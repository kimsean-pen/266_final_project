Like a hand you reached out to me
The thunder rolls in with the dawn
Tiny fingers on the edges
Watch it unravel pulling everything apart

In the night we sleep together
The walls are shaking in their skin
Does it become you troublemaker
Watch them unravel you
Pulling everything apart

Some day out of the blue it will find you
Always
Always a place to remind me
Someone like you
Someone like you
Someone like you

You watch the shape these things are taking
Till you cry out in your sleep
Does it become you when you're under
Your heart is racing you're taking everything to heart

When you walk away
Will you show me how
Come pull me under

Some day out of the blue it will find you
Always
Always a place to remind me
Someone like you
Someone like you
Someone like you

Someday out of the blue it will find you
Always
Always a place to remind you
