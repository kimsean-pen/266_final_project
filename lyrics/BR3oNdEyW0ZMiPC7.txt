Direct, directly from my heart to you
Direct, directly from my heart to you
Oh, you know that I love you
That's why I feel so blue

Oh, I think I will love the man always
I think that I will love the man always
Yeah, we'd be so happy together
But you're so far away

Oh, I need, I need you by my side
Well, I need, yes, I need you by my side
Oh, I love you, little darlin'
Your love I could never hide
