Love was just a passing phase
A fever that ran away
'till they could find us where we lay
Blood, they smell it from miles way
Try to look passed and see
And just get used to the taste

But don't leave me here
Don't leave me here

And don't walk away
And let me die
Oh, in this house of wolves
And pray for my soul
Now that I go
Into this house of wolves

Don't believe what you read
Or sometimes what you see
Like most of it is true, too true
And I'm too happy this way
And scalpels bring back this face
Tell the judge that I'm innocent
Tell the jury I'm no one at all

But don't leave me here
Don't leave me here

Don't walk away
And let me die
Oh, in this house of wolves
And pray for my soul
Now that I go
Into this house of wolves

Hey
Do you want it?

Ah, the bleeding
Don't stop the bleeding in your heart
The bleeding, don't stop that bleeding in your
Ah, the bleeding
Don't stop the bleeding in your heart
The bleeding, don't stop

But don't leave me here
Don't leave me here

Don't walk away
Let me die
Oh, in this house of wolves
And pray for my soul
Now that I go
Into this house of wolves

Don't walk away
And let me die
Oh, in this house of wolves
And pray for my soul
Now that I go
Into this house of wolves

You cannot stop the bleeding, baby
You cannot stop the bleeding, baby
She won't stop the bleeding, baby
She won't stop

Don't walk away
And let me die
Oh, in this house of wolves
And pray
