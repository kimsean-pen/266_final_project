I'm a heavyweight
I'm a left turn
I'm a the top floor
Of a bad burn

Tell you "My lips don't meet,"
Heavy breath
Sharp teeth

At the park in the streetlight
Coming undone
Taking a hit in a fistfight
Coming undone
In a cab on a weeknight
Coming undone
I'm coming undone
I'm coming on

I don't wanna hurt nobody
I don't wanna hurt nobody

I'm broke
So strange
Cause you bathe
In loose change
When my face hits yours
The crowd applauds

At the park in the streetlight
Coming undone
Taking a hit in a fistfight
Coming undone
In a cab on a weeknight
Coming undone
I'm coming undone
I'm coming on

I don't wanna hurt nobody
I don't wanna hurt nobody, no
I don't wanna hurt nobody
I don't wanna hurt nobody, no

I woke
Heart thumping
Cause I wanted to be something
And when I followed reason
Then it turned out to be nothing
I woke
Heart thumping
Cause I wanna be something
And when I followed reason
It turned out to be nothing

At the park in the streetlight
Coming undone
Taking a hit in a fistfight
Coming undone
In a cab on a weeknight
Coming undone
I'm coming undone
I'm coming on

I don't wanna hurt nobody
I don't wanna hurt nobody, no
I don't wanna hurt nobody
I don't wanna hurt nobody, no

Here it is:
Deep End
Goodbye
My friend
I don't wanna hurt nobody
I don't wanna hurt nobody
