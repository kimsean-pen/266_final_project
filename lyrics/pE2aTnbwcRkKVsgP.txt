I'm shaking and I don't wanna be that way
I'm fading and I don't wanna be that way
And I'm not changing all I know
I need a place to go
I wanna be around
But I, I bring you down
I wanna be around
But I, I bring you down
I'm holding back but I don't wanna be like that
The days we had, I don't wanna be like that
And I'm not trying all alone
I need a place to go
I wanna be around
But I, I bring you down
I wanna be around
But I, I bring you down
You're asking for too much
You're already here
You're asking for too much
You're already here
I wanna be around
But I, I bring you down (Down)
I wanna be around
But I, I bring you down (Down).
