Staring at the ceiling sorting out my thoughts
Weighing every word I want to say
Darkness fills the room, it's closing in on us
The words all come out wrong again, I let you down

If I could just trust more I'd dare to speak the truth
Wish I could give one hundred percent
It's sad and unfair, you too are suffering
When I'm the guilty you are the innocent

For way too long
I've been merely a shadow of my true self
I'm in despair
I'm beyond repair

A shadow hanging over me it clouds my mind
Preventing any sane thoughts to occur
A silhouette is cast on your side of the bed
Reminding me of what I have become

For way too long
I've been merely a shadow of my true self
I'm in despair
I'm beyond repair
