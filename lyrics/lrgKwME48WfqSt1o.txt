In the interest of keeping sane
Keeping off the leeches of fame
Kill the crows that point the blame
Our voices are fast changed

I never said I would take your side
I just said I would compromise
If you make me put up a fight
We'll fight back till the day I die

I'll fight back
I'll fight back

All the things that could go wrong
All the things that you wanted all along
And I don't really mind if what I say
Pisses you off

I never said I would take your side
I just said I would compromise
If you make me put up a fight
We'll fight back till the day I die

I'll-
I'll fight-
