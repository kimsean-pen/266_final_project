Welcome to a trip
Into my hurt feelings
To the centre of my soul
You better bring a light
To find the house of meanings
In the labyrinth of yes or no

For you, life is just like chess
If you don't make a move
You'll lose the game like this

'Cause you, you're walking on the edge
You, you chose the way of love and pain
You, don't you see the bridge
I've built for you, it's just one step to start again

Welcome to a trip
Into my emotions
To the language of my heart
You're sailing on a river
That becomes an ocean
Which you can only cross with love

For you, life is just like chess
If you don't make a move
You'll lose the game like this

'Cause you, you're walking on the edge
You, you chose the way of love and pain
You, don't you see the bridge
I've built for you, it's just one step to start again

For you, life is just like chess
If you don't make a move
You'll lose the game like this

'Cause you, you're walking on the edge
You, you chose the way of love and pain
You, don't you see the bridge
I've built for you, it's just one step to start again

Walking on the edge
Baby, you're walking on the edge

You, you're walking on the edge
You, you chose the way of love and pain
You, don't you see the bridge
I've built for you, it's just one step to start again

You, you're walking on the edge
On the edge
You, you chose the way of love and pain
You, don't you see the bridge
I've built for you, it's just one step to start again
You, you're walking on the edge
On the edge
You, you chose the way of love and pain
You, don't you see the bridge
I've built for you, it's just one step to start again
On the edge
On the edge
