I have been waiting, all of my life
For you to come along, and make everything alright
My body's shaking, right through my bones
So take me by the hand, please don't leave me here alone

And I wonder if you know just how I feel
I feel, yeah...
And I wonder how I know if this is real
Is real...

'Cause I want you to save me,
Just please save me,
Save me
'Cause I need you to save me,
Just please save me,
Save me
