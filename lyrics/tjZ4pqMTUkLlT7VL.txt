I got all the time in the world
Don't you want some of that?

I got all the time in the world
Don't you want some of that?
Don't you want some of that?
I would
I would

I have all the time in the world
You want it none of that
I have all the time in the world
You want it none of that
You want it none of that
I would
I would

With my world in front of my girl
There's something wrong with her
With my world in front of my girl
There's something wrong with her
Something really, really wrong with her

All is to be true
