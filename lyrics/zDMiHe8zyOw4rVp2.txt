Well I was born, the year that disco died
And U2 was in high school, thank the lord that they survived
Got my first taste, on a Seger '45
And since that kiss, I rocked all day, and partied every night

We still argue about who's better, Elton John or Billy Joel
We still wonder if Kurt really wrote the song she sang in Hole
No one ever stop believing, this the journey of our lives
So won't you help me pour some sugar on these memories tonight

Sing it, long live rock, long live roll
Long live big guitars and music for the soul
Sing it, don't give up, don't grow old
Long live crazy nights and records made of gold
Long live rock and roll

Summer of '96, I got my first guitar
I played it 'till fingers said, "you're gonna be a star"
Grunge was everything, at least, it was to me
A Marshall in my Chevy Sprint, just runnin' down a dream

We still argue about who's better, Mötley Crüe or G N' R
We still can't believe Van Halen, turned into Van Hagar
Now the record shops are gone for good and no one seems to care
But me and you, and all our friends, keep living on that prayer

Sing it, long live rock, long live roll
Long live big guitars and music for the soul
Sing it, don't give up, don't grow old
Long live crazy nights and records made of gold
Long live rock and roll

Oh oh ooohhh oh oohh
Oh oh ooohhh oh oohh
Oh oh ooohhh oh oohh
Oh oh ooohhh oh oohh

Went to bed in Cleveland
Woke up in Tennessee
No matter where I'll roam tonight
I'm chasing history

We still argue about who's better, The Beatles or The Stones
They're forever 27, Jimmy, Janis, Brian Jones
And we're stand here in their memory, 'cause their songs, they still survive
So throw your lighters up and darling sing with me tonight

Come on, long live rock, long live roll
Long live big guitars and music for the soul
Sing it, don't give up, don't grow old
Long live crazy nights and records made of gold
Long live rock and roll

Long live rock, long live roll
Long live big guitars and music for the soul
Sing it, don't give up, don't grow old
Long live crazy nights and records made of gold

Long live rock and roll
