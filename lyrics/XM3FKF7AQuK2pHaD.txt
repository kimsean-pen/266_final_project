The fire in his belly is taking over
He never watches the telly dressed or sober
He really likes a tiff, give him a lift
And he won't round now
He gets me to the point its nearly over
But somehow

Somehow I'd like to get to know him
Somebody told me that I shouldn't claim him
Somebody told me that I should let him go
Baby somehow

I really hate to say this
I can't wait 'til he gets older
Then I can assure you we'll be fine
I won't bow out
I know nobody's perfect
With love you gotta earn it
But until then I guess we'll have to scream and shout

Somehow, I'd like to get to know him
Somebody told me that I shouldn't claim him
Somebody said I should let him go
But they really don't know
That sometimes I really wanna kill him
I'd die if I wasn't with him
Somebody said I should let him go, oh

Looking out on Casanova
Well we got people coming over
I couldn't care less about the mess
Just pipe it down
By now you should know it
that I'm a girl who don't give a dis
there comes a point even for me
I got my pride
