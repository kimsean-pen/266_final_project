I do me wrong

And I do it again
My sorrow rain
My feeling pain
See me through, walk me through
I long

I still long
I long
I long so much away - from me - for me
I long
I still long
Take my lips

Kiss me sweet
Take my feelings
Stop me from sweating fear
My sweet nightmare ends
I long

I still long
I long
I long so much away - from me - for me
My sweet nightmare ends
I long
I still long
I long
I long so much away - from me - for me
My sweet nightmare ends
