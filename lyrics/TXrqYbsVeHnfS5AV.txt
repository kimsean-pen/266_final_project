You may not have all you want or you need
all that you have has been due to my hand,
it can change, it can stay the same,
who can say, who can make their claim

The situation we are in at this time
neither a good one, nor is it so unblest
it can change, it can stay the same,
I can say, I can make my claim.
Hail ... Hail ... Hail

Unity's strength and all must be as one,
confidence in you hope will reflect in me
I think everyone not as my nation for
you are my people and there must be no change
It can change, it can stay the same
I can say, I can make my claim

Hail ... Hail ... Hail
Hail to Power and to Glory's way
Hail to Power and to Glory's way
Hail to Power and to Glory's way
Hail to Power and to Glory's way
Day by day.

You may not have all you want or you need
all that you have has been due to my hand,
it can change, it can stay the same,
who can say, who can make their claim

Unity's strength and all must be as one,
confidence in you hope will reflect in me
I think everyone not as my nation for
you are my people and there must be no change
It can change, it can stay the same
I can say, I can make my claim

Hail ... Hail ... Hail
Hail to Power and to Glory's way
Hail to Power and to Glory's way
Hail to Power and to Glory's way
Hail to Power and to Glory's way
Day by day
