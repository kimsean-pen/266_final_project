Most of me sunk into the carpet
What was was left of you asked me to leave
I was a broken thought tank
I was a napkin in the rain
I was a napkin in the rain
Oh.
This is how it often goes
Sold into captivity so long ago...
This is how it often goes
God knows I would know
God knows I would know
I don't want your kind words
I want your ghost inside a thimble
I woke up feeling mutilated
and I made my way as best as I could to my place
I made my way as best as I could to my place
This is how it often goes
Sold into captivity so long ago
This is how it often goes
God knows I would know
God knows I would know
You love me mostly when I'm leaving
You love me mostly
You love me mostly when I'm leaving
I was half gone when you met me
I cut out my tongue
Seeing yours would speak for the both of us
