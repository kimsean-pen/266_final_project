I can still remember
Every song you played
Long ago when we were younger
And we rocked the night away

How could I see a future then
Or you would not grow old
With such a fire in our belly
Such a hunger in our souls

I guess I probably loved you
When those words rolled off your tongue
Seemed that we were traveling
Under some old lucky sun

I know I couldn't save you
And no one was to blame
But the road we shared together once
Will never be the same

Hey, gone a long way
Won't be coming 'round again
Hey, with a song I pray
And on wings of a song I'll fly away

I wandered in the wilderness
For a while, I was so lost
To everything there is a season
And every blessing has its cost

So I took what you left me
Put it to some use
When looking for an answer
With those three chords and the truth

I come down from the mountain
I come walking in your shoes
I was taken for a gambler
When I had no more to lose

For you put me on that pathway
How could I refuse
And I've spend my whole life out here
Working on the blues

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

So I've carried on
You can't be haunted by the past
People come, people go
And nothing ever lasts

But I still think about you
Wonder where you are
Can you see me from some place
Up there among the stars?

But down here under heaven
There never was a chart
To guide our way across
This crooked highway of the heart

And if it's only all about
The journey in the end
On that road I'm glad
I came to know you, my old friend

Hey, gone a long way
Won't be coming 'round again
Hey, with a song I pray
And on wings of a song I'll fly away

I'll fly away
I'll fly away
I'll fly away
Oh, oh
