My heart's a broken place
Seeking a state of grace
Where love survives
Wild in an urban world
Come steal my night
Make heaven mine

Say when we catch the light
We're gonna flame so high
Only way to burn
We're passing wonder why
To the other side
Where ever hides

A firefly you glow
Where I can only go

For every storm that breaks
Every sky that wakes
I'll be at your side
For ever and a day
Take you in every way
Feel a love divine

We hold the hand of time
Just you and I
Feel a love divine
Coz when we burn
We flame
A carnival of light
Reaching for the sky

A firefly you glow
Where I can only go

For every storm that breaks
Every sky that wakes
I'll be at your side
For ever and a day
Take you in every way
Feel a love divine

So to the end we blaze
And every cloud we chase
You're my alibi
Above the darkest sky
We found a way to fly
A love divine
A love divine

Every storm that breaks
Every sky that wakes
I'll be at your side
For ever and a day
Take you in every way
A love divine

So to the end we blaze
And every cloud we chase
You're my alibi
Above the darkest sky
We found a way to fly
A love divine
I feel a love divine

Yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Ooohhh
Yeah yeah
Oooohhhh
Yeah yeah

Love divine
