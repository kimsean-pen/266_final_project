Some days, I start off draggin' my feet
Some days, I want to fly
Some days, it all makes sense to me
Some days, I just don't want to know why

Hey, hey I'm not givin' up, no
Gonna stand up and shout it, oh
No way, I'm not slackin' off or backin' out or
Crackin' up with doubt
I'm workin it out

Sometimes, I'm just surrounded by friends
Sometimes, we've never met
Sometimes, I pray for somethin' I need
But hey, you never know what you're gonna get
And

Hey, hey, I'm not givin' up, no
Gonna stands up and shout it
Oh no way, I'm not slackin' off or backin' out or
Crackin' up with doubt
I'm workin' it out

It's hard enough to be what you are
Harder to what you're not
Hard to know what you need to get
Harder to know what you've got

Hey, hey, I'm not givin' up, no
Gonna stand up and shout it, oh
No way, I'm not slackin' off or backin' out or
Crackin' up with doubt
I'm workin' it out

Hey, hey, I'm not givin' up, no
Gonna stand up and shout it, oh
No way, I'm not slackin' off or backin' out or
Crackin' up with doubt
I'm workin' it out
I'm workin' it out, now
I'm workin' it out
