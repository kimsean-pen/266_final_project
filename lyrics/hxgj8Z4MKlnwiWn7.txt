They're playing led stains in some old cafe
In this room, in this room, in this room
And the night's but a cheap cabaret
To the moon, oh the moon, oh the moon
There's fools holding hands in the park and in the underground
Things go unsaid in the dark and resonate around

First you wanna run and hide
Then you wanna play the game
Love is like a suicide
Hearts are like two passing trains
But I'm hopeful and willing
Rightful to killing
Honest to god, listen true
I could be a grave mistake
If you'd let me through

There's a half empty glass in the sink
I'm alright, she's alright, we're alright
It's a scene like a robbery
Pay no mind, pay no mind, pay no mind
Is it hard to relate anymore? We're always changing shape
Everyones out making war or love or taking aim

First you wanna run and hide
Then you wanna play the game
Love is like a suicide
Hearts are like two passing trains
But I'm hopeful and willing
Rightful to killing
Honest to god, listen true
I could be a grave mistake
If you'd let me through

First you wanna run and hide
Then you wanna play the game
Love is like a suicide
Hearts are like two passing trains
But I'm hopeful and willing
Rightful to killing
Honest to god, listen true
I could be a grave mistake
If you'd let me through
