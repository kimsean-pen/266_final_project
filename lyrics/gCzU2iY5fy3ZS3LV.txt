You're a shaman and a conman
And a diva and a diamond paid in blood
You're a liar, but they buyin' it
I need two more suppliers for my drugs
(I'm going crazy)

Feels like the world's made of letters
So why do I feel so constrained by my words?
Like saying things are gonna get better
That's the fakest shit that I ever heard

If it's something you gotta pay for
Then heaven wasn't made for me
If I gotta be saved for it
Then heaven wasn't made for me

If there's people you've got a hate for
Lovin' what they made for, lovin' who they came for
Where crooked saints get the big reward
No, heaven wasn't made for me

No, heaven wasn't made for me
Okay, bye

All these shitty people made it past the gates
So you can keep your faith
I dreamt to die to spend my time in heaven
Missin' all of my mistakes

Feels like the world's made of letters
So why do I feel so constrained by my words?
Like saying things are gonna get better
That's the fakest shit that i ever heard

If it's something you gotta pay for
Then heaven wasn't made for me
If I gotta be saved for it
Then heaven wasn't made for me

If there's people you've got hate for
Lovin' what they made for, lovin' who they came for
Where crooked saints get the big reward
No, heaven wasn't made for me

No, heaven wasn't made for me
No, heaven wasn't made for me
No, heaven wasn't made for me
No, heaven wasn't made for me
(Now, a Godly woman)
No, heaven wasn't made for me
(Now, a Godly woman is a very sympathetic)
No, heaven wasn't made for me

A woman should learn in quietness and full submission
