Call me crazy, I won't mind
Call me whatever! I will smile

If dreamers look like me
Then You now know
I am one! I am Dreamer

I do all this nice crazy things
I do whatever, I do still smile

And I won't mind

Dreamers live in a crazy wonderful world
Dreamers take a chance!
Smile like you do!

And here I go

I am dreamer and let me
Let me shout it to the world

I won't mind! If I go down
I won't mind!

I am looking around
wishing for you
Thinking about you!
