Over
It just begun
Pull from her
Pull to me
It's everything she wanted
It's happening with ease
Modern Rembrandt line
A peach and black painted charisma

You're so alive
Like a dream I'd catch if I stayed asleep
Magothy days slipped away
I caught a stranger's eye
And what a way
You won me over
And what a way
And what a way
And what a way
And what a way
You won me over
And what a way
And what a way
And what a way
And what a way
You won me over

Keep praising the light
Keep sleeping by numbers
It's everything she wanted
It's all famine or feast now
Making do with bitter sundown

A body that stayed in disarray
Sneaking out of view
I think deep down she always knew
I'd fully give in
She got blood from a stone with grace
Making up for lost living
Wearing that wound
Looks good on you
No better view
I love the new painted charisma
Magothy days slipped away
I caught a stranger's eye
And what a way
You won me over
And what a way
And what a way
And what a way
And what a way
You won me over
And what a way
And what a way
And what a way
And what a way
You won me over
