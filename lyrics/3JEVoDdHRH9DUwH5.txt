Give me time to reason, give me time to think it through
Passing through the season where I cheated you
I will always have a cross to wear
But the bolt reminds me I was there
So give me strength to face this test of mine

If only I could turn back time
If only I had said what I still hide
If only I could turn back time
I would stay for the night, for the night

Claim your right to science, claim your right to see the truth
Though my pangs of conscience will drill a hole in you
I've seen it coming like a thief in the night
I've seen it coming from the flash of your light
So give me strength to face this test of mine

If only I could turn back time
If only I had said what I still hide
If only I could turn back time
I would stay

The bolt reminds me I was there
The bolt reminds me I was there

If only I could turn back time
If only I had said what I still hide
If only I could turn back time
I would stay for the night

If only I could turn back time
If only I had said what I still hide
If only I could turn back time
I would stay for the night

If only I could
(If only I could)
If only I could
(If only I could)

If only I could turn back time
I would stay for the night

If only I could
(If only I could, if only I could)
If only I could
(If only I could, if only I could)
If only I could turn back time
I would stay for the night
If only I could
(If only I could, if only I could)
If only I could
(If only I could, if only I could)
If only I could turn back time
