Will you take back, you take back, what you said?
I gave all, I gave in for your best
He fumbles and trembles over land
The power love had over that dying man
He wishes and desires that his depth
Will be paid, made good and redressed
To freely forgive those who did wrong
To pardon God for everything i've done.
OH NO...
