Oh baby let's get down tonight
Every time we do it just feels so right
Lets go sit underneath that willow tree
Oh baby just you and me

Even though I can't see you all the time
I got to let you know you're on my mind
Even though I can't see you all the time
I got to let you know you're on my mind

Girl you're on my mind, on my mind again
On my mind, on my mind again
You're on my mind, on my mind again
But I got to let you know that ill never let you go

You take those clouds and make a sunny day
I love to watch you do it just your own way
You take my day into night
You still give me all that loving light, loving light, yeah

Even though I can't see you all the time
I got to let you know you're on my mind
Even though I can't see you all the time
I got to let you know you're on my mind

Girl you're on my mind, on my mind again
Woman don't you know
You're on my mind, you're on my mind again
Oh I got to let you know
You're on my mind, you're on my mind again
Because you're on my mind, on my mind again
