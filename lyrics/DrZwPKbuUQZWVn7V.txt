Whatever happened to your beautiful misery?
I miss the way that you murder me
Still feel your knife stuck in my back
Yeah, let it bleed
I never wanted anymore than just your kiss
I can't pretend that I don't miss
The way you chew me up
And spit me out, yeah, woah!

She said, "Don't let the door hit you in the ass"
You say that you're fed up, 'cause it's a set up

Just kill me softly 'cause I'm empty
Please don't take it easy
Do your worst and murder me, yeah
Kill me softly 'cause I'm empty
Please don't take it easy
Do your worst and murder me, yeah

Whatever happened to your wonderful agony?
I miss the way that you poison me
Still feel your claws stuck in my back
Yeah, let it bleed
I never thought that I would live to die like this
I think that ignorance is bliss
The way you grab my heart
And rip it out, yeah, woah!

She said, "Don't let the door hit you in the ass"
You say that you're fed up, 'cause it's a set up

Just kill me softly 'cause I'm empty
Please don't take it easy
Do your worst and murder me, yeah
Kill me softly 'cause I'm empty
Please don't take it easy
Do your worst and murder me, yeah

(Na na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na na!)

Kill me softly 'cause I'm empty
Please don't take it easy
Do your worst and murder me, yeah
Kill me softly 'cause I'm empty
Please don't take it easy
Do your worst and murder me, yeah

Just kill me softly 'cause I'm empty
Please don't take it easy
Do your worst and murder me, yeah
Kill me softly 'cause I'm empty
Please don't take it easy
Do your worst and murder me, yeah
