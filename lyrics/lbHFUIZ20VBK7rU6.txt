All along it was me who changed
Morning now waits for me
All along it was me
Morning now waits
Morning now waits for me

What I have to gain does not matter
If what I give is all to You
If what I give is all to You

I have seen the stars fall
And the sun rise again
But You are yet to change

You are all that is
You are all that is worth
You are all that is worth living for

What I have to gain does not matter
If what I give is all to You
If what I give is all to You

You are all that is worth
That is worth living for
You are all that is worth
That is worth living for
You are all that is worth
That is worth living for
You are all that is worth
That is worth living for
You are all that is worth...
