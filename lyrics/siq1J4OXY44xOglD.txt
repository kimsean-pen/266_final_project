I'm tired
Tired of always losing
I tried to stop your fire
Turns out that I couldn't
I'm tired
Tired of competing
I tried to hold you under
But, honey, you kept breathing

When you said you wanted the world
I said you couldn't too
You were walking right beside me
But I left no room for you
Calling you my enemy but my enemy's right here
It was my mistake to try and break
That power that I feared

I see flames in your eyes
Damn, they burn so bright
Oh, you gotta know I'm with ya
Now shine like city lights
Torches in the sky
Don't you try to hide it
Sister

I'm sorry
Sorry for the drama
I tried to steal your thunder
Turns out that I don't wanna

When you said you wanted the world
I said you couldn't too
You were walking right beside me
But I left no room for you
Calling you my enemy but my enemy's right here
It was my mistake to try and break
Your power that I feared

I see flames in your eyes
Damn, they burn so bright
Don't you try to hide it
Sister, sister, sister
Don't you try to hide it
Sister, sister, sister
Don't you try to hide it
I see flames in your eyes
Damn, they burn so bright
Oh, you gotta know I'm with ya
Now shine like city lights
Torches in the sky
Don't you try to hide it
Don't you try to hide it
Sister
