You shock my body deeper than I've ever known
It's more than physical, I swear it's something spiritual
I wasn't living, you were my missing part
I had a half a heart

Feel like a diamond, you treat me like a queen
Your perfect timing, I can barely keep the beat
You got me climbing, one-two-three
Now I'm in heaven, now I'm in heaven
NA NA NA NA!

I didn't know my blood was running slow
You got my pulse so out of control
You keep me racing on that "ready-set-go"
Now I'm in heaven, now I'm in heaven

You shock my body deeper than I've ever known
It's more than physical, I swear it's something spiritual
I wasn't living, you were my missing part
I had a half a heart, I had a half a heart,

I had a, I had a, I had a half a heart,
I had a, I had a, I had a half a heart,
I had a, I had a, I had a half a heart,
I had a half a heart,
You gave me half a heart

Before I met you thought I was so alive
It's so much better now I'm slipping overdrive
Accelerated feel like I could fly
Now I'm in heaven, now I'm in heaven!

You shock my body deeper than I've ever known
It's more than physical, I swear it's something spiritual
I wasn't living, you were my missing part
I had a half a heart, I had a half a heart

You shock my body deeper than I've ever known
It's more than physical, I swear it's something spiritual
I wasn't living, you were my missing part
I had a half a heart, I had a half a heart

I had a, I had a, I had a half a heart
I had a, I had a, I had a half a heart
I had a, I had a, I had a half a heart
I had a half a heart
You gave me half a heart

I had a, I had a, I had a half a heart
I had a, I had a, I had a half a heart
I had a, I had a, I had a half a heart
I had a half a heart
You gave me half a heart

You gave me half a heart

You gave me half a heart

You gave me half a heart, half a heart

You gave me half a heart
