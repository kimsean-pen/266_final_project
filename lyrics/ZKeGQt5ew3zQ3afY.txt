I wake up
And the day feels
Broken
I tilt my head
I'm trying
To get an angle

'Cause the evenin'
I've always longed for
It could still happen
How do I master
The perfect day?
Six glasses of water
Seven phone calls

If you leave it alone
It might just happen
Anyway

It's not up to you
(Oh, it never really was)
It's not up to you
(Oh, it never really was)
It's not up to you
(Well, it never really was)
It's not up to you

If you wake up
And the day feels
Ah broken
Just lean into the crack
(Just lean into the crack)
And it will tremble
Ever so nicely

Notice
How it sparkles
Down there
I can decide
What I give
But it's not up to me
What I get given

Unthinkable surprises
About to happen
But what they are

It's not up to you
(Well, it never really was)
It's not up to you
(Oh, it never really was)
It's not up to you
(Oh, it never really was)
It's not up to you
(Oh, me share)

It's not up to you
It's not up to you
(Oh, it never really was)
It's not up to you
(Well, it never really was)
It's not up to you
It's not up to you
It's not up to you
It's not up to you

There's too much
Clinging
To peak
There's too much
Pressure
