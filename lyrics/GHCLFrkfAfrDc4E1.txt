One deceiver
Among millions of others
One look
And you lover forever
One word
And you're the one to blame
Tell me
Who could live with this shame?

Something seems to be dead here
Undergo deconstruction
The symmetry of fear
Strange lack of seduction
My sister remember

Sister...
Sister...
Sister...

Sister September

An inner war is to come
Still he doesn't want to succumb
An ineffable loss of trust
One story
Turning into diamond dust

Something seems to be dead here
Undergo deconstruction
The symmetry of fear
Strange lack of seduction
My sister remember

It's obviously beyond his power
All certainties move towards their end
One question
And so many answers
Where's the crown he once transcend?

Sister September
Where are the dream's you've stuck in me?
Sister remember
I shall never, never forget the name of your devotee

A moment of beauty
Still it remains only a memory
A stunning artifact of the past
The one, the true, the last

Do I have to die under this autumnal sun?
Did I have to trust you?
Truly and madly and blindly
And what did I get in return?

Sister...
Sister...
Sister...
Sister September

Shall never forget the name of your devotee
Where are the dreams you have stuck in me?
An eternity of torture to me
Such a lot of pain
