How can I sit and eat my tea
With all that blood flowing from the television
At a quarter to six, I watch the news
Eating, eating all my food as I sit watching the red spot
In the egg which looks like all the blood you don't see on the television

Still body now, no movement yet
Five men lie die flat on their backs
Were they born to lie in state
Defend the ever stagnate great?

Down on the street assassinate
All of them look so desperate
Declared blood war on the bourgeois state

Watch new blood on the eighteen inch screen
The corpse is a new personality
Ionic charge gives immortality
The corpse is a new personality

Down on the street assassinate
All of them look so desperate
Declared blood war on the bourgeois state

Watch new blood on the eighteen inch screen
The corpse is a new personality
Watch new blood on the eighteen inch screen
The corpse is a new personality
Watch new blood on the eighteen inch screen
The corpse is a new personality

Watch new blood on the eighteen inch screen
The corpse is a new personality
Watch new blood on the eighteen inch screen
The corpse is a new personality

Guerrilla war struggle is a new entertainment
Guerrilla war struggle is a new entertainment
Guerrilla war struggle is a new entertainment
Guerrilla war struggle is a new entertainment

Guerrilla war struggle is a new entertainment
Guerrilla war struggle is a new entertainment
Guerrilla war struggle is a new entertainment
Guerrilla war struggle is a new entertainment

Down on the street assassinate
All of them look so desperate
Declared blood war on the bourgeois state
