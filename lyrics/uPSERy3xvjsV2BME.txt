Crazy
Oh, oh

Baby, I'm so into you
You got that somethin', what can I do?
Baby, you spin me around
The earth is movin', but I can't feel the ground

Every time you look at me
My heart is jumpin', it's easy to see

You Drive Me Crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Whoa, Crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night

Tell me, you're so into me
That I'm the only one you will see
Tell me, I'm not in the blue, oh
That I'm not wastin' my feelings on you

Every time I look at you, my heart is jumpin'
What can I do?

You Drive Me Crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Whoa, Crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night

You Drive Me Crazy
Sing it!
Oh, Crazy
Yeah!
Oh yeah
Stop!
Ooh, oh yeah

You Drive Me Crazy, baby
Excited, I'm in too deep
Whoa, oh, but it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night

You drive me Crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Whoa, Crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night

Sing it!
Crazy, oh, oh
Crazy, ooh, oh yeah
You drive me Crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
