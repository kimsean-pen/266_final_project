You got the touch, you got the magic
Making me blush, you keep me coming back for more
Gave you too much, I'll let you have it
It's gonna suck, this is a thing I can't ignore

You almost take me
But you never take me all the way
All the way (no, no, no)
And now I'd hate to break your heart
But I don't wanna waste
Anymore time on you

I could like you 'til the day that I die
But I'm looking for the love of my life
I could like you 'til the day that I die
But I'm looking for the love of my life

Baby don't beg or buy me flowers
You cannot stay 'cause it would only make it worse
Some other chick that's on your lips for hours
Sure it could wait, but I don't wanna see you hurt

You almost took me
But you never took me all the way
All the way (no, no, no)
And now I'd hate to break your heart
But I don't wanna waste
Anymore time on you

I could like you 'til the day that I die
But I'm looking for the love of my life
I could like you 'til the day that I die
But I'm looking for the love of my life

I really like you, but you're not that right for me
I rather wait all my life to find the one
I really like you, but it's just not meant to be
Oh, I'm so sorry, I am, oh yeah

I could like you 'til the day that I die
But I'm looking for the love of my life
I could like you 'til the day that I die
But I'm looking for the love of my life
