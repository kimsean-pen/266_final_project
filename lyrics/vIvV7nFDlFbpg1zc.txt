Sun rays come down
As seen when they hit the ground
Children spinning around
Till they fall down, down, down

I wait for you
It's been two hours now
You're still somewhere in town
Your dinner's getting cold

I rest my case
You are always this late
And you know how much I hate
Waiting a 'round, 'round, 'round

Bitter heart, bitter heart
Tries to keep it all inside
Bitter heart, bitter heart
Shadows will help you try to hide
Bitter heart, my bitter heart
Is getting just a little fragile
Bitter heart, bitter heart of mine

And then you come
And tell me the same reasons
As you did yesterday
So tell me what's her name

Bitter heart, bitter heart
Tries to keep it all inside
Bitter heart, bitter heart
Shadows will help you try to hide
Bitter heart, my bitter heart
Is getting just a little fragile
Bitter heart, bitter heart
Of mine
Of mine
Of mine
Of mine
