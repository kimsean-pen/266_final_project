Let's go

Never let him destruct you, worth to start the fight
You're shiftin 'cause your brother shin, you step through the night

I know you, I know you
Know that there's a thunder deep inside of you
It makes you think it's all a dream, it cannot be true
We'll inhale, we'll inhale

Just follow me and go
Just follow me and go

It's not known what we'll do, they can break your heart
Without love, without my desire
I see a thing that is not real but I'm still alive

I know you, I know you
And when the power comes from deep within
I never ran a story that gon never begin
We'll inhale, we'll inhale

Just follow me and go
Just follow me and go

This time know when we'll do
They can break your heart again

That's enough
