In the darkest corners of the mind
There is a mirror to reflect lost time
But if you look into the depths of your soul
You may just discover a light that is whole
And to feast on such a ravenous force
Is to become one with your primal self
But if the colors of one don't ring true
The veracity of your passion is see-through

A view from the bottom of a pit of despair
The feeling of loss and the absence of hope
Breathing life into such radiant light
Devour it all in the darkness of night
Sustaining the hunger of the luminous blaze
Never again will we live in grey haze
