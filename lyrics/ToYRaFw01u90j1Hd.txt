I saw the news this morning
And saw your face across the screen
And as I poured my coffee
I picked up a magazine
But as I turned the page
And looked inside
There you were again (there you were)
Oh these lonely times
They never seem to end
You're too far
I know I should be there where you are
Today I did some shopping
Just had to clear my mind again
I can't stop thinkin' bout you
I hopped into a taxi
In a moment I was home
Home again

But as I turned the key
And slept inside
My heart could not pretend (could not pretend)
All those feelings
Not those feelings
Not again
You're too far
I know I should be there where you are

Tossing and turning in my sleep
I can't take being without you
I'm gonna catch the next plane out
I got to get to where you are
No matter how near or far
I got to get there where you are
I know

But as I turned the key
And slept inside
My heart could not pretend (could not pretend)
Oh these lonely times
They never seem to end
You're too far
I know I should be there where you are
I wanna be where you are
I need to be where you are
I wanna be I wanna be baby
You know I need to be
I know I should be there where you are
