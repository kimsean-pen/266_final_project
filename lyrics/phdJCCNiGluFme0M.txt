It amazes me to find out what you do and do not know,
but it surprises me that you're not the same person
you claim
that you are when we're left alone.
It amuses me, the fact that
we sleep in separate beds.
We know we'd rather be wasting our lives doing
anything (everything) else instead.
You know that it's hard to be grateful
when you're not feeling great in the first place,
and you know that I'm nothing special in that department.
