When I saw you the other day
And then I saw you later
Well, I just couldn't help but say
Ooh, what I want to say to you
But I'm so very, very lucky
Uh-huh
But I'm so very lucky, baby

Some people want lots of people
Some people don't want nothing
Me, I don't want lots of people
Ne, I don't want nothing
'Cause I'm so very, very lucky
That's why I'm lucky now
'Cause I'm so very lucky, baby
'Cause when I'm with you I don't have to dream
'Cause when I'm with you I don't have to tell no lies
'Cause when I'm with you I don't have to wish
Oh, baby, baby it's like the sun is setting in your eyes
Oh, baby, baby I can see the sun is setting in your eyes

I know the reason why I'm lucky
I know the reason why I'm lucky
I know the reason why I'm lucky
I know the reason why I'm lucky
