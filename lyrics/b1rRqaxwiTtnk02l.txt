They shut down The Golden Sahara Hotel
Jessica says it won't be long till they blow it all to hell
She's standing in the front yard cut off some skin
Me and her brother we've been friends, since I can't remember when

Ain't that the way it's always been?
Everybody sitting around waiting for the sun to come again
A shift at the chemical plant, a white wedding dress
I wake up every morning and I wonder if I'm gonna pass the test

Just trying to live up to what she's got in mind
Sometimes the pressure's so heavy I feel like leaving it all behind

Ain't that the way that it's always been?
Laying low just long enough for the dust to settle down
The black and the white, the thick and the thin
And hoping that He's really got the power to save us from these sins
Everybody sitting around waiting for the sun to come again

I took a long walk yesterday
To a field where I used to play
I saw myself in the corner of my mind
I was twelve years old and blind
To the big wheel and the grind

Ain't that the way that it's always been?
Standing at the water's edge waiting for the fog to clear
Tackle or touch, you sink or you swim
And hoping that he's really got the power to save us from these sins
Everybody sitting around waiting for the sun to come again
They're waiting for the sun to come again
