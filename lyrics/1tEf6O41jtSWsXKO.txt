You say you're dead and gone and you're moving on
Beyond the regular rectangular
Forced in burgeoning come closing in
But still a serious experience
You stay out all night
It was a weapon you could use
To get through all the threads in sight
How you gonna wave hello or goodbye when your hands are tied?
How you gonna wave hello or goodbye when your hands are tied?
How you gonna wave when your hands are tied
To the end of the threads inside
