she's the only one that i'll ever love as much as i do now
as much as i do now
and she's been keeping me guessing in misery
i hope she doesn't leave, i hope she doesn't leave
and when we're getting up, i'll have her hand to hold
her fingers laced in mine, she'll be here, by my side
and though we'll be apart, i'll keep her nearer heart
and all the memories will keep on telling me,
"did ya love her the best that you could?
and would you change it, was the ending so good?
and would there ever be another that makes you cave?"
we haven't spoke in months
and i can't think of us without forsaking it
and i start faking it
i get the 'life moves on', but what if i stay here?
and i get left behind for just another year
well, i was happiest when i had you to kiss
and when we'd start to sing, i'd give most anything
to have you by my side, your fingers laced in mine
but all the memories will keep on telling me,
"did ya love her the best that you could?
would you change it, was the ending so good?
will there ever be another that makes you cave?"
