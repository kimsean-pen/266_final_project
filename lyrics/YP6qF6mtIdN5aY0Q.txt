I can't decide which one of us will leave here alive
Your fingers breaking as I place them over mine
The only thing I need is time
To change your mind, I said

When all that you know
Has fallen behind you
It's not the past that you're afraid to see
There's nobody here and no one to find you
Tonight is forever

I can't decide which one of us is dreaming tonight
I'm just a shadow in the light you leave behind
The only thing I need is time
To change your mind, I said

When all that you know
Has fallen behind you
It's not the past that you're afraid to see
There's nobody here and no one to find you
Tonight is forever

It's always darker at the end of every answer
Like a finger down the back of your throat
It's always empty in the house of every other
Nothing waiting in the silence below

When all that you know
Has fallen behind you
It's not the past that you're afraid to see
There's nobody here and no one to find you
Tonight is forever
