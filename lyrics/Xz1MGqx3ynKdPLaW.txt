I
I can't promise you that I won't let you down
And I
I can't promise you that I will be the only one around
When your hope falls down
But we're young
Open flowers in the windy fields of this war-torn world
And love
This city breathes the plague of loving things more than their creators

I ran away
I could not take the burden of both me and you
It was too fast
Casting love on me as if it were a spell I could not break
When it was a promise I could not make

But what if I was wrong?
Oh, what if I was wrong?

But hold on to what you believed in the light
When the darkness has robbed you of all your sight
And oh, hold on to what you believed in the light
When the darkness has robbed you of all your sight

And now this land
Means less and less to me without you breathing through its trees
At every turn
The water runs away from me and the halo disappears
And the hole when you're not near

So what if I was wrong?
Oh, what if I was wrong
Oh, what If I was wrong?

But hold on to what you believed in the light
When the darkness has robbed you of all your sight
And oh, hold on to what you believed in the light
When the darkness has robbed you of all your sight

Hold on to what you believed in the light
