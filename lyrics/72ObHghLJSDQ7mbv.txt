What have I done with life, I close my eyes, now I say I can't see
Because of the tear that fall i built the wass and now unfortunately
I try to talk to you and I can't break through and it's killing me
Well, I feel lost inside the space between

So I'm done making excuses for mistakes I made
For so long now I have found a way past the blame
I know you will forgive me if I turn away
From this life of shame you have made a way

I'm taking life
I'm getting older
I won't back down
I'm getting closer
I'm taking life
I'm far from over
It's not the end
This is not the end

So many years I've wasted selfishly embracing natural things
I thought that I was fine as long as I didn't bring someone pain
But now I've begun to see a plan for me, so much more than this game
Father cover me, just like the rain

I'm taking life
I'm getting older
I won't back down
I'm getting closer
I'm taking life
I'm far from over
It's not the end
This is not the end

My eyes are open and my path is straight
You moved the mountain so there's nothing in my way
Your love is boundless and forever stays the same
I am on my way

Oh, I'm taking life
I'm getting older
I won't back down
I'm getting closer
I'm taking life
I'm far from over
It's not the end
This is not the end
I don't wanna waste my life

I'm taking life
I'm getting older
I won't back down
I'm getting closer
I'm taking life
I'm far from over
It's not the end
It's not the end
This is not the end!
