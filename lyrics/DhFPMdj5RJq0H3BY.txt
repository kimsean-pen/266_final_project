I am an anti everything man
A scab on the lips of the lord
My caustic - dismissal
Is all I need to get you
To fall on your sword

It's easy to live fast
It's harder to live
I woke up today with a gun
Ignoring your history is killing your past
You might run forever if death never lasts
So do me a favor
Your behavior

Is just a reason why
There is no savior
When you're wasted
Let's face it
There's a side of you that
Knows you're a failure
Lives for the danger
Feels like an enemy but looks like a stranger
The bell has rung on the titans
Everybody give us some room

Your so called set of fake morals
I can't tell the difference
Is that an excuse?
The matter at hand
is a matter of time

A sad little kid with broken toys
Your dogmatic license
Has kept you inside
What will you do when you're burning alive?
So do me a favor

Your behavior
Is just a reason why

There is no savior
When you're wasted
Let's face it
There's a side of you that
Knows you're a failure
Lives for the danger
Feels like an enemy but looks like a stranger
So do me a favor
Your behavior
Is just a reason why

There is no savior
When you're wasted
Let's face it
There's a side of you that
Knows you're a failure
Lives for the danger
Feels like an enemy but looks like a stranger
I don't mind my old
Dead story
And I don't want to lie to you

I know my glory
Will never be the same as truth
By now my only
enemy is you
I won't go slowly
I'll leave you behind
leave you behind
leave you behind
leave you behind
