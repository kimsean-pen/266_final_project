Twenty-six years and seems like I've just begun
To understand my
My intimate is no one
When the director sold the show, who
Bought its last rites?
They cut the cast, the music and the lights

This is my line, this is eternal
How did I ever end up here?
Discarnate, preternatural
My prayers to disappear

Absent of grace, marked as infernal
Ungranted in dead time left me disowned
To this nature so unnatural
I remain alone

Twenty-six years end, still speaking in these tongues
Such revelations, while understood by no one
When the new actor stole the show, who
Questioned his grace?
Please clear this house of ill-acquired taste

This is my line, this is eternal
How did I ever end up here?
Discarnate, preternatural
My prayers to disappear

Absent of grace, marked as infernal
Ungranted in dead time and left me disowned
To this nature so unnatural
I remain alone

Give me
Something
Give me
Something
Give me
Something
Give me
Something
Give me
Something
Give me
Something real

I lay strewn
Across the floor
Can't solve
This puzzle
Everyday, another small piece
Can be found
Oh

I lay strewn
Across the floor
Pieced up
In sorrow
The pieces are lost, the pieces don't fit
Pieced together incomplete
And empty

This is my line, this is eternal
How did I ever end up here?
Discarnate, preternatural
My prayers to disappear

Absent of grace, marked as infernal
Ungranted in dead time and left me disowned
In this nature so unnatural
I remain alone

This is my line, this is eternal
How did I
End up here?
Discarnate, preternatural
My prayers to disappear

Absent of grace, marked as infernal
Ungranted in dead time and left me disowned
To this nature so unnatural
I remain alone
