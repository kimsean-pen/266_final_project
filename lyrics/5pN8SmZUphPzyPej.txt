Never felt more like hiding myself away
Never felt so great

Never felt more weeping
Never felt more like sneaking away
Creeping away to crawl

I have to confess
I never felt less like dancing

Oh I know we should come to expect
Everything could be read
And you have to protect yourself

So how come I wasn't ready to see
When so obviously
You were falling for somebody else

I never felt less like dancing
Never felt more like hiding myself away
Never felt so great

I never felt more weeping
Never felt more like sneaking away
Creeping away to crawl

I have to confess
I never felt less like dancing

How come I wasn't ready to see
When so obviously
You were falling for somebody else

I never felt less like dancing
Never felt more like hiding myself away
Never felt so great

I never felt more weeping
Never felt more like sneaking away
Creeping away to crawl

I have to confess
I never felt less like dancing
