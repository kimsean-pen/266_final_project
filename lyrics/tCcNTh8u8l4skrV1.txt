Is this hard to swallow
You keep your thoughts by your pillow
Just so you can adore them
Just so we can ignore them
I'd rather lead not follow,
I'd rather stay and not go home
My moves have got so old
or so I've been told
But now you've lost it all

We're running out of time
We've got things on our mind
And things we just don't like
Who do you want to see?
Who do you want to be tonight?

Forgetting the promises you make,
Is how your, your promises easily break
Oh, you sit on your fence
And I'll dig under it
I'll count my losses
And I'll count my sins
I hope you've cleared your mind

We're running out of time
We've got things on our mind
And things we just don't like
Who do you want to see?
Who do you want to be tonight?

We're running out of time
We've got things on our mind
And things we just don't like
Who do you want to see?
Who do you want to be tonight?

We were young and we were blind
We ignored the warning signs
How were we to know?
How were we to know?

We were close but still so far
We grew apart and out of touch
All I wanted was...
All I wanted was to say...

We're running out of time
We've got things on our mind
And things we just don't like
Who do you want to see?
Who do you want to be tonight?

We're running out of time
We've got things on our mind
And things we just don't like
Who do you want to see?
Who do you want to be tonight?
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
