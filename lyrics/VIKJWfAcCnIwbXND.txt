You must guard this secret with your life
The hour has come
Breathe life into clay
A slave
We will be saved
When he rises up a mental brave

The creature walks, Combat the enemy

Follow follow follow follow follow follow follow
Your enemy
Follow follow follow follow follow follow follow
Your enemy
The creature walks
Now who's your enemy?

I'm the Golem
The secret stolen
This is my body

I walk again

Life born anew
Let silence scorn you
Reach out my body

I walk again
