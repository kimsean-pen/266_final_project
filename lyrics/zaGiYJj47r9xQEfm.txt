Oh I know that I love you even though
you seem to string me along.
But when we lock eyes and your smiles shining bright, your transe turns right into wrong.
And I'm hypnotized (Oh oh oh oh oh).
And I'm hypnotized (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Oh I know that I love you even though,
you'll get me killed one day.
But when we lock eyes and your smiles shining bright,
I'll do anything that you say!
cause I'm hypnotized (Oh oh oh oh oh)
I'm hypnotized (Oh oh oh oh oh)
I'm hypnotized by the light in your eyes, I seem to always find myself in a bind with you.
So stomp your feet, to the sound of all your burdens crashing down, cause I belong to you.(Oh oh oh oh oh)
I'm hypnotiezed (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Oh I know that I love you even though, you change everything in my life. (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Oh I know that I love you even though, I seem to be hypnotized.
