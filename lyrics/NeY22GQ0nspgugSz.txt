I've been trying to do right (right)
I know where we belong
Sometimes, I admit, I lose sight (sight)
Lose track and I do wrong

You try to keep the pain away (I can feel it)
Tell me you believe the lies I say (Don't believe it)
You try to keep those tears away (I can see it)
Hanging on to the strings of yesterday (Yesterday, yesterday)

You're too good for me
Too good for a sinner like me
Too good for me
Too good for a beginner like me

You're too good for me
Too good for a sinner like me
Too good for me
Too good for a beginner like me

You're too good for me, (Too good for me)
Too good for a sinner like me
Too good for me (Too good)
Too good for a beginner like me

You're too good for me, (Too good for me)
Too good for a sinner like me
Too good for me
Too good for a beginner like me

You're too good, too good for me
You're too good, too good

I couldn't fall asleep last night (Night, night night)
Wicked thoughts kept me awake
I lied watching the morning star
Wondering whose hand could write out fate
You've been shedding new light (Light, light)
On every promise that I break
I know one day I'll get too far

You try to keep the pain away (I can feel it)
Tell me you believe the lies I say (Don't believe it)
You try to keep those tears away (I can see it)
Hanging on to the strings of yesterday (Yesterday, yesterday)

You're too good for me
Too good for a sinner like me
Too good for me
Too good for a beginner like me

You're too good for me, (Too good for me)
Too good for a sinner like me
Too good for me
Too good for a beginner like me

You're too good for me
Too good for a sinner like me
Too good for me
Too good for a beginner like me

You're too good for me, too good for me, too good
You're too good, too good for a beginner like me
You're too good, too good for me
Too good
You're too good
Good
Good
Good
Good
