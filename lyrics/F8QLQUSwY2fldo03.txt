i was paralyzed
as i opened up my bloodshot eyes
do i really wanna know
where i've been or where i've put my nose

i'm in a rut
keep kicking myself in the nuts
in a stairwell i seek
the lair where i stuck my dirty beak

so i'm back again it's ok
well be that as it may
over and over away

into the fires unknown
into oblivion through sticks and stones

pick up the phone - my jacks are all blown
oh these nights out alone
come carry me home

a habit hard to break
take me home good lord for heavens sake
the doctor's not in
got no cure for the medicine

so i'm back again it's ok
well be that as it may
over and over away

into the fires unknown
into oblivion through sticks and stones

pick up the phone - listen to me moan
oh these nights out alone
come carry me home

everytime i make the round i turn around
i'm put upon the rack
everytime i stand up i fall flat on my face
and break my back - tombstoned
