this is getting difficult in my say
stutters on my mind when you approach me
with soft untrusting words

you're such a wordshaker
talk and you take it back
twisting turning

i gotta shut you up
your lips are burning
first you say yes then no
when you are ready then
baby let me know
you're such a wordshaker
talk and you take it back, back
shaking me off my track

my head above the water still i'm sinking
so please make up your mind
