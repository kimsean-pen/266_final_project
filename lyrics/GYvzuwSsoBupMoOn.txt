I rarely had enough time to think
My mind was never quiet enough
And when deceit arose it pulled me in
And I never came back

I can't help to think that we got lost because of me
Can't help to feel that I brought on this travesty
Been lost so long that lost is the only thing I've ever known
Can't help to feel that I'm alone

I'm weightless in the water
Surrounded by the deep
I stare my past in its eyes to say
It's over, it's over my friend
I made a promise to myself that I
Would never falter, never fade so I
Could stare my past in its eyes
Over and over

There was a whisper, a time was now fulfilled
So when the bell chimed all stars aligned
I sat in wonder, eyes on the horizon
And I never looked back

I can't help to think that we got lost because of me
Can't help to feel that I brought on this travesty
Been lost so long that lost is the only thing I'll ever know
Can't help to feel like I'm alone

I'm weightless in the water
Surrounded by the deep
I stare my past in its eyes to say
It's over, it's over my friend
I made a promise to myself that I
Would never falter, never fade so I
Could stare my past in its eyes
Over and over

I'm weightless in the water
Surrounded by the deep
I stare my past in its eyes to say
It's over, it's over my friend
I made a promise to myself that I
Would never falter, never fade so I
Could stare my past in its eyes
Over and over
