I see so much now
How my head spins round
Tell me just what to do
'Cause I'm lost inside it all

'Cause I would like to get to know you
I would like to get to know you
To know you

'Cause if there is a place for me
A place for you, this is what I've found
And if there is a place for me
A place for you, this is what I've found

Try to forget how
All these things came round
Tell me just what to do
'Cause I'm lost inside it all

'Cause I would like to get to know you
I would like to get to know you
To know you

'Cause if there is a place for me
A place for you, this is what I've found
And if there is a place for me
A place for you, this is what I've found

So hold your head high
Think about a better time
Hold your head high
Think about a better time
Hold your head high
Think about a better time
Hold your head high
Think about a better time

Hold your head high
Think about a better time
Hold your head high
Think about a better time
Hold your head high
Think about a better time
Hold your head high
Think about...

'Cause if there is a place for me
A place for you, this is what I've found
And if there is a place for me
A place for you, this is what I've found

If there is a place for me
If there is a place for me
If there is a place for me
If there is a place for me
