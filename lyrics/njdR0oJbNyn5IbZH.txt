Nobody knows what I'm doing here
And I ain't got a clue
Messin around with these other fools
When I'm not with you
There's been so many nights
When I've longed for your touch
There's been so many days
When our love was not enough
Oh leave me, leave me, just leave me
Can't you see me, see me
Nobody knows what I'm doing here
And I ain't got a clue
Messin around with these other fools
When I'm not with you
There's been so many nights
When I've longed for your touch
There's been so many days
When our love was not enough
Oh, leave me, leave me, leave me
Can't you see me, see me
Nobody knows what I'm doing here
And I ain't got a clue
Messin around with these other fools
When I'm not, when I'm not, when I'm not oohhh
Nobody knows what I'm doing here
And I ain't got a clue
Messin around with these other fools
When I'm not with you
When I'm not with you
