Somebody ought to draw a line, having you next to me
We were both afraid to say how we think
It's part of the poetry
If I let you go and I look away, it's time
But isn't it enough to say I fought
Isn't it enough to say I can't

I'll just keep away for you, keep away for me
You were a song to sing, a way to say
I need you more, you need to stay

You'll see me again, is it right or wrong?
You'll see me again, we go on and on
It's worth, it's worth the wait
And all this time I've have to change
You'll see me again, I know it won't be long

When it's hard to break, it's hard to take
And the reasons why I never made it through
And I never gave you all the things that I wanted to

If I let you go and I walk away
For reasons I will never know
I'll break, you'll pray

You'll see me again, is it right or wrong?
You'll see me again, we go on and on
It's worth, it's worth the wait
And all this time I've had to change
You'll see me again
I know it won't be long

But you won't love a ghost, I don't
I feel you in my throat
Another taste of love
You'll never know, never wait for it
And now the hand you hold
Is now the hand that holds you down

You'll see me again, on and on
We go on and on again

You'll see me again, is it right or wrong?
You'll see me again, we go on and on
It's worth, it's worth the wait
And all this time I've had to change
You'll see me again, and I will let you be
