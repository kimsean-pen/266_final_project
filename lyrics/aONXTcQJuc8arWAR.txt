Ladies and gentleman, this is mambo number five
One, two, three, four, five everybody in the car, so come on
Let's ride to the liquor store around the corner
The boys say they want some gin and juice
But I really don't wanna, beer bust like I had last week
I must stay deep because talk is cheap
I like Angela, Pamela, Sandra and Rita
And as I continue you know they are getting sweeter
So what can I do I really beg you my Lord
To me is flirting it's just like sport, anything fly
It's all good let me dump it please set in the trumpet
A little bit of Monica in my life, a little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita is all I need, a little bit of Tina is what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun, a little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica here I am,
a little bit of you makes me your man
Mambo number five
Jump up and down and move it all around
Shake your head to the sound, put your hand on the ground
Take one step left and one step right
One to the front and one to the side
Clap your hand once and clap your hands twice
And if it looks like this then you are doing it right
A little bit of Monica in my life, a little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita is all I need, a little bit of Tina is what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun, a little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica here I am,
a little bit of you makes me your man
Trumpet, the trumpet
Mambo number five
A little bit of Monica in my life, a little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita is all I need, a little bit of Tina is what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun, a little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica here I am,
a little bit of you makes me your man
I do all, to fall in love with a girl like you
'Cause you can't run and you can't hide
You and me gonna touch the sky
Mambo number five
