I'm in a lie
That I told last night
You're a problem
But you're mine
I think you hide it well
Despite the dark around your eyes

You're a winner
Even though you think you're not
I'm not a quitter
But you never talk
Getting later and it's hard for you
To turn in for the night

Still I'm with ya
Still I'm with ya, you know
Still I'm with ya
Can I have the boy I wanted?
Hello, hello

Any way we could keep it cool
You respond when I'm polite
Sitting on my suitcase
In the doorway out of spite

You're a winner
Even though you think you're not
I'm not a quitter
But you never talk
Getting later and it's hard for you
To turn in for the night

Still I'm with ya
Still I'm with ya, you know
Still I'm with ya
Can I have the boy I wanted?
Hello, hello

Still I'm with ya
(Oh, you're a winner though you think you're not)
Still I'm with ya, you know
(And you never talk)
Still I'm with ya
(Oh, getting later now)
Can I have the boy I wanted?
Hello, hello

You're a winner
Even though you think you're not
I'm not a quitter
But you never talk
Getting later and it's hard for you
To turn in for the night

Still I'm with ya
Still I'm with ya, you know
Still I'm with ya
Can I have the boy I wanted?
Hello, hello

Still I'm with ya
(Oh, you're a winner though you think you're not)
Still I'm with ya, you know
(And you never talk)
Still I'm with ya
(Oh, getting later now)
Can I have the boy I wanted?
Hello, hello

(Oh, getting later now)
Can I have the boy I wanted?
Hello, hello
