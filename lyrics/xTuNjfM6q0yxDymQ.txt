moving closer now
your hand just knocked me off my feet
yeah like a puppet now
i cannot move to my own beat

but i can dance tonight
i'll make up songs for us to sing
you hold my heart with cotton string
and to your rhythm i will shout
my love for play

take off your hat
and pull a rabbit out for me
i'm like a lackey now
i'll lay on my back, get on my knees

so i will dance now
