Dance to the music
Dance to the music
Dance to the music
Dance to the music

'Cos if you dance to the music
The night will last, the night will last
The night will go on and on

He drives a black Cadillac
Whips and furs in the back
He drives a black Cadillac
Whips and furs in the back

An' if you dance to the music
The night will last, the night will last
The night will go on and on

You can take a chance on love
One more dance on love
You can take a chance on love
One more dance on love

An' if you dance to the music
The night will last, the night will last
The night will go on and on

You can take a chance on love
One more dance on love
You can take a chance on love
One more dance on love

An' if you dance to the music
The night will last, the night will last
The night will go on and on
