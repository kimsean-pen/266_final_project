Could not break the silence
Could not move in here
How can they stay so silent?
All the grief and violence
For all they went through
For all it breaks loose

It's bursting out
Fire, walk with me
Fire, walk with me

The will is strong
Can I show you Fear?

Don't move
Don't turn
Don't come too close as I
Burn down this place
My spirit will set it all on fire

Would you like to meet the tyrant in the twilight zone?

Get in, don't be late
And breathe in my reality
But first break the silence

There is more
Beyond the dawn he's rising
Where darkness grows
He traveling in disguise
Now don't look back
Now you know why
We set sail to new shores
We will meet him

Sacred mind
We build a new pleasure-dome here
Xanadu
My Xanadu
My Xanadu

Don't look back, just enter
What I call my soul asylum
Where they are playing tricks
Everybody
If you like to see
Whatever lies beyond that golden door
It seems
My frequency's turned weak
Try to remember me
Try to remember me

Then for a while
We've heard the sounds of sirens
You turn to stone
Medusa's in your sight
I tell you why
Rearranged by the ages gone by
You can change it

Sacred mind
We build a new pleasure-dome here
Xanadu
My Xanadu
My Xanadu

Sacred mind
We build a new pleasure-dome here
Xanadu
My Xanadu
My Xanadu

Chance or predestined end
Praise, hallelujah

Never mind the end
Fool the mall
Fear the demon in disguise
Keep your secret inside

Let's move on, it's time
A thousand years gone by
The pleasure-dome
What will we hear
And what will we see

All a lie
There's no boat
There's no river
No shore
Journey's over

Sacred mind
We build a new pleasure-dome here
Xanadu
My Xanadu
My Xanadu
