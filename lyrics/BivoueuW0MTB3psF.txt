What left your soul
start to pull apart
and I know what you don't
would you stay with me

we stayed up every night
and slept when it turned light
we killed our empty past
and burned it on the grass
and you said you were fine
clouds covered the sky
rain began to fall
it was gone

slipped through all this noise
hoy'd you make it this far
cause I don't think it's nothing at all
yea I could swear I saw it in you

we stayed up every night
and slept when it turned light
we killed our empty past
and burned it on the grass
and you said you were fine
clouds covered the sky
rain began to fall
it was gone
