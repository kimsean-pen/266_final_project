Wasted on nothing
Effortlessly you appear
Sound of the thunder
Reverberating your ear
This is a slow dance
This is the chance to transform
Pause for the silence
Inhabit the calm of the storm

This is your ocean an ocean of night
This is an ocean your ocean of night
This is your ocean an ocean of night
This is an ocean your ocean of night

Love is a feeling
Buried with me in the yard
Gaze at the skyline
Under the ocean of stars
This is your slow dance and this is your chance to transform
Lost in a moment
The moment your confront the storm

This is your ocean an ocean of night
This is an ocean your ocean of night
This is your ocean an ocean of night
This is an ocean your ocean of night

I am your hope down the wire
So you can hold back the fire
I am your hope down the wire
So you can hold back the fire
I am your hope down the wire
So you can hold back the fire
I am your hope down the wire
So you can hold back the fire
I am your hope down the wire
So you can hold back the fire
I am your hope down the wire
So you can hold back the fire

This is your ocean an ocean of night
This is an ocean your ocean of night
This is your ocean an ocean of night
This is an ocean your ocean of night
(Ocean of night)
(Ocean of night)
(Ocean of night)
(Ocean of night)
