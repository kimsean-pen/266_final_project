Passarino, go away for the trap is set
And waits for its prey

You have come here in pursuit of your deepest urge
In pursuit of that wish which till now has been silent
Silent

I have brought you
That our passions may fuse and merge
In your mind you've already succumbed to me
Dropped all defences, completely succumbed to me
Now you are here with me
No second thoughts, you've decided
Decided

Past the point of no return
No backward glances
Our games of make-believe are at an end

Past all thought of "if" or "when"
No use resisting
Abandon thought and let the dream descend

What raging fire shall flood the soul?
What rich desire unlocks its door?
What sweet seduction lies before us?

Past the point of no return
The final threshold
What warm unspoken secrets will we learn?
Beyond the point of no return

You have brought me
To that moment when words run dry
To that moment when speech disappears
Into silence
Silence

I have come here
Hardly knowing the reason why
In my mind, I've already imagined
Our bodies entwining
Defenseless and silent
Now I am here with you
No second thoughts
I've decided
Decided

Past the point of no return
No going back now
Our passion-play has now, at last, begun

Past all thought of right or wrong
One final question
How long should we two wait, before we're one?
When will the blood begin to race?
The sleeping bud burst into bloom?
When will the flames, at last, consume us?

Past the point of no return
The final threshold
The bridge is crossed
So stand and watch it burn
We've passed the point of no return

Say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime
Lead me, save me from my solitude

Say you want me with you here, beside you
Anywhere you go, let me go too
Christine, that's all I ask of

Oh my God! Piangi, my love!

Oh my god. We're ruined Andr√©
Ruined!

Where did he take her?

Come with me monsieur, I will take you to him.
But remember
Keep your hand at the level of your eyes!

I'll come with you!

No Meg, no. You must stay here!
Come with me monsieur
Do as I say

No!
