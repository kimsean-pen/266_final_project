Strike me down
Give me everything you've got
Strike me down
I'll be everything I'm not
Count the questions on one hand
You don't ask me what I planned

Strike me down
Should have asked me what went wrong
Strike me down
Should have stayed away too long
Should have stayed away too long

Strike me down
Give it everything you've got
Chance me now I'll be everything I'm not
Hope's the child of what luck brings
Points to faith in higher things

Ask me now
Fire at everything at once
Strike me down
Take it any way you want

Strike me down
Better left it all unknown
Strike me down
Should have held it all alone
Wash the questions off my hands
I'm the fate in no one's plans

Strike me down
Give it everything you've got
Strike me down
I'll be everything I'm not
I'll be everything I'm not, everything I'm not
I'll be everything I'm not
