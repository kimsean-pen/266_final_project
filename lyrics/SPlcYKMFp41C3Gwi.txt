It's nature's way of telling you something's wrong
It's nature's way of telling you in a song

It's nature's way of receiving you
It's nature's way of retrieving you
It's nature's way of telling you something's wrong

It's nature's way of telling you, summer breeze
It's nature's way of telling you, dying trees

It's nature's way of receiving you
It's nature's way of retrieving you
It's nature's way of telling you something's wrong

It's nature's way, it's nature's way
It's nature's way, it's nature's way

It's nature's way of telling you something's wrong
It's nature's way of telling you in a song, oh oh oh

It's nature's way of receiving you
(It's nature's way)
It's nature's way of retrieving you
(It's nature's way)
It's nature's way of telling you something's wrong
Something's wrong, something's wrong
