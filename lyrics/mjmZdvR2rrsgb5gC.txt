Hail from the end of the Adelaide
Many have failed but I said I would be with you
Wherever you are
No matter however far

This is the fantasy
That I dream

Sewn together in a simple life
Denting the can with a plan I feel like I could never survive
Oh, my second life wife

Mad in the energy of a world on fire
With our dreams

Skip to the end of our tragedy
Many have died and we cannot survive
Unless we cut off our life
And give them something to write

This is the remedy to begin the legend of our love

Of our love

This is the melody of our sad desire
