Yeah that's right
One, two, three
One, two
One
One...

We sent out the SOS call
It was a quarter past four
In the morning
When the storm broke our second anchor line
Four months at sea
Four months of calm seas
To be pounded in the shallows off
The tip of Montauk Point

They call them rogues
They travel fast and alone
One hundred foot faces
Of God's good ocean gone wrong
What they call love is a risk
You'll always get hit
Out of nowhere
By some wave and end up on your own

The hole in the hull defied the crews attempts
To bail us out
And flooded the engines and radio
And half buried bow

Your tongue is a rudder
It steers the whole ship
Sends your words past your lips
Or keeps them safe behind your teeth
But the wrong words will strand you
Come off course while you sleep
Sweep your boat out to sea
Or dash to bits on the reef

The vessel groans
The ocean pressures its frame
To the port I see the lighthouse
Through the sleet and the rain
And I wish for one more day
To give my love and repay debts
But the morning finds our bodies
Washed up thirty miles west

They say that the captain
Stays fast with the ship
Through still and storm
But this ain't the Dakota
The water's cold (so cold)
Won't have to fight for long

(This is the end)
This story's old (this is the end)
But it goes on and on
Until we disappear (this is the calm)
Calm me and let me taste (this is the calm)
The salt you breathed
While you were underneath (We are the resin)
I am the one who haunts your (we are the resin)
Dreams of mountains
Sunk below the sea (after the storm)
I spoke the words but never (after the storm)
Gave a thought to what they all could mean (Rest here with me)
I know that this (rest in the deep) is what you want
A funeral keeps both of us apart (Washed up on the beach)
You know that you are not alone (Washed up on the beach)
I need you like water in my lungs (this is the end)
