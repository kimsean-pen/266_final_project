I been drinking for way too long
She want love
that's just way too strong
In too deep and I'm way too gone
In too deep and I'm way too gone
I know what you want
I got it right
Yeah I got it
I know what you want
I got it got it right
Yeah I got it

About time that I came
and I had a re up
I'm coolin on the beach
with a bad senorita
I would take a snapshot
just to send it to ya
But I been in the lab
tryna pack coliseums
Gold plated quality gold rated
I'm tryna land in the top 5
next to your favorites
I know what she wanting
and then I got it yeaa
She look me up and down say
she bout it yeaa
Yea she college educated
with the good brain
YSL top with the Balmain
Yeah we yeah we vibrate
like her phone ring
But another broken link
on my gold chain
Whipping down the 101 I runaway
She just want that 1 on 1
and all we do is fornicate
Like what we gon do today
Prolly the same thing
we doin like everyday
And that's alright

I been drinking for way too long
She want love
that's just way too strong
In too deep and I'm way too gone
In too deep and I'm way too gone
I know what you want

Yeah I got it
I know what you want
I got it got it right

I know what you want
and yeah I got it
Something more
than filling up them pockets
Something deeper
than a bank deposit
She don't feel the need
to talk about it
Sometimes things
are better left unsaid
Some days things
are better left unread
Still I gotta hit the city
just to go flex
I feel sorry for anybody
that go next
I been drinking for way too long
I'm just waiting
for somebody come
and prove me wrong
Why's it that you gotta murder
every track you on
I been hustling from the jump
what the fuh you on
I put it all on the line for you
Redirect all my shine to you
She told me it's all on you
I don't know if I'm ready
for ready for that

I been drinking for way too long
She want love
that's just way too strong
In too deep and I'm way too gone
In too deep and I'm way too gone
I know what you want
I got it right
Yeah I got it
I know what you want
I got it got it right
Yeah I got it

I been drinking for way too long
She want love

In too deep and I'm way too gone
In too deep and I'm way too gone
I know what you want
