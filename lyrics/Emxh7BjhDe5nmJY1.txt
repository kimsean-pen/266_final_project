It's so still, far too still,
In the air, something new.

Tension is rising and pressure is on,
Every thing's coming undone,
People get ready is your time to move,
Coming together as one.

Everybody shake,
Till your heart breaks.
Everybody shake,
Till your heart breaks.
(Shake, shake)

Break it down, break it right down,
Keep your feet on the ground.

Eyes become lights of the skies going dark,
Shining like pieces of glass.
Rhythm intensifies hold out your hands,
Pulses are rising so fast.

Everybody shake,
Till your heart breaks.
Everybody shake,
Till your heart breaks.
(Shake, shake)

(Shake)

There's only one thing you should really know,
I tell you this place is about to blow. (Shake)
There's only one thing you should really know,
I tell you this place is about to blow ('bout to blow).

Shake,
Till your heart breaks.
Everybody shake,
Till your heart breaks.

Everybody shake,
Till your heart breaks.
Everybody shake,
Till your heart breaks.

Everybody shake, (there's only one thing you should really know)
Till your heart breaks. (I tell you this place is about to blow)
Everybody shake, (there's only one thing you should really know)
Till your heart breaks. (I tell you this place is about to blow, 'bout to blow)

(Shake)
