Oh, well I knew you shook the set-up
baby, of all the leaves up in the ground
And I know our song is over and
heavy as I see dry leaves fallin' down, oh
With all this fever in my mind, I could drown in your kerosene eyes
Oh, you're just a riddle in the sky
Oh, where do my bluebird fly?

And as the early sign of dawn of thunder I see you stir the fog around
And when you find the boys and gears of
sunset we'll hear that high and lonesome sound, oh
And I will question every wind if
they gone through the glow of your eyes
Oh, you're just a riddle in the sky
Oh, where do my bluebird fly?
I say where do my bluebird fly?

Oh, well I know you soak your
feathers baby upon the ghosts along my trail
And I know well I was sole and
buried before I knew it was for sale, oh
With all this fever in my mind I could aim for your kerosene eyes
Oh, you're just a target in the sky
I say where do my bluebird fly?
I say where do my bluebird fly?
