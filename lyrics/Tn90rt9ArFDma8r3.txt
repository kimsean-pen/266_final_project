So right, so clean
But does it mean anything? No, no
So right, so clean
Does it mean anything? No, no

It sounds like something that I saw in a movie
It looks like something that I've seen on TV
Oh perfect thing
I wish I could believe in your dream

I see signs of life in alleys and corners
I smell death on a crowded street
I feel the last old building burnin'
I've got nowhere left to put my feet

'Cause it's so right, so clean
Does it mean anything? No, no
It's right so clean
It doesn't mean anything, no, no

'Cause you nevermind the ones who got left behind
You nevermind the ones who got left behind
You nevermind the ones who got left behind
You nevermind the ones who got left behind

It's so right, so clean
It doesn't mean anything, no, no
So right, so clean
But does it mean anything? No, no

I wish I could believe in your dream
I wish I could believe in your dream
I wish I could believe in your dream
I wish I could believe in your dream
I wish I could believe in your dream
I wish I could believe in your dream
I wish I could believe in your dream
I wish I could believe in your dream
