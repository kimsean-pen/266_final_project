Endless hierarchies
Distortions of human nature
The myths and their gravity
This world we have created defies
our natural evolution

Nature versus nurture
Obsolescence reality

In a state of collapse
Led by the invisible hand
They tip the scales of equilibrium
Structured delusional system
disorder

Nature versus nurture
Obsolescence reality
Nature versus future
The endless hierarchies

We pushed it all too far
Those vicious cycles, ecocide
We spilled the blood of innocents
Hierarchies

Endless hierarchies
Distortions of human nature
Nature versus future
Obsolescence reality
Nature versus nurture
The endless hierarchies
