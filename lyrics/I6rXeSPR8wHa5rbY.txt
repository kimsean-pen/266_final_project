The moonlit sky
The pale light unveils the secret path
Gates covered in roses
Hide a silent place
I hear you breathe
Signs in the wind are leading me
Into paradise
I come for you

I will forever return
Angels would call our names
They'd take us into the garden of dreams
And then your eyes meet mine
The light they shine will never die
Sing with me
The lullaby that sets me free

All my fears fading

Your sweet embrace
Talk to me
Make all my sorrows disappear
In my dark hours
I come to you
I will forever return

Angels would call our names
They'd take us into the garden of dreams

And then your eyes meet mine
The light they shine will never die
Angels would call our names
They'd take us into the garden of dreams
And then your eyes meet mine
The light they shine will never die

Come meet me tonight
Come to our secret garden
Hide with me

Hide in your arms hold me forever
Come meet me tonight
Come to our secret garden
Hide with me
Hide by your side hold me forever
Here in your arms
Angels would call our names
They'd take us into the garden of dreams
And then your eyes meet mine
The light they shine will never die
Angels would call our names
They'd take us into the garden of dreams
And then your eyes meet mine
The light they shine will never die
The light you shine will never die
