Oh
My love and I were thinking
How low our boat was sinking
From fishing for the blues
Every lure we tried
Jonesey turned the tide
We lost our cool
Caught in whirlpools

Oh
So bland was our condition
We summoned black magicians
To wave a wand or two
Talismanic spells
Tannis root and well
To tell the tale
Their magic failed

If that is all you want
(Doctor Marvello)
Then I may be of service
If all you want is love
(Doctor Marvello)
Well I may know a special man
Whose love machine turns can't to can
With your mind in mind
With your mind in mind

(A passage of time)

Oh
The trance wore off by morning
A sentimental journey was hazily recalled
Though it sounds absurd
We're completely cured
And now we're fine
And now we're fine
And now we're fine

My love and I
