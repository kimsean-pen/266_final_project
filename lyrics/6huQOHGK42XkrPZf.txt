I'm fond of solitude, the deepest shade of blue
And lighting a spark just to watch it go out in the night
It's true I've had my doubts, my tongue there in your mouth
It's hard to move on when it's all that I'm thinking about

So I sit here in the dark now,
Wait for the season to change
All I know is letting go of you

All I know is letting go
Take my hand I'm drowning deep and slow
All I know is letting go

The ones that brought me here, they're bound to disappear
And I sink at the thought of a life without the ones I love
The world beneath our feet, it spins at violent speeds
There's one thing I've learned, there's no stopping the passage of time

So I sit here in your arms now,
Waiting for something to feel good,
To feel right, I've waited my whole life

All I know is letting go of you
All I know is letting go
Take my life it's spinning out of control
All I know is letting go.
