All those old basements and tenements I've been through
In every bedroom I grit my teeth and smiled my way into
All the halls I ran down, a blatant imposter
And every sofa where I bet you called a doctor

Well I was searching
Yeah, I was searching
For an abstract distant view
Satellite I'd never be near to
Oh listen, you eclipsed them
Through a backwards, misspent youth
I was always reaching for you
Oh listen, you eclipsed them

Daydreams pass nightshifts and I'm wheezing like the trains
Again, so distracting, when someone shares your name
Are these places I'm invited really where I should be?
And are you just excited the first 10 times you meet me?

Well I was searching
Yeah, I was searching
For an abstract distant view
Satellite I'd never be near to
Oh listen, you eclipsed them
Through a backwards, misspent youth
I was always reaching for you
Oh listen, you eclipsed them

You abstract distant view
I was always reaching for you
Oh listen, you eclipsed them
My shy heart beats for you
And I opened up and told you
Oh listen, you eclipsed them
