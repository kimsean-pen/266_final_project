Your hands were cold
Your voice was shaky
One morning not too long ago
And at the time I was only a child
About to lose my childlike mind
The way you touched my hands
Like you never had before
It wasn't you anymore
I called for my brothers
I called for my sisters
But there was nothing left for them to do
And so I watched from far away
As the ambulances came
And started dressing for school

Goodbye sweet mother earth
Without you now I'm a lonely universe
You won't always understand
When you've truly loved someone
Until after they've gone

This time of year the nights fall longer
So grow a spine or catch cold
The winter months they do make you feel stronger
But in the end it's all getting old
And you won't always be walking the safest streets
But you can find your way home
If you have imagined your way back
Then my dear you're more than halfway there
And you might only possess
What you've carried on your back
But you've always been free
Now it's time to believe
Time to give up that unforgiving act of altogetherness
And start living out your oldest childhood dreams
Well, losing your minds it ain't half as bad as it seems
And if you would take the risk
Well, it might be worth your time
It's only your life
It's only going by

Goodbye sweet mother earth
Without you now I'm a lonely universe
You won't always understand
When you've truly loved someone
Until after they've gone
