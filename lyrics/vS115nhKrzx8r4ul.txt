Fear something again
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
Fear something again
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
Fear something again
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
Fear something again
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh

Reject
Are you no one
Feel you nothing
You know I'll bet you think
You have a good reason to be living
In the limelight of the fortunate ones
You're too weakened by the poison
That they feed you in the living lie
They don't believe you
Call to no one
Trust in nothing
Little impotent one

I don't want to be, I don't want to be
I don't want to be, I don't want to be innocent, you know
I don't want to be, I don't want to be
I don't want to be, I don't want to let them hypnotize me

Punk ass, are you listening?
Can you hear me or are you deaf and dumb to my language?
Do the real words seem to hurt you
Well put em' up motherfucker
Because you'll feel it
When I stamp it on your forehead
So you will never forget
That you're a reject
And you're no one
And you're nothing
Little impotent one

I don't want to be, I don't want to be
I don't want to be, I don't want to be innocent, you know
I don't want to be, I don't want to be
I don't want to be, I don't want to let them hypnotize me
I don't want to be, I don't want to be
I don't want to be, I don't want innocence, you know
I don't want to be, I don't want to be
I don't want to be, I don't want to let them hypnotize me

Fear awaken
Go with it now
And let it overcome you
Fear awaken
Your mind is racing

I don't understand why you don't like me
Why don't you like me?
Am I so different from you
Now does it scare you that I'm able to discern
What to love and what to burn
I'll add your fuel to the fire now
Stand back, brother, take your hand back
Leave it and I might crack
More than a smile or two you see
You don't judge what you don't understand
You can't deny what has been given to me

I don't want to be, I don't want to be
I don't want to be, I don't want to be innocent, you know
I don't want to be, I don't want to be
I don't want to be, I don't want to let them hypnotize me
I don't want to be, I don't want to be
I don't want to be, I don't want innocence, you know
I don't want to be, I don't want to be
I don't want to be, I don't want to let them hypnotize me

Fear awaken
Go with it now
And let it overcome you
Fear awaken
Go with it now, go with it now
Your fear awaken
Go with it now
And let it overcome you
Fear awaken
Your mind is racing

Erasing now

Reject
Are you no one
Feel you nothing
You know I'll bet you think
You have a good reason to be living
In the limelight of the fortunate ones, you know
