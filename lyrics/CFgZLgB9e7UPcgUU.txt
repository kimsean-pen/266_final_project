As I was saying
I know that I've been one of the few who walks
Away from you
Steven smith, we all lose
One look at you
And they're suddenly covered in
Shrapnel too
It's true, most die in your bedroom

All the time I'm getting shot
Oh, barrels roll and hammers drop
Come on now
Grab that gun and we'll go drive
Around
Until there's no sound

Come on
Let's go
I said I am driving and I am driving
It's true, I've got something for you

When everything is quiet
The ringing in our ears will be awfully
Violent
And then there will be silence
Then there will be silence
