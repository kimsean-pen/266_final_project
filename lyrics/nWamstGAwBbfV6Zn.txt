Bootleg, bootleg
Bootleg, howl
Bootleg, bootleg
Bootleg, howl

Take you a glass of water
Make it against the law
See how good the water tastes
When you can't have any at all

Bootleg, bootleg
Bootleg, howl
Bootleg, bootleg
Bootleg, now, now

Findin' a natural woman
Like honey to a bee
But you don't buzz the flower
When you know the honey free

Bootleg, bootleg
Bootleg, howl
Bootleg, bootleg
Bootleg, howl

Suzy maybe give you some cherry pie
But Lord, that ain't no fun
Better you grab it when she ain't lookin'
'Cause you know you'd rather have it on the run

Bootleg, bootleg
Bootleg, howl
Bootleg, bootleg
Bootleg, howl
