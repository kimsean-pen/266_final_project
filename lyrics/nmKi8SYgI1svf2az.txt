I looked under chairs
I looked under tables
I try to find the key
To fifty million fables

They call me the seeker
I've been searchin' low and high

I won't get to get what I'm after
'Til the day I die

I asked
I asked the Beatles
I asked Timothy Leary
But he couldn't help me, either

They call me the seeker
I've been searchin' low and high

I won't get to get what I'm after
'Til the day I die

People tend to hate me
Cause I never smile
As I ransack their homes, they wanna shake my hand

Focusin' on nowhere
Investigatin' miles
I'm a seeker, I'm a really desperate man

I won't get to get what I'm after
'Til the day I die

I learned how to raise my voice in anger
Yeah, but look at my face, ain't this a smile
I'm happy when life's good, and when it's bad I cry
I got values, but I don't know how or why
I'm lookin' for me
You're lookin' for you
We're lookin' at each other, and we don't know what to do
They call me the seeker
I've been searchin' low and high
I won't get to get what I'm after
'Til the day I die
