There is a feeling deep inside
As dreary as a winternight
It darkens all my pride
And drives away the light

There is a feeling in my soul
It feels marooned and far too cold
I stand alone to face the wheel of time unfold

Darkness falls inside of me
And the sorrow's growing day by day
And though my life's a broken memory
There's a door and there's a key

Sorrow comes with silent tears
And the dawn still haunts my darkest fears
What have we both become throughout these years
There's a serpent in all tears

There is a river in my dreams
That runs so wide, that runs so deep
And by it's riverine
I still can hear you weep

There is a winter in my heart
So freezing cold and utter dark
It keeps me down and tears my sanity apart

Darkness falls inside of me
And the sorrow's growing day by day
And though my life's a broken memory
There's a door and there's a key

Sorrow comes with silent tears
And the dawn still haunts my darkest fears
What have we both become throughout these years
There's a serpent in all tears

Darkness falls inside of me
And the sorrow's growing day by day
And though my life's a broken memory
There's a door and there's a key

Sorrow comes with silent tears
And the dawn still haunts my darkest fears
What have we both become throughout these years
There's a serpent in all tears
