So winter froze the river
And winter birds don't sing
So winter makes you shiver
So time is gonna bring you spring

So he swears, he'll never marry
Says that cuddles are a curse
Just tell him plain you're on the next train
If our love don't get there first

Time and love everybody, time and love
Nothing cures like time and love
Don't let the Devil fool you
Here comes a dove

Nothing cures like time and love
Love for the man if you please
If you think and if you can

So winter froze the river
And winter birds don't sing
So winter makes you shiver
So time is gonna bring you spring

You've been running, you've been rambling
And you don't know what to do
A holly golden wager says
That love will see you through

Time and love everybody, time and love
Nothing cures like time and love
Don't let the Devil fool you
Here comes a dove

Nothing cures like time and love
Love for the man if you please
If you think and if you can

So Jesus wasn't angel
And mankind broke His wing
But Jesus gave His lifeline
So sacred bell could sing

Now, a woman is a fighter
Gather white or African
A woman is a woman, inside
Has miracles for men at night

Time and love everybody, time and love
Nothing cures like time and love
Don't let the Devil fool you
Here comes a dove

Nothing cures like time and love
Love for the man if you please
If you think and if you can

Love for the man if you please
If you think and if you can
Love for the man if you please
If you think and if you can

Love for the man if you please
If you think and if you can
Love for the man if you please
If you think and if you can

Love for the man if you please
If you think and if you can
Love for the man if you please
If you think and if you can
