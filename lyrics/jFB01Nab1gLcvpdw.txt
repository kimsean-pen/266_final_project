Jack daniels if you please knock me to my knees
Your the only friend there's has ever been
That didn't do me wrong
Jack daniels if you please knock me to my knees
You can kill this pain that's driving me insane
Since my babies gone
Cigarettes and whiskey calm my shaking hands
I just lost a lover to a one night stand
Something temporary to late i had to learn
It wasn't meant to last, i lost her to the past
A bridge she couldn't burn

Promises were broken dreams were to die
Empty words were spoken tears were in our eyes
Something temporary those fears will fade away
Please do the best you can to help me understand
These games that people play
