When I look in the mirror
I'm not as young as I used to be
I'm not quite as beautiful
As when you were next to me

And all the times that I've tried to go out
To see if you might be there
No, I'll never get over you
No, I still got a lock of your hair

'Cause when I said that I loved you, honey
I knew it from the very start
And when I said that I loved you, honey
I knew that you would break my heart

But why, why
Why, why

There's a voice in the back of my head
That says you're always gonna be alone
Go turn the TV on
Turn off the telephone

'Cause all the times that I've tried to go out
To find somebody new
You make me wish you would just come back home
Baby, won't you come on home?

'Cause when I said that I loved you, honey
I knew it from the very start
And when I said that I loved you, honey
I knew that you would break my heart

But why, why
Why, why

'Cause when I said that I loved you, honey
I knew it from the very start
And when I said that I loved you, honey
I knew that you would break my heart

But why, why
Why, why
