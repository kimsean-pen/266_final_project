Wherever you found it,
It's none of my business
Now, wherever you go, go, go
It's not my concern
But for a second, your attention
Just belonged to me
And it passed so fast
Which is scratchin' off my cool
I'm not broken-hearted,
I'm just kind of pissed off
'Cause, Allie I was so good back then
But I wonder if I'd be so good if I saw you again
Listen, miss, you've got me
You shoulda taught me such naughty things
(You shoulda taught me such naughty things)
You coulda taught me such naughty things
You sang to me (in a whisper, a capella)
Cross-legged on Andrew's bed
And I, drunk beyond my fifteen years,
Wished to be anywhere else instead
'Cause I was still terrified of you
And, oh, I was too scared to dare to do
So I slid, unsprung, off the mattress
And crumpled to the floor, and the sad fact is
You said you were protected
I thought you meant you had a gun
'Cause, Allie I was so good back then
But I wonder if I'd be so good if I saw you again
Listen, miss, you've got me
You shoulda taught me such naughty things
(You shoulda taught me such naughty things)
You coulda taught me such naughty things
Allie I was so good-
But I wonder, but I wonder, but I wonder
But I wonder, if I'd be so good-
(You shoulda taught me such naughty things)
Oh, you coulda taught me such naughty things
Allie I was so good back then
But I wonder if I'd be so good if I saw you again
Listen, miss, you've got me
You shoulda taught me such naughty things
(Tonight we're going to do naughty things)
You shoulda taught me such naughty things, yeah
