An empty house, an empty heart
Throw it away, too late to take a different part
I hope we escape

An empty house, an empty heart
Throw it away, too late to take a different part
Let's hope we escape

I'll hold you,
Too close
I'll take you,
Too close
When I turn,
we'll turn
We'll still be,
Too close

I'll hold you,
Too close
I'll take you,
Too close
When I turn,
we'll turn
We'll still be,
Too close
