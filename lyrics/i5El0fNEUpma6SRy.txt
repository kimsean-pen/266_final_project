I can't find a four-leaf clover rainbow.
I could find it if I wanted to.
I believe if you put your mind to somethin'
Well there ain't anything in this world
You could not do.

What I can't find:
One honest mind.
Why can't I find me
One honest mind?
Don't understand.

The only thing I ever wanted
Was a little bouquet of truth from him.
But he gave me all the things
You can't build love on.
And I'm on the wrong side
Of a broken heart again.

Why can't I find
One honest man?
Why can't I find me
One honest man?
Don't understand.

If a little bit of candle
Can light up the darkness
Why can't it shine it's way through?
I've been waitin' for a very,
Very, very long time.
Ain't no man ever gonna be true.

Don't understand.
Ain't there a man for me?

Why can't I find me
One honest man?
Why can't I find
One honest man?
Why can't I find me
One honest man?
Why can't I find
One honest man?
