This is a call a call to all
It goes out to those who've been there
And I should know because I've been
Maybe once a week on Mondays

You should have seen what I've seen
She doubles up and comes back Sundays
And she will come into your heart
It goes on and on and on

Here it comes
Here comes my days in the sun
Here it comes
Here comes my time in the sun

This is the day, this is the time
To stare at the skies in wonder
We live a lie, you'll never find
Never in a month of Sundays

You should have seen what I've seen
He doubles up and comes back Mondays
And he will come into your heart
It goes on and on and on

Here it comes
Here comes my days in the sun
Here it comes
Here comes my time in the sun
And you don't know how it feels
Here it comes
Here comes my time in the sun

Here it comes
Here comes my days in the sun
Here it comes
Here comes my time in the sun
And you don't know how it feels
Here it comes
Here comes my time in the sun
