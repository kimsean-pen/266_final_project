Daydreamer
Rise and shine
Daily deja vu
Yet still surprised
Watch the weary world with greyscale eyes

A millionaire in my mind
With a pocket full of lint
Confined to a puzzle where the pieces don't fit
Stare into a broken mirror
Reflecting shards of fear
Daydreamer
Now's your time
I refuse to die here

I refuse to die here

I see a prison of a city, destined for collapse
I see the worker bees buzzing in circles
Fighting over scraps
I see a concrete garden
Of lead and steel trees
I see the clouds swell with synthetic disease

A visionless man can't balance the scale
The court of conscience slips secrets on the gavel
Written in Braille
Lie just beyond my fingertips

Daydreamer
Rise and shine
Daily deja vu
Yet still surprised
Watch the weary world with greyscale eyes

A millionaire in my mind
With a pocket full of lint
Confined to a puzzle where the pieces don't fit
Stare into a broken mirror
Reflecting shards of fear
Daydreamer
Now's your time
I refuse to die here

I refuse to die here
