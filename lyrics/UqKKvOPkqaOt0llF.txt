Pretty women out walkin' with gorillas down my street
From my window I'm starin' while my coffee goes cold
Look over there (where)
There, there's a lady that I used to know
She's married now or engaged or somethin' so I'm told
Is she really goin' out with him
Is she really gonna take him home tonight
Is she really goin' out with him
'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me
There's somethin' goin' wrong around here
Tonight's the night when I go to all the parties down my street
I wash my hair and I kid myself I look real smooth
Look over there (where)
There, here comes Jeanie with her new boyfriend
They say that looks don't count for much
If so, there goes your proof
Is she really goin' out with him
Is she really gonna take him home tonight
Is she really goin' out with him
'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me
There's somethin' goin' wrong around here
Around here
But if looks could kill
There's a man there who's marked down as dead
'Cause I've had my fill
Listen you, take your hand from her hand
I get so mean around this scene
Hey, hey, hey
Is she really goin' out with him
Is she really gonna take him home tonight
Is she really goin' out with him
'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me
There's somethin' goin' wrong around here
Around here
Somethin' goin' wrong around here
Somethin' goin' wrong around here
Somethin' goin' wrong around here
Somethin' goin' wrong around
