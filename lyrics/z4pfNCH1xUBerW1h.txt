The wind was driving in my face
The smell of prickly pear
(my rival show me my rival)
The milk truck eased into my space
Somebody scream somewhere

I struck a match
Against the door of Anthony's bar and grill
I was the whining stranger
A fool in love
With time to kill

I've got detectives on his case
They filmed the whole charade
(my rival show me my rival)
He's got a scar across his face
He wears a hearing aid

Sure he's a jolly roger
Until he answers for his crime
Yes
I'll match him whim for whim now

I still recall when I first held
Your tiny hand in mine
(my rival show me my rival)
I loved you more than I can tell
But now it's stomping time

Sure he's a jolly roger
Until he answers for his crime
Yes
I'll match him whim for whim now
