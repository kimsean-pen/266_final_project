If you were in my heart
I'll surely not break you
If you were beside me
And my love would take you
I'll keep you in safety
For ever protect you
I'll hide you away from the world you rejected
I'll hide you
I'll hide you

Take my hand, show no fear
Look in my eyes it's perfectly clear
I'll love you, and cover you
Ask me to tell you what I wanna do
I'll hide you away from danger
Danger
Danger
Hide you, hide you?

If you were in my heart
I'll surely not break you
If you were beside me
And my love would take you
I'll keep you in safety
Forever protect you
I'll hide you away from the world you rejected
I'll hide you
I'll hide you

Take my hand, show no fear
Look in my eyes it's perfectly clear
I'll love you, and cover you
Ask me to tell you what I wanna do
I'll hide you away from danger
Danger
Danger
Hide you, hide you?

If you were in my heart
I'll surely not break you
If you were beside me
And my love would take you
I'll keep you in safety
For ever protect you
I'll hide you away from the world you rejected

I'll hide you, I'll hide you

If you were in my heart
I'll surely not break you
If you were beside me
And my love would take you
I'll keep you in safety
Forever protect you
I'll hide you away from the world you rejected
I'll hide you

I'll hide you
