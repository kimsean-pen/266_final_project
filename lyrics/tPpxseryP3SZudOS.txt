I'm sick of all the noise
From the storm in here
I need a little quiet
To get things clear, but
Tell me something true
Or a lie I know
And show me that you're there
And I'm not alone now

So if the right words
Feel like the wrong kind to say
I'll keep my mouth shut, darling
Hope things all work out okay

But there's something wrong
Come on, come on, you know
We just play along
Come on, come on, you know

My war is over right
When my heart is spent
Though you know they overwrite
With the best intents, so
Tomorrow is a day
Like this gone mile
I'll try to keep my hopes
From getting up too high now

So if the right words
Feel like the wrong kind to say
I'll keep my mouth shut, darling
Hope things all work out okay

But there's something wrong
Come on, come on, you know
We just play along
Come on, come on, you know

Love is just a word that tights
The gap between you and I
'Cause you know there's something wrong
You've known it for a while, come on

Love is just a word that tights
The gap between you and I
'Cause you know there's something wrong
You've known it for a while, come on

Love is just a word that tights
The gap between you and I
'Cause you know there's something wrong
You've known it for a while, come on

Love is just a word that tights
The gap between you and I
'Cause you know there's something wrong
You've known it for a while, come on

But there's something wrong
Come on, come on, you know
We just play along
Come on, come on, you know

But there's something wrong
Come on, come on, you know
We just play along
Come on, come on, you know
