When was the last time it was just us two?
This busy world gives us an endless list of things to do
I wish there was a place we could go just me and you
Need to carve out precious time despite all we're going through

Call in, say that you're ill
There's no medicine to fill
This love sick void of mine

Let's just turn the world off like a Sunday
All we gotta do is work our bodies
Underneath these sheets there are no worries
When the world outside is scary
Baby, you're my Sanctuary
Baby, you're my Sanctuary

When was the last time we went out for a meal
And drunk too much to forget about work and how it makes us feel?
We can wake up to reality when our hearts have healed
But for now this isolation, it couldn't be more ideal

Call in, say that you're ill
There's no medicine to fill
This love sick void of mine
And now that we've found our space to feed each other's embrace
We can leave our troubles behind

Let's just turn the world off like a Sunday
All we gotta do is work our bodies
Underneath these sheets there are no worries
When the world outside is scary
Baby, you're my Sanctuary
Baby, you're my Sanctuary

In your room oh time it stops
And everything else I forgot
Oh when you leave it starts again
We can just pretend.
Let's just turn the world off like a Sunday
All we gotta do is work our bodies
Underneath these sheets there are no worries
When the world outside is scary
Baby, you're my Sanctuary
Baby, you're my Sanctuary
