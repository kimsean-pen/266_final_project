Mankind in his insatiable search for divine knowledge
Has discarded all biblical teachings
Realizing that the strength of religion is the repression of knowledge
All structures of religion have collapsed
Life prays for death
In the wake of the horror of these revelations
Teaching us
It was never imagined how graphic the reality
That would be known as the end of creation would manifest itself
We believe all this chaos and atrocity
Can be traced back to one single event

We hold these truths to be painfully self-evident
All men are not created equal
Only the strong will prosper
Only the strong will conquer
Only in the darkness of Christ have I realized
God hates us all
God hates us all
