Maybe I'll see you tonight
Maybe I'll see you tonight
Wherever the night takes you
Maybe you'll see me too

The colder it gets, you wont see me anymore
But there's still a chance I might walk to your door

Maybe your timings not right
I wont be seeing you tonight
Maybe I'll see you tonight
Maybe I'll see you tonight
