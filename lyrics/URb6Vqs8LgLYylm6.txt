Now, if she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now
Now, if she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now

It looks so good
She's made out of wood
Just look and see

Now, if she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now
Now, if she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now

It looks so good
She's made out of wood
Just look and see

It's made out of wood
Just look and see now
She ever comes, she ever comes now
Now, now, now, now
She ever, ever, ever comes now
