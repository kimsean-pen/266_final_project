I'm losing my mind today, yo, what the fuck can I say?
I got 3's drugs on the way, c-couple hits then I sway
You better get out the way before I spray that AK
Yo, what the fuck can I say? I'm losing my mind today
Step up in that mosh pit, elbows up, let's bust some lips
Acting like I give a shit, roll it up, take a hit
Smelling like that Mary J, hands on that champagne
Maintain a bad habit, line the cocaine
I'm on another level, a level you can't pass
I'm on some other shit, who knows how long it'll last?
My heart is beating out, this shit just creeps up fast
I'm on another level, a level you can't pass

I'm on another level, I'm on another level, I'm on another level
Li'l bitch
I'm on another level, I'm on another level, I'm on another level
Shit
I'm on another level, I'm on another level, I'm on another level
I'm on another level, I'm on another level, I'm on another level

I got a modern persona made of cocaine marijuana
Fuck you bitch-ass primadonnas, gonna b-b-break you down
I got a whole lot of vengeance deep inside of every sentence
Yeah, I'm just another menace sent to b-b-break you down
And I feel it now, breaking down every time I bleed 'em out
Sixty, six, six, suffocating every count
And I should run, but I don't; let me tell you why I won't
When the devil takes your hand, let me show you where he roams
I'm so fucking dope
And I'm cleaner than the bottom of a sack of coke
And these motherfuckers talk, but they always choke
Like they're hanging at the bottom of a six-foot rope
Can't stop now, nope, gotta keep going
You can sober up, I'm gonna keep on blowing
Gonna tear it up, gonna burn it down
Then drop that fucking beat now

I'm on another level, I'm on another level, I'm on another level
Li'l bitch
I'm on another level, I'm on another level, I'm on another level
Shit
I'm on another level, I'm on another level, I'm on another level
I'm on another level, I'm on another level, I'm on another level

Here I sit, in Sunset and Vine
With an empty bottle and a drinking fine
No woe is me 'cause I ain't got time
Too cold to feel, and I'mma take what's mine
So fuck this club, I'mma rush the line
Gonna get kicked out, gonna wreck some wine
And at 5 AM, I'mma make the climb
I'mma take a piss off the Hollywood sign

I'm on another level, I'm on another level, I'm on another level
Hahaha
I'm on another level, I'm on another level, I'm on another level
Shit
I'm on another level, I'm on another level, I'm on another level
I'm on another level, I'm on another level, I'm on another level
