When dawn breaks see it in your eyes,
they see straight superheroes disguise x4

You can go to sleep now baby,

You can go to sleep now baby i got the world outside,
you can go to sleep now girl i got the world outside x2

Because im sleeping, but your still awake x4

I'm sleeping, but your still awake
