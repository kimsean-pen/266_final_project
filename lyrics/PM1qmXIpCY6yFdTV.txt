What can I say?
What can I do?

Three a.m. It's me again
And wouldn't you know
Things would have to end this way

I did my best
The perfect guest
Knew when to go
Perfect you knew when to stay

Come on, tell me
That you're lovely, dear
I've been feelin' down some too

After all this time
Now ain't it clear
I've been waiting just for you

What can I say?
Oh, to make you know, baby
What can I do?
Ooh, to show you that I care
What can I say?
Got to have your number, baby
What can I do do, ooh wee

Can't you see the people?
Just stop and stare
Don't it make you wonder why
I just happened to be standing there
Can't you see it in my eyes?

What can I say?
Ooh, you got me
Actin' like a fool, girl
What can I do?
Ooh stop makin' like
A little schoolgirl

What can I say?
Could be your lucky day, baby
What can I do?
Ooh, talk, oh, talk to me, girl

What can I say?
Oh, to make you know baby
What can I do?
Oh, to show you that I care

What can I say?
Oh, I'm down on my knees
What can I do?
Please, please, please
What can I say?

What can I do?
Ooh, what can I do?
What can I say?
