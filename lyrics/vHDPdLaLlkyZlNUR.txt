Wind
and my body is underneath the sea
I can't breathe if
I can't breathe if your'e not with me

Like rain
has gotta fall so the roses grow again
And a fire
ain't a fire without flames

I am drawn to you you

We're fallin in
fallin out
but were gravity gravity ey

We're rising up
going down ey

Can't live without
I can't live without your life

We're falling in
falling out
but were gravity gravity ey

But were gravity gravity ey

Shade
couldn't hide anywhere without the light
And the stars they
need their darkness
to survive

I need you you you yooouu

We're fallin in
fallin out
but we're gravity gravity ey

We're rising up
going down
but we're gravity gravity ey

Can't live without
I can't live without your life

Were falling in
falling out
But we're gravity gravity ey

But we're gravity gravity ey

But we're gravity gravity ey

I'll never let you fall
fall down into the dark
if you blow away
I pull you back to the ground

Won't ever let you down
won't ever let you down
down

Cause we're gravity
Can't live without
I can't live without your live

Were falling in
falling out
but we're gravity gravity ey
