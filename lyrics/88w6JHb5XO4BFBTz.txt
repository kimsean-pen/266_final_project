I'm the one
I've been here for you all along
I'm the one
Whose shoulder you've been crying on

Nice guys finish last no one knows as good as me
We're just good friends and you come for me for sympathy
You tell me that I'm not your type
But still you call me late at night
Everytime he picks a fight
After all he's said and and all he's done

I'm the one
I've been here for you all along
I'm the one
Who's shoulder you've been crying on

He's a total dick that's the truth and you know I'm right
From everything you say there's no way he'll ever do you right
You love a man who treats you wrong
You think you'll change him but you're wrong
He'll use you then he'll say so long
After all he's said and all he's done

I'm the one
I've been here for you all along
I'm the one
Who's shoulder you've been crying on

I'm the one who wants you more than anything
You don't feel the same way you made it clear to me
But I'll stand my ground and maybe you'll hear what I'm saying
After all I've said and all I've done
I'm the one
I've been here for you all along
I'm the one
Who's shoulder you've been crying on
I'm the one
