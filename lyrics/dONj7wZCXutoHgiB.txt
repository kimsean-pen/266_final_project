It was magical, beautiful
I didn't know how it all began
One day, twenty four hours
It didn't turn out how I planed

'Cause I did not expect to feel the way
The way I do, from a single day
And both of us we knew we could not stay
You had yours, I had mine
Separate lives, but at least we had the night

I was in love for a day
Love
In a way
Love
Can't explain
Why you went away

Love
Its a shame
Love
You didnt stay
Love
With me
(uh uh uh)

Forgettable, incredible
I didn't know how to handle it
I was unprepared
Maybe a little scared
Of something I may never get
Ooh yeah

I was never one to believe
Love at first sight
Could get to me

And maybe if these feelings stay the same
I'll be with you again (someday)
But baby either way

I was in love for a day
Love
In a way
Love
Can't explain
Why you went away

Love
It's a shame
Love
You didn't stay
(you didn't stay)
Love
With me
(uh uh uh)

And maybe someday we will reconnect
It was so powerful I can't believe it's over yet
The way you play back in my mind makes it hard to forget you
(you, you)
I know you have your life, and I've got mine
But someday maybe we'll re-collide
But until then
Baby I know
(I know)

I was in love for a day
Love
In a way
Love
Can't explain
Why you went away

Love
Its a shame
Love
You didn't stay
(you didn't stay)
Love
With me
(uh uh uh)

If you hear me
If you hear me halla

If you hear me
If you hear me halla

Love
In a way
Love
Can't explain
Why you went away

Love
Its a shame
Love
You didn't stay
Love
With me
With me
With me
With me
