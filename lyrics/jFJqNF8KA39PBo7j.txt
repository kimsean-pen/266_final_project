Decades to decide I need decision
Decades to decide I will never be satisfied
With how I have been living
I must find and capture an astonished man
Hold him till he knows he is forgiven

You don't look for me
But I will look for you
Without a wish to see
Anybody new
You don't look for me
How I will look for you
Without a wish to see
Anybody new

I wake
So worried, worried
Yet I won't
Hurry, Hurry
What is the wait
The wait of a lonely man
I wake
So worried, worried
Yet I won't
Hurry, hurry
Fast asleep
As only the careless can

You don't look for me
How I will look for you
Without a wish to see
Anybody new
You don't look for me
How I will look for you
Without a wish to see
Anybody new

I wake
So worried, worried
Yet I won't
Hurry, Hurry
What is the wait
The wait of a lonely man
I wake
So worried, worried
Yet I won't
Hurry, hurry
Fast asleep
As only the careless can

How far gone, how far flown
How far flung could I be
When all along, all along
You have belonged to me
How far gone, how far flown
How far flung could I be
When all along, all along
You have belonged to me

Decades to decide I need decision
I must find and capture an astonished man
Hold him till he knows he is forgiven
