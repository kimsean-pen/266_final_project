Another west coast Saturday
And the shore gives me a crash and it's gone
Just like the midnight getaway
When I ducked into a cabin, pushed on
She had a pretty face silhouette
And she told me that she liked how I kissed
What's the point, point anyway?
Dreaming of this

'Cause it's gone, in the past
But we'll always be together in the photograph
Know our love didn't last
But we'll always be together in the photograph
No, I won't forget all the things she said
And the way she looked at me that night
'Cause it's stuck under glass
Yeah, we'll always be together in the photograph

Books on the bed frame, countertop
She had papers on the dresser and drawers
Still hear her 'don't you ever stop'
We were laying in a room on the floor
She had a dark side underneath
But I never saw it peeking until
Sometimes she dances through my thoughts
But I know instead

That it's gone, in the past
But we'll always be together in the photograph
Know our love didn't last
But we'll always be together in the photograph
No, I won't forget all the things she said
And the way she looked at me that night
'Cause it's stuck under glass
Yeah, we'll always be together in the photograph

She's not the one, hey, woah
But I think about it now and then
She's not the one, hey, woah
When I close my eyes I see her face
But still, I know she's not the one
I think about it now and then

But it's gone, in the past
But we'll always be together in the photograph
Know our love didn't last
But we'll always be together in the photograph
No, I won't forget all the things she said
And the way she looked at me that night
'Cause it's stuck under glass
Yeah, we'll always be together in the photograph
It's better like that
