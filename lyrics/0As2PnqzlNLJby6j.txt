I am bongo crazed with the crazy beat
Makes me stamp and shout
Get up on my feet
All the boys go wild with the bongo chill
Chase the girls around for a bongo thrill

Forget the beach
Party with no stuff
'Cause it's kind of fun
But it's not enough
Let the boys go wild and the boys don't miss
When they grab the girls for a bongo kiss

Surfing's not too cool
Just what can you do?
Standing on a board and the water's smooth
All the girls go wild, start to shake their seeds
When the boys start to play their bongo beat

I am bongo crazed with the crazy beat
Makes me stamp and shout
Get up on my feet
All the boys go wild with the bongo chill
Chase the girls around for a bongo thrill

Forget the beach
Party with no stuff
'Cause it's kind of fun
But it's not enough
But the boys go wild and the boys don't miss
When they chase the girls for a bongo kiss

Surfing's not too cool
Just what can you do?
Standing on a board and the water's smooth
All the girls go wild, start to shake their seeds
When the boys start to play their bongo beat
