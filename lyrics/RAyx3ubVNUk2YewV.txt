I can see some of them crying,
I can see all of them screaming,
I can't imagine how they're feeling,
Is this the sound of the devil laughing?
I wonder why the innocent must be the unwilling victims
I don't know what's going on in my mind
But I believe something big is hidden deep in the sky

Come back, the table's been set tonight
Have you gone over to the light, is this really our time?
Will you be watching over me from up above
Wherever you are, I'll be waiting right here

Do they care? Do they cry? Do they sleep tonight?
I'm alright, rest in peace right on the other side
Do they care? Do they cry? Do they sleep tonight?
I'm alright, rest in peace right on the other side

I still feel your soul, I can hear your cries
Don't let this be the last time I see you smile

Come back, the table's been set tonight
Have you gone over to the light, is this really our time?
Will you be watching over me from up above
Wherever you are, I'll be waiting right here

Let them stay, let them stay for just another one more day,
Let them wave goodbye before they're gone and washed away
Let them wave goodbye before they're gone
Let them stay for just another one more day

Please come back, and take me with you
Will you watch over me every day from wherever you are
Your spirit will live on
Forever and ever
