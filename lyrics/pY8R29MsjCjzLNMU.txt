He imagines his life in a stream
What he sees are minnows which flinch with each drop of the rain

He concludes that it all is a dream
Can't accept that sometimes life is just destined for pain

I can't do anything
I am nothing
Our lives are meaningless
Swim in the sunshine

Hanging onto the films in his eyes
Undermines his beauty he's capable of seeing more
Cooling downpour, please wash me away
And I find I'm no one, I'm feeling more love than before

I can't do anything
I am nothing
Our lives are meaningless
Swim in the sunshine

I can't do anything
I am nothing
Our lives are meaningless
Swim in the sunshine

I am nothing
I'm no one
It's wonderful

I am nothing
I'm no one
It's wonderful
