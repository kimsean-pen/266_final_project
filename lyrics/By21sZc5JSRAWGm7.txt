I don't care about the story
I don't care about the myth
I don't care how you see my life
You haven't witnessed it
Use fear as a weapon
And pity as a whip
Convince everyone around
That I'm a piece of sh...

Enter scene, enter Judas
Now give me a kiss
You sold me out
Hold on, wait, what did I miss?
Gossip gets you off
But you couldn't resist, you couldn't resist

Make me a sinner
Because you paint the picture
Buy your believers
You couldn't resist, you couldn't resist
We're on the same side

Friendly fire, honest liar
Friendly fire, honest liar
Friendly fire, honest liar
Friendly fire, honest liar

Exit scene, dim the lights
Now here comes the twist
You did this for me?
Hold on, wait, what did I miss?
Your good intentions?
What do you get out of this, get out of this?

Make me a sinner
Because you paint the picture
Buy your believers
You couldn't resist, you couldn't resist
We're on the same side

Friendly fire, honest liar
Friendly fire, honest liar
Friendly fire, honest liar
Friendly fire, honest liar

Does it make you feel alive?
Does it make you feel so high?
How does it feel? How does it feel?

So you think it's your place
And you think you're so brave
Shit slinging
I'll tell you now what I see
A child's insecurities projecting
From the sidelines, a critic
A voice that won't admit it
That you have never risked it
How vicarious the cynic
My Judas, my brother
My Judas, my brother

Does it make you feel so high?
Does it make you feel so high?
Does it make you feel alive?
Does it make you feel so high?
How does it feel? How does it feel?

Friendly fire, honest liar
Friendly fire, honest liar
