Deceitful eyes, she's got those come get me thighs
she only knows how low that she can go
She speaks the lines that can control my mind
Wherever she goes I know my eyes follow
She blew a kiss, I swear that it was meant
only for me, then spoke with her body
her only goal is just to take control
And I can't believe that I can't tell her no

That girl I can't take her
should have known she was a heartbreaker
that girl I can't take her
should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
should have seen it coming heartbreaker
that girl I can't take her
should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker

She plays a game with such an innocent face
I didn't know heartbreaking was her case
Her actions confess and put me through the test
I was surprised that I was caught inside
Now she's thinking that I will never know
ans she'll keep playing until I let her go
But I hope in time that she will finally realize
I'm onto her game and she'll get played the same

That girl I can't take her
should have known she was a heartbreaker(all the lie thing)
that girl I can't take her(that girl)
should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker(don't you do it to me)
That girl I can't take her(hoo, doggon)
should have seen it coming heartbreaker (should have seen it commin all the lie thing)
that girl I can't take her(hoo)
see right through her she's a heartbreaker(doggon, hoo)

I never thought that I would stop dreamin' about you, Stop being without you
But everyone told me so, to stop caring about you, and start being without you
but I'll find a way to go and start doin' without you, and stop talkin' aboout you
and what will she say?
She will say I was the man that got away
