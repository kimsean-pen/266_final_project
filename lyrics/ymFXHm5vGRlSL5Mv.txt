Miss Madonna, won't you give me a kiss?
One of your soft sweet lagrimas
Miss Madonna, won't you give me a kiss?
One of your soft sweet lagrimas
Oh, Miss Madonna, won't you please give me a kiss?
Give me one of those soft sweet lagrimas
'Cause I felt your pain
When your - your baby was slain
I tossed some roses to perfume his grave
Oh, Miss Madonna, won't you let me underneath your halo?
'Cause it's raining hard
Raining hard in this abyss

Miss Madonna, won't you give me a kiss?
One of your soft sweet lagrimas
Miss Madonna, won't you give me a kiss?
One of your soft sweet lagrimas

Oh, Miss Madonna, where you goin' after church?
In that preacher's car
You know I won't tell nobody
That you've been smoking cigars
I won't tell nobody, tell nobody
That you've been smoking cigars

Miss Madonna, won't you give me a kiss?
One of your soft sweet lagrimas
Miss Madonna, won't you give me a kiss?
One of your soft sweet lagrimas
