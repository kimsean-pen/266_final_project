Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying
Brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today

Father, father
We don't need to escalate
War is not the answer
'cause only love, can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today

Picket lines and picket signs
Don't you punish me with brutality
Talk to me, so you can see
What's going on, hey yeah
What's going on
I wanna know what's going on

Hey hey yeah yeah
Mother, mother, mother,
Everybody says that we're wrong, mmm
Oh, but who are they to judge us
Simply because your hair is long
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some loving here today

Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me
So you can see
What's going on, hey hey hey
What's going on
I wanna know what's going on
