Weve spent countless hours
Learning how to loose
So what happens now?
Are there choices left to choose?

Oh lover, what we gonna do?
Tell me how we gonna make it thru

No I'm not renound
For my wise decisions
And i find it hard
To stay true to my intuition

Oh lover, what we gonna do?
Tell me how we gonna make it thru
Times running so ragged and so wild
Oh I just wanna try and make it with you

Oh lover, what we gonna do?
Tell me how we gonna make it thru
Times running so rugged and so wild
Oh i just wanna try and make it with you
