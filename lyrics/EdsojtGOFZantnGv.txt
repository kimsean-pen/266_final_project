Suppose I should hate it so
Yet I can smell saliva
Palamino set afloat
Yet I can smell saliva
Hides it very well
As a baby

Has a playmate
Yeah baby
Yeah guess it's blown
Hides it very well
As a baby

Telling me words in Turkish
Your nosiness, your belly
Frantically or mimicly
Your nosiness, your belly
Has your mother gone
as a baby as a baby

Has a playmate
We are helpless as babies
As a baby
As a baby
Hides it very well
As a baby

Has a playmate
Has your mother gone
Reach out your hand
He seldom will
And a memory

Go out
He seldom will
Go out
He seldom will

Smart you should heal soon
An eagle spares your bedroom
Palominoes as we flow
An eagle spares your bedroom
Some forget where to go
They know fear again
