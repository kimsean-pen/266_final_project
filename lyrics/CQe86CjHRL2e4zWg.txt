You left me
On a Sunday
And I still remember
That day in September

Yeah you left me
On a Sunday
Made sure there's no way
To forget that day

Say hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Loving you is a hard price to pay
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Watching the smoke
Rise from the ashtray
Filling the room with pain
It's still in my veins

Can't feel at home
Cuz it's so lonely
So cold and so grey
Since you left that day
You know, you know

Even if the sun rises and the world moves on everyday
Hey, hey, hey
I will always be waiting for you to come back home to me
To me, to me, to me hey

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Loving you is a hard price to pay
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Loving you is a hard price to pay
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Wake me up
From this nightmare
Is this even true
Am I without you

Love's not fair
Oh, I have learned that
Just never knew, that
I'll be losing you
You know, you know

Even if the sun rises and the world moves on everyday
Hey, hey, hey
I will always be waiting for you to come back home to me
To me, to me, to me hey

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Loving you is a hard price to pay
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Loving you is a hard price to pay
