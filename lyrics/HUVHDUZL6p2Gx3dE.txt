I'm far from home, no place to go
But I don't feel cold
I've been so blind, just lost my mind
But all I have lost, I find

Your face reminds me of these games
The memories don't erase
I'll never be the same anymore
I'm on the highest stop with no control

A new dawn
I open my eyes, do you remember me
I carried on
For all of these years, you've been my fantasy

I'm far from home, no place to go
But I don't feel cold
I've been so blind, just lost my mind
But all I have lost, I find

Your face reminds me of these games
The memories don't erase
I'll never be the same anymore
I'm on the highest stop with no control

I'm far from home
No place to go
I'm far from home

(I'm far from home)
(I've been so blind, just lost my mind)
