I'm on a high, on a high
there's nothing more to it

You're the sea and the sky
and the blue that runs through it, yeah

And there are some who say there are so many things I need
So I run or I fight and I crawl or I scream and I bleed, I bleed, I bleed

It's a lie, It's a lie, don't you believe it
If you're fine then you're fine, its all how you see it
Or there never will be no conspiracy of happiness

I'm on a high, on a high
there's nothing more to it
I have the sun it's a star
why should I refuse it

And there are so many reasons I could give you why I should be down
there's not enough money, or time and my love you're not...
Around, Around, Around

It's a lie, It's a lie don't you believe it
If you're fine then you're fine, it's all how you see it
Or there never will be no conspiracy of happiness

You're alive, You're alive, where else could you hear me
You are fine, You are fine, nothing worth fearing
Or there never will be no conspiracy of happiness

I'm on a high, on a high
We are the sea and the sky
I'm on a high, on a high
I'm on a high...

It's a lie, It's a lie don't you believe it
Cause I've tried, and I've tried, can't really see it
Well I'm trapped inside my conspiracy of happiness

Said I was yours, you were mine, but I didn't really mean it
And I lied, and I lied, wish you hadn't seen it
Now I'm trapped inside my conspiracy of happiness

I'm on a high, on a high, there's nothing more to it, yeah
