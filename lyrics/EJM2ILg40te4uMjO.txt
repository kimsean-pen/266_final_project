Memories are just where you laid them
Drag the waters till the depths give up their dead
What did you expect to find?
Was there something you left behind?
Don't you remember anything I said when I said

Don't fall away
And leave me to myself
Don't fall away
And leave love bleeding in my hands, in my hands again
Leave love bleeding in my hands, in my hands
Love lies bleeding

Oh, hold me now I feel contagious
Am I the only place that you've left to go?
She cries her life is like
Some movie black and white
Dead actors faking lines
Over and over and over again she cries

Don't fall away
And leave me to myself
Don't fall away
And leave love bleeding in my hands, in my hands again
Leave love bleeding in my hands, in my hands
Love lies bleeding

And I wanted you turned away
You don't remember, but I do
You never even tried

Don't fall away
And leave me to myself
Don't fall away
And leave love bleeding in my hands, in my hands again
Leave love bleeding in my hands, in my hands again
Leave love bleeding in my hands, in my hands again
