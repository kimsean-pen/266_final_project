There's so many of you girls, I hear you been runnin'
From the beautiful queen that you can be becomin?
You can look in my palm and see the storm comin?
Read the book of my life and see I've overcome it
Just because the length of your hair ain't long
And they often criticize you for your skin tone
Go on and hold your head high? cause you a pretty woman
Get your runway stride honed and keep it goin?
Girl, live your life
I just wanna be myself
Don't sweat girl be yourself
Follow me, follow me, follow me, girl be yourself
That? s why I be myself and I grew to love it
(Work your thing out, out, out)
Let? em get mad

They gon? hate anyway, don't you get that?
(Work your thing out, out, out)
Doesn't matter if you go along with their plan
(Work your thing out, out, out)
They'll never be happy? cause they're not happy with themselves
(Work your thing out, out, out)
(Ah, ah, work what you got)
I'm talkin? about things that I know

(Ah, ah, work what you got)
It's okay show yourself some love

Don't worry about who's sayin? what

Work what you got

Feelin? great because the light's on me
Celebratin? the things that everyone told me would never happen
But God has put his hands on me
And ain't a man alive could ever take it from me
Workin? with what I got, I gotta keep on
Takin? care of myself, I wanna live long
Ain't never ashamed what life did to me
Wasn't afraid to change? cause it was good for me
