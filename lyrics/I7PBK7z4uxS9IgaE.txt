Oh, oh yea, yea, yea, yea
Open up your heart to me
And say what's on your mind
Oh yes
I know that we have been through
So much pain
But I still need you
In my life this time

An' I need you tonight
I need you right now
I know deep within my heart
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
I really need you tonight

Oh, I figured out what to say to you
Hmm, sometimes the word they
They come out so wrong
Oh yes they do
And I know it's time that
You will understand
Then what we have is so right this time

An' I need you tonight
I need you right now
I know deep within my heart
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right

All those endless times
We tried to make it
Last forever more
An' baby I know I need you
Oh oh yea

I know deep within my heart
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
Really need you
Ho oh ho

(I need you tonight)
I need you, oh I need you baby
(I need you right now)
It's gotta be this, it's gotta be this
(I know deep within my heart)
No, it doesn't matter if it's wrong or it's right
All I know is baby
I really need you tonight
Ooh
