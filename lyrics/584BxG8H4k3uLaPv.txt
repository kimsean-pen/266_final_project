Sometimes it's gonna be days like this
Sometimes it's gonna be rain like this
Sometimes you're gonna feel pain like this
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it
'Cause when you feeling low
And you can't get no lower
That's when you know your close
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it
Woke up in the morning
It's another cloudy day but
That never mattered too much to me, hey
'Cause it's still a new beginning
And I know I got it in me
Had my share of ups and downs
But now I know I can do anything
Sometimes it's gonna be days like this
Sometimes it's gonna be rain like this
Sometimes you're gonna feel pain like this
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it
'Cause when you feeling low
And you can't get no lower
That's when you know your close
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it
Give it to me!
Some people think I'm aggressive
'Cause I know what I want but
That never mattered too much to me
Show me some body with no goal
Show me some body with no control
'Cause life is for living
So go and get it
But when times get rough
Remember nothing's for free
Sometimes it's gonna be days like this
Sometimes it's gonna be rain like this
Sometimes you're gonna feel pain like this
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it
'Cause when you feeling low
And you can't get no lower
That's when you know your close
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it
Oh gotta get it
Na na na na na
Hey hey hey
Sometimes the road may seem too far
You never really know for sure
If you're ever gonna make it, yeah, heah
Sometimes the end may seem so far
You never really know for sure
If you got the strength to make it
But you gotta remember
Sometimes it's gonna be days like this
Sometimes it's gonna be rain like this
Sometimes you're gonna feel pain like this
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it
'Cause when you feeling low
And you can't get no lower
That's when you know your close
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it
Days like this
Rain like this
Feel pain like this
Gotta work hard for it
Gotta work hard for it
Ha ha ha, ooh ah
I do it 'cause I love it
