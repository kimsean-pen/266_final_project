The rivers of Babylon flow
And fall
And carry away

Jesus is alone on earth
Not merely with no one to feel and share His agony
But with no one even to know of it
Heaven and he are the only ones to know
Jesus is in a garden
Not of delight
Like the first Adam
Who there fell and took with him all mankind
But of agony
Where He has saved Himself and all mankind

He suffers this anguish and abandonment in the horror of the night

Jesus will be in agony until the end of the world
There must be no resting in the meantime

To Eden with me you will not leave
To live in my cottage of crazy crooked Eves
In your own heavy home
Take care of this night
When you let your little cat in
Turn on the light
Something scurries behind
And finds a cozy place to stare
Something sent to you from paradise
Paradisicallysomewhere
Tongues flouring
They leap out laughing
Lapping
Disappear
