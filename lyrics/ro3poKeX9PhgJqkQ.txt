You said that it's too late
It's not the perfect time
You told me "You are great,
why can't you be just mine?"
Baby...

You can break my heart in one or two
or more than a thousand pieces
You can bring me down
You can take me high and fly and fly
Oh boy, we still have
One last dance to dance
Let's take it as a bet
Let's give us one last chance

Cause you and I
We are meant to be
Whatever the future might
Choose for us to see
Again...

You can break my heart in one or two
or in a zillion pieces
You can bring me down
You can take me high
Oh boy, we still have
One last dance
Let's take it
Let's give us one last chance

I'm not as nice
As you thought I were
I'm only fine
I'm only what you heard
There we go...

Even though
You like me so
You told me no,
just no, no
Once more...

You can break my heart in one or two
or in a zillion pieces
You can bring me down
You can take me high
Oh boy, we still have
One last dance
Let's take it
Let's give us one last chance

I guess this song
Is sung off-key
That's how I see
this sweet funny melody
The end
