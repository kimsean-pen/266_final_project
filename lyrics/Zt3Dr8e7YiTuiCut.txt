Sometimes in life
You gotta do what you gotta do
When you gotta stand by
'cause all around the world
Don't forget, sky is the limit

I got moves, i got love
I got everything you want
I can dream, i can fly
Girl you need for a ride

My love round, my love buzz
Don't you stare at my shoes
If you think i'm just cool
Girl you need for a ride

Fricko fricko you're freackin' it x3
But i like it
Fricko fricko you're freackin' it x3
But i like it

O o o x3
But i like it

O o o x3
But i like it

O o o x6
Caught to me in a thing
'cause my love is a game

I will treat you the same
And everthing's all right

I just want you to know
'cause i wanna go slow
If you want it let go
And everything's all right

O o o x6

Fricko fricko you're freackin' it x3
But i like it
Fricko fricko you're freackin' it x3
But i like it
But i like it...
Fricko fricko you're freackin' it x3
But i like it
Fricko fricko you're freackin' it x3
But i like it
O o o x3
But i like it
O o o x3
But i like
