I feel the colors sharper than the knives that cut away at me
Are you the? the feelings taking over me

I don't know if I really want to come down
Feel the scales tipping towards a meltdown
I don't know if I really want to come down
Split in two and gunning for a show down

The length of time spinning faster
I'm divided by the face of the moon
Reflective? meets in the middle
? everywhere I think I use

I don't know if I really want to come down
Feel the scales tipping towards a meltdown
I don't know if I really want to come down
Split in two and gunning for a show down

I don't know if I really want to come down
Feel the scales slipping towards a meltdown
Down, down, down, down
