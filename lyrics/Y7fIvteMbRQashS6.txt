We own the night
We own the night
So let's turn it, turn it, turn it
And reach the other side
We're flying high
Flying so high
And let's turn it, turn it, turn it up
Tonight we're dancing in the sky
You heard the legends, have you?
But you're miles away from the sun
You have to take me to heaven
Turn it, turn it, turn it up
When I feel your heart beating faster
Beating faster than the drums
You have to take me to heaven
Turn it, turn it, turn it up
Turn it up, up, up
You know I like it up
Turn it up, up, up
And also turn it, turn it, turn it up, up, up
It's going down tonight
So turn it up, up, up
Up, up, up
Turn it up, up, up
You know I like it up
Turn it up, up, up
And also turn it, turn it, turn it up, up, up
It's going down tonight
So turn it up, up, up
Up, up, up
We own the night
We own the light
So let's turn it, turn it, turn it up
Tonight it's only you and I
He owns the stars
Shine like the stars
So let's turn it, turn it, turn it up
Tonight the world, the world is ours
You heard the legends, have you?
But you're miles away from the sun
You have to take me to heaven
Turn it, turn it, turn it up
When I feel your heart beating faster
Beating faster than the drums
You have to take me to heaven
Turn it, turn it, turn it up
Turn it up, up, up
You know I like it up
Turn it up, up, up
And also turn it, turn it, turn it up, up, up
It's going down tonight
So turn it up, up, up
Up, up, up
Turn it up, up, up
You know I like it up
Turn it up, up, up
And also turn it, turn it, turn it up, up, up
It's going down tonight
So turn it up, up, up
Up, up, up
You heard the legends, have you?
You have to take me to heaven
When I feel your heart beating faster
Turn it, turn it
So turn it up, let's turn it up
So turn it up, up, up
You know I like it up
Turn it up, up, up
And also turn it, turn it, turn it up, up, up
