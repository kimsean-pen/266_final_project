Can you believe?
Can you believe in my heart?
I'm electrical
I told you so
Once by my side
You'll rather slip away

Could you believe?
Could you believe in my heart?
I have told you so
I'm electrical
I've found myself
I don't wanna sleep away

Can you believe?
Can you believe in my heart?
I'm electrical
I told you so
Once by my side
You'll rather slip away

Could you believe?
Could you believe in my heart?
I have told you so
I'm electrical
I've found myself
I don't wanna sleep away

I'm heading out I'm flying solo
I'll give myself away to what you don't know
Everything in wider angles
Instead of "no–no's"
I'll come and go

You wanna top that
You wanna talk back
You want a flawless beautiful soul
You wanna top that
You wanna talk back
You want a flawless beautiful soul

You wanna top that
You wanna talk back
You want a flawless beautiful soul
You want a flawless beautiful soul

End of conversation
No more communication
The end

I'm heading out I'm flying solo
I'll give myself away to what you don't know
Everything in wider angles
Instead of "no–no's"
I'll come and go

I'm heading out I'm flying solo
I'll give myself away to what you don't know
Everything in wider angles
Instead of "no–no's"
I'll come and go

Can you believe?
Can you believe in my heart?
I'm electrical
I told you so
Once by my side
You'll rather slip away

Could you believe?
Could you believe in my heart?
I have told you so
I'm electrical
I've found myself
I don't wanna sleep away
