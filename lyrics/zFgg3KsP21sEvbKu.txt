i was walking with my neck out
some ways i wish i was
i was walking with my neck out
in some ways that i wish that i was
out on the bevel of sound
it sounds like everything else
you'll know it when you hear it
cuz you know the way my voice felt
ignore my tone and everything
i sing, i sing for me
ignore the phone on your bed
it rings, it rings, it rings
shirt collar wringing me out
and my collarbone got all red
and already severing prose i wrote
so i sing instead
i hold you, put your neck out
tell me the ways you wish you were
keep your confidence sound
your hook, my eye, my spur
so when i went to hang out
i hung behind your eyes
but my eyes still flicker with doubt
quickly, oh i can't decide
i'm tapped out
don't it always seem to go
that you could hold it right in your hands
collapsing and still not know
your hands' collapse and still not know
not know

say what it is
say how it is with everybody i know
i got no temper for that
i send you this
cadmium red, one for every layer i shed
and i shed one layer for this

say what it is
it's so impossible
but if i just say what it is
it tends to sublimate away

when i was looking to drop my life away

more every year
i shine a light on edges i tried to unfeel
but we gotta do better than that
some sorting out

so i'll be sitting on the outskirts if you wanna talk about it
things in there were just getting so loud

say what it is
it's so impossible
but if i just say what it is
it tends to sublimate away
when i was looking to drop my life away
