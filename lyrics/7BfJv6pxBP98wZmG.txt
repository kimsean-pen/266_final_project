In a quantity of light
You can search for all of your life
But it's finite

From a sudden burst of sound
The recoil may never be found
It is finite

On and on, on and on
But impervious to calculation
On and on
It's impervious to calculation

Woah, just how far it goes
Nobody knows

In the peaceful warm embrace
The intention shows on your face
But it's finite

From the hate that spurs us on
To the meek and gullible pawn
It is finite

On and on, on and on
It's impervious to calculation
On and on
But impervious to calculation

Woah, just how far it goes

Where the lightning sparked a flash
When precisely did it pass
All delusions went away
As with all the shades of gray
Now i'm left with faulty tools
And a hazy set of rules
And brand new day

In the turbulent conscious stream
The unbearable lightness of being
It is finite

From the universal mass
Constant matters coming to pass
It is finite

On and on, on and on
But impervious to calculation
On and on
It's impervious to calculation

Woah, just how far it goes
Nobody knows
No one knows
Woah, no one knows
No one knows
?
