Am I alone with the thoughts that I have?
I'm afraid that I'm scared of myself
Am I the only one to doubt who I am?
Wish I was someone else

Everytime I try to swim, it pulls me,
pulls me deeper down
Everytime I try to fly, it holds me,
holds me to the groud

It tells me I'm a freak,
drains me,
the monster inside of me
Freak
Save me
The enemy is inside of me

Would be easier to fight someone else
than the war I fight within
It's impossible to hide from yourself
Where do I begin?

Everytime I dare to dream it wakes me,
wakes me with a cry
Everytime I dare to love it hates me,
hates me 'til it dies

It tells me I'm a freak,
drains me,
the monster inside of me
Freak
Save me
The enemy is inside of me

Screaming, laughing, the voice is inside my head
Freak, silent, let go, inside my head

Love me, can you even love at all
show me, show me what I ought to know
Mirror, mirror mirror on the wall
tell me, tell me that I'm beautiful

It tells me I'm a freak,
drains me,
the monster inside of me

Freak
drains me
the monster inside of me
Freak
Save me
The enemy is inside of me

It tells me I'm a freak
