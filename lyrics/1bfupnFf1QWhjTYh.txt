It's Friday night
I'm all alone
I want you to
Call me at home
Any time
You know I'm there
Waiting for you
For you to show
You make me sweat
You know you do
Come to my house
I want you to
You lick your lips
I get excited
The party's on
And you're invited

CHORUS
(It's Friday night) it's Friday night
(It's Saturday night) it's Saturday
(Sunday night) yeah yeah
(it's the weekend) It's the weekend
(It's party time) It's party time
(It's your time) It's time to shine
(It's something) It's something baby
(For the weekend) It's the weekend

You're on the phone
I know who too
But she's a (oh)
You know it's true
My big green eyes
My voluptuous lips
And only I know
What makes you tick
You're feeling me
Don't get it twisted
I'm like a drug
And you're addicted
Keep what we do
Between me and you
No one should know
But me and you

Chorus 2x
