Could you fall and get back up one-thousand times over?
Do you ever feel like someone else?
Over and over

Failure's something I've grown close to for some time
But still, sometimes I get it right

When this all comes crashing down I
will find a safe way out for you my friend
I know things never make sense

I like to pretend I'm not one of them
I pick at this scab- red ink for my pen

Failure's something I've grown close to for some time
But still, sometimes I get it right

When this all comes crashing down I
will find a safe way out for you my friend
I know things never make sense

But neither do I and neither do you
So why bother try?
Why bother try?
Why get it right?
