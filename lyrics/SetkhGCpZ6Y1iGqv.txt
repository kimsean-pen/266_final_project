When there's no one here in the tryouts
Who will live through your first day's trial
Of confusion when your faint and crooked smile
Had to leave
When you're painted like a warrior
Though you know it's a raining war
When the first who spoke, but wasn't really shure
Was your heart
Your fear of the leading light
If they are with you and your heart won't fail
To see through a fearless eye
And know that danger finally goes away
Still you're trying

To be lost like your child again
Claim forever is a close and honest friend
To your ways
Will there be time to harvest rivers
That for so long refused to grow
All the little things you need to build a home
For your love
Your fear of the leading light
If they are with you and your heart won't fail
To see through a fearless eye
And know that danger finally goes away
Still you're trying
But there's no leaving now
