When does the show start?
When does it all get moving?
I feel something in the air
I don't know what I'm doing
Though the shapes are familiar
In the shadows of quiet rooms
I don't feel like I'm really there
Wait for me I'll be there soon

For now, just talk, oh please just talk
And say anything, just say anything at all
Just talk my love, just talk and
Say anything, just say anything at all

I've got my heart beating in the right place
I know it's just the wrong time
But when it starts, I'm not gonna miss a second no
Don't know 'bout love, but it feels like the right place to be
And it's the right time
But when it starts, I'll have to go

When does the show start?
Over strings and a drum-roll
I'll be there for the light show
On a hill below it all
Where does the road start
To where I think that I'm going
Don't tell me I missed the turn
Without someway of knowing

For now, just talk, oh please just talk
And say anything, just say anything at all
Just talk my love, just talk and
Say anything, just say anything at all

I've got my heart beating in the right place
I know it's just the wrong time
But when it starts, I'm not gonna miss a second no
Don't know 'bout love, but it feels like the right place to be
And it's the right time
But when it starts, I'll have to go

I'll have to go
I'll have to go
I'll have to go
I'll have to go
