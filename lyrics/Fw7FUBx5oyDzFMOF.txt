Left the city, my momma she said, "Don't come back home
These kids 'round killin each other, they lost they minds, they gone
They quittin' school, making babies and can barely read
Some gone off to that war, Lord have mercy on them
One, two, three, four, your cousins is 'round here sellin' dope
While they're daddy, your uncle, is walking 'round strung out
Babies with babies, and their tears keep burning
While their dreams go down the drain now"

(While their dreams go down the drain)
Are we really living or just walking dead now?
(Are we walking dead now?)
Or dreaming of a hope riding the wings of angels?

The way we live, the way we die
What a tragedy, I'm so terrified
Day dreamers, please wake up
We can't sleep no more

Love don't make no sense, ask your neighbor
The winds have changed, it seems that they've abandoned us
The truth hurts, and so does yesterday
What good is love if it burns bright and explodes in flames?

I thought every living thing had love, but uh...

Are we really living or just walking dead now?
(Are we walking dead now?)
Or dreaming of a hope riding the wings of angels?

The way we live, the way we die
What a tragedy, I'm so terrified
Day dreamers, please wake up
We can't sleep no more

I've seen them shootin' up funerals in they Sunday clothes (Yah)
And spending money on spinners but won't pay college loans (Yah)
And all you gangers and bangers rolling dice and taking lives in a smokey dark
Lord have mercy on you (Yah)
Teacher, teacher please reach those girls in them videos (Live your life)
The little girls just broken Queens, confusing bling for soul
Danger, there's danger, when you take off your clothes
All your dreams go down the drain, girl

Are we really living or just walking dead now?
Or dreaming of a hope riding the wings of angels?

The way we live (The way we live)
The way we die (The way we die)
What a tragedy, I'm so terrified
Day dreamers, please wake up
We can't sleep no more

(Lord, have mercy on them)
(Lord, have mercy on them)
(Lord, have mercy on them)
(Lord, have mercy on them)

(Are we really living or just walking dead now?)

We live and then we die, and we never know the why
So now, now we go, down underground
We think that we can fly, but we never touch the sky
So now, now we go, down underground

(Ooh)

57821, it is now time for you to come home, my dear
You've been gone long enough

Thank you
(Lord have mercy on them)
But you must come, you must go...
(Lord have mercy on them)
