Sunrise breaks its fatal perfume
And I'm dizzy to distraction
The scented clutches of a siren's lament
Embrace the sound of enchantment
Five fathoms deep, the lovers leap
The lanterns of skin beckon us in
O Belladonna

Daylight devours your unguarded hours
Burnt and charred, this bride of scars
O Belladonna

Five fathoms deep, the lovers leap
The lanterns of skin summon us in
O Belladonna

Nightfalls descent shrouds her intent
In a halo of sharks and a skeleton mask
O Belladonna

Lost in the glare, all of us stare
The patterns of pain, scream out your name
O Belladonna
