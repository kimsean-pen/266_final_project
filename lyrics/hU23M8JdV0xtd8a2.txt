We all hide behind a mask
A product of our own self destructive past
We all ache for something deeper than the surface
Searching for anything to break the name "worthless"

If only we could see the damage we cause ourselves
It often seems our best intentions pave the road to hell
We do it to ourselves
It's got me overwhelmed

I've never fallen this far
It's never been this dark

Take me back to better days
Before I was a slave to the choices that I have made
There's gotta be a better way
This can't stay

Don't let me fade away
Don't let me fade away
Don't let me fade away
Don't let me fade away

I just can't make another day
Don't let me fade away
Don't let me fade away
I've been torn down to nothing

We all want to be set free
Enslaved to emotions or someone
We're ripping at the seams
Can't seem to stop the bleeding
Too blind to see the cycle repeats
Feels like I'm made to fail
You pick the coffin and I'll drive the nail

Take me back to better days
Before I was a slave to the choices that I have made
There's gotta be a better way
This can't stay

Don't let me fade away
Don't let me fade away
Don't let me fade away
Don't let me fade away

I just can't make another day
Don't let me fade away
Don't let me fade away
I've been torn down to nothing

We all hide behind a mask
We all want to be set free
We all hide behind a mask
We all want to be set free

If you can hear this
If you can feel this
Don't let me fade away
Don't let me fade away

If you can hear this
If you can feel this
Don't let me fade away
Don't let me fade away

Give me a sign
Tell me everything will be alright
Give me a sign
These idle hands
Adept for a crime
