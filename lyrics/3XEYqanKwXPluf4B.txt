Woo-who, yee-who
Woo-who, yee-who
Woo-who, yee-who
Woo-who, yee-who

If I could escape
I would but, first of all, let me say
I must apologize for acting stank & treating you this way
Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold?

If I could escape (escape)
And re-create a place that's my own world (own world)
And I could be your favorite girl forever, perfectly together
And tell me boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape)
If I could be sweet (be sweet)
I know I've been a real bad girl (bad girl)
I didn't mean for you to get hurt

Whatsoever, we can make it better
And tell me boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape)

Woo-who, I wanna get away
Yee-who, (get away)
Woo-who, To our sweet escape
Yee-who, (sweet escape)

Woo-who, I wanna get away
Yee-who, (get away)
Woo-who, Ooh yeah
Yee-who, (ooh yeah)

You melt me down
I'm at my lowest boiling point
Come help me out
I need to get me out of this joint

Come on, let's bounce
Counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around let's look for some common ground
So baby, times gettin' a little crazy
I've been gettin' a little lazy
Waiting for you to come save me
I can see that you're angry
By the way that you treat me

Hopefully you don't leave me

I want to take you with me
If I could escape (escape)
And re-create a place that's my own world (own world)

And I could be your favorite girl forever, perfectly together
And tell me boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape)
If I could be sweet (be sweet)
I know I've been a real bad girl (bad girl)

I didn't mean for you to get hurt
Whatsoever, we can make it better
And tell me boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape)
Woo-who, yee-who
Woo-who, yee-who
If I could escape
Woo-who, yee-who
If I could escape

Woo-who, yee-who
Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold
If I could escape (escape)
And re-create a place that's my own world (own world)
And I could be your favorite girl forever, perfectly together
And tell me boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape)
If I could be sweet (be sweet)
I know I've been a real bad girl (bad girl)
I didn't mean for you to get hurt

And tell me boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape)
Woo-who, I wanna get away
Yee-who, (get away)
Woo-who, To our sweet escape
Yee-who, (sweet escape)
Woo-who, I wanna get away
