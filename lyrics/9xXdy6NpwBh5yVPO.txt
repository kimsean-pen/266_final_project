Whoa-hoa-hoa-hoa
Whoa-hoa-hoa-hoa
Whoa-hoa-hoa-hoa
Whoa-hoa-hoa-hoa
Whoa-hoa Whoa-hoa-hoa-hoa
We woke up on the floor
Our bodies intertwined
You're doing that thing you do
When something's on your mind
Restlessness and worries for a future that's unknown
But I'll travel through both space and time
To make sure you will never be alone
I would wait a thousand years for you
I would brave new frontiers for you
I would trade a thousand years for you
A thousand years
A thousand years
We head into the night
And fade into the streets
As rain on the city falls
The taste is bittersweet
Restlessness and worries for a future far away
I'll travel into the unknown
To make sure you will see another day
I would wait a thousand years for you
I would brave new frontiers for you
I would trade a thousand years for you
A thousand years
A thousand years
Whoa-hoa-hoa-hoa
Through complication
Whoa-hoa-hoa-hoa
Through the unknown
Whoa-hoa-hoa-hoa
Determination
Whoa-hoa whoa-hoa-hoa-hoa
I'll make sure you'll never be alone
I would wait a thousand years for you
I would brave new frontiers for you
I would trade a thousand years for you
A thousand years
A thousand years
Whoa-hoa-hoa-hoa
(I would wait a thousand years)
Whoa-hoa-hoa-hoa
(I would trade a thousand years)
Whoa-hoa-hoa-hoa
(I would wait a thousand years)
Whoa-hoa Whoa-hoa-hoa-hoa
(I would wait a thousand years for you)
A thousand years for you!
