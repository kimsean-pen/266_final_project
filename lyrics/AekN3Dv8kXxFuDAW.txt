In moment of peace

Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah
Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah

Come now, come by our side
Into a place where you can hide
We are the sunshine
Rest your Soul here
And you'll find
We are the energy
We give the world to thee
Hold up your heart now
We will ease pain from your brow

In the world without danger
When destruction is near
You can come with us here

When the people are strangers
We will rest here and be
In a moment of peace

In the world without danger
When destruction is near
You can come with us here

When the people are strangers
We will rest here and be
In a moment of peace

Light up the dark below
See through the stars
Reach to the earth's flow
Drift into the joy of our hearts
Unleash the energy
Taste of the wine
Drink as a Soul
That knows now, power divine

In the world without danger
When destruction is near
You can come with us here
When the people are strangers
We will rest here and be
In a moment of peace
In the world without danger
When destruction is near
You can come with us here
When the people are strangers
We will rest here and be
In a moment of peace
In a moment of peace
