Hey little girl why you fooling around?
Why you always gotta be putting me down?
You don't know what I'm talking about
So hey little girl better stop putting out

I've been walking in my sleep
Can you give me what I need?

It's never enough just to hold you
It's never enough just to please you
Ooh baby it's never enough

You take and you take all you can
Now I need to understand it's never enough
So baby, bye bye bye bye bye, baby
Bye bye bye bye, baby

Hey little girl you're a heartbreaker
Why you gotta be such a dictator?
You don't care about how I feel
Why you always gotta be spinning your wheels?

I've been walking in my sleep
Can you give me what I need?

It's never enough just to hold you
It's never enough just to please you
Ooh baby it's never enough

Take and you take all you can
Now I need to understand it's never enough
So baby, bye bye bye bye bye
So long baby

It's never enough just to hold you
It's never enough just to please you
Ooh baby it's never enough

You take and you take all you can
Now I need to understand it's never enough
So baby bye bye bye bye
Baby bye bye bye
Baby bye bye bye, oh
