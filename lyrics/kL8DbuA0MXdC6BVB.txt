I ain't even here right now
I ain't even here right now

Silhouettes of made up stories
Windows into someone lonely
Everything can change by morning
Right now someone's waiting for you

This chandelier is luxury
But what's a penthouse view to me
When I'm walking on a skyline?
I'm walking on a skyline
Highrises and balconies
But what's a top-floor view to me
When we're walking on a skyline?
We're walking on a skyline

Seen the host tell the doorman to lock up the elevator
Guess this room was too exclusive
You told me whats-her-name would be here
But she ain't even here right now
And I think all the drinks have been drunken
All the ice in the bucket has melted
We could do much better, we don't have to settle
I ain't even here right now

Right now, right now
I ain't even here right now
Right now, right now
I ain't even here right now
Right now, right now
I ain't even here right now
Right now, right now
I ain't even here right now

Teenage dream, asleep forever
3 A.M., we're on a stretcher
Diamonds in the sky get weathered
You get trashed until you're treasured

This chandelier is luxury
But what's a penthouse view to me
When I'm walking on a skyline?
I'm walking on a skyline
Highrises and balconies
But what's a top-floor view to me
When we're walking on a skyline?
We're walking on a skyline

Seen the host tell the doorman to lock up the elevator
Guess this room was too exclusive
You told me whats-her-name would be here
But she ain't even here right now
And I think all the drinks have been drunken
All the ice in the bucket has melted
We could do much better, we don't have to settle
I ain't even here right now

Right now, right now
I ain't even here right now
Right now, right now
I ain't even here right now
Right now, right now
I ain't even here right now
Right now, right now
I ain't even here right now

I ain't even here right now
I ain't even here right now
And I think all the drinks have been drunken
All the ice in the bucket has melted
We could do much better, we don't have to settle
I ain't even here right now
