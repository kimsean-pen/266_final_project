You're the sky that I fell through
And I remember the view
Whenever I'm holding you

The sun hung from a string
Looking down on the world
As it warms over everything

Chills run down my spine
As our fingers entwine
And your sighs harmonize with mine

Unmistakably
I can still feel your heart beat fast
When you dance with me

We got older and I should've known (do you feel alive?)
That I feel colder when I walk alone (oh, but you'll survive)
So I may as well ditch my dismay
(Bombs away, bombs away)

Circle me and the needle
Moves gracefully back and forth
If my heart was a compass
You'd be north

Risk it all
'Cause I'll catch you if you fall wherever you go
If my heart was a house
You'd be home

It makes me smile because you said it best
I would clearly feel blessed
If the sun rose up from the west

Flower balm perfume
All my clothes smell like you
'Cause your favorite shade is navy blue

I walk slowly when I'm on my own (do you feel alive?)
Yeah, but frankly I still feel alone (oh, but you'll survive)
So I may as well ditch my dismay
(Bombs away, bombs away)

Circle me and the needle moves
Gracefully back and forth
If my heart was a compass
You'd be north

Risk it all
'Cause I'll catch you if you fall wherever you go
If my heart was a house
You'd be home

If my heart was a house
You'd be home
