All night, daylight, everything that we had, we had
Turns violet in the sky, burning in the sunlight, sunlight

Cause I'm wide-eyed feeling like I've never seen a sunrise, sunrise
Hangin' high feelin' like everything is alright
This ain't love, I don't feel and nothing hurts

Cause this ain't love that I feel cause I made it through the night
Ooh, ooh, cause I made it through the night
Ooh, ooh, yeah I made it through the night

Cause I made it through the night
I would give, you would take everything that we had, we had
I know you made a big mistake thinking that my heart could break

Cause I'm wide-eyed feeling like I've never seen a sunrise, sunrise
Hangin' high feelin' like everything is alright

This ain't love, I don't feel and nothing hurts
Cause this ain't love that I feel cause I made it through the night
Ooh, ooh, cause I made it through the night
Ooh, ooh, yeah I made it through the night
Cause I made it through the night

This ain't love
I don't feel and nothing hurts
Cause this ain't love
That I feel cause I made it through the night
I made it through, I made it
I made it through, I made it
I made it through, I made it
I made it through, I made it

This ain't love, I don't feel and nothing hurts
Cause this ain't love that I feel cause I made it through the night
Ooh, ooh, cause I made it through the night
Ooh, ooh, yeah I made it through the night
Cause I made it through the night
I made it through, I made it
I made it through, I made it
I made it through, I made it
I made it through, I made it

I made it through, I made it
I made it through, I made it
I made it through, I made it
I made it, I made it through the night
