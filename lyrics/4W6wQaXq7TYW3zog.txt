Oh, I feel the ocean in my head
Oh, the pressure's rising and my heart beat's speeding
(For you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you)
And don't you feel the tension crawling up your chest?
Oh, it's do or die, kid
How it's always been
(For you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you)

Please call me and tell me that you want me
'Cause right now my life is getting pretty ugly
And I wanna share a cigarette and I wanna go dancing in the rain
So call me and tell me that you want me
And let's do it all again

Oh, the tropical weather
It must've softened your heart
(Beats for you, beats for you, beats for you, beats for you, beats for you, beats for you, beats for you)
But now we're back on the streets in California where the air is dry
And your heart is closing up in plain sight
(Beats for you, beats for you, beats for you, beats for you, beats for you, beats for you, beats for you)

Please call me and tell me that you want me
'Cause right now my life is getting pretty ugly
And I wanna share a cigarette and I wanna go dancing in the rain
So call me and tell me that you want me
And let's do it all again

And I question your love for me
You tell me to have confidence
I question your love for me
'Cause baby, you don't make no sense

Please call me and tell me that you want me
'Cause right now my life is getting pretty ugly
And I wanna share a cigarette and I wanna go dancing in the rain
So call me and tell me that you want me
And let's do it all again
