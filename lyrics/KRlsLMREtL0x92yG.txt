If I can't love myself?
I sweep it under the rug
Just like everything else
You take the good with the bad
Through the nights like this
And you sink with me into the abyss

I regress and I slip
And I fall off that cliff
Free falling head first
Pray I don't feel a thing when I hit the dirt

How can I love you
If I can't love myself?
I needed something to hold
Every time that I fell
You took pity on me
And I couldn't resist

I regress and I slip
And I fall off that cliff
Free falling head first
Pray I don't feel a thing when I hit the dirt

I never wanted this
I'm really sorry Miss
I pulled you down with me
Into the abyss

Sink with me
