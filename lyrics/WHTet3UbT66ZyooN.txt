Here today
Gone today
Hurry up and wait
I'm never there
For you or me
Can't you read
The story of our lives?
Death to me
And life for you

Something isn't right

And I need some space
To clear my head
To think about my life

And I can't be alone
I just need some space
To clear my head

To think about my life
With or without you
We fight it out
We work it out
Give me some ti-i-ime
To unwind

With Or Without you
We Work It out
Give me some ti-i-me

To unwind
I must confess
I'm falling apart
Breaking your heart
Crying with you on the phone
We're walking
On thin ice

And I hope it doesn't break
I just need some space
To clear my head
To think about my life
With or without you
We fight it out

We work it out
Give me some ti-i-ime
To unwind
We fight it out
We work it out
Give me some ti-i-ime

With or with out you
Mile by mile
We're farther apart

And it's one empty bottle
And two broken hearts
Night after night
We are falling apart
Now it's two broken bottles
And four empty hearts
Decompression
Depression period
Decompression
Depression period
Decompression
Depression period
Decompression
Depression period
And I need some space
To clear my head
To think about my life
With or without you
I'm never there
For you or me
Can't you read
The story of our lives?
