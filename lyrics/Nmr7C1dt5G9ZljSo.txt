Now, Tommy's a good father
Of two sons and a daughter
But he wakes up and he asks himself
Why even bother?
If he cannot feed his family
The wage he's paid's insanity
Every day he's dealing with a new calamity

Lost his old occupation
But it wasn't immigration
It was a machine, automation that replaced him
Politicians left him, corruption since the recession
So he grabs his Smith and Wesson
And says he'll teach 'em all a lesson, like

Get down on the ground
It's a stick up
Nobody make a sound
Don't even hiccup or I'm emptying the round
I'm done playing games
So I'm going down in flames
Let it rain over Washington

It's a stick up
Nobody make a sound
Don't even hiccup or I'm emptying the round
I'm done playing games
So I'm going down in flames
Let it rain over Washington

Now first he'd lost his pension
Sunk into depression
Congress is defecting
It's been adding to detention
Came back from war, and he's been post-traumatic stressing
Can't afford his medicine he took for his aggression
He needs help
Relying on this system that rejects him
Took away his benefits, but left him with his weapon
Bought a one way ticket
He's entering the thicket
To do the only thing
That he's thinking will make a difference, like

Get down on the ground
It's a stick up
Nobody make a sound
Don't even hiccup or I'm emptying the round
I'm done playing games
So I'm going down in flames
Let it rain over Washington

It's a stick up
Nobody make a sound
Don't even hiccup or I'm emptying the round
I'm done playing games
So I'm going down in flames
Let it rain over Washington

There's a cold wind blowing
I'm just warning and preparing ya
There's a cold wind blowing
And it's coming for America
And it's coming for America
And it's coming for America

Get down on the ground
It's a stick up
Nobody make a sound
Don't even hiccup or I'm emptying the round
I'm done playing games
So I'm going down in flames
Let it rain over Washington

It's a stick up
Nobody make a sound
Don't even hiccup or I'm emptying the round
I'm done playing games
So I'm going down in flames
Let it rain over Washington
