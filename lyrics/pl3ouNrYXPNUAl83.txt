If you leave your faith in time then it's over for you
Your escape right now is the space of another
Because the truth is way too much for you to handle
Yeah, haven't you enough love for yourself?

Why we keep running? Somebody tell me
Hiding from something, under your shelter
But if you look in the mirror long enough to see yourself
If you look in the mirror long enough to free yourself
You would notice that you're alone waking up
If you look in the mirror, mirror you remember yourself, yourself

Gotta keep your eyes wide open the same way they do
To believe in things you don't understand ain't good for you
They think the truth is way too much for you to handle
Yeah, show 'em you got much love for yourself

Why we keep running? Somebody tell me
Hiding from something, under your shelter
But if you look in the mirror long enough to see yourself
If you look in the mirror long enough to free yourself
You would notice that you're alone waking up
If you look in the mirror, mirror you remember yourself, yourself

And this won't be your last
But you're always there
Searching for yourself
Deeper and deeper
You just don't remember
And that's alright
But if you just happen
To look

But if you look in the mirror long enough to see yourself
If you look in the mirror long enough to free yourself
You would notice that you're alone waking up
If you look in the mirror, mirror you remember yourself, yourself
