Now I see trouble
Is coming up ahead
Black dogs running through the fields
They're dripping red

The world is quiet
And there is nothing left unsaid
Million image, million captured
Million dead

And all the birds fall out of the sky
In two by two's
And my teeth fall out my head
Into the snow

I am you now
And you are me instead
I see with is blood on your wedding dress

And all of the old walk down
And I'm feeling unsure
When I'm sleeping in my own place
I'm not home

It is perfect
It is beautiful and still
And it is silent, it is white
And it is good

With all falling round us
Daisy chains in our hair
It is coming now my friend
And it's the end
