Another year has passed and I'm all right
I lick the salt from my wounds and run into the night
Well, it's unknown, why collusion goes on
It rapes like betrayal and I'm rotting in the squalor of some

Do you remember the rage?
I remember the hate
I remember it rained for years and the blood had left a stain

You say, I got karma to collect
I dig my grave and I'm here waiting for some kind of check
If I get one, I'll hold my breath
I racked my spine, it takes a year of you to warrant a test

As the years go by I won't cry
It's the year you walked into my life
I will despise

We are the revenants
We will rise up from the dead
We become the living
We've come back to reclaim our stolen breath

We are the revenants
We will rise up from the dead
We become the living
We've come back to reclaim our stolen...

We are the revenants
We will rise up from the dead
We become the living
We've come back to reclaim our stolen breath

We are the revenants
We will rise up from the dead
We become the living
We've come back to reclaim our stolen breath

We are the revenants
We will rise up from the dead
We become the living
We've come back to reclaim our stolen breath

We are the revenants
We will rise up from the dead
We become the living
We've come back to reclaim our stolen...

Another year has passed and I'm all right
I lick the salt from my wounds and run into the night

Run into the night
Run into the night
Run into the night
Run into the night
