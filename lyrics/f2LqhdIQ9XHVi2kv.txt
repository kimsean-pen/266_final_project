Alright, baby
Well, I think you will like Sister Honey
She will help you
Make up your mind
even if you don't need her
Tell her you need her
She needs you brother
She needs you brother

Strange fascination
Some kind of temptation
To know Sister
Never having allowed yourself
Do you understand the word, pleasure
Well, you say it's just never crossed your mind
And she believes you

Can we still be friends
the answer's always yes
Even best intentions turn around one day
Saying

Nobody's right, baby
All the time
And a fool never knows what he's leaving behind
So take some time to know the real story
Cause a soul that's true is your ride to glory
Don't let that golden hair get in your way, baby

Can we still be friends
the answer's always yes
Even best intentions turn around one day
Saying

Come back solemn stranger
It's your last chance
She's almost gone, now
And she'll go fast like a jet plane
And then fast like a star stream
She'll hit you with a fury
Whispering the words one more time, baby
One more time
And she says don't let that golden hair
Get in your way now
