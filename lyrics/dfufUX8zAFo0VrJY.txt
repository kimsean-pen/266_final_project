C'mon billy
Come to me
You know i'm waiting
I love you endlessly

C'mon billy
You're the only one
Don't you think it's time now
You met your only son?

I remember
Lover's play
The car was cold and
We lay in it for days

I remember
The things you said
My little billy,
Come to your lover's bed

Come home
Is my plea
Your home now is
Here with me
Come home
To your son
Ttomorrow might never come

C'mon billy
You look good to me
How many nights now
Your child inside of

Don't forget me
I had your son
Damn thing went crazy
But I swear you're the only one

Come along, Billy, now come to me
Come along, Billy, now come to me
Come along, Billy, now come to me
Come along, Billy, now come to me
Come along, Billy, now come to me
Come along, Billy, now come to me
Come along, Billy, now come to me
Come along, and come to me
