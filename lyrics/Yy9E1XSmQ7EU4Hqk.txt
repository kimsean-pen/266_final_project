This is how I found you
Guided by my insides
Will you be the one to keep?
Oh when it really happens
I'm so unsure of myself
I'm see through, I'm naked
And if hurts so bad

I'm in the room
of your sacred belief
Don't look at me like
I'm your saviour
I'm not your friend
I am not your lover
Your an extension
of private desires
