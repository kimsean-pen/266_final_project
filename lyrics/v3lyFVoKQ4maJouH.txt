Baby, I never gave my heart to anyone, oh no
I used to think that love was a game
I used to make it just for fun, oh yeah

When we spent the night together
Didn't mean it meant that much
Now I just can't live without your touch

I didn't want to need you, no, no
I didn't want to want you like I do
I didn't mean to fall, I didn't want to care at all
I didn't want to need you, no, no, like I need you now

Oh, I can't get no sleep 'cause I keep thinking of you
All through the night, oh yeah
My eyes can't wait to see you again
My arms can't wait to hold you tight, oh yeah

And when you're lying here beside me
There is nothing else I need
Never thought that this could ever be

I didn't want to need you, oh no
I didn't want to want you like I do
I didn't mean to fall, I didn't want to care at all
I didn't want to need you, no, no, like I need you now

I've always been free
To leave when I wanted to leave
But it's not up to me anymore

I didn't want to need you, no, no
I didn't want to want you like I do
I didn't mean to fall, I didn't want to care at all
I didn't want to need you, no, no

I didn't want to want you like I do
I didn't mean to fall, I didn't want to care at all
I didn't want to need you, no, no
But I need you now, oh

I need you now
I need you now
I need you baby, ooh

I didn't wanna [Incomprehensible], no, no
I didn't wanna [Incomprehensible], no, no
I didn't wanna [Incomprehensible], no, no
