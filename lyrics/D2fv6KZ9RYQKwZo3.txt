You show your age
When you drown your rage
But I see past those laughter lines
So, baby, let's split tonight
I got a tank full of gas to light
Yeah, we could drive for miles and miles

But you just said
"Not for all the love in the world
Oh, not for all the love in the world"
'Cause she didn't realize, now, that's a lot of love

Pipe dreams fade
And all the underdogs get laid
Left your heart in the hands of a jugglin' clown
And so you crave recognition
But the keys to the city went missing
People aren't puzzles to be figured out

But you just said
"Not for all the love in the world
Oh, not for all the love in the world"
'Cause she didn't realize, now, that's a lot of love
Oh, oh
Whoo-ooh-ooh

I guess that everybody
Went to a better party, oh, no

"Not for all the love in the world
Oh, not for all the love in the world"
But she didn't realize, now, that's a lot of love
