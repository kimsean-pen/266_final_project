Quit playin' games, boy
How soon did we forget?
I'll be in some other bed
So don't you fuck with me like that!
Got me confused, boy
Like I won't put your ass in check
I tried in

'Cause I tried so hard to just keep it goin'
Not cheat on you
You know how I am, don't you forget
What I did for you

I left all my hoes
Told 'em not to call and text me no more
Now you're so ungrateful
Do you know how hard it was for me to stay faithful?

Babe, I'ma make this song cry
Never let a nigga see me cry
I'ma make this song cry
'Fore I ever let 'em fuck up my eyes

For the first time in my life
Tried to do somethin' that's right
I tried to stop fightin' and be a wife
But I paid the ultimate price
Guess karma caught up with me (guess it did)
'Cause I done hurt so many

I tried so hard to just keep it goin'
Not cheat on you
You know how I am, don't you forget
What I did for you

Left all my hoes
Told 'em not to call or text me no more
Now you're so ungrateful
Do you know how hard it was to be faithful?

It's been said, yeah, some hoes you can find that perfect one
And they should be the only one you wanna see
But that just ain't never been me
I can't believe the things I don't see
I'm feelin' out of control
I just miss my hoes

So I told all my hoes
I told 'em not to call and text me no more, yeah
Now you're so ungrateful
Do you know how hard it was for me to stay faithful?

Sing it
I'ma make this song cry
Never let a nigga see me cry, no
Gotta make the song cry, ey yeah
I'ma make the song cry
Whoa yeah
Whoa yeah, yeah
