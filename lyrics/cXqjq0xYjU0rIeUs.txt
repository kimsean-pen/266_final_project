You can breathe in the music this city makes
Move by the rhythm the gypsies play
Deep inside it comes alive

There is a whisper that feeds your soul
Words so beautiful on a Spanish rose
'Til you're hypnotized that's when you've arrived

You gotta strut like you mean it
Free your mind
It's not enough just to dream it
Come on, come on, get up

When you feel it, it's your chance to shine
Strut like you mean it
Come on, come on, come on, yah

Poundin' the pavement
Kickin' through the streets
To wander like Picasso
In the Barcelona heat

Passion is the fashion
And life is poetry
Welcome to another world
Where every heart can beat

Get a different tempo there's never a wrong one
Never a wrong one, never a wrong one
Building to a crescendo
You know the journey's just begun

You got to strut like you mean it
Free your mind
It's not enough just to dream it
Come on, come on, get up

When you feel it, it's your chance to shine
Strut like you mean it
Come on, come on, come on, yah

Hey feel the flow when you just can't move no more
The city wants to show you somethin', somethin'
A heart unfolds that you would never know
Barcelona soul, so somethin', somethin' good is comin' is comin', yah
Everybody knows that something good is comin on

You got to strut like you mean it
Free your mind
It's not enough just to dream it
Come on, come on, get up

When you feel it, it's your chance to shine
Strut like you mean it
Come on, come on, come on
You got to strut

Bienvenidos, esto es mi sueño
(Come on, come on, get up)
Siganme y descubran mi Barcelona
(Strut, come on, come on)
Bienvenidos, esto es mi sueño
(Come on)
