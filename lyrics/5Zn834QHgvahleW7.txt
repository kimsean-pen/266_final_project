Premise to interlude
Wait till all bones pretrude
You're convexed, you're convert
There is a stain on your shirt

Semi-sweet, semicide
The remorse you can't hide
Now we molt, past our skin
And make room to begin

Symmetry
You must work in symmetry
You must earn their empathy
Empathy, empathy, empathy

Symmetry
You must work in symmetry
You must earn their empathy
Empathy, empathy, empathy

Down, down, cities fall down on me
Down, down, cities fall down on me
Down, down, cities fall down on me
Down, down, cities fall down on me

The final chrysalis
Self-controlled consciousness
Now it feels omminent
Done for your benefit

Eat right out of their hand
Its concaved all your glands
We're encouraged to forget
Preference to be forcefed

Symmetry
You must work in symmetry
You must earn their empathy
Empathy, empathy, empathy

Symmetry
You must work in symmetry
You must earn their empathy
Empathy, empathy, empathy

Down, down, cities fall down on me
Down, down, cities fall down on me
Down, down, cities fall down on me
Down, down, cities fall down

You must earn our empathy
You must earn our empathy
You must earn our empathy
You must earn our empathy

You must earn our empathy
You must earn our empathy
You must earn our empathy
