I'm runnin' here
I'm runnin' there
I'm lookin' for a girl
Cause there's nothing I need
there's nothing I want more
In the whole wide world.

Well I need it quick
and I need it now
before I start to fade away
That's why I'm searchin'
that's why I'm lookin'
each and every day.

Ooh I need some love
I said I need some love
Ooh yes I need some love
This feeling I can't rise above
Yeah, yeah.

Well I been hustlin' here
I been hustlin' there
I been searchin for about a week.
And I started feeling this strange sensation
My knee's are startin' gettin' weak.

Well I need what keeps
a young man alive
I said I need it now
I'm gonna get my message across to you
Someway, somehow

Ooh I need some love
I said I need some love.
Ooh yes I need some love
This feelin' I can't rise above.
Ooh yeah yeah.
