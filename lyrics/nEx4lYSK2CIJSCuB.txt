Hahaha You know what it is
Gym class heroes, the dream
Its hard to look innocent when I got cookie crumbs all over my face

I like girls
They like me
They look so good
In their satin jeans
Want you to be the one
And my only
I want be faithful
But I cant keep my hands out the cookie jar.

My hands, my hands, my ha uh my hands
Cant keep my hands, my hands, my, uh, my
Cant keep my hands, my hands, my, uh, my
Cant keep my hands, my hands my hands out the cookie jar.

You see I got this problem
I need help trying to solve it
Cause meeting after meeting and Im still a cookie-holic
You can hide them, Imma find them, on the counter, in the closet
And I'll say I aint do it with my face covered in chocolate

My girl be setting booby traps
To catch me eating Scooby snacks
I left crumbs in the bed once
But I told her I was through with that
She still dont be believing me
And I guess that I'm cool with that
But I got a sweet tooth, thatll never come loose
And the truth of the matter is.

I like girls
They like me
They look so good
In their Satin jeans
Want you to be the one
And my only
I want be faithful
But I cant keep my hands out the cookie jar.

My hands, my hands, my ha uh my hands
Cant keep my hands, my hands, my, uh, my
Cant keep my hands, my hands, my, uh, my
Cant keep my hands, my hands my hands out the cookie jar.

I got a thing for Milano, Biscotti Italianos
And I never turn down some Oreos if you got them
Butter Pecan Puerto Rican,
Or them Oatmeal Raisin Asians.
Hazelnut Brazilians,
Macadamia Caucasians,
Double stuffed or thin mint
It dont matter you getting it
Cos I got a sweet tooth thatll never come loose
And the fact of the matter is.

I like girls
They like me
They look so good
In their Satin jeans
Want you to be the one
And my only
I want be faithful
But I can't keep my hands out the cookie jar.

My hands, my hands, my ha uh my hands
Cant keep my hands, my hands, my, uh, my
Cant keep my hands, my hands, my, uh, my
Cant keep my hands, my hands my hands out the cookie jar.

Im a monster for these cookies
Im a beast for theyre treats
An animal for theyre crackers
Head to feet they so damn sweet
Cant keep my hands, my hands, my ha uh my
Cant keep my hands, my hands, my hands out the cookie jar.

And then you have it haha
I tried my best
I went to cookie anonymous
I guess Im a failure
I cant seem to keep my damn hands out the cookie jar but,
It is what it is
