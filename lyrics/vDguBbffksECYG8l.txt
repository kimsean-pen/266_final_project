Hey, yo
When this first started off
it was just linkin park

And then in the middle
came Motion Man
And at the end of it all
it was Kutmasta Kurt with a remix

One thing i dont know why
It doesn't even matter
how hard you try
Keep that in mind

i designed this rhyme
when i was obsessed with time
All i know
Time was just slipping away

and i watched it count down to the end of the day
Watched it watch me and the words that i say
The echo of the clock rythm
in my veins

I know that i didn't look out below when i watched the time
go right out the window
Trying to grab hold
Trying not to watch

I wasted it all
on the hands on the clock
But in the end
no matter what i pretend

the journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it ment to me
Will eventually be a memory of
A time i tried so hard

And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall

To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
Hey, yo
One thing

I don't know why
It doesn't even matter
how hard you try
Keep that in mind

I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All i know
Ha, I so-socialize like the host of the party i spoke, shaked

and made eye-contact
Partied and toast strong
All that Northeast, Southwest coast
I'm staring out the window

No oppurtunity to mingle
I tried to sew it up
You weaken your system
I had you throwing up

I brought you back into things
Like the imaginary man
in your dreams
You'd always seem

to make it worth it
I pig-skin I never nerf it
You felt like loving
Never played real
In bringing the pleasure
By any means it means
I'm leaving your team
Hell of a team,
Man it seems
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
One thing
I don't know how
It doesn't even matter
when you look at it now
Cause when i designed this rhyme
I was scared of it all
Scared to fall
And I hadn't even tried to crawl
But i was forced to run
With you mocking me
Stopping me
Backstabbing me constantly
Remembering all the times
you fought with me
Watch the clock now
Chock-full of hipocrisy
But now your mouth
Wishes it could inhale
Every single little thing
You said to make things fail
Every single word you sputtered
Just to get your piece
But it really doesn't matter to me
Cause from the start
To the end
No matter what i pretend
The journey is more important
Than the end or the start
And what it ment to me
Will eventually
be a memory of a time
When i tried so hard
And got so far
But in the and
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
...IN THE END...
