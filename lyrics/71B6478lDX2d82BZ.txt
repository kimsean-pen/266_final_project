If I wait
Don't move a muscle
Maybe somehow we'll sparkle strong
It's been a long night

So sincere
But the message is still a struggle
Knives with which we juggle
While we jump through fire

So maybe I'll move on or make a mistake
And see if my earth-quakes

This is the love I'm frightened of
Doesn't come with a leaflet that says how to keep it
This is the love that can't be seen
No detailed instructions or Japanese symbols like you find on the washing machine

Slow me down
Apply some gentile pressure
And maybe somehow we'll sparkle strong
I hope they might

One is best
But like any conversation
Safe but no relation
To the all you give

So maybe I'll move on or make a mistake
And see if my earth-quakes

This is the love I'm frightened of
Doesn't come with a leaflet that says how to keep it
This is the love that can't be seen
No detailed instructions...

This is the love I'm frightened of
This is the love I'm frightened of
