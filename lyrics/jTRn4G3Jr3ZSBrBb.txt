[VERSE 1]
When you know
The stars all start to shine
And love won't lose the time

In the dark
The hearts will cause a spark
Alone you'll never walk

[CHORUS]
Cause we will never fade
We'll shine and light the shade
We'll just illuminate
Show our color ray
So baby let's gleaux away
In the night they will see you
Luminate
Show 'em that we were meant to

[VERSE 2]
It's a feel
That some can't compreheend
It's a chance to light
And take a stand

In the dark
The hearts will cause a spark
Alone you'll never walk

[CHORUS]
Cause we will never fade
We'll shine and light the shade
We'll just illuminate
Show our color ray
So baby let's gleaux away
In the night they will see you
Luminate
Show 'em that we were meant to

Gleaux
Show em that you were meant to gleaux
Show em that you were meant to gleaux
Show em that you were meant to gleaux
You were meant to gleaux
You were meant to gleaux
We were meant to gleaux
The hearts gonna gleaux
Gleaux
Gleaux
Gleuax
