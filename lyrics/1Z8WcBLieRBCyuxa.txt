Only way to feel the noise
Is when it's good and loud
So good I can't believe it
Screaming with the crowd

Don't sweat it
Get it back to you
Don't sweat it
Get it back to you

Overkill
Overkill
Overkill

On your feet you feel the beat
It goes straight to your spine
Shake your head you must be dead
If it don't make you fly

Don't sweat it
Get it back to you
Don't sweat it
Get it back to you

Overkill
Overkill
Overkill

Know your body's made to move
You feel it in your guts
Rock 'n' roll ain't worth the name
If it don't make you strut

Don't sweat it
Get it back to you

Don't sweat it
Get it back to you

Overkill
Overkill
Overkill
