Treasure
I was somewhere two thousand a daydream
I was hiding, I couldn't face it
I used to live my life in this
I fell out of sync, audio phasing
Felt like I couldn't find my placing
Sky shivers there
They turn to rain
I turn again
I wish we could heal
I'll take you home
I'll make you whole
You made me wish
That this wasn't real
Because you're
You're my treasure
Because you're
You're my treasure
I used to live my life in the wind
And I would fly wherever you would swim
I couldn't stand by you or anything
Sky shivers there
They turn to rain
I turn again
I wish we could heal
I'll take you home
I'll make you whole
You made me wish
That this wasn't real
Because you're
You're my treasure
Because you're
You're my treasure
Bad habits and good times
Let's take a risk, no nine lives
Don't smile, you just might cry
Been round the round-a-bout, like five times
Will be two scratches, hard drive
Local advertise, decline
Watch the heavens just recline
Watch the heavens, let's the sun die
Breathing even is a challenge
Cause I don't want to lose, brother
I need it, gotta have it

Too stuck in the loop
Too stuck in the loop
Too stuck in the loop
Too stuck in the loop
Too stuck in the loop
Too stuck in the loop
Too stuck in the loop
Too stuck in the loop
Too stuck in the loop
Too stuck in the loop
Too stuck in the loop
Too stuck in the loop
Too stuck in the loop
Too stuck in the loop
Too stuck in the loop
Too stuck in the loop
Too stuck in the loop
Too stuck in the loop
Too stuck in the loop
Too stuck in the loop
So alone
