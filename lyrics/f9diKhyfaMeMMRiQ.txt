Something held me down and made me make a promise
That I wouldn't tell if the truth forgets about us
But saying it now comes easily
After finding out how you've been using me

At least the dark don't hide it
At least the dark don't hide it
At least the dark don't hide it
At least the dark don't hide it

You said you only wanted friends
For long enough to get rid of them
You found the kind you knew would only kill ya
So you surrounded yourself with them

At least the dark don't hide it
At least the dark don't hide it
At least the dark don't hide it
At least the dark don't hide it

Now the world was empty on the day when they made it
But heaven needed someplace to throw all the shit
Human hearts and pain should never be separate
They wouldn't tear themselves apart both trying to fit

At least the dark don't hide it
At least the dark don't hide it
At least the dark don't hide it
At least the dark don't hide it

Now death is gonna hold us up in the mirror
And say we're so much alike, we must be brothers
See, I had a job to do, but people like you
Have been doing it for me to one another

At least I don't hide it
At least I don't hide it
At least I don't hide it
At least I don't hide it
