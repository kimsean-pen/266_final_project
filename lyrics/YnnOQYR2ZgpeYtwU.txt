The poems I wrote for the last few years
Were nothing, but vague prophecies
But they abode what they promised
So be careful what you wish for, you might get it…

Some guys, they just give up living
And start dying little by little, piece by piece
Some guys bury their hopes beneath disrooted trees
But most of them just die a wretched death near these streets…

My memories got stolen… …so hail to the thief
Irony causes laughter, but laugther causes pain
These mountains, one day, will soak the sea
But I won't witness, I won't neighter hear nor see…

I can already hear the chains clatter behind my ears
I can feel the flames searing all last evidence
That we have lost this battle doesn't mean we‘ve lost the war
But only when we‘ve lost everything, we'll be free to leave…
…we'll be free to leave…

We shared the thirst of swans in the summer
We shared alignment, the lack long after
This city will be the death of me…
To be homebound will be the death of me…

I can never regret, I can feel sorrow, but at least it's not the same thing
I take leave heavy at heart, although it was out of our hands…
