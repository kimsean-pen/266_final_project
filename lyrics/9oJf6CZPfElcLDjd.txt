Ã¶Time has come to say goodbye
I know it's gonna make you cry
But you belong to another my love
And half a love that just isn't enough

I am so tired
(So tired)
And I just can't wait around for you
I am so tired
(So tired)
And I always thought we'd see it through, yea

I've waited all this time for you
Believed your promises were true
I keep believin' that you mean what you say
Be mine tomorrow, now tomorrow's today

I am so tired
(So tired)
And I just can't wait around for you
I am so tired
(So tired)
And I always thought we'd see it through
Yea

And I often sit and wonder why
You're not with me tonight
I stayed at home remainin' true
While you do what you wanted to, yea

And I often sit and wonder why
Ohh, you're not with me tonight
I stayed at home remainin' true
While you do what you wanted to

I am so tired
(So tired)
And I just can't wait around for you
I am so tired
(So tired)
And I always thought we'd see it through
Yea
So tired, so tired
So tired, so tired
So tired, so tired
Yea
