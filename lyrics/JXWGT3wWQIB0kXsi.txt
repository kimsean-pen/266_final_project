So scream you, out from behind the bitter ache
You're hanging on the memory, you need most
You still want love, love's ugly, smooth and delicate
But not without affection, no not alone

And instead of wishing that it would get better
Man you're seeing that you just get angrier

And it's good that I'm not angry
Well I need to get over
Well I, I'm not angry, anymore

Cry when you cry, run when you run
Love when you love
Well now, represent the ashes
That you leave behind

And instead of wishing that the road had shoulder
Man you're seeing that you're sinking over time and you're blind

And it's good that I'm not angry
Well I need to get over
Well I, I'm not angry
Oh well, it's dragging me under
Well I, I'm not angry, angry yeah

I'm not angry and it's never been enough
It gets inside and it tears you up
I'm not angry and I've never been above it
You see through me don't you

Well it's good that I'm not angry
Well I need to get over
And I, I'm not angry
Ah well, it's dragging me under

Well I, I'm not angry
Well it's good that I'm not angry, oh anymore
