We turn and face each other
My fingers pull your hair
You wince and jerk my wrist off
I bite my lip and stare

Your stance at once defiant
I'm rigid to your pose
You clench your teeth in anger
My loving swells and grows

You give me evil fantasies
I wanna get inside your mind
Come on and live my fantasies
I'll show you evil you can't hide

You're dragged into my vision
Trapped, serving to my needs
Maybe imagination
Is where my dark side feeds

You slide your nails down in me
I raise my structure high
You pout, I snarl, you whimper
And wave compassion 'bye (ohhh)

You give me evil fantasies
I wanna get inside your mind
Come on and live my fantasies
I'll show you evil you can't hide

A, give me evil

Gonna take you, wanna get through
Gonna make you do what I want

You give me evil fantasies
I wanna get inside your mind
Come on and live my fantasies
I'll show you evil you can't hide

You're dragged into my vision
Trapped, serving to my needs
Maybe imagination
Is where my dark side feeds

C'mon, evil. Yeah! You give me evil, evil fantasies
C'mon! You evil. Yeah! Gimme, gimme, gimme fantasies
I want it, you got it, those evil fantasies
Oh, you need it! I'm gonna give it!
Give it, give it, give it fantasy-ohhh!
C'mon and get it, get it! Fantasies...
