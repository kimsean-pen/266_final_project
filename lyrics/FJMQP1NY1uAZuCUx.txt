And everything feels empty
I rely on empty touch
To ignore the days that I hate myself and miss you too much
And everyone feels cold when they lack something familiar
There is light trides, where the sun was
This is harder than I thought
I will always look for you in the quiet, empty nothing
Where you were convinced there was only dark
In the sharpest objects
I saw your coat
I saw it like a martyr sees its body
I saw your coat
Like the shadow of a ghost that wouldn't leave here
I saw your coat
Hanging in surrender like a lifeline
I saw your coat
And I hate this, this is harder than I thought
