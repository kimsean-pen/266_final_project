Is it a sin, that I want it bad
Halfway to hell I've made my bed
Baby give in and we'll be gone
If I go will you follow me home
Just like a pill, it's going down
Just say the word and I'll take it now
Come get me high, so I won't be low

If I go will you follow me home tonight
You don't have to be alone tonight
If I go will you follow me

If I go will you follow me
Baby follow me

My name on your lips, sweat on your skin
I wanna love you again and again
Don't make me wait, cause I need to know

If I go will you follow me home tonight
You don't have to be alone tonight
If I go will you follow me

Will you, follow me
If I go will you follow me
Baby follow me

Nothing ever last forever
All we got is now or never
Baby we're is good as gone
Won't you follow me home
Won't you follow me
Nothing ever last forever
All we got is now or never
Baby we're is good as gone
Won't you follow me home

If I go will you follow me
Will you follow me, follow me
I will take you there
If I go will you follow me
If I go, will you follow
Baby follow me
Mi casa is tu casa
Baby
