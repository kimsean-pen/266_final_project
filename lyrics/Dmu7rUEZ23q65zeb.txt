All day we wait
Just to go back to the places that we know
Light grey, day breaks
Over my head and pouring down my throat

Ooh, oooh,
Howlin' out here for the morning light
I can't sing no more
Ooh, oooh
Coming on the dark we can lose our sight
What I gotta do this for?

Same bar, set high
Burning it up like whisky to a fire
I'd close my eyes
But I ain't going out like this tonight
I ain't going out like this tonight

Ooh, oooh,
Howlin' out here for the morning light
I can't sing no more
Ooh, oooh
Coming on the dark we can lose our sight
What I gotta do this for?

Running me down to the last round,
running me down til the well runs out
Running me down to the last round,
running me down til the well runs out
Running me down to the last round,
running me down til the well runs out
Running me down to the last round,
running me down til the well runs out
Running me down to the last round,
running me down til the well runs out
Running me down to the last round,
running me down til the well runs out

Ooh, oooh,
Howlin' out here for the morning light
I can't sing no more
Ooh, oooh
Coming on the dark we can lose our sight
What I gotta do this for?
Ooh, oooh
Howlin' out here for the morning light
I can't sing no more
