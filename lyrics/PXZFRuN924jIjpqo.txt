Don't look back
Over your shoulder
Keep your eye on freedom shore
'Cause you know
The brave men with you
Also pay the wages of war

You can read all about justice
In a million books and more
But there aren't words
To bring back Evers
Nor pay the price
That he stood for
So don't look back
Over your shoulder
Keep your eye on freedom shore
'Cause you know
The brave men with you
Also pay the wages of war

Well can't you hear the bells of Selma
Calling out their mournful chimes
Just another death for justice
Another sorrow that's yours and mine
So don't look back
Over your shoulder
Keep your eye on freedom shore
'Cause you know
The brave men with you
Also pay the wages of war

Well there are walls that make a prison
Many names that can bring hate
You tear â€˜em down and ride â€˜em over
Before you find
It's just too late
So don't look back
Over your shoulder
Keep your eye on freedom shore
'Cause you know
The brave men with you
Also pay the wages of war
