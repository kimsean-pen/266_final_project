I woke up tired and feeling old
And I wondered why by bed was cold
And I thought could you have gone?
And if so where and how long?
And why would I let you go?
Why would I ever let you go?

Oh but sometimes my mind could tell my heart that yes is no
Like sometime I might wake up old and all alone

Oh no, what if I never knew your name?
Oh my god, the thought's insane
What if your love is not the same
As it seems inside my brain?
What if you're not really in my sheets?
Oh, just the thought gives me the creeps

I woke up young in lovers love
And I felt my luck when I felt your touch
And my skin it wondered how
Yeah, my skin it wondered how
Could you be touching me right now
When in my sleep you can't be found?

Oh but somehow by some will we've carried our love through the years
Oh but somehow I still carry on, burdened by fears

Like oh, what if I never knew your name?
Oh my god, the thought's insane
What if your love is not the same
As it seems inside my brain?
What if you're not really in my sheets?
Oh, just the thought gives me the creeps

Oh no, what if I never knew your name?
Oh my god, the thought's insane
What if your love is not the same
As it seems inside my brain?
What if you're not really in my sheets?
Oh, just the thought gives me the creeps

Oh no, just the thought gives me the creeps
