We can do anything
Just you and me baby baby baby baby baby babe
Wait and see.

Hold on, sit tight.
Are you ready for a crazy ride?
Your on your own, it ain't right.
Something gotta give tonight.

So if you wanna run, run and disappear.
You and I can bust our way right out of here.

Together we can.
Shoot the moon, stop the rain even ride a hurricane,
If we wanna.
Together we can.
Walk into space,
Save the human race, do you think we oughta, oughta?

Here we take our time, we can have it all.
I don't think we're gonna make it on our own.

Together we can.
Even ride a hurricane, if we wanna. (C'mon)
Walk into space save the human race.
Do you think we oughta?
Together we can!
