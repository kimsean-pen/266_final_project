Like the sun comes crashing down
You will set the world on fire.
Deep down You got to know why
We prepare for war
It's vengeance or sacrifice
Incapability to hide from the
predictable desire.
Time's up, all in I will rise to top
Going to crush us put us to sleep
It's lifting us up
As our instincts come alive
Got to never give in as we're falling
into the sky.
This time gonna let us all shine
One makes three in this chemistry

Trinity is the key to feel a live
It's just shattered world,
there right before your eyes
*before your eyes*
You see the will to fight,
As we live and die
I see the light, It's trinity, Unite

As I set the sky alight
An inescapable empire
Heads up, You got to realise
That glow you see forever will haunt us
As we break the chains of might
in dependence of the fire
Give up this ground sterilized for all time
Going to crush us put us to sleep
It's lifting us up
As our instincts come alive
Got to never give in as we're falling
into the sky.
This time gonna let us all shine

Trinity is the key to feel a live
It's just shattered world,
there right before your eyes
*before your eyes*
You see the will to fight,
As we live and die
I see the light, It's trinity, Unite

Going to crush us put us to sleep
It's lifting us up
As our instincts come alive
Got to never give in as we're falling
into the sky.
This time gonna let us all shine

Trinity is the key to feel a live
It's just shattered world,
there right before your eyes
*before your eyes*
You see the will to fight,
As we live and die
I see the light, It's trinity, Unite
