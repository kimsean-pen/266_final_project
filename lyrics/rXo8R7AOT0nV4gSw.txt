We used to stay in all night
When it got cold outside
We used to make a bed on the floor
And talk about nothing
'Til the morning

I can't believe that we're standing

Girl, I need you to know that
We've got this now
Haven't we, haven't we?

I could be anywhere as long as you're there
Smoking my cigarettes, inhaling my hair

I can't believe that we're standing

Girl, I need you to know that
We've got this now
Haven't we, haven't we?

Can we stay like this?
Do I even have to ask?
I know we will, I know we will

Girl, I need you to know that
We've got this now
Haven't we, haven't we?
Girl, I need you to know that
We've got this now
Haven't we, haven't we?
Girl, I need you to know that
We've got this now
Haven't we, haven't we?
