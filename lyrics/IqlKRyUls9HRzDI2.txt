I can't even think of words to match the way I'm feeling
I don't even think a book can say enough for you
I can only try my best to put it in a song
I guess, you try to speak I know you tell the truth

If I could freeze our small amount of time together
then we could make believe this world would never end
Unfortunately truth is cold
So you stay young while I get old
But always know, I'm your best friend

Nothing is the same everything is a better change
sometimes I see silence in your eyes
Let it all crash down
When it ends it begins with you
I'm going to look every time you do

And I'm as scared as anybody who has done this
I would have given up but not defeat
You took my love, turned it a around, you put
my feet back on the ground, I owe you, eternally

Nothing is the same everything is a better change
sometimes I see silence in your eyes
Let it all crash down
When it ends it begins with you
I'm going to look every time you do

I'm always
I'm always
I'm always here
I'm always
I'm always
I'm always here

Nothing is the same everything is a better change
sometimes I see silence in your eyes
Let it all crash down
When it ends it begins with you
I'm going to look every time you do
