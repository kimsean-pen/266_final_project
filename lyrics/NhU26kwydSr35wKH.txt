Fed up of girls in pretty dresses
With boys who want to teach them a lesson
Sick of the sight of my old lover
Went under sheets and covers to get away from him

I can't see what he once meant to me
I think it's time I put him out of my mind

So I took a glimpse of Montana
Now nothing else matters
I'll heal eventually
How I adore you Dory Previn
Turned you up to eleven for the band's ears to bleed

I can't see what he once meant to me
Do you think it's time I put it out of my mind?
Do you think it's time I put it out of my mind?

I can't see what he once meant to me
Do you think it's time I put it out of my mind?
I can't see what he once meant to me
Do you think it's time I put it out of my mind?

I can't see what he once meant to me
Do you think it's time I put it out of my mind?
I can't see what he once meant to me
Do you think it's time I put it out of my mind?
I think it's time I let my love for him die
