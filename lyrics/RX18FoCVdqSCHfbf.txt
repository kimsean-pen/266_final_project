...
Seems we're alone
We're fixated
Just waiting for something
As time goes by

We got lost on the way
As we wait for tomorrow
To find our way home
(Find our way home)
I shed my skin

And like a butterfly
We'll find our wings and then we'll fly
Far away
So far away

And when we're way up high
We'll look back down with different eyes
Let's take our time
Awake this life

Dreams made of stone
Gone is patience
Cus a lifetime alone
Is way too long

Things are better this way
So we wait for tomorrow
To find our way home
(Find our way home)
I shed my skin

And like a butterfly
We'll find our wings and then we'll fly
Far away
So far away

And when we're way up high
We'll look back down with different eyes
Let's take our time
Awake this life

So spread your wings
And take my hand
Tonight will be the end
...
And like a butterfly
We'll find our wings and then we'll fly
Far away
So far away
And when we're way up high
We'll look back down with different eyes
Let's take our time
Awake this life
