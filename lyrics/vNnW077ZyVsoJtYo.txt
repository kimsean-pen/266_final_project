What do you say we leave a little crack in the window?
What a lovely day, we should leave the curtains drawn
We're just two neighbors sending a friendly "hello"
And we really like to know what's going on

Who's the new-in, what's he doing in the neighborhood?
We should bake him a pecan or apple pie
We insist they can't resist it 'cause it tastes so good
Though they may think it's 'cause we're sweet
We get to sneak a peek inside

That's why we leave a itty-bitty crack in the window
That's why we tend the roses in the lawn
We're just two neighbors sending a friendly "hello"
And we really like to know what's going on

What's going on
