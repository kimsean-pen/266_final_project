My cry for a fist-full of sand
Breathes silence
Hold me, if only I can see land
The world just blinks

Lead me, I'm stupid from a lesson learned
You've learned nothing
You told me to get lost to find myself

First it bleeds then it stops
I feel like I've been filling up
Why change if you can't be bad?

Ahh, ahh, ahh, yes, I would
Believe me now
Ahh, ahh, yes, I would
And I can't sink now
Ahh, ahh, yes, I would

But what if I'm never thrown that bone
And what if this tear in my side just
Pours and pours and pours

I wonder if they'd notice that I'm not around
The loss of a lonely man
Never makes much of a sound

First it bleeds then it stops
I feel like I've been filling up
Why change if you can't be back?

Ahh, ahh, ahh, yes, I would
Believe me now
Ahh, ahh, yes, I would
And I can't sink now
Ahh, ahh, yes, I would

Believe then
Believe me now
Ahh, ahh, yes, I would
Ahh, ahh, yes, I would

Believe me now
Ahh, ahh, yes, I would
And I can't sink now
Ahh, ahh, yes, I would

Believe me now
Ahh, ahh, yes, I would
And I can't sink now
Ahh, ahh, yes, I would
