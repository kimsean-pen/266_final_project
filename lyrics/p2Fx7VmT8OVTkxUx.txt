I am a death house, haunted mirror
Acerbic heart, ain't nothing pure in here
I keep the memories of a broken you
Sing, sing the stories of a fractured few

I believe I will open up
For all my rage will surely come undone (sing sing death house)

I am agnostic, but I hang on a cross
Faithless, saintless, my sin stabs
I wear the crown of oblivion
Rule and aching void, watch my sun burn out

I am a death house, haunted mirror
Acerbic heart, ain't nothing pure in here
You close the door, I sing pleading
Save me before you leave, you're leaving

I believe I will open up
For all my rage will surely come undone
I believe I will open up
For all my rage will surely come undone (sing sing death house)

I believe, I will, I will
I will distiller my rage away (sing sing death house)
I believe, I will, I will
I will distiller my rage away (sing sing death house)

Sing sing death house
Sing sing death house
Sing sing, ha ha, fuck it!
