How do you look into the mirror
When you're too tired to fake a smile
Your misery won't make you look thinner
Reality is bitter
It's your hand and yours alone that has opened
The door to let their voices in
Into your head, under your skin
Fix your face or you will never fit in

Do you want me, do you want me
To burst your bubble now?
Do you want me, I will break it
Make it loud
Do you want me, do you want me
To break the paradigm
These rules were made by us
They break you up inside
They will break you down

Army of dolls stole your reflection
Army of dolls stole all your perfect imperfections
Just shut them out, don't let them in
Into our head
Do you really think
Misery tastes so much sweeter
Served with a perfect smile

Do you want me, do you want me
To burst your bubble now?
Do you want me, I will break it
Make it loud
Do you want me, do you want me
To break the paradigm
These rules were made by us
They break you up inside
They will break you down

Don't you look into the mirror
Army of dolls made you so bitter
Make-up magpul follow the leader
Never have seen a face much sweeter

Don't you look into the mirror
Army of dolls made you so bitter
Make-up magpul follow the leader
Never have seen a face much sweeter

Do you want me, do you want me
To burst your bubble now?
Do you want me, I will break it
Make it loud
Do you want me, do you want me
To break the paradigm
These rules were made by us
They break you up inside
They will break you down
