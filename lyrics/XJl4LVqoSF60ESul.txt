...
if you think nothing is yours
And if i think everything belongs to me
How wrong i'll be
None of us have anything
...
There's a place I never explored
Another world we have yet to conquer
And until then none of us have anything
...
...
If you think nothing is yours
And if I think everthing belongs to me
How wrong i'll be
None of us have anything
...
...
End
