I turn around and feel the sun in my face
Back foot in the grass turning next to you
I feel so right

All those flashes of old memories
My past, you and I, all that we've been through
I feel so alive

I was afraid, I was scared to fall
I can't believe that I almost lost it all

So I'm standing here locked to you
I realize that I need you now
To make my heart beat fast
You're the only one

And I'm sorry I'm such a fool
Baby, I know that I need you now
You are the only one

Who makes my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster, faster
You make my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster, faster
Baby, you make my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster, faster
You make my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster, faster

I used to think about destiny
My way, left or right
But boy, I was running in circles

And now you're standing in front of me
Hands down, you and I
This time I promise I won't let you go

I was afraid, I was scared to fall
Running from love and I almost lost it all

So I'm standing here locked to you
I realize that I need you now
To make my heart beat fast
You're the only one

And I'm sorry I'm such a fool
Baby, I know that I need you now
You are the only one

Who makes my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster, faster
Baby, you make my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster, faster
Baby, you make my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster, faster
You make my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster, faster

So baby, let's hold on
'Cause baby, as time goes
You are the only one
And I almost lost it all

So I'm standing here locked to you
I realize that I need you now
To make my heart beat fast
You're the only one

And I'm sorry I'm such a fool
Baby, I know that I need you now
You are the only one

Oh, you make my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster, faster
You make my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster, faster
Baby, you make my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster, faster
You make my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster, faster

Oh, you make my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster, faster
You make my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster, faster
Baby, you make my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster, faster

You are the only one
Who makes my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster, faster
Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster
Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster
