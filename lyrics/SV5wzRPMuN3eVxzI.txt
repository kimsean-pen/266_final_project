Do you ever get tired of feeling alone?
Hmmm-mmmm
When the lights come on and there's no one at home
Hmmm-mmmm

She said she wanted to break out, to break outta here
And I believed every move she made
She said she knew an easier way outta here
And I believed every word she said

I woke up this morning, had a funny feeling
Last thing I remember we were beautiful
The sun came up and God she had left me nothing
Where have all the good girls gone?
Woah
Woah
Where have all the good girls gone?

Hold tight, my love, and the stars will appear
Hmmm-mmmm
All the words she said when she shot me right here
Hmmm-mmmm

She said she knew an easier way outta here
And I believed every word she said

I woke up this morning, had a funny feeling
Last thing I remember we were beautiful
The sun came up and God she had left me nothing
Where have all the good girls gone?
Woah
I woke up this morning, had a funny feeling
Last thing I remember we were beautiful
The sun came up and God she had left me nothing
Where have all the good girls gone?
Woah

Where have all the good girls gone?
Where have all the good girls gone?
Where have all the good girls gone?
Where have all the good girls gone?

I woke up this morning, had a funny feeling
Last thing I remember we were beautiful
The sun came up and God she had left me nothing
Where have all the good girls gone?
Woah
I woke up this morning, had a funny feeling

The sun came up and God she had left me nothing
Where have all the good girls gone?
Woah

Where have all the good girls gone?
