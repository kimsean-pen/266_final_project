Doing like 95 on the interstate
Looking for a dinner plate
I'm hungry, you called me
To say you got something, and it's all me

Can you hold me down for one night, like I got three strikes?
I need you to free me, it's a prison inside my mind
Break me, taste me
Roll me up like the northern lights
Can you hold me down for one night, like I got three strikes?

Lit up, burnt out
Closer to God than we've ever been now
Sipping slow, talking loud
Enough soul, we could sell out

Can you hold me down for one night, like I got three strikes?
I need you to free me, it's a prison inside my mind
Break me, taste me
Roll me up like the northern lights
Can you hold me down for one night, like I got three strikes?
