was i left behind?
someone tell me, tell me i survived
and don't look so surprised that i'm home, but just for tonight
with rough hands and sore eyes
so don't speak, i am tired
let's just live through this lie

she says i swear too much
she says a lot of things
well, i'd swear every other word if i could
for her, i'll make an attempt
sometimes love isn't about how much someone suits you
but how much you're willing to change to suit them

all my bones are dust
two people too damaged too much, too late
and my heart sealed with rust
two people too damaged too much, too late
these hands will always be rough
two people too damaged too much, too late
i know this won't count for much
two people too damaged too much, too late

one day my hands were too soft
one day she said, "i'm tired"
one day her clothes were on my floor
one day, empty bottles

i'm not saying she's my last
i'm just saying that she could have been
it doesn't matter how rough these hands get
it doesn't matter cause i'm not her man

rough hands
rough days
rough hands
rough nights
rough hands
rough season
rough hands
rough fights...

all my bones are dust (rough hands, rough days)
two people too damaged too much, too late
and my heart's sealed with rust (rough hands, rough season)
two people too damaged too much, too late
these hands will always be rough (rough hands, rough days)
two people too damaged too much, too late
i know this won't count for much (rough hands, rough season)
two people too damaged too much, too late
