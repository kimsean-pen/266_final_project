Don't quit on me
Don't quit on me now tonight
The last time
You poison my
You poison my mind tonight
You poison my

I'm running away
Get out of sight
Bruised legs, cut lips
It wasn't right
Im running away
Get out of sight
Bruised legs
Cut lips
I wanna see ya

I don't dance cause I want to
I dance cause I need to
I'm gonna die to own this room
Yeah I need this more than you
I can't help but wonder
Is this romance?
Standing still makes me confused
What happened to the kid in you
I wanna see ya play

Don't quit on me
Don't quit on me now tonight
The last time
You poison my
You poison my mind tonight
You poison my

I'm running away

Cut lips
