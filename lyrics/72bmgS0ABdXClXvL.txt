I once shone but now I'm old
Give my secrets up like gold
There's a fire beneath my feet
Lights the longest losing streak

Love don't live here anymore
Don't come knocking on my door
I just can't get peace of mind
There's a piece that I can't find

So what if I run?
Where would I run to?
So what if I run?
Where would I run to?

Days like these you can't kill
Lives like mine you just can't fill
Blow some money, kill some time
Soak myself in blood red wine
There's no fever coming on
Love is leaving, dead and gone

Love don't live here anymore
Don't come knocking on my door

So what if I run?
Where would I run to?
So what if I run?
Where would I run to?

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
(So what if I run?)
Where would I run to?

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
