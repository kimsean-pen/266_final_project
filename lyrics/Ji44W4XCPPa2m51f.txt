Na-na-na-na-nada
Na-na-na-na-nada
Na-na-na

My pocket hefty, actin' like it's nada
Fresh off that yacht, move steady in designer
(Step up my game, I don't care about what you think)
This Henny agua, he gon' do me proper

I got 'em all like it's nada
Way up high like NASA
(When I bring something different, you gotta take it)
I got 'em all like it's nada
Way up high like NASA
(When I bring something different, you gotta take it)

(Speeding up my spacecraft, I arrived early
I'm used to them numbers I don't even count, it's just whatever
Counting down to the doomsday so I can be free from gravity
When the day comes everything will be gone like I see the future)
Pathetic, a bird ain't gonna fly in a cage
Too flashy a Wraith, I don't feel no way
Flexin' all day, in the end I don't got nothing when I left
(Looking back,
I'm standing at the end of the world then I got cold feet)
Cuz I got nada, they all fade

My pocket hefty, actin' like it's nada
Fresh off that yacht, move steady in designer
(Step up my game, I don't care about what you think)
This Henny agua, he gon' do me proper

I got 'em all like it's nada
Way up high like NASA
(When I bring something different, you gotta take it)
I got 'em all like it's nada
Way up high like NASA
(When I bring something different, you gotta take it)
