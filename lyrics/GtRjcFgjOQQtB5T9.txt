Can you hear the thunder?
Can you feel the rain, it pours?
Nail down all your windows
Then barricade the doors!
Mother Nature's fury
Takes you by the hand.

Showing all but mercy
Wreaking death upon the land!
GO!
Caught in the eye of the storm!
Did the heavens just open and fall?
We are caught in the eye of the storm
All that's left are just bodies to mourn!
Can you see the lightning?
Can you feel the wind, it soars?

Pack up your belongings
Let chaos take control!
(Take control!)
Mother Nature's fury

Takes you by the hand.
Rip this world to pieces
Bid farewell to all you know!
GO!
Yeah!

Caught in the eye of the storm!
Caught in the eye of the storm!
Caught in the eye of the storm!
Can you hear the thunder?
Can you feel the rain, it pours?
Nail down all your windows
Then barricade the doors!
Mother Nature's fury
Takes you by the hand.
Showing all but mercy
Wreaking death upon the land!
GO!
To mourn!
