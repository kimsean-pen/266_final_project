if timing is everything
then i have nothing
cause i've been wondering
so i'll ask you for one thing
don't leave me in my body for too long
all i've got are my silly bedroom songs
dont leave me in my body for too long
all i've got are my silly bedroom songs

if courage is power
then i am a coward
cause i've been hiding
naked in the jungle
i am a quiet dreamer
i am a make-believer
i am a quiet dreamer
i am a make-believer
