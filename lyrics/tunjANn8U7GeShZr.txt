Easier said than done
Easier said than done
Calling you baby
Easier said than done
Easier said than done
Calling you baby
Calling you baby

You know I ache about
The time we had together
I've been through more with you
Than I have with anyone, ever

Why I gotta let you go?
Easier said than done
Why I gotta let you go?
Easier said than done
Why I gotta let you go?
Easier said than done
Easier said than done
Calling you baby
Easier said than done
Easier said than done
Calling you baby

I know just what you like
It's been a long time
The more I try I hold you tight
You don't believe it
It's not right

Why I gotta let you go?
It's easier said than done
Why I gotta let you go?
It's easier said than done
Why I gotta let you go?
It's easier said than done
Why I gotta let you go?

Why I gotta let you go?
It's easier said than done
Why I gotta let you go?
It's easier said than done
Why I gotta let you go?
It's easier said than done
Why I gotta let you go?
