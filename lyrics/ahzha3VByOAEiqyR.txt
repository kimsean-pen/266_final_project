Feat. Maya

every time I'm with you
and every time we meet
I just lock myself until then you are from into deep
the way youre walking by
and the way you cought my eye
and the way i feel so bad when you say good bye

every time I'm with you
and every time we meet
I just lock myself until then you are from into deep
the way youre walking by
and the way you cought my eye
and the way i feel so bad when you say good bye

for the first time
you've got me baby
yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh
first time
you've got me baby
yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh
first time

you've got me baby
yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh

every time I'm with you
and every time we meet
I just lock myself until then you are from into deep
the way youre walking by
and the way you cought my eye
and the way i feel so bad when you say good bye

every time I'm with you
and every time we meet
I just lock myself until then you are from into deep
the way youre walking by
and the way youre walking by
and the way youre walking by (repeat till fade)

for the first time
you've got me baby
yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh
first time
you've got me baby
yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh
first time
you've got me baby
yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh
