1010 via two houses
It's been the fiery breeze from the like 1010

On me, on me
Away, ooh, on me
On me, on me
All of he light we was focusing
Darlin', in brown
Two houses on top of us
Holding us down
Don't wait, you and I could die today (Don't wait)
Precious face, wholly emotive, yeah
Shoo, shoo, shoo, little mosquito
Little nightmare, don't wake me
It'll be years before I could call you back, 'cause
This hurts, baby
I wanted so badly to be something free
Will you still be paying for me?
Oh, till the end

On me (On me)
(Morning, all you sexy, here's another one from the avatar themselves)
(1010 via the two houses, keep right here)
On me (On me)
(A new message will be coming through shortly)
On me (On me)
On me (On me)
(Morning, all you sexy, here's another one from the avatar themselves)
(1010 via the two houses, keep right here)
(A new message will be coming through shortly)

(Ooh) All of he light we was focusing
Darlin', in brown
Two houses on top of us
Holding us down
Don't wait, you and I could die today (Don't wait)
Your face so careful and precious, wholly emotive
On me, on me

(Umm, can I just say it one more time? I'm gonna say it one more time)
(And how would I say it)
It's been long enough since you left
It's been long enough (been alone by the grace of God)
(I like it when she sings)
(Check it, check it out, though)

Here I am bathin' in sunlight
Hoping you'll be alright
Blue in vein, yellow into white, asterisk
Pretty face (Pretty face), hoo, and escape
Your face so careful and precious
Keepin' me at baby
On me, on me (On me)
Away (On me), on me (On me)
On me (On me)
On me (On me)
On me (On me)
On me (On me)
On me (On me)
