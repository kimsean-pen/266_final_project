Bells ring into the night
Sounds like a mistress
On a rainy night
Hold your throne
Down together

And see the light that goes away
Leave my heart down by the water
He spins inside my soul
It isn't true about your father
Just hold me down by the water

They say you look like
A believer
Look up to see your weakness
In the sky
Nobody's out to buy your story
Nobody wants to know your reason why

Hold your hands out towards the water
In front of me to know I'm with you
Don't put it all into your hero
Look on if you believe
Look on if you believe

Look on if you believe
Don't want to say that I'm through with it
Just want to be
Right by your side
Right by your side
