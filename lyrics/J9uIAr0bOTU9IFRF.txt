Haven't you heard, it's all over the news today
This is the last time you'll see my face
Haven't you heard? You were never my friend
This is the last time you'll see my face

You think you're good and all
But now you hit the wall
The last time you'll see my face
I wish you good and all
That was the last straw
The last time you'll see my face

Haven't you heard I'll never play cool again?
This is the last time you'll see my face
Haven't you got enough of this game?
This is the last time you'll see my face

You think you're good and all
But now you hit the wall
The last time you'll see my face
I wish you good and all
That was the last straw
The last time you'll see my face

No way, no way
You got me playing on your sideshow
No way, no way
And now you'll hear me on the radio

No way, no way
You got me playing on your sideshow
No way, no way
And now you'll hear me on the radio

Everything out of control
Hits me like an undertow
Am I in a puppet show?

Everything out of control
Hits me like an undertow
Am I in a puppet show?

Everything out of control
Hits me like an undertow
Am I in a puppet show?

Everything out of control
Hits me like an undertow
Am I in a puppet show?...

No way, no way
You got me playing on your sideshow
No way, no way
And now you'll hear me on the radio

No way, no way
You got me playing on your sideshow
No way, no way
And now you'll hear me on the radio
