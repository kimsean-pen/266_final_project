I'm the air you breathe babe, I'm the sun
I'm the earth in your grave, and I'm the worm
Don't you worry baby, you're safe with me
I'm the poison apple in your tree

I'm the water dripping from your drain
I'm the spider crawling through your brain
Do I scare you baby, when I'm mad
I'm your own reflection, you wish you had

I'm the animal, I'm the underworld
I'm the blood and cocaine from your flag unfurled
I'm the stars in the sky, in the blue
I will always watch you, I will always watch you

I'm a box car baby, jug of wine
I'm a switchblade if you cross the line
I am what you made me and nothing more
I'm the broken lock thats on your door
