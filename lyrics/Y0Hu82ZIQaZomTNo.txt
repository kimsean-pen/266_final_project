It's Twelve O'Clock and I need your attention
It's like the alcohol
Making my head spin
Your scent is the rum
The room is a bottle
Keeping me hopeless 'til I wake tomorrow
If tonight ever makes a difference
The way that I feel
The way that I'll remember it
I'll take this down until the glass remains
Swallow the words that I was meant to say

It's a long drive back to Vegas Skies
So why don't I make one more wrong turn tonight

So say goodnight
Our first goodbye
I've only got forever and forever is fine
Just take your time
We'll stop the clock together and know that the timing was right

All of these guards they stand tall and defensive
Putting up walls around what once was innocent
They won't let me in, but I'm stronger than that
'Cause you stole my eyes and I've never looked back
Girl, last night I forgot to mention
The way that I feel, the way that I'll remember this
When we're this young
We have nothing to lose
Just a clock to beat and a hand to choose

It's a long drive back to Vegas Skies
So why don't I make one more wrong turn tonight

So say goodnight
Our first goodbye
I've only got forever and forever is fine
Just take your time
We'll stop the clock together and know that the timing was right

It's a long way down
Just fall into place and you'll fall into me
We'll make it out
You'll see

So say goodnight
Our first goodbye
I've only got forever and forever is fine
Just take your time
We'll stop the clock together and
Say goodnight
Our first goodbye
I've only got forever and forever is fine
Just take your time
We'll stop the clock together and know that the timing was right
