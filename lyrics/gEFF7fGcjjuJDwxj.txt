Go now don't look back we've drawn the line
Move on it's no good to go back in time

I'll never find another girl like you
For happy endings it takes two
We're fire and ice, a dream won't come true

Sara, Sara
Storms are brewin' in your eyes
Sara, Sara
No time is a good time for goodbyes

Danger, in the game when the stakes are high
Branded, my heart was branded while my senses stood by

I'll never find another girl like you
For happy endings it takes two
We're fire and ice, a dream won't come true

Sara, Sara
Storms are brewin' in your eyes
Sara, Sara
No time is a good time for goodbyes

('Cause Sara) loved me, like no one ever loved me before
(And Sara) hurt me, no one could ever hurt me more
(And Sara) Sara
(And Sara) nobody loved me anymore

I'll never find another girl like you
We're fire and ice, a dream won't come true

Sara, Sara
No time is a good time, oh

Sara, Sara
Storms are brewin' in your eyes
Sara, Sara
No time is a good time for goodbyes
Sara, Sara
Storms are brewing in your eyes
Sara, Sara
No time is a good time
Ooh, Sara
Why did it, why did it
Why did it all fall apart
