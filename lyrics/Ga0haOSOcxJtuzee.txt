Hey, come inside
While I stand here acting bold
Can't stand to feel this way
Clear out the cobwebs in my soul

This time I turn around
And things have changed
Now I don't feel the same

Start a fight
I can't defend
One more time
Dammit, I changed again

Now I don't see
Things the way I did before
Can't stand to feel this way
Things I feel yesterday
Don't matter anymore
It doesn't make any sense
To feel so different day to day
(Can't stand to feel this way)
When nothing's changed except for me

Next time I turn around, things have changed
Now I don't feel the same, yeah
Start a fight, I can't defend, one more time
Dammit, I changed again

Turn around, things have changed
Now I don't feel the same, yeah
Start a fight, I can't defend, one more time
Dammit, I changed again

Turn around, things have changed
Now I don't feel the same, yeah
Start a fight, I can't defend, one more time
Dammit, I changed again

Turn around, things have changed
Now I don't feel the same, yeah
Turn around, I can't defend, one more time
Dammit, I changed again

I see it
