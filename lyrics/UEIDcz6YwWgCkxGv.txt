took a toke o tom's cig, but
my stomach don't want it
shared a chocolate stout and
it made me vomit
tried to get the high, but
my head ... . . it's spinning again ... . .
had a mulberry // turns out
i'm kind of allergic
as soon as bobby had started the
car, i felt sick
try to understand what my system
suddenly wants to reject
the signs keep telling me to
stay away from what
my body don't want
because my body don't want
it so stay away
from what
my body don't want
and when i am o.k.
it's tempting, to let it
slip my mind that i've felt so gross
i'd regret it
elle a dit qu'il faut que je le laisse
pendent que j'suis en avant du jeu,
mais je veux avoir un petit peu
can't stay away from what
my body don't want
because my body to want
to stay away from what
my body don't want
