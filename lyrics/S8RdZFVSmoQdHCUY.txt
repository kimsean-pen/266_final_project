I want you out of my head
You thought that I was the one
They found my body instead

I want you out of my head
You woke up and I was gone
Fuck how I hated your friends

Go tell them how I'm a mess
Why are you waiting for him?
I want you, B, I'm for sure
Bury me under your floor
Talk to me when you're asleep
Ghost at the end of your bed
Sullii, just come back to me
Baby, I'm already dead

I want you out of my head

I want you out of my head
You woke up and I was gone
Fuck how I hated your friends

House at the end of my road
42, area code
Told me you came by yourself
Ice on the road as you left
Talk to me when you're asleep
Tell me that you love me more
I hope you never wake up
Bury me under your floor

I want you out of my head
You thought that I was the one
They found my body instead

I want you out of my head
You woke up and I was gone
Fuck how I hated your friends

I want you out of my head
You thought that I was the one
They found my body instead

I want you out of my head
You woke up and I was gone
Don't make me do this again
