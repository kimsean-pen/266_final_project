Well, it's midnight, damn right
We're wound up too tight
I've got a fist full of whiskey
The bottle just bit me

Oh, that shit makes me bat shit crazy
We've got no fear, no doubt
All in balls out

We're going off tonight
To kick out every light
Take anything we want
Drink everything in sight

We're going till the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

We're screaming like demons
Swinging from the ceiling
I got a fist full of fifties
Tequila just hit me

Oh, we got no class, no taste
No shirt, and shit faced
We got it lined up, shot down
Firing back straight crown

We're going off tonight
To kick out every light
Take anything we want
Drink everything in sight

We're going till the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Ticking like a time bomb
Drinking till the nights gone
Well, get you hands off of this glass
Last call my ass

Well, no chain, no lock
And this train won't stop
We got no fear, no doubt
All in balls out

We're going off tonight
To kick out every light
Take anything we want
Drink everything in sight

We're going till the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight

Ooh, ooh, ooh

We're going off tonight
To kick out every light
Take anything we want
Drink everything in sight

We're going till the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight
