The beginning of all beginnings
The era of nonexistence
When the Earth wasn't the Earth
When our planet was a fireball
It was raining heavily for a thousand years
And the fireball became an ocean
That cooking water, the primal soup
A natural life-giving potion

This substance strove to find a way
To create another form of miracle

I brought a myriad atoms and turn them into your flesh
Regenerated through destruction and chaos
While the young world was sculpting itself
No one could notice how you stroke a different pose

Voracious ape who walks upright
Who deserts life to satisfy his appetite
Don't you remember you were the size of a bean?
Now what a shame to wear the name of a 'human being'

Oh, here you are! Vertically standing!
He, who calls himself intelligent
But has not much for understanding
Oh, here you go, Mr. Know-it-all!
I made a mistake when I created you long time ago

Oh, here you go
Oh, here you go
Oh, here you go

Just the mention of your name
Would make the whole world start to shake
Who gave you right to save your life
By taking life from others?
By taking life away!

By taking life away!
By taking life away!

Bloodthirsty ape who walks upright
What shall I do to humble your appetite?
Bloodthirsty ape who walks upright
What shall I do to humble your appetite
