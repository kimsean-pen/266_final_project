I wish that there could be more days in summer
I wish that autumn wouldn't come so soon
'Cause when the sun goes away
I'm left in the shade

Oh, I wish that you could warm me in the winter
They say that springtime is so beautiful
But I see nothing but rain
And short windy days

And I only feel safe
When your arms are wrapped around me

So forget the clouds, I don't feel the rain
Even though the seasons may change
I see the sun when I hear your name
Give me a reason, a reason to start again, yeah

I wish that there could be more days in summer
I wish that autumn wouldn't come so soon
'Cause when the sun goes away
I'm left in the shade

Oh, I'd love to see the leaves fall in September
And the snow drops in December just the same
But it leaves me in a daze
Can't wait to see your face, oh

Yeah, and I only feel safe
When your arms are wrapped around me

So forget the clouds, I don't feel the rain
Even though the seasons may change
I see the sun when I hear your name
Give me a reason, a reason to start again

I only feel safe when I'm in your arms
It's another day that we can't escape
It won't be too long till love finds it's way
To start again

So forget the clouds, I don't feel the rain
Even though the seasons may change
I see the sun when I hear your name
Give me a reason, a reason to start again

Oh yeah, yeah
I said I love you, I love you, I love you
Oh, yes I do, I truly love you
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah, oh

Oh yeah, hey yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh
I said now take me to the end for me
Yeah hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
