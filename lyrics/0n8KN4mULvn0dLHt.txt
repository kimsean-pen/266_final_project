Ayo
Let's take it back to them days
Counting sheep on Sadie Hannah's floor
Carpet was my baby mama
80 dollar profit from the coffee I poured
Rent-A-Center calling everyday
Nobody home, they're knocking on the door
Now I skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
In toys I only dreamed that I could afford
Now I roll through Okaga, California

I ride to California
These frog oval goggles
I'm leaning out the window
OJ shining on me
Simp-Sun shining on me
Slick circles floating
Out this world
Yea yea

Run it, run it, run it, run it
I rock, I roll, I bloom, I glow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (What you say?), I bloom, I glow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (Let 'em know), I bloom, I glow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (One more time), I bloom, I grow
(Let's go!)

Ain't nobody fucking with T, but that may just be my ego
But don't be too cool, you may freeze
Because niggas get stuck in the cold (Man, look at this ice)
Shit weighs a ton, water your garden my nigga and stunt
(Stunt on these niggas)
Tell these black kids they could be who they are
Dye your hair blue, shit, I'll do it too
Look, I smell like Chanel
I never mall grip with my manicured nails
I coconut oil the skin
I keep the top low 'cause the follicles thinnin'
But other than that, man, it feels like I'm winning
Went from statistic to millionaire
CNN doubted 'cause my skin is dark
But they forget when I get in my car

I'm leaning out the window
OJ shining on me
Simp Sun shining on me
Slick circles floating
Vro we off this world
Run it, run it, run it, yea

I glow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (What you say?), I bloom, I glow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (Let 'em know), I bloom, I grow (I grow)
I rock, I roll (One more time), I bloom, I-
(Let's go!)

Flower boy T, nigga that's me
Rooted from the bottom, bloomed into a tree
Took a little while, nigga making leaves
Keep 'em in the branches so my family can eat
Favorite color green, energy is strong
Giving niggas life like birdies and the beez
Dropping them seeds, not what you want
You don't know what I keep in the trunk... tree

Ah, shit!

Run it, run it, run it, run it
Run it
Run it
Run it
