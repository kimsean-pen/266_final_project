I've been through the desert
And I've been across the sea
I've been walking through the mountains
I've wandered through the trees for her

I have been trying to find her
Want to give what I got, she lit a fire
But now she's in my every thought

Where, could that girl have gone
Where, I've wandered far
Where, could that girl have gone
She left no trail but I cannot fail

I will find her
But now she's in my every thought

But now she's in my every thought
Where, could that girl have gone
Where, I've wandered far
Where, could that girl have gone

She left no trace but I know her face, I will find her
When last I saw her she was dancing all alone
Perhaps my chance was then, I'll never know
I'll search the world until there's no place left to go

And if she leaves it, I will follow, yes, I will follow
But now she's in my every thought

But now she's in my every thought
I've been through the desert
And I've been across the sea
I've been walking through the mountains
I've wandered through the trees for her
I have been trying to find her
Want to give what I got, she lit a fire
But now she's in my every thought
