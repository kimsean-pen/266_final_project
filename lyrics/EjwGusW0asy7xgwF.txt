No, woman no cry
No, woman no cry
No, woman no cry
No, woman no cry
Said, said
Said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Ob-observing the hypocrites
As they would mingle with the good people we meet (meet)
Good friends we have
Oh good friends we've lost
Along the way (way)

In this great future
You can't forget your past
So dry your tears, I say

And, no woman no cry
No, woman no cry
Dear, little darlin'
Don't shed no tears
No, woman no cry

Said, said
Said I remember when we used to sit

In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire light
As it was logwood burnin' through the night (night)
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge
Of which I'll share with you (ooh)
My feet is my only carriage
So I've got to push on through

But while I'm gone I mean

Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright

Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright, yeah
Everything's gonna be alright

No, woman no cry
Oh, no, no (no, woman no cry)
Woman, little sister
Don't shed no tears
No, woman no cry
