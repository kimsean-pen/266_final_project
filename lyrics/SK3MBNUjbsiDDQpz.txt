Old is my moon - Circle is complete
Long has been the way - The day is giving in
The dusk is thickening, cold engulfs the shore
I hear across the stream as Charon blows the horn
One more summer I ask for, I crave
One more autumn just to finish my song

Grant me this wish, bestow this gift
Ye noble gods I pray
When all is done, I'll go down with the sun
And welcome the twilight that falls

I know its in vain
For it's my time
There is no delay
Last light will hide

Hearken now to the trumpet call
As it echoes in the dark (whirls through the night)
Time has come to say the farewells
Step down into the shades

I scrape the sand that's running out, slipping away
Dripping now through this weary hands
Vanishing into thin air
All I ask is one more day to redeem it all
Then gladly I will pass and welcome the silent world

With no sound, upon the calm stream
The black boat moves, like mist on the waves

Slowly Charon rows, slowly sky turns
Stars fade away, we enter the shades

But a wanderer I am on the heaths of night
On this shore now ends my prolonged path
I am home at last
Tonight my dust is being gathered here
And brought before my father
Set before his throne, I am home at last
