Calico, you'll always trace a pedigree
A better half, so contrary
Why are you so jealous?
Why are you so jealous?
Say you won't
Say you will attend to me
Space is all the light we need
Why are you so jealous?
Why are you so jealous?

We ran like fools
To chase our blues down
It seemed reminiscent
Patience growing thin
I'll sing for you again in the morning
In the morning baby
Passenger, I'm clinging to the driver's seat
But you've got all the fight we need
In your room, so selfish
In your room, so selfish
Ahh

We laughed like fools
To chase our blues down
I thought it familiar
Patience growing thin
I'll sing for you again in the morning
In the morning baby

I was always awake
Spy to your feels
Keen on the way we were
But I fell ill like our friends, corrupted by youth
And those who wanted more
If we ever became the things we lost, the things we left behind
I would wish for the past
When we were pure
Suffering intertwined
