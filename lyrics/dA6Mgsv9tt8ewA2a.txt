Once upon a time, I had a little money
Government burglars took it long
Before I could mail it to you
Still you are the only one

Now, I can't let it slip away
So, if the man with the ticker tape
Tries to take it
Well, this is what I'm gonna say

Blame it on Cain
Don't blame it on me
Oh, oh, oh, it's nobody's fault
But we need somebody to burn

Well, if I was a saint with a silver cup
And the money got low
We could always heat it up
And trade it in

But then the radio to heaven
Will be wired to your purse
And you can run down the wave band

Coast to coast, hand in hand
Bad for worse, curse for curse
Don't be dissatisfied
So you're not satisfied

Blame it on Cain
Don't blame it on me
Oh, oh, oh, it's nobody's fault
But we need somebody to burn

I think I've lived a little too long
On the outskirts of town
I think I'm going insane
From talking to myself for so long

Oh, but I've never been accused
But when they step upon your face
They wear that good look grin
I gotta break out one weekend

Before I do somebody in
But every single time
I feel a little stronger
They tell me it's a crime
Well, how much longer?

Blame it on Cain
Don't blame it on me
Oh, oh, oh, it's nobody's fault
But we need somebody to burn

Blame it on Cain
Oh, oh, oh, please don't blame it on me
It's nobody's fault
But it just seems to be his turn
