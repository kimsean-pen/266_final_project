I can see every tear you've cried
Like an ocean in your eyes
All the pain and the scars have left you cold
I can see all the fears you face
Through a storm that never goes away
Don't believe all the lies that you've been told

I'll be right here now
To hold you when the sky falls down
I will always
Be the One who took your place
When the rain falls
I won't let go

I'll be right here

I will show you the way back home
Never leave you all alone
I will stay until the morning comes
I'll show you how to live again

And heal the brokenness within
Let me love you when you come undone

I'll be right here now
To hold you when the sky falls down
I will always
Be the One who took your place
When the rain falls
I won't let go
I'll be right here
When daybreak seems so far away
Reach for my hand
When hope and peace begin to fray
Still I will stand
Right here now
To hold you when the sky falls down
I will always
Be the One who took your place
When the rain falls
I won't let go
When the rain falls
I won't let go
I'll be right here.
