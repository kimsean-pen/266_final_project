I knew it was love

Boys, they're dime a dozen
Boys they doin' nothing
For me any longer
Not be getting stronger

Boys a lot of women love you
But boys they just make me mad
All the little things that you do
Ain't gonna make me sad

Then I saw one lookin'
At me from afar

Then I knew it was you all along
I knew it was you all along
Suddenly I knew there was love
Then I knew it was you all along

You put my faith back in boys
Back in...

Boys I see you smilin'
Boys'll never take the blame
All the rotten things that you do
Always getting in my way

Then I saw one lookin'
At me from afar

Then I knew it was you all along
I knew it was you all along
Suddenly I knew there was love
Then I knew it was you all along

You put my faith back in boys
Back in.

Cross my heart and hope to die
Stick a needle in my eye
Cross my heart and hope to die
Stick a needle in my eye

Cross my heart and hope to die
Stick a needle in my eye
Then I knew it was you all along
I knew it was you along
Suddenly I knew there was love

You put my faith back in boys
Back in
Back in boys
Back in
Back in boys
Back in

You put my faith back in boys
Back in
Back in boys
Back in
Back in boys
Back in boys
