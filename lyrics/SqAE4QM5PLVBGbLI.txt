I bet you had a couple long nights sleepin' alone
I bet even on a short drive if our song came on
You'd pull over on the shoulder and cry
Thinkin' 'bout how we used to be
Girl, I bet you had a hard time gettin' over me

Oou, that might be true
But if you think gettin' over me was hard, try gettin' over you
I don't wanna make light of what you're goin' through
But if you think gettin' over me was hard, try gettin' over you
(Try gettin', try gettin', try gettin' over you)

Bet you never taste my kiss in a rum and coke
Bet you never spent all night at that old bar prayin', waitin', hopin'
That I might walk into your arms again like we never said goodbye
Make the cab take the long way by my place
To see if someone's parked outside

Oou, even if you do
If you think gettin' over me was hard, try gettin' over you
I don't wanna make light of what you're goin' through
But if you think gettin' over me was hard, try gettin' over you
Yaa-aa try gettin' over you

Movin' on and I can barely move
Yeah, you gotta face it baby, try gettin' over you
Oou, my point of view
If you think gettin' over me was hard, try gettin' over you
I don't wanna make light of what you're goin' through
But if you think gettin' over me was hard, try gettin' over you ya
Oh, try gettin' over you aah
