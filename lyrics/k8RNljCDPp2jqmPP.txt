Feel I can't breath
Thoughts spinning around
It's a new day, but it's the same like yesterday
Trying to find something to hold on to

Time is not my friend, more an enemy
When I want to dream
Waking up instead from a nightmare

Thoughts like ghosts
That's haunting me
My eyes burn from sleepless nights

Fear is an illusion
Don't let it get in your way
You are enough as you are
So remember that everyday

Falling down to the ground
Gasping for air
As the panic strikes like lightning through my body
Behind four walls like being a prisoner

Thoughts like ghosts
That's haunting me

Fear is an illusion
Don't let it get in your way
You are enough as you are
So remember that everyday

Fear is an illusion
Don't let it get in your way
You are enough as you are
So remember that everyday

An inner voice says rise, rise
My soul clings to every thought of hope
Sunbeams lead me to another state of mind

My thoughts like ghosts, haunting me
My eyes they burn, from sleepless nights
My thoughts like ghosts, haunting me
My eyes they burn, from sleepless nights
My thoughts like ghosts, haunting me
My eyes they burn, from sleepless nights
My thoughts like ghosts, haunting me
My eyes they burn, from sleepless nights

Fear is an illusion
Don't let it get in your way
Fear is an illusion
Don't let it get in your way
You are enough as you are
So remember that everyday
Fear is an illusion
Don't let it get in your way
You are enough as you are
So remember that everyday

Thoughts like ghosts
That's haunting me
