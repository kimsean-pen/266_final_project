These weapons of mass destruction
Around our world, threat to us all
Operated by fears, cold over years
Systematic death, terminal breath

Leaders of our time just stand behind
An arsenal to end us all
Fighting a war, we can't ignore
Destined to fall, cowards to all
Cowards to all
Cowards to all
Cowards to all
Cowards to all
Cowards
Cowards
Cowards
Cowards

We are losing, weapons controlling
This is the hour of your reckoning

These weapons of mass destruction
Around our world, threat to us all
Fighting a war, we can't ignore
Destined to fall, cowards to all
Cowards to all
Cowards to all
Cowards to all
Cowards to all
Cowards
Cowards

Cowards

We are losing, weapons controlling
This is the hour of your reckoning

No more arsenal threatens all
Heading for a downfall
Mass destruction, mass destruction
Mass destruction for all
