Ooh I got a new one for ya
I like the way that sounds
I'm 'bout to do it for ya
I like to break it down
This joint has got me open
Ooh that's my favorite song
I put my thang in motion
I do it all night long

I've been working hard and now the weekend is here

(Show me what you got) It's time to light one put it in the atmosphere
(Give it your best shot)
(Show me what you got) I got that lightning feeling from my head to my toes
(Give it your best shot)
(Show me what you got) So tonight I'm really gonna let myself go-oh
(Show me what you got)
