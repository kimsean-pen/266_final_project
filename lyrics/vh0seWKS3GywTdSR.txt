Soon the men
Taste their own normalcy
Ends that day
Consumed by all
Irrational thoughts depend
Then shape their taste

Let's call it change
Let's call it change

Once the fad
Permeates it's
Hip to care
Hip to hate it

Once the fad
Permeates it's
Hip to care
Hip to hate it

Laugh at the violence
Laugh at the violence

True to form
He's blind as his
Taste for cheap
Panther piss
He loves to live
Beyond the card
So count us in
To that Gucci clan The fat face

Let's call
The chase
I'll call it
A phase

Once the fad
Permeates it's
Hip to care
Hip to hate it

Once the fad
Permeates it's
Hip to care
Hip to hate it

Laugh at the violence
Laugh at the violence
Laugh at the violence

So sell your voodoo
And recognize this
Your last and only score
Got you hung up on your strut

Once the fad
Permeates it's
Hip to care
Hip to hate it
Once the fad
Permeates it's
Hip to care
Hip to hate it
Once the fad
Once the fad
Once the fad
Once the fad
I bought it
Laugh at the violence
Laugh at the violence
