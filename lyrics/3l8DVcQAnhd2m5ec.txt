I never want to be a distraction
You say as
You're unashamed and naked
I feel okay all over
Void of all composure
And I know this may sound narcissistic
I like the lips you kiss with
But I want to wear your lipstick
Cuz it means I got to kiss them

You say you like the sound of cigarettes after sex
And I say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah"

One, two hits
Her lips
And bad behavior
I'm in danger
Three, four a.m
The feeling's getting stranger
I'm in danger
Bad behavior

And I don't have time for your feelings
You told me
You're insecure, but don't be
Stay soft, but don't be gentle
It's altogether mental
Let's go to a place where we can forget
We haven't left the room yet
You eloquently stated
That leaving's overrated

You say you like the sound of cigarettes after sex
And I say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah"

One, two hits
Her lips
And bad behavior
I'm in danger
Three, four a.m
The feeling's getting stranger
I'm in danger

Oh, I inhale you in small doses
But adore you like the roses
When you're bad for me, yeah
But you're bad for me, yeah
You medicate me with your poses
I'm a lush, I know you notice
You're bad for me, yeah
But you're bad for me, yeah
You're bad for me, yeah
Ohhh, and I say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah"

One, two hits
Her lips
And bad behavior
I'm in danger
Oh, here we go again
Hope it don't lose its flavor
And I'm in danger
Yeah, I'm in danger
I think I know that you're bad for me
Oh, I know you're bad for me, yeah
