Oh won't you stay for a while
I'll take you on a ride
If you can keep a secret
Oh won't you stay for a while
Show me darkness baby, show me deepness
Oh won't you stay for a while

I'll take you on a ride
If you can keep a secret
Oh won't you stay for a while
Show me darkness baby, show me deepness
Oh won't you stay for a while
I'll take you on a ride

If you can keep a secret
Stay awhile, stay awhile
And I will make it worth your while, worth your while
Stay awhile, stay awhile

And I will go the extra mile, extra mile
Boy, if you wait until the lights go down
I got some tricks that help you scream it out
So stay awhile, stay awhile

And I will make it worth your while, worth your while
Oh won't you stay for a while
Oh won't you stay for a while
Oh won't you stay for a while
Oh won't you stay for a while
I'll take you on a ride
If you can keep one secret
