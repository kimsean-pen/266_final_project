When will this winter end?
The snow's been falling for months
The town all dressed in white
And my skin is burning from the wind

A cold sun in disguise
An assault from the morning light
My burial, I can't succeed
Frozen and paralyzed

Oh winter, oh winter
Oh winter, oh winter
Oh winter, oh winter
Oh winter, oh winter
Oh no

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Oh winter, oh winter
Oh winter, oh winter
Oh winter, oh winter
Oh winter, oh winter

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
