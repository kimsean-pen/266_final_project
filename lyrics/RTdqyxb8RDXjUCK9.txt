There's a train leaving town, If you hurry up I think you just might make it
Dammit I hope you make it
Conscience is a faint, unpleasant sound, You've worried enough, but here's your chance so take it
Dammit I hope you take it
A heart attack is sleeping in your chest, waiting until the timing's best
So make a move, while you're still breathing

Say so long to innocence
From underneath the evidence
You taste like Heaven, but God knows you're built for sin
You're built for sin
You're built for sin
You're built for sin

There's a lie, for every truth, If you take these pills, I think you just might make it
Dammit I hope you make it
When you were mine, was I for you, Just one cheap thrill just to help you make it
Dammit I hope you didn't fake it
Hypocrisy has really aged you well
The white on your nose is your secret to tell
So you should speak, while they're still listening

Say so long to innocence
From underneath the evidence
You taste like Heaven, but God knows your built for sin
You're built for sin
You're built for sin
You're built for sin

You can scream out loud
But your panic falls on deaf ears
This is where you've brought yourself
And this is what you've always feared
There's a faceless crowd, with no sympathy
So you can scream out loud
But there's no one listening

Say so long to innocence
From underneath the evidence
You taste like Heaven, but God knows your built for sin
You're built for sin
You're built for sin
You're built for sin
