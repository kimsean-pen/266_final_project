I know that hearts were loving
long before I was here.
And I'm not the first to ever cry
in my bed or in my beer.
There were songs before there was radio
of love that stays
and love that goes.
They were writing meloncholy tunes
and tearful words that rhyme.

Before my time.
Before my time.

There were songs in old dusty books
of love that's always been.
Sweet lovers in their glory
who are now gone with the wind.
Old fashioned love words spoken
then keep coming back around again
nothing's changed except the name,
their love burned just like mine.

Before my time.
Before my time.

And in the dim of yesterday
I can clearly see
that flesh and blood
cried out to someone
as it does in me.
And there was some old song that said,
"I love you til I die."

Before my time.
Before my time.

But what the old time master's had
is what I feel for you.
Love is love and doesn't change
in a century or two.
If someway they had seen and knew
how it would be for me and you
they'd wish for love like yours
and they would wish for love like mine.

Before my time.
Before my time.
