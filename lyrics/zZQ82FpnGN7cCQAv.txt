We don't get a million years
But it's long enough for me

Don't bring me back

Learn to love the little things
So don't fall with me
I'm only here once
Once is enough

Don't bring me back
Don't bring me back

You can have your strange beliefs
You can have your waking dreams
I'm learning to let it be
Like an endless sleep
