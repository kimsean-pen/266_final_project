When you dream of a dream
And you live in the world
Every hope is a hope
For the best don't want you resting my bones
And you're calling me now
I will see you all the time
Should be out there living the life
And not just watching you

Take me back
Before we all explode
Before we turn to stone
Before the light is gone
Take me back
To where it all began
To where our memories grow
Before the day goes off
Tonight we gotta live for
We gotta live for these days
Tonight, tonight, we'll remember
We'll remember these days

What a day to believe
To believe in the night
Want a date to belong
To a face in the crowd to the beat of your heart
And the moment begin
And you're working it out
And you're holding us all
In your hands, don't want you waiting for

Take me back
Before we lose control
Before the tables turn
Before we break it off
Take me back
To where it all began
To where our memories grow
Before they take us off

Tonight we gotta live for
We gotta live for these days
Tonight, tonight, we'll remember
We'll remember these days
