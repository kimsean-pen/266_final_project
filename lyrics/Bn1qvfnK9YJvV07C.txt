Some of them would leave me laughing in their way
Some of them wouldn't lay me low
One of them likes to make my heart to break
This was a different kind of love
With some of them I knew it best to hesitate
Some I've never seen again
Some of them they wanna be your friend
This was a different kind of love
Some of them I really, really, really blew
And some of it was all in vain
Some of them were blowing over before I knew
I need a different kind of love
Sometimes the only solace I can find is my old faded dreams
Can I get unstuck?
'Cause if it weren't too much
I need a different kind of love
Between the world and me
Tell me, what will it be?
Who do you love?
Tell me, who do you love?
Between the world and me
Now, what will it be?
Who do you love?
Tell me, who do you love?
Between the world and me
Now, what will it be?
Who do you love?
Tell me, who do you love?
Between the world and me
Now, what will it be?
Who do you love?
Tell me, who do you love?
Who do you love?
Tell me, who do you love?
Tell me, who do you love?
Tell me, who do you love?
Tell me, who do you love?
Tell me, who?
Between the world and me
What will it be?
Tell me, who do you love?
Tell me, who do you love?
Between the world and me
Now, what will it be?
Who do you love?
Tell me, who do you love?
Between the world and me
Oh, what will it be?
Who do you love?
Tell me, who do you love?
Between the world and me
Tell me, what will it be?
Who do you love?
Tell me, who do you love?
Who do you love?
Tell me, who do you love?
Who do you love?
Tell me, who do you love?
Tell me, who do you love?
Tell me, who?
