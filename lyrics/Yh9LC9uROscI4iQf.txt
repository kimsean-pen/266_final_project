You hear the whisper calling
You hear the whisper calling
You hear the whisper calling
You hear the whisper calling

Every comb of hair
The times you see red
Every hair on your head
Every thread on your back
Every piece of skin
Every mouth you feed
Every word that you said
Every drop that you bled

You hear the whisper calling
