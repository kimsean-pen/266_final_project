It's the way she fills my senses
It's the perfume that she wears
I feel I'm losing my defences
To the colour of her hair
And every, little, piece of her is right
Just thinking, about her
Takes me through the night

Everytime we meet
The picture is complete
Everytime we touch
The feeling is too much
She's all I ever need
To fall in love again
I knew it from the very start...
She's the puzzle of my heart

It's the way she's always smiling
That makes me think she never cries
I feel like I'm losing my defences yeah
To the colour of her eyes
And every, little, piece of her is right

Everytime we meet
The picture is complete
Everytime we touch
The feeling is too much
She's all I ever need
To fall in love again
I knew it from the very start...
She's the puzzle of my heart

Like a miracle she's meant to be
She became the light inside of me
And I can feel her like a memory
From long... ago

Everytime we meet
The picture is complete
Everytime we touch
The feeling is too much
Everytime we meet
The picture is complete
Everytime we touch
The feeling is too much
She's all I ever need
To fall in love again
I knew it from the very start...
She's the puzzle of my heart
