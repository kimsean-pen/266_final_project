Something happened in my life so sudden
I used to think I wouldn't mind
The short time that I had
At night I'd fly down country roads
And flip the lights off under the stars
My old truck couldn't do much
But it could sure fly right through the dark

Moved to California back at 22
Thought that I could cut right through my bitter youth
Felt like some unwanted dog wandering 'round in east LA
The sun beat down and burned me out
I lost myself, I lost the way
Looking back, I see it now
The emptiness that I couldn't deal with

But now I feel it
A reason to live

When you came into my life
I went through changes
Suddenly I got the chills when I felt danger
Now I want to live out
And to feel what it's like to have old love
Somehow you just spun me round
And showed me all the things that I forgot

And now I feel it
Now I feel it
A reason to live
Now I feel it
A reason to live
