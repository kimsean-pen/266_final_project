Counting on the morning for him
To make it back, take it off
You know what he wants if he's in drag
And he's keeping the lights down

To the top he's shooting
So you beg him back
He's a royal-
Charm you 'til you give him a slap
That microphone heart

Audeline
I question my design
Your opinion changed my mind
Don't leave me caught up

You can look
But to touch you'll have to pay the price
Open book, but-
Oh yeah, most of the pages are wired
Straight to his arm

He dropped the coin
'Cause he's got no problems sparing a dime
Not a boy, that's a man-
Can't you tell by the shine
Of his black magic lounge?

Audeline
I question my design
Your opinion changed my mind

Far behind
I struggle to pass the line
Motorcycle head of the lions
Don't leave me caught up

He spends his days
With what's-her-face
The seven feet of Shaman
She's being vague
He's in that phase
I'm by your place

Audeline
I question my design
Your opinion changed my mind
Don't leave me out
