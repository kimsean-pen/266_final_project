I have
I need to see you
We see
We see right through you
You don't like what we do
I have no patience for you
To a cross to be lost
I don't, don't like to see you
You are always so untrue
We don't, don't think like you do
I have no time left for you
You want it, you got it
The absolute best in town
I'm all broke down
Lead me up one more go around
You love to hate it
The absolute worst around
We're all broke down
Lead us up
One more go around
