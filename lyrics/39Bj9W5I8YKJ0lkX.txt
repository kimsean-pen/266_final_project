Someday I will walk away
When time ain't drawing on me like a blade
Back turned to the setting sun
Leaving behind Toronto's incessant hum

'Cause I was born and raised
To live beyond
The heft and weight
Of a world undone

But I don't mean to be a bother
I don't need you to take my burden away
And I ain't afraid of dying
Cold and alone

Traipsing though the utter dark
Walking underneath the dead moonlight
Without any great concern
For what I've missed or how many bridges have burned

Like a bird who flies
Away from the North
My heart will roam
In search of warmth

But I don't mean to be a bother
I don't need you to take my burden away
And I ain't afraid of dying
Cold and alone

When my time comes
When I was young
I didn't know too much
I thought that I could rule the world

Then I grew up
And found out life was hard
Harder than stone
