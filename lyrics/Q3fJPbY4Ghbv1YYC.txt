Ooo
It sounds just like a scream
I don't know what you mean
Your witchcraft's all around me in your ragged pagan scene
You tell me all the ways around my garden that you like
I float just like a bubble heading for the spike

All is well between the breasts of passenger, and slave
We'll never make it out alive to join witches' rave

You'd like to see him suffer for your fantasy, and thrill
He fell sick while we made love, he's out there, somewhere still
Oh, I feel the spell that you have cast
Hot, pink, nasty bubble gum

Coming down just like a big red coal
I can't help from looking outside for a guarantee

I can't help from looking outside for a guarantee
Hey
I try to keep all hidden when you come around
Oh no
The sight of broomsticks sliding on the ground
You're levitating something
'Cause I feel so collectible
We're all lying natural
He's watching from a window up above I see
He loves you

I'll bring you closer
Something in my fate says it's not right for me
Tell me
Am i cursed?
Or am i blessed?
I can't tell
Oh yes
Cause all is well between the breast of passenger, and slave
I'll never make it out alive
Join witches' rave
Ooo
I can't help from looking outside for a guarantee
For a guarantee
