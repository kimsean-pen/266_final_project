Don't cry victim to me
Everything we are and used to be is buried and gone
Now it's my turn to speak
It's my turn to expose and release what's been killing me

I'll be damned fighting you
It's impossible, impossible
Say goodbye with no sympathy

I'm entitled to overcome
Completely stunned and numb
Knock me down, throw me to the floor

There's no pain; I can't feel no more
I'm entitled to overcome
Overcome

Finally see what's beneath
Everything I am and hope to be cannot be lost
I'll be damned fighting you
You're impossible, impossible
Say goodbye with no sympathy

I'm entitled to overcome
Completely stunned and numb
Knock me down, throw me to the floor

There's no pain; I can't feel no more
I'm entitled to overcome
Overcome
Overcome

You'll never know what I was thinking before you came 'round
Take a step, take a breath, put your guard down
(Overcome)
I cannot worry anymore of what you think of me
I may be crazy but I'm buried in your memory

I'm entitled to overcome
Completely stunned and numb
Knock me down, throw me to the floor
There's no pain; I can't feel no more

(Look in my eyes)
I'm entitled to overcome
(I'll fight till I die)
Completely stunned and numb
(Look in my eyes)
I'm entitled to overcome
(I'll fight till I die)
Completely stunned and numb
I'm entitled to overcome

I may be crazy but I'm buried in your memory.
