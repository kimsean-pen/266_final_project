Now ain't it strange that I feel like
Philby, there's a stranger in my soul
I'm lost in transit in a lonesome city, I can't come in from the cold
I'm deep in action on a secret mission, contact's broken down
Time drags by, I'm above suspicion, there's a voice on the telephone

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Well it sure is dark in this
clockwork city, contact's never gonna show
I've got a code which can't be broken, my eyes never seem to close
Well, I'm standing here in the silent city, shadows falling down
I'm disconnected but I don't need pity, the night's gonna burn on slow

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Now ain't it funny that I feel like
Philby, a stranger on a foreign shore
I've got my plans and I must move
quickly, there's a knock upon the door
Still in transit and I'm close to danger, my cover can't be blown,
It's getting strange and it's
getting crazy, tell me, what is going on?

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Four o'clock and nothing's moving,
six o'clock and the daylight's stirring
Morning comes, must be moving on
All night long my mind's been burning,
makes me feel such a long, long way from home, home

Now ain't it strange that I feel like
Philby, there's a stranger in my soul
I'm lost in transit in a lonesome city, I can't come in from the cold
Deep in action on a secret mission
Contact's broken down,
Time drags by, I'm above suspicion
There's a voice on the telephone
