The smiles as she walked in the room
Have all turned into frowns am I too quick to assume
That the love is no longer in bloom
The tantrums and the tears play a very different tune
To what they did before
The head's red raw

And the ending doesn't sound like the happiest around
When you sobbed before it felt much more
Like the product of a squabble
Now there's reason for it to be something more
And there would be
Oh it's uncertain whether the curtain has
Shut for good, she
Says, "See if it's still raining, I'm not dressed for it, and

If you loved me..."
And I interrupted, received a scowl and stare
But still decided to stop her there
Would it be outrageous to say
We're either shouting or we're shagging
Docked in tempestuous bays
At least that's how we felt yesterday

The eyes are getting heavier and whether you're asleep or awake
Is a mystery
Would a kiss be too much to ask?
When you fit me
As Sunday's frozen pitch fits the thermos flask?
It's a pity
It just hit me, we can't go back
To the chest touching on the back
