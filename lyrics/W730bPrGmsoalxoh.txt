Today a thousand years
Of strained affection and prayer
"out beyond ideas of right & wrong is a field"
Will I meet you there?
Will I meet you there?
The summer garden blooms
With autumn soon replaced
Another harvest moon—
So many ways to lose
So many faiths
'Holy to the LORD' on the bells of horses
Safely on the shore we sank like stones
To the bottom of a made up ocean
Standing on the lake shore, Julia
Silent as a seashell, Julia
Magnet of the elk park, Julia
Laid down on the temple floor
"Send a couple rats," said Julia
I'd have done the same thing to you
Coffee and a milk, now Julia
Who do you think needs who more?
In case your plan falls through
To mispronounce my name
(static between me and that Salafi, Yusef)
To curse You-Don't-Know-Who
And bow before the same
(so was the scene at al-Aqsa.)
I'll meet you there
(I have to admit I loved the cut of his pant legs!)
I'll meet you there
(another lovely afternoon for Sūrat al-Kāfirūn)
'Holy to the LORD' on the bells of horses
Safely on the shore we sank like stones
To the bottom of a made up ocean
