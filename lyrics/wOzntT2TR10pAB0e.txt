When i heard no i wasnt suprised
Coulda said it was a long time coming
Now you beg for some compromise
And youre offering nothing
And by now you must understand im making due with what ive been given
Read the past on the palm of my hand
A few chapters i think that youre missing

So im wondering
Where can we go now
And im wondering
Where can we go now

When i heard no i wasn't surprised
The shadows long and the pain is numbing
Years ago you left me behind
And left the place gutted
I lined up to stand and commend
The streets lined with satellite dishes
I skinned my knees and i cut my hair
Got a pulse but theres a few beats missing

So im wondering
Where can we go now
And im wondering
Where can we go now
