It's preposterous to think
That I'd second guess a thing
It's preposterous to believe
I'd kill a single moment
With the years at my back
I find that I'm still reaching
For an answer that keeps at a distance
For an answer that keeps staring back
I am the one true enemy
I am the constant defeating
A madness surrounds
A madness surrounds
A madness surrounds

It's wrapped around my neck and severs the life
It's wrapped around, it's wrapped around
It's wrapped around, it's wrapped around
It's wrapped around my neck and severs the life
There is a night wind coming in
There is a night wind coming

The weight crushes down
With the fiercest intrusion
Like a catalyst for implosion
The barriers grow high
Higher and higher
Now this is my nature
Higher and higher

Still I keep coming back
On the ashes of the falling ground
I'll keep coming back
I'll weather the storms
I'll bury the weak
And my reaching will never cease
And my reaching will never cease
Will never cease

The weight crushes down
A true catalyst for an implosion
Barriers growing high
Now this is my nature

It's wrapped around
It's wrapped around, it's wrapped around
It's wrapped around my neck and severs the life
There is a night wind coming in
There is a night wind coming
