Just like seventies goofballs
He's waiting on last calls
Well listen to method man
'Cause if you leave on the last line
Don't leave on the ground kind
Born just a little too slow

Just a little too slow
Just a little too

Oh, your lives are more than two
Just a little too

Oh, just a little too

'Cause if ya picture the wrong kind
You'll know you'll be turnin' blind
Got outta your head

Bangin' tail just the wrong way
You'll know that a turnin' grey
I'm just a little too slow

Oh, your lives are more than two

Slow

Oh, your lives are more than two

Just a little too
Just a little too

Your lives are more than two
Just a little too

Oh, your your life's a born in two
Just a little too slow

'Cause if you leave on the last line
Don't leave on the ground kind
Well listen to method man
Cause if you leave him callin'
You'll know you'll be fallin'
Lights are bummin' low

Your shot off and bum and go
Lives are bummin' low
Your shot off and bum and go
Born just a little too
