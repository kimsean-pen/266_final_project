Is there something I should know
Of the colours that you show
I remember those words
In the back of my mind
There is an old phantom

It isn't a secret this mind's shrouded in history
It isn't a secret this mind spirals in disarray
It isn't a secret this mind shatters in mystery
It isn't a secret I find terror in memory

Come close
Don't be afraid
It's stranger than you think
Desperately opiate, weary
Feaverish host to us, teary eyed
History hexes us
History hexes us

Don't look,
Don't think,
Don't feel,
Don't move,
Don't breathe,
Don't make, a sound,
It lives,
It breaths,
In my conscious mind,
(Rosebud don't change)

It isn't a secret this mind's shattered in history
It isn't a secret this mind spirals in disarray
It isn't a secret this mind shatters in mystery
It isn't a secret I find terror in memory

I live and breathe again
Through these gory locks
don't you dare forget them
Don't you dare!
Don't you dare!
History hexes us
I breathe again!
History hexes us
I'll live again!
