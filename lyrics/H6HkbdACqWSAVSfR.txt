My body's connected to my brain
Give it a name
I think we'll call it me
My body's connected to my brain
Give it a name
I think we'll call it me

I am who I am
No one else can be me
I come as I am
No one else does me as well as me
(Give it a name I think we'll call it)
You are so you are
No one else can be you
(Give it a name I think we'll call it)
Do what you do
No one else does you as well as you

My thighs are connected to my thigh bone
And my thigh bone connected to my leg bone
And my leg bone connected to my thigh bone
And my thighs are connected to you

Eyes are the window to my brain
Is connected to my sight
From my retina through my lenses
And my pupils let in the light
Is connected to the colors
That are not the same as you see
And in the shades of your iris
There's not one fleck the same and

My body's connected to my brain
Give it a name
I think we'll call it me
My body's connected to my brain
Give it a name
I think we'll call it me

I am who I am
No one else can be me
I come as I am
No one else does me as well as me

My legbone connected to my thigh bone
And my thighs are connected to you

Can you hear the bang bang bang
Within my my ear
Hear the bang bang
Within my my ear
Can you hear the bang bang bang
Beat beat on my ear drum
The drum that lets me hear

My ears have been the same since I was born
They are connected to my head
That is connected to two lobes
But I punch holes and dangle gold
When you blow waves down my canals
The ossicles the start to creak
And the way my drums sing
Is connected to the way you were thinking

Can you hear the bang bang bang
Within my my ear
Hear the bang bang
Within my my ear
Can you hear the bang bang bang
Beat beat on my ear drum
The drum that lets me hear

You are so you are
No one else can be you
(Give it a name I think we'll call it)
Do what you do
No one else does you as well as you
(Give it a name I think we'll call it)

Can I put my prints on you
Put my fingerprints on you
Can I put my prints on you
Put my fingerprints on you

My thighs are connected to my thigh bone
And my thigh bone connected to my leg bone
And my leg bone connected to my thigh bone
And my thighs are connected to you
