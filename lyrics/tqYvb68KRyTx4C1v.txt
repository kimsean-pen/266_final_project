Almost thought we made it home
But we don't know this place at all
That's enough now, dry your tears
It's been a long eleven years

Fire
Fire, Fire

Fire from the tongues of liars
You're ashamed of where you're from
Crying 'cause your father's drunk
We can't die because we're young

At least that's what we heard in a song
Fire
Fire, Fire
Fire from the tongues of liars

Fire
Fire, fire
Fire from the tongues of liars
You're ashamed of what you've done

Crying 'cause your father's wrong
Trying to be something new
You'll feel that you have something to prove
What you confuse for glory's fire

Is fire from the tongues of liars

What you confuse for glory's fire
Is fire from the tongues of liars
Oh send your rain
Fire

Fire, Fire

Fire from the tongues of liars
Oh send your rain
Fire
Fire, Fire
Fire from the tongues of liars
Oh send your rain
Fire
Fire, Fire
Fire from the tongues of liars
Oh send your rain
Fire
Fire, Fire
Fire from the tongues of liars
You're afraid of who you are
Crying 'cause your father's gone
Clinging to your youthful truth
You'll find that you've nothing to lose
You'll find that you've nothing to prove
