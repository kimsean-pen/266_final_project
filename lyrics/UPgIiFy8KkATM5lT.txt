Last night you talked about leaving
I said I can't let you go
It's not just emotional feeling
I need your body and soul
You give me one good reason to leave me
I'll give you ten good reasons to stay
You're the only one I believe in
I'll be hurt, I'll be hurt if you walked away
Too many broken hearts in the world
There's too many, dreams can be broken in two
Too many broken hearts in the world
So I won't give up the fight for you
The world is full of lonely people
Never have and to love
Last night I tried to reach you
But somehow it wasn't enough
So was it, can't you wait any longer?
I'll give you all a lover should give
It ain't my pride but my love that is stronger
I'll be hurt, I'll be hurt if you walked away
Too many broken hearts in the world
There's too many, dreams can be broken in two
Too many broken hearts in the world
So I won't give up the fight for you
Too many broken hearts in the world
There's too many, dreams can be broken in two
Too many broken hearts in the world
So I won't give up the fight for you
You give me one good reason to leave me
I'll give you ten good reasons to stay
You're the only one I believe in
I'll be hurt, I'll be hurt if you walked away
Too many broken hearts in the world
There's too many, dreams can be broken in two
Too many broken hearts in the world
So I won't give up the fight for you
Too many broken hearts in the world
There's too many, dreams can be broken in two
Too many broken hearts in the world
So I won't give up the fight for you
Too many broken hearts in the world
There's too many, dreams can be broken in two
Too many broken hearts in the world
So I won't give up the fight for you
