There have been fireworks for long
But I was the only one to send it now I know
I carve out all the pieces of my brain
Yeah, all the parts that used to hide the stain

You tried to tell me how to love
But it's like walking on a treadmill on the road
Yeah, it's like walking on a treadmill on the road
Going nowhere, like a treadmill on the road

You know it doesn't add up, you know it doesn't add up
You know it doesn't add up, you won't break my uranium heart
You know it doesn't add up, you know it doesn't add up
You know it doesn't add up, you won't break my uranium heart

Hohoho ho hohoho
Hohoho ho hohoho
So fire away, fire away, fire away
Hohoho ho hohoho
Fire away, fire away, fire away

Quiet now the smoke clearing away
I was the only one who takes the spark, I know
You tore out all the beauty from my soul
And then you left it by a signpost in the dark

I'm still walking on a treadmill on the road
Going nowhere, like a treadmill on the road

You know it doesn't add up, you know it doesn't add up
You know it doesn't add up, you won't break my uranium heart
You know it doesn't add up, you know it doesn't add up
You know it doesn't add up, you won't break my uranium heart

Hohoho ho hohoho
Hohoho ho hohoho
Fire away, fire away, fire away
Hohoho ho hohoho
Hohoho ho hohoho
Fire away, fire away, fire away
Fire away, fire away, fire away
Fire away, fire away, fire away
Hohoho ho hohoho
Fire away, fire away, fire away
