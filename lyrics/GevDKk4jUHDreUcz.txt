Trace the faces down the line
The legacy they left behind
A bloody trail you'll never find
The hidden hand, the hidden hand
Pale white, leprous as the snow
Pale white, leprous as the snow
Marks the places where we stand
Shapes the surface of the land
Where our troubles all began
The hidden hand, the hidden hand
Pale white, leprous as the snow
Pale white, leprous as the snow
