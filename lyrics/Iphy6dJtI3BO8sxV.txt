I've got the cash if you've got the hugs?
It's been a rough week
It's been an unproductive month
I swapped contact with reality
For a country house in a bright translucent daydream

Don't you get bored of them giving you nothing?
I only press pause when you press play in my stomach

Flowerball, Flowerball
How can you waltz through my blood-stream and then never call?
You make me shake
Like a waveform
You're my work of modern art and I want more

I'll take the punch if you'll sell the kick?
It's been a while
Since we tripped the light fantastic
I wanna hear guitars and cymbals sing
I'm tired of deciphering her senile fax machine

Don't you get bored of them giving you nothing?
I only press pause when you press play in my stomach

Flowerball, Flowerball
How can you waltz through my bloodstream and then never call?
You make me shake
Even though I'm warm
You're my work of modern art and I want more
I want more

Like a funeral needs an audience
Like a skeptic needs a church
It's not fun unless it hurts

Flowerball, Flowerball
How can you waltz through my bloodstream and then never call?
You make me shake, shake like a waveform
You're my work of modern art and I want more
I want more
