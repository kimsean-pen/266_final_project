Sad hearts, track lines
Cold lips, no time
To make this dark cloud chase the pain away, away

I'm stuck in the middle of this room
Hands tied with shackles on my shoes
I fight to set my demons free
But I'm trapped between the ghosts and screams
"Save me," I beg before you leave
I'm lost and caught inside these dreams
Tell me the way to get me home
I'm tired of drowning on my own

Leave me, alone
Red eyes, cold bones
Soft kiss, death's touch
Black heart, no love

I'm lying in the wake
I'm dying in your arms
I'm waiting for the tide to turn and bury me alive
Running out of time
I see it in your eyes
We're waiting for the tide to turn and bury me alive

The spiders weave their web so tight
Cold-blooded murder no goodbye
I hear the voices in my head
Whisper "good luck son this is it"
I wonder what I need to do
To stop the pain from bleeding through
I cross my heart and hope to die
I wear these scars on me tonight

Leave me, alone
Red eyes, cold bones
Soft kiss, death's touch
Black heart, no love

I'm lying in the wake
I'm dying in your arms
I'm waiting for the tide to turn and bury me alive
Running out of time
I see it in your eyes
We're waiting for the tide to turn and bury me alive

Sad hearts, track lines
Cold lips, no time
To make this dark cloud chase the pain away, away
Dear mum, dear dad
Hear me, I'm lost
And looking for a way to drown the pain away

I'm lying in the wake
I'm dying in your arms
I'm waiting for the tide to turn and bury me alive
Running out of time
I see it in your eyes
We're waiting for the tide to turn and bury me alive

Bury me alive
