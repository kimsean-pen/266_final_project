Time is up
Your doomsday clock's here
Carry the cross, boy, and make your bed
In a place where all (???)
Placed behind (???)
Halfway's been to a better place and the body (???)
What's the view like from your bed
Where a handful of love goes down where you got fed
And now it's time for pain
That's right
Now it's time for pain
That's right
Penetration time tonight

When we power packed bodies
Now we're power packed bodies Providence of angels and fairymen
Here after all's well and said and done
What's the view like from your bed
Where a handful of love goes down where you got fed
Now it's time for pain
That's right
Penetration time tonight

Not enough violence (repeats)

Carnage, violence (repeats)

Not enough violence (repeats)

Power packed Bodies
Not enough violence
