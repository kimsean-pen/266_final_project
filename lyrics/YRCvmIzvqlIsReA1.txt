We are ageless, holding our breath and waiting.
(We connect in separate places)
We paint our bodies and we are graceless in our decision making.
They'll hear us through the walls.
I'm just trying to make some good decisions.
Trying to prove that I am different than the other ones you've met.
I want to be your best friend.
We're all aware of our own purpose.
We all know what makes us nervous.
Just hold my hand and be my best friend.
We're dressed in blue and grey.
It's as ordinary as we are anxious.
We agree we're in the same place.
We agree that we can't relate unless we could stay the same age.
(We agree we could stay the same age).
So remember when you were young and you will be.
