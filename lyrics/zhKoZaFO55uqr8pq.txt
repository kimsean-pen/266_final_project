Haunt me, even in my sleeps, even in my dreams.
I skip to self karma, comes back around with the taste of regret.

Fuck repercussions, that don't mean shit to me.
It's always darkest right, right where it needs to be.

They say I'm a sinner, tonight I'm just a thief
Hold your heart for ransom, away with me.
Turns out she's a killer
Bury me in concrete to my teeth, away with me.
Bury me, bury me, bury me
Bury me in concrete to my teeth.

I'll be growing, every sleep, tearing up all your dreams.
No love when you look up for God, no luck, I'm all you've got.

Not repercussions, they never thank me
It's always darkest right, right where it needs to be.

They say I'm a sinner, tonight I'm just a thief
Hold your heart for ransom, away with me.
Turns out she's a killer
Bury me in concrete to my teeth, away with me.
Bury me, bury me, bury me
Bury me in concrete to my teeth, away with me.
Away with me.

I don't wanna be tied down.
Not surprised, I'm buried alive
I'm dead for all you know.
You don't wanna be alone
When you open your eyes and I'm alive
You should have never left me breathing.
They say I'm a sinner, tonight I'm just a thief
Hold your heart for ransom, away with me.
Turns out she's a killer
Bury me in concrete to my teeth, away with me.
Bury me, bury me, bury me
Bury me in concrete to my teeth.
