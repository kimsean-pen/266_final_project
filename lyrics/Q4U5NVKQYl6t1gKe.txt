Mary, if you wanna
I'll waive my right
I'll be on the corner
Just passin' time

No, I won't
Never once
Make you cry
Just to kiss
Oh, I'll miss
Your goodbye

We'll go to the disco
We'll be a sight
We'll dance like were boyfriends
In sheer delight

No, I won't
Never once
Make you cry
With the kiss
Oh, I'll miss
Your goodbye

Oh, I won't
Never once
Make you cry
Just to kiss
Oh, and I'll miss
Your goodbye
