Your heart is more than a machine.
Pumping blood through your body, doing things you've never seen.
Their words come like arrows when they fly.
With mechanical percision they can cut you up inside.
But you're more than bolts.
Like the city's more than steel and stones.
Soon your heart is gonna overflow.
Push you back down you get up again.
Circuits freeze and androids never dream.
You're more than a machine.
Touch screen.
Figertips and pretty lights.
We go through the scanner sideways.
See you on the other side.
Your flesh.
All your skin and all your bones.
Carry all our generations.
With futures still unknown.
But you're more than bolts.
Like the city's more than steel and stones.
Soon your heart is gonna overflow.
Push you back down you get up again.
Circuits freeze and androids never dream.
You're more than a machine.
But you're more than bolts.
Like the city's more than steel and stones.
Soon your heart is gonna overflow.
Push you back down you get up again.
Circuits freeze and androids never dream.
You're more than a machine.
