(House of love)
Come a come, come a come on in, come a come on in
Come a come, come a come on in
[Incomprehensible]

There is a place up the street
It's a funky little place we can meet
It's my house built for love

From the kitchen to the basement, wall to wall
See that chair, I put it there
The vibrations of love are everywhere

And when things are going crazy
I'll be your shelter, baby, keep you warm
And keep you from the rain, hey, hey

Come a come, come a come on in, come a come on in
Come a come, come a come on in
(House of love)
Come a come, come a come on in, come a come on in
Come a come, come a come on in

Just stop on by, anytime
'Cause what's mine is yours
And what's yours is mine

And when things are going crazy
I'll be your shelter, baby, keep you warm
And keep you from the rain, hey, hey

Come a come, come a come on in, come a come on in
Come a come, come a come on in
(House of love)
Come a come, come a come on in, come a come on in
(House of love)
Come a come, come a come on in
(House of love)

Come on in, come on, come on in, come on
Come on in, come on, come on in, come on
Come on in, come on, come on in, come on
Come on in, come on, come on in, come on
(House of love)

[Incomprehensible]
It's open baby, come on in
H O U S E of my L O V E
Make yourself at home
H O U S E of my L O V E
Make yourself at home

Come a come, come a come on in, come a come on in
Come a come, come a come on in
(House of love)
Come a come, come a come on in, come a come on in
Come a come, come a come on in
(House of love)

Come a come, come a come on in, come a come on in
Come a come, come a come on in
(House of love)
Come a come, come a come on in, come a come on in
(House of love)
Come a come, come a come on in
(House of love)

Come a come, come a come on in, come a come on in
Come a come, come a come on in
(Love, house of love)
Come a come, come a come on in, come a come on in
Come a come, come a come on in
(Love, house of love)
