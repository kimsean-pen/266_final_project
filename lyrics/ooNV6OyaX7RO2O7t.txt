Those days were mine
I run to the past
Searching for life to get back
Those days are dead,
Been buried alive

And I can't forget
All that I regret
Those days are dead
They're buried with time

We were left here
We have been forgotten
Why won't you stay?
Why won't you follow me now?
Into the fog
Out of reach, out of sight
We have been forgotten
Those were the days
When I felt nothing

I left all my pain
I gave it away

As the fog clears,
We have been forgotten
And we arise just like the Sun
Into the fog
Freedom, freedom
Free from the days
When I felt nothing

Into the eye of the setting Sun
All that we are
Is undone
