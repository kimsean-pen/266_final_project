I start to levitate
I feel the air beneath my wings
I hear my pulse, I taste the air I breathe
I touch the ground

I see the end and I feel whole again
I hear the echoes of a world I left behind
I taste the victory I thought I'd never find
I touch the ground but it's slipping away from me

And now I can't see it, I can't see anything
Somebody help me, please help me!

Oh Johnny! Hahahahaha
Wake the fuck up
It's your big day
Wouldn't want to keep all of those angry souls waiting, now would you?

This is the story of Johnny's group of misfits taking on the Devil himself
Welcome to Hell

I can't believe it was a dream, I walked the surface
Breathed the air then found myself back underneath
It must've been a sign
The time to take back what was mine
I am alive

So it's time that I bid you farewell
I'll sign my release with your blood
You can't keep me trapped in this hell
I won't ever call this my tomb

The place where your soul's sent to die
Is the place where my purpose was found
I'm taking control of my life and I'm raising an army from hell
And I'm burning this place to the ground

First I'll take the things he loves
(Make him feel defeated, make him feel defeated)
Then I'll take his fucking heart
(Make him watch you eat it, make him watch you eat it)

I can't remain here
I'm taking control
So string 'em out, and bare his bones
I'm taking back my soul

You think you can run?
You think you can hide?
No, I'm done hiding
I challenge you to fight me to the death

So it's time that I bid you farewell
I'll sign my release with your blood
You can't keep me trapped in this hell
I won't ever call this my tomb

The place where your soul's sent to die
Is the place where my purpose was found
I'm taking control of my life and I'm raising an army from hell
And I'm burning this place to the ground

So it seems it's my time
Fate has brought me to now
With armies aligned
We brace for the sound

Of ten thousand souls fighting for air
The chance to live again
So ready your guns, prepare for the end
Cause the last thing that you'll hear is "Off with his head!"

(Get over here you son of a bitch)
(You're not getting away from me that easily)
(Rip him to pieces)

With the force of ten thousand guns
I destroy everything you built
Corner you with no where to run
Then I tear your black heart straight out of your chest

I took his crown of fire and I crushed it with my hands
I came, I saw, and I conquered
So did you miss me?

Well, here's my farewell
I'm crazier than I ever fucking was
I'm king of the dead and the damned
I thought that this day'd never come
But why should your sinners be saved?

You wouldn't be free without me
I'm your leader, your savior, your king
And I don't think that I'm ready to leave

So gather ye demons, it seems it's your day
I sin but I've paid more than ten thousand graves
And though we're the damned, we're so far from alone
So let's bury the hatchet inside of their skulls

I can feel air inside my lungs again
(Don't ever trust the Devil bitch)
And I know that my destiny
(See the way your blood spills on the ground)

It's just a part of satellites
All because of you, you, you
