Dead serious now...

Are you lonesome tonight
Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
(It still does that man)

Does your memory stray
To a brighter sunny day
When I kissed you and
Called you sweetheart?
Do the chairs in your
Parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep
And picture me there?

Is your heart filled with pain,
Shall I come back again?
Tell me dear,
Are you lonesome tonight?

I wonder if you're lonesome ever

Are you sorry we drifted apart?
(It still does that man)

Does your memory stray
To a brighter sunny day
When I kissed you and
Called you sweetheart?
Do the chairs in your
Parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep
And picture me there?

Is your heart filled with pain,
Shall I come back again?
Tell me dear,
Are you lonesome tonight?
