Forlorn your heart
This scratch will leave a mark
And you'll fall you'll sob
But you'll walk you'll walk
And now you'll understand
This love lost never went
And your god is not enough enough enough

You'll never figure though I know you're trying to
Bend all that seems to comply
You're not that apparent
It's not the feat but all the times you tried to
All will be completed

Forlorn your heart
This scratch will leave a mark
And you'll fall you'll sob
But you'll walk you'll walk
And now you'll understand
This love lost never went
And your god is not enough enough enough

There is no other but the one you pine for
Hold in your heart and your pride
You can't change what happened

So suffer liars
Nobody's at fault
You can't hold it in
Suffer liars

So suffer liars
Nobody's at fault
You can't hold it in
Suffer liars

Forlorn your heart
This scratch will leave a mark
And you'll fall you'll sob
But you'll walk you'll walk
And now you'll understand
This love lost never went
And your god is not enough enough enough

Forlorn your heart
This scratch will leave a mark

And you'll fall you'll sob
But you'll walk you'll walk
And your god is not enough enough enough
