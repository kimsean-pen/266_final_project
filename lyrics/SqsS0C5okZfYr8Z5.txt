They tell me, it's all in my mind
They don't know, they're yet to try
My thoughts are safer inside
I pray it hurts less this time.

They tell me, it's all in my head
They don't know they have to check
What lies within is a mess
This pill could fix it, I guess.

Don't say, it's all in my brain
'Cause I can't help being this way
I feel the changes they've made
Now I don't feel the same.

Leave my secrets alone
They aren't for you to know
I hear the knock at my door
As they take me far from my home
They say, "It's better this way"
But the voices, they tell me I'm sane
They think they're cleansing my veins
As they hook me up in this place.

They say it starts in my soul
Makes its way down through my blood
It's been with me since I was young
But they can't explain what it's from

I think that I've had enough
I don't know who I can trust

Leave my secrets alone
They aren't for you to know
I hear the knock at my door
As they take me far from my home
They say, "It's better this way"
But the voices, they tell me I'm sane
They think they're cleansing my veins
As they hook me up in this place

Leave my secrets alone
They aren't for you to know
I hear the knock at my door
As they make me vacate my bones
