In vain they fight
They have fell from their throne

As the light faded from the horizon
The ones of the nocturn awake
Darkness grants them its blessing
And sends them out to hunt

Air is steaming as the horde leaves its nest
Frost covering the ground
All life shall be raped by the dark

As the resources expire
The only thing that keeps the last bits of human race going
Is pure instinct of survival

A herd of weaklings is lost in the ruins
And panic is starting to rise
The troops of decay smell their fear and are ready to strike

Air is steaming as the horde leaves its nest
Frost covering the ground
All life shall be raped by the dark

The scavengers of apocalypse
Will hunt you down

Behing the curtains of thorns
Far from the landscape of demise

Air freezes as the horde leaves the nest
All life shall be raped by the dark
