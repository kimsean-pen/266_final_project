From the nightclub to the bedroom floor
I never felt quite like this before
It's your eyes that I really adore
If I say anymore, if I say anymore
From the nightclub to the bedroom floor
I never felt quite like this before
It's your eyes that I really adore
If I say anymore, I might just fall in
Nightclub to the bedroom floor
I never felt quite like this before
It's your eyes that I really adore
If I say anymore, if I say anymore
From the nightclub to the bedroom floor
I never felt quite like this before
It's your eyes that I really adore
If I say anymore, I might just fall in

Understand where we stand
Say we ain't together, but every weekend
We do breakfast
Then put our initials in beach sand (beach sand)
And it's obvious that you fuck with me
And I got you at the beach and we trippy
Now the situation's getting quite sticky
Say you wanna touch, but I can't leave hickeys
I know what that means
You think I got another man, but trust me
Got a better plan, how 'bout we stay in this beach sand?
We can, we can build in this beach sand

From the nightclub to the bedroom floor
I never felt quite like this before
It's your eyes that I really adore
If I say anymore, if I say anymore
From the nightclub to the bedroom floor
I never felt quite like this before
It's your eyes that I really adore
If I say anymore, I might just fall in
Nightclub to the bedroom floor
I never felt quite like this before
It's your eyes that I really adore
If I say anymore, if I say anymore

White sand beneath our feet
Fuck that, give me rain and sleet
As long as I got you in between the sheets
A bottle of that red and some blue weed
All I need is you and I could make you purr
Like you been waiting for years just to get yours
And if you been waiting you know I'm good to serve it
Baby you deserve everything you earning

From the nightclub to the bedroom floor
I never felt quite like this before
It's your eyes that I really adore
If I say anymore, if I say anymore
From the nightclub to the bedroom floor
I never felt quite like this before
It's your eyes that I really adore
If I say anymore, I might just fall in
Nightclub to the bedroom floor
I never felt quite like this before
It's your eyes that I really adore
If I say anymore, if I say anymore
From the nightclub to the bedroom floor
I never felt quite like this before
It's your eyes that I really adore
If I say anymore, I might just fall in

Fall in
Fall in
Bedroom, fall in
Fall in, fall in
Fall in
Fall in
Bedroom, fall in
Fall in, fall in
