Blues, rest into the sleep
Choose visions, wake from deep
Painting ourselves on stained glass floor
The things we discussed are disguised until unveiled

In the hour of night we take from ourselves,
we place in the world
There's a balance of thoughts
you should find affirmation speaking in tongues

Tame the words through you

Dawn of creation blessed in devotion
Love, lust, spaces in time bringing colours to life
Spectrums defy us left to remind us
Love, lust, spaces and time bringing colours to life

Loose words from voices speak
Loose shades of darkness seek
Staining ourselves on a painted floor
The things we have done are disclosed only to ourselves

In the hour of night we take from our selves,
we reflect on the world
There's a balance of thoughts
you should find adoration speaking in tongues

Tame the words through you

Dawn of creation blessed in devotion
Love, lust, spaces and time bringing colours to life
Spectrums defy us left to remind us
Love, lust, spaces in time bringing colours to life
