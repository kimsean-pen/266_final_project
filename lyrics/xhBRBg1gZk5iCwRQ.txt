Usually I'm such a bitch
But when I'm with you, I just feel the opposite
Never had much innocence
Something 'bout you makes me wanna grow my wings

Test me now
'Cause I know that deep inside, you're curious
Sweep me down, let me show you what I do, I do for love

I wanna get personal, personal
I want that personal with you
I wanna get personal, personal
I want that personal with you
I wanna get
(I wanna get)

Usually I'm high as fuck
But when I'm with you, I don't even know what drug
Save me from a world of fakes
Let them have the ocean, we'll create a lake

Test me now
'Cause I know that deep inside, you're curious (yeah)
Sweep me down, let me show you what I do, I'd do for us

I wanna get personal, personal
I want that personal with you
I wanna get personal, personal
I want that personal with you
I wanna get, I wanna get, I wanna get, I wanna get
I wanna get personal, personal
I want that personal with you
I wanna get personal, personal
I want that personal with you
I wanna get personal, personal
I want that personal with you
I wanna get personal, personal
I want that personal with you
I wanna get
