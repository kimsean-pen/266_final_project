Look to the clock on the wall
Hands hardly moving at all
I can't stand the state that I'm in
Sometimes it feels like the walls closing in

Oh Lord what can I say?
I am so sad since You went away
Time, time ticking on me
Alone is the last place I wanted to be
Alone what can I say?

Try to bury my troubles away
Drowns my sorrows the same way
Seems that no matter how hard I try
It feel like somethings just missing inside

Oh Lord what can I say?
I am so sad since You went away
Time, time ticking on me
Alone is the last place I wanted to be
Alone what can I say? Oh alone what can I say?

And how many rules can I break?
How many lives can I make?
How many roads must I turn?
To find me a place where the bridge isn't burned

Oh Lord what can I say?
I am so sad since You went away
Time, time ticking on me
Alone is the last place I wanted to be

Oh Lord what can I say?
I am so sad since You went away
Time, time ticking on me
Alone is the last place I wanted to be

Alone what can I say?
Oh alone what can I say?
