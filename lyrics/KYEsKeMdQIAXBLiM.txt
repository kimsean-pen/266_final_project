One, Two, Three

Oh I beg you: can I follow?
Oh I ask you: why not always?
Be the ocean, where I unravel,
Be my only, be the water where I'm wading.
You're my river running high,

Run deep, run wild.
I-I follow, I follow you
Deep sea baby, I follow you
I-I follow, I follow you

Dark moon honey, I follow you
He's a message
I'm the runner.
He the rebel

I'm the daughter waiting for you.
You're my river running high

Run deep, run wild.
I-I follow, I follow you,
Deep sea baby, I follow you
I-I follow, I follow you

Dark moon honey, I follow you
You're my river running high,

Run deep, run wild.
I-I follow, I follow you,
Deep sea baby, I follow you
I-I follow, I follow you
Dark moon honey, I follow you
I-I follow, I follow you,
Deep sea baby, I follow you
I-I follow, I follow you
Dark moon honey, I follow you
I follow you
I follow you
