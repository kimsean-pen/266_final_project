Life will act against your will if you lie to
People who trust
Live with integrity honesty
And then happiness will prevail
Your reputation destroyed
By your own ignorant actions
Self destroyed - by - your own actions
Why do I write lyrics
To express the way I feel
Because I can't talk face to face
With an irrational person who steals
Self destroyed - by - your own actions
Left alone yet cease to realize
I cross you out from a list of friends
People who lie and steal
Because in my eyes you're as guilty as Marc
