Leave me alone, I'm over it and everybody's movin' on
I can't see my tomorrow
And yesterday has come and gone
So, leave me alone

My mind is blown but it's my own, so deal with it
I'm feelin' fine most of the time
I may be on the outside but no one's gettin' in
So, leave me alone

We're okay, reelin' in the days
We're alright, we're just gettin' high
Let us be, it'll be all right

I got no strife I'm lovin' life, could you say the same?
You don't have to move to groove
So come on up and see me but leave that judge behind
'Cause I'm loving life

We're okay, reelin' in the days
We're alright, we're just gettin' high
Let us be, it'll be all right

We're okay, reelin' in the days
We're alright, we're just gettin' high
Let us be, it'll be all right

I'm gettin' stoned and what's wrong with that
The President seems to be just fine
Come on up and see me
Come on up just know that I'm gettin' stoned

I'm gettin' stoned
I'm gettin' stoned
I'm gettin' stoned

We're okay, reelin' in the days
We're alright, we're just gettin' high
Let us be, it'll be all right

It'll be alright, it'll be alright
