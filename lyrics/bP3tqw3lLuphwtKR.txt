Words fail me trying to convey,
the right thing to say,but they're written in the lines on my face,
Like a road map to show you the way,no tomorrow if there's no today,
Coz,time will take all we've left,we've only now,
So fly away,hold your breath and don't look down,
What becomes of us,found mistakes are the sum of us,
Missing all the beauty right in front of us,

Here we are,our pride got a hold of us,
One road too far,our path's not in folding us,
Here we are,our world in front of us,
If we lose our path,then what becomes of us?
Ooh ooh ooh,Ooh ooh ooh
Every road of my life,I've had to build across a broken divide,
Cornered animals only know how to fight,
So why's it feel like,
for winning every argument I'd lose a little part of us,
If I can see that I can be the furor in this partnership,
And I don't know where I stand,
maybe lately I've been focused on
my own just trying to broker a plan,
If everything's left unspoken then I know we'll be damned,
and we'll keep drowning with this weight tied to both of our hands,
But don't mistake my silence for a martyr draw,
Cause only people caught inside a war say it's worth fighting for,
This encompasses us what becomes of us,
missing all the beauty right in front of us,

Here we are,our pride got a hold of us,
One road too far,our path's not in folding us,
Here we are,our world in front of us,
If we lose our path,then what becomes of us?
Ooh ooh ooh,Ooh ooh ooh
Suffa: Ask a friend a question,
Said how much do you drink at night,coz that's how much I spill while,
Tried to drown my demons,
But my demons they grew gills,I feel I have no chill,
Don't want my heart to give,
coz I'm a father and I've got two other hearts to live for,
Frieda said Viva La Vida,
I'ma meet her on the other side and fall at her feet,
I've never heard such good advice,not here to pass the time,
I'm here to map a story on my face with laughter lines right,
We can't see the parts sometimes coz of our busy lives,
like we can't see the stars at night coz of the
city lights,I-need to step away and find my balance,
Redecorate with my palace,Mind my Alice,
I went down the rabbit hole to find my
sadness,and crush it like it's aderol will,
Mind my malice,
And try to be kind,when I find my answers I'm going to be fine

Here we are,Our pride got a hold of us,
One road too far,our path's not in folding us,
Here we are,Our world in front of us,
If we lose our path,then what becomes of us?
Ooh ooh ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh Ooh
