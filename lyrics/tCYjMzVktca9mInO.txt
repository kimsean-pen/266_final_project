Forty days and forty nights
You were the drug that kept me alive
During weary times

Seemed so pure when wearing white
Within such a frail and immaculate mind
With those innocent eyes

We were young and full of life
You asked me to swear in a mirror - confide
Underneath the stars

I should care to let you fly
A chance to retrieve what was left behind
To experience life

Staring at the sky
Staring at the sun
Waiting for a wonder
Within a forsaken land
The sparrow in my hand
Now buried in the sand
Leaving you dependent
Leaving you an open vein

Can't make you wait no more
Can't make you wait nowhere
It's hard to breathe
Everything's blackening

I am made of flesh and bone
Blood, sweat and tears are all you ever will find
Underneath the skin

You're affair, that I'm a stone
Falling from the depths into the grave
Where I'm destined to dwell

And we reach for mystery
At the edge of reason
Every path we take
We're wandering in blindness
In the end nothing is
Lonelier or so honorable
While we drown in doubt
We're drifting like strangers...

Staring at the sky
Staring at the sun
Waiting for a wonder
Within a forsaken land
The sparrow in my hand
Now buried in the sand
Leaving you dependent
Leaving me with open veins

Forty days and forty nights
You were the drug that kept me alive
With those innocent eyes
