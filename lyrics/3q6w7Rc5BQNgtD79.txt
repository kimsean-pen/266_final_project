And when I see
And if I walk
And when I run away
Hold me in your arms
Don't let go
Hold me in your arms
And when I run away
Hold me in your arms

And when I see
And if I walk
And when I run away
Hold me in your arms
Don't let go
Hold me in your arms
And when I run away
Hold me in your arms

And when I see
And if I walk
And when I run away
Hold me in your arms
Don't let go
Hold me in your arms
And when I run away
Hold me in your arms

And when I see
And if I walk
And when I run away
Hold me in your arms
Don't let go
Hold me in your arms
And when I run away
Hold me in your arms
Don't let go
Hold me in your arms
And when i run away
Hold me in your arms
And when I see
Hold me in your arms
