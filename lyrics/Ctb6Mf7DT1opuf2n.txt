Oh you can have it all
And wrap it in the world
You can have everything
You can have Love
And lots of other things
to make you think

But when it all comes down to you, girl
Yeah no matter what you do
Take a look at yourself and realize
I've been good to you
I've been good to you

Oh no
I didn't mean to say what I, did say
All about lovers and how they should lay
That was never for me to, say and say
Don't you see now how I pay?

I see the sun rising
And all you see is it fall, fall, fall

So come on up
Oh wasn't to you said life was like a
plastic cup?
Oh to be used and then
disposed of
Yeah, but that's no way to live a
life like yours
Don't you see now how I pay?

I see the sun rising
And all you see is it fall, fall, fall

For all the times I never
Never turned away
And now she's here on someone else's arm

For all the times I never
Never turned her way
And now she's here on someone else's arm
For all the times I never
never turned away
And now she's here on someone else's arm
For all the times I never,
never turned away
And now she's here on someone else's arm
