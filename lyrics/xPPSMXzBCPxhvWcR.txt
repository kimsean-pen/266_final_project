Love is easier when one of us dead
Hey!
I will wait a year
No one starts to hear an accidental fall
And they wont suspect a thing at all

Wait for the summer
We'll sleep when we wanna
Don't look your mother
We'll leave when we,
We'll leave when we wanna

And I have dreamed about it,
And how I read about it
And I can't grieve about it,
And I can't hey!

Someone help me,
Someone help me,
Someone help me please!
Someone help me,
Someone help me,
Someone help me please!

Just an accidental fall,
And they won't suspect a thing at all

Wait for the summer,
We'll leave when we wanna
Look at your mother,
Is that who ya,
Is that who ya wanna?

Killed my lady here, when I was drinking
Held her neck too long, won't she stop screaming?
What a proud old mare, what was she thinking?
I hear her voice sometimes, when I've been dreaming

Killed my lady here, when I was dreaming
I held her neck too long, what was I thinking?
What a proud old mare, won't she stop screaming?
I hear her voice sometimes, when I've been, when I've been...

Rising, Rising,
Falling down,
I'm rising, rising,
Falling down.
I'm rising, rising,
Falling down.

I killed my baby with a bullet
Words I shot right into her head and I'm
Falling, falling, falling, down
Sink into the river, sink into the river

Killed my baby yeah when I was dreamin
I killed my baby with a bullet
Words I shot right into her head and I'm
Falling, falling, falling, down
Sink into the river sink into the river

I hear her voice sometimes
When I've been dreaming

Killed my baby yeah when I was dreamin
I killed my baby with a bullet
Words I shot right into her head and I'm
Falling, falling, falling, down
Sink into the river sink into the river

I hear her voice sometimes
When I've been dreaming
When I've been...

Rising, Rising,
Falling down,
I'm rising, rising,
Falling down.
I'm rising, rising,
Falling down.
