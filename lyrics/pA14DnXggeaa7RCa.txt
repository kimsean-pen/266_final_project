I'm sitting pretty and it's raining
I know you never see me
Oh no
Had a feeling never fallen
I know your sky is taller
Must go
Love said
I'll take this on my own

No more sorrow for tomorrow
You stumble I don't think so
Oh no
No more botter left to borrow
You can let yourself go
Just go
Love said
I'll take this on my own
Love said
I'll take this on my own

Crashing through the long grass
That's where all the fun lasts
Let's go
The party's getting started
The port is almost lasting
Oh no
Love said
I'll take this on my own
Love said
I'll take this on my own

Had a feeling never falling
I know your sky is taller
Must go
Must go
Must go
Must go
