I look around and all I see is evil
The walking dead disguised as real people
It's kill or be killed 'cause life is not forever
It comes apart and then it falls together
I am what you made me 'til death do I part

It's the world I've grown to know
Unforgiving and so cold
Take it away, take it away
I don't want it
It's a life I'm forced to live
I've got nothing more to give
Take it away, take it away
I don't want it anymore, generation dead
We're dead

You see yourself as such a fucking shepherd
But you trip the blind, and then you curse the leper
Do you really want my true opinion?
You've taken more then you've ever given
You are what you are until death do you part

It's the world I've grown to know
Unforgiving and so cold
Take it away, take it away
I don't want it
It's a life I'm forced to live
I've got nothing more to give
Take it away, take it away
I don't want it anymore, generation dead

It's the world I've grown to know
Unforgiving and so cold
Take it away, take it away
I don't want it
It's a life I'm forced to live
I've got nothing more to give
Take it away, take it away
I don't want it anymore
It's the world I've grown to know
Unforgiving and so cold
Take it away, take it away
I don't want it
It's a life I'm forced to live
I've got nothing more to give
Take it away, take it away
I don't want it anymore, generation dead
We're dead
