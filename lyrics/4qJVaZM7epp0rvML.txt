Right before your eyes
What you valued is gone
But we're still here
Right before your eyes
All the magic is gone
But we're still here
We still here

All the saints will fall
Time dissolves
But we're still here
Wait, we can not wait
Cause our mistakes
Will soon be gone

Breath, close your eyes
Whatever is gone
Don't need no tears
Why do we always try
To hold to things forever
We are passers by
In the dance of time

All the saints will fall
Time dissolves
But we're still here
Wait, we can not wait
Cause our mistakes
Will soon be gone

Right before your eyes
What you valued is gone
But we're still here
All the saints will fall
Time dissolves
But we're still here
Wait, we can not wait
Cause our mistakes
Will soon be gone
