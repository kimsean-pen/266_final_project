Break down;
On your knees and drown
Look left, see death
Staring back at you
You grow tall;
I, I get old
Mystery, honestly just go
I can't handle anymore

And she goes when he's ready
And I know he feels heavy
But she knows that he's dirty
To make her feel worthy, she;
She cries like a drama queen
While dying next to me, he;
He'll hold her closely
While she falls asleep

She floats, I don't
Now she's gone
Physical, magical, you've left
Oh, I'm suddenly less.
Mystery, show me the way
To a happy place.

And he goes when he's ready
And I know he feels heavy
But she knows that he's dirty
To make her feel worthy, she;
She cries like a drama queen
While dying next to me, he;
He'll hold her closely

And now he's gone backwards
Feeling more like a coward
And he knows she sees him
So he smiles as he walks, he;
He thinks of her cheeky grin
While faking being happy
He's so cold at night
As cold as her last breath
