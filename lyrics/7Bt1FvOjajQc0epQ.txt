My cry echoes on a naked wall
Cold like a crystal
Numbered hours creeping
Insanity strangles reality...

Weakened, crushed, formed
New dimensions arise
My mind becomes a fortress
Inpregnable, shut

The walls between us make the public safe...

Read my scars...
See why I'm like that
Read my scars...
And don't ask me why

Whisper turns into a scream
Light would burn my skin
My legs, useless instruments
My eyes, almost blind

See the sunny world outside
Ignorant of the fact
Faking shock, forgetting fast
Freedom is a gift...

My cry echoes on a naked wall
Cold like a crystal
Numbered hours creeping
Insanity strangles reality...

The walls between us make the public safe...

Read my scars...
See why I'm like that
Read my scars...
And don't ask me why

The walls between us make the public safe...

Read my scars...
See why I'm like that
Read my scars...
And don't ask me why!
