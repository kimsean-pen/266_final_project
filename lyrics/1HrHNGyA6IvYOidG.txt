You were born under a star
In the sky she lives now
Protecting you, night after night
Listen to the lullaby
Every time life seems to hurt
Close your eyes
Just close your eyes

Our voices will hug you
Music will be our arms
The star will shine
And enlighten in mind
You are loved little girl, you are
I bet you'll be stronger
When the day is by

If one day you wanna cry
Look at the star, I know she's proud
Of who you've been and who you are
Then run into loving arms
And shine as bright as you can
You've been loved, you still are

Our voices will hug you
Music will be our arms
The star will shine
And enlighten in mind
You are loved little girl, you are
I bet you'll be stronger
When the day is by
