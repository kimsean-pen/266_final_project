I don't know where I'm at.
I'm standing out the back
And I'm tired of waiting.
Waiting here in line
Hoping that I'll find
What I've been chasing

I shot for the sky
I'm stuck on the ground
So why do I try?
I know I'm gonna fall down.
I thought I could fly
So why did I drown?
You never know why
It's coming down, down, down.

Not ready to let go.
Cause then I'll never know
What I could be missing.
But I'm missing way too much.
When do I give up
What I've been wishing for?

I shot for the sky
I'm stuck on the ground
So why do I try?
I know I'm gonna fall down.
I thought I could fly
So why did I drown?
I'll never know why
It's coming down, down, down.

Oh, I am coming down, down, down.
I can't find another way around
And I don't wanna hear the sound
Of losing what I've never found.

I shot for the sky
I'm stuck on the ground
So why do I try?
I know I'm gonna fall down.
I thought I could fly
So why did I drown?
I'll never know why
It's coming down, down, down.

I shot for the sky
I'm stuck on the ground
So why do I try?
I know I'm gonna fall down.
I thought I could fly
So why did I drown?
I'll never now why
it's coming down, down, down
