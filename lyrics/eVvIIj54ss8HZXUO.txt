I've been driving all night, my hands are wet on the wheel
There's a voice in my head that drives my heel
And my baby calls, says she needs me here
And it's a half past four and I'm shifting gears
When she gets lonely and the longing gets too much
She sends a cable coming in from above
We don't need to talk at all
WE've got a thing that's called Radar Love
Ww got a wave in the air
Radar Love
Radio's playing som forgotten song
Brenda Lee's "Coming On Strong"
The road has got me hypnotized
And I'm spinning into a new sunrise
When I get lonely and I'm sure I've had enough
She sends her comfort coming in from above
We don't need a letter at all
We've got a thing that's called Radar Love
We got a line in the air
Radar Love
No more speed, I'm almost there
Gotta keep cool now, gotta take care
Last car to pass, here I go
And the line of cars goes down real slow
And the radio played some forgotten song
Brenda Lee's "Coming on Strong"
And the newsman sang his same song
Oh, one more Radar Lover gone
When I get lonely and I'm sure I've had enough
She sends her comfort coming in from above
We don't need a letter at all
We've got a thing that's called Radar Love
We got a line in the sky
We've got a thing that's called Radar Love
We've got a thing that's called ... Radar Love
