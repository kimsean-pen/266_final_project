I'm just interference
Noise and whispers
A shadow onto them
I'm dust on the record stop,
A static, a click, a compromise
A discord, a spark, a silhouette
A shady ghost, an echo of what's left

Help me touch the ground
Cause all that's every in me
Still won't bring me down

Path of waste-resistance
Pins and needles
We shall take it to the ground
Now I'm interruption
Infinant and momentary
I'm onto this destruction
Incomplete and temporary

Help me touch the ground
Cause all that's every in me
Still won't bring me down
Bring me back to the surface
I'm done with this endlessness
Help me find my way back down

I'm just interference
Moments placed in time
Now I'm interruption
Infinant and momentary
I'm onto this destruction
Incomplete and temporary

Help me touch the ground
Cause all that's every in me
Still won't bring me down
Bring me back to the surface
I'm done with this endlessness
Help me find my way back down
