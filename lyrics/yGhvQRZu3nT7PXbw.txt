I don't wanna know how long we'll last
In the end we'll always have the past
Take me to the place where we first met
All I really want is my heart back

Hey, I'm sorry now (I'm sorry)
We are fading out (I'm sorry)
Tell me what to do (I'm sorry)
To lead (to lead)
Me back (me back)
To you

Just lead me back to you
Lead me back to you
Lead me back to you

Hold on tight
You know we're moving fast
Love might fade
But memories always last
Wish I could stop this from getting old
I hold you close but we are feeling cold

Hey, I'm sorry now (I'm sorry)
We are fading out (I'm sorry)
Tell me what to do (I'm sorry)
To lead (to lead)
Me back (me back)
To you

Just lead me back to you
Just lead me back to you
Just lead me back to you

Wish I could still feel fire
Wish I could see things brighter
Wish I could still feel fire
Wish I could see things brighter
(Just lead me back to you)
(Lead me back to you)
