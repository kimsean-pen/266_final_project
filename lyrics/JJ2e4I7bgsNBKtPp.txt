I knew you fine, sight dream of mine
But I know my eyes they've often lied
And I move like blood, like fire and flood
Despite you

Blind love couldn't win
As the facts all came in
But I know I'll again chase after wind
What have I got if not a thought?

I knew, oh I knew
I knew

It was a fool's errand
Waiting for a sign
I can't leave until the sight comes to mind
A fool's errand

Life will repeat
Vision I see
The mouth and the teeth
That's fine with me
What have I got if not a thought?

I knew, oh I knew
I knew

It was a fool's errand
Waiting for a sign
But I can't leave until the sign comes to mind
A fool's errand

But I can make it through
I was thin and I saw All Life in you
A fool's errand
