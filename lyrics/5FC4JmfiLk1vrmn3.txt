Where we start
Is where we end
We step out sweetly
With nothing planned

Along by the river
We feed bread to the swans
And then over the footbridge
To the woods beyond

We walk ourselves weary
You and I
There's just this moment

I light a campfire
Away from the path
We lie in the bluebells
A woodpecker laughs

Time passes slowly
Our hearts entwined
All of the dark times left behind

The day is done
The sun sinks low
We fold up the blanket
It's time to go

We walk ourselves weary
Arm in arm
Back through the twilight
Home again
We're home again

We waltz in the moonlight
And the embers glow
So much behind us
Still far to go
Still far to go
