Been flying high
You know how I feel
Sewn in the sky
You know how I feel
Breeze drifting on by
You know how I feel
It's a new a dawn
And a new day
And a new life for me
And I'm feeling good
So good, yeah

Fish in the sea
You know how I feel
Winters running free
You know how I feel
Bouncing on the tree
You know how I feel
It's a new a dawn
And a new day
And a new life for me
And I'm feeling good
So good
So good

Dragon fly out in the sun
You know what I mean
Don't you know?
Butterflies all having fun
You know what I mean
Sleeping peacefully is done
That's what I mean
And this old one
Is a new one
And the right one for me
For me

Stars when you shine
You know how I feel
Scent of pine
You know how I feel
Afraid out of his mind
And I know how I feel
It's a new dawn
And a new day
And a new love for me
And I'm feeling...
Oh...
I'm feeling good

You know how I feel
You know how I feel
You
You know how I feel
Feeling good
I'm feeling good
I'm feeling good
Feeling good
Feeling good
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life for me
