Oh, I used to be disgusted
Now I try to be amused
But since their wings have got rusted
You know the angels wanna wear my red shoes

But when they told me
'Bout their side of the bargain
That's when I knew that I could not refuse
And I won't get any older

Now the angels wanna wear my red shoes
Oh, I was watching while you're dancing away
Our love got fractured in the echo and sway
How come everybody wants to be your friend?
You know that it still hurts me just to say it

Oh, I know that she's disgusted
(Oh, why is that?)
'Cause she's feeling so abused
(Oh, that's too bad)

She gets tired of the lust
(Oh, I'm so sad)
But it's so hard to refuse
How can you say that I'm too old

When the angels have stolen my red shoes?
Oh, I said, "I'm so happy I could die"
She said, "Drop dead" then left with another guy
That's what you get if you go

Chasing after vengeance
Ever since you got me punctured
This has been my sentence
Oh, I used to be disgusted

And now I try to be amused
Since their wings have got rusted
You know the angels wanna wear my red shoes
But when they told me

'Bout their side of the bargain
That's when I knew that I could not refuse
And I won't get any older
Now the angels wanna wear my red shoes

Oh, I won't get any older
Now the angels wanna wear my red shoes
Red shoes, the angels wanna wear my red shoes
Red shoes, the angels wanna wear my red shoes

Red shoes, the angels wanna wear my red shoes
Red shoes, the angels wanna wear my red shoes
Red shoes, the angels wanna wear my red shoes
Red shoes, the angels wanna wear my red shoes

Red shoes, the angels wanna wear my red shoes
Red shoes, the angels wanna wear my red shoes...
