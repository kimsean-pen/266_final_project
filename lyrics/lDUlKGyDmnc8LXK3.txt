If love is blind
Why do we got to be pretty all the time?
(Girls, girls)

You tell me I never smile
You tell me I talk too much
It feels like I'm under fire
It feels like I'm not enough

I won't let you bring me down
Gotta let all of me out
I don't need to look so perfect
To make me feel like I'm worth it now

If love is blind
Why do we got to be pretty all the time?
(Girls, girls)
If love is blind
Why do we got to be pretty all the time?
(Girls, girls)

Don't tell me that I look tired
I'm already in my head
Don't tell me that I look better
With my hair up, dressed up and make-up

Don't need you telling me how
I could look beautiful now
If I lived up to your standards
I'll break under the pressure now (girls)

If love is blind
Why do we got to be pretty all the time?
(Girls, girls)
If love is blind
Why do we got to be pretty all the time?
(Girls, girls)

(You just got to be who you are that's all you can be)
(You just got to be who you are that's all you can be)
(You just got to be who you are that's all you can be)
(You just got to be who you are that's all you can be)

If love is blind
Why do we got to be pretty all the time?
(Girls, girls)
If love is blind
Why do we got to be pretty all the time?
(Girls, girls)

If love is blind (you just got to be who you are)
Why do we got to be pretty all the time? (that's all you can be)
(Girls, you just got to be who you are)
(Girls, that's all you can be)
If love is blind (you just got to be who you are)
Why do we got to be pretty all the time? (that's all you can be)

Pretty all the time
(Girls)
