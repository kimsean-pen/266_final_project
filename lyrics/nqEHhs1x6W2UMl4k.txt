Looking for the mystery of love
With you
Everyday
Walking on the clouds above
In the sky
Far away
Sailing through the sea of love
With you
Everyday
Digging diamonds in the grove
In this land
Far away

Looking for the mystery of love
With you
Every day
Walking on the clouds above
In the sky
Far away
Sailing through the sea of love
With you
Every day
Digging diamonds in the grove
In this land
Far away

Come with me
Share the mystery
This was meant to be
It's up to you and me

Come with me
Share the mystery
Love can set us free
Close your eyes and you will see

Come with me
Share the mystery
This was meant to be
It's up to you and me

Come with me
Share the mystery
Love can set us free
Close your eyes and you will see
