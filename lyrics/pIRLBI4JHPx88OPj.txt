When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

And darlin', I, will be lovin' you till we're seventy
And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty three
I'm thinking about how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Me, I fall in love with you every single day

I just wanna tell you I am
So, honey, now
Take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
When my hairs all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way

I know you will still love me the same
Cos, honey, your soul could never grow old
It's evergreen
And, baby, your smiles forever in my mind and memory

I'm thinking about how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
But baby, now
Take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

Place your head on my beating heart
Thinking out loud
Baby, we found love right where we are
Oh, oh
So, baby, now
Take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh, darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
Maybe we found love right where we are
Maybe we found love right where we are
