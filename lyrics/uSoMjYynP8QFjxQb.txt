I've been trying to keep my grip, yeah I think I'm over this
I can hear it now, oh no
Yeah, my tongue, I'll let it slip. Why'd I do those things I did?
I can taste it now, oh no
I'll try my best, how much do I invest?
Like cardiac arrest, high voltage in her lips
I'll try my best, how much do I invest?
Like cardiac arrest, high voltage when we kiss
My innards turn, your eyes, they roll. I'll be there to take the fall
I can feel it now, oh no
Same old story since day one, but I've got no place to run
I can see it now, oh no
I'll try my best, how much do I invest?
Like cardiac arrest, high voltage in her lips
I'll try my best, how much do I invest?
Like cardiac arrest, high voltage when we kiss
(Oh, woah)
High voltage in her lips, they catch me when I slip
(Oh, woah)
High voltage in her lips, they catch me when I slip
I'll try my best, how much do I invest?
Like cardiac arrest, high voltage in her lips
I'll try my best, how much do I invest?
Like cardiac arrest, high voltage when we kiss
(Oh, woah)
(Like cardiac arrest, high voltage in her lips)
(Oh, woah)
(Like cardiac arrest, high voltage when we kiss)
