Last chance lost--
in the tyranny of a long good-bye
last chance lost--
we talk of us with deadly earnest eyes
last chance lost--
we talk of love in terms of sacrifice and compromise
last chance--
last chance lost
Last chance lost--
the hero cannot make the change
last chance lost--
the shrew will not be tamed
last chance lost--
they bicker on the rifle range
blame takes aim
last chance--
last chance lost
