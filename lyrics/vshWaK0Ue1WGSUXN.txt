Look around, the writing's on the wall
Don't you think we're all feeling crazed
In a world, where nothing's as it seems
Paved with broken dreams, I found truth
Well my god, I should know you're right
I should know it's right to say I thank you for my days

Come around and see the other side
Stepping stones, away from the limelight
Come around and breathe in peace of mind
And for it all, I thank you
I thank you

Sit down, lose yourself in thought
Then you might find out it's all we've got
Well take a chance, the future's in your hands
Make it what you can before your time has reached the end

Come around and see the other side
Stepping stones, away from the limelight
Come around and breathe in peace of mind
And for it all, I thank you
I thank you

Come around and see the other side
Stepping stones, away from the limelight
Come around, and breathe in peace of mind
And for it all... You'll make it, on your own
Yeah, you're free
Stepping stones away from the limelight
Come around and breathe in peace of mind
and for it all I thank you, I thank you, I thank you, I thank you
