I've seen it all, boys --
I've been all over.
Been everywhere in the whole wide world.
I rode the high line with ol' Blind Darby.
I danced real slow with Ida Jane.
I was full of wonder when I left Murfreesboro --
Now I am full of hollow on Maxwell street.
And I hope my Pony
I hope my Pony
I hope my Pony
Knows the way back home.
I walked from Nachez to Hushpukena --
I built a fire by the side of the road.
I worked for nothing in a Belzoni saw mill.
I caught a blind out on the B and O
Talullah's friendly Belzoni ain't so
A 44'll get you 99.
And I hope my Pony
I hope my Pony
I hope my Pony
Knows the way back home.
I run my race with burnt face Jake --
Gave him a Manzanita cross.
I lived on nothing but dreams and train smoke
Somehow my watch and chain got lost.
I wish I was home in Evelyn's kitchen
With old Gyp curled around my feet.
And I hope my Pony
I hope my Pony
I hope my Pony
Knows the way back home.
