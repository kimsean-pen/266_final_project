You'll never know, unless you try, you're blinding by what you idleise
I stand alone, nobody knows the morning
The sun is roll he in my light
He's in my sole he's even in my rock and roll I stand alone nobody knows
The morning the sun is roll

I'm here to show, I'll help you out, it takes a lifetime, I've worked it out,
I stand alone nobody knows the morning
The sun is roll, the morning,
The sun is roll the morning
The sun is roll the morning
The sun is roll

So let it be and give it time you go you're way and I'll go mine, I'll stand
Alonem nobody knows the morning sun is roll
You'll never know unless we try
We're blinded by what you idleise we stand alone nobody knows the morning
The sun is roll the morning
The sun is roll the morning
The sun is roll the morning
The sun is roll the morning
The sun is roll the morning
The sun is roll the morning
The sun is roll the morning
The sun is roll the morning
