Don't, honey don't, go away, no no
Don't you hear, don't you hear,
What I say, what I say
Give me time, give me time
I'm gonna make your love as strong as mine
But I know Rome wasn't built in a day

Now, you know that I love you dear with all my heart
I know that you didn't love me from the start
But I planted a lil' seed in your heart I know
And it just needs time to grow, baby

Don't, honey don't, go away, no no
Don't you hear, don't you hear,
What I say, what I say
Give me time, give me time
I'm gonna make your love as strong as mine
But I know Rome wasn't built in a day
Listen to me honey now

How would Romeo feel if his Juliet
Had turned down his advances and played hard to get
He wouldn't have let this bother him, this I know
Because where there's light there's hope
Oh!

Baby, don't go away, no no
Don't you hear now, don't you hear now,
What I say, what I say
Give me time, give me time
I'm gonna make your love as strong as mine
But I know Rome wasn't built in a day

Don't you hear me telling you that
Rome wasn't built in a day
Don't you realize that
Rome wasn't built in a day
