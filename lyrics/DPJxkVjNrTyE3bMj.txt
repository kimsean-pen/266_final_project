Broken down, feeling naked
Leaving me unfulfilled
Promising compromise
Championing mediocrity

Time and time again
What you said ain't what you mean
Even if all my bones are broken
I will drag myself back from the edge

To kill the King, the King is dead, long live the King
Kill the King, the King is dead, long live the King
I am the King, God save the King

Kill the King, the King is dead
I am the King, long live the King
Kill the King, the King is dead
I am the King, long live the King

I reveal a deceiver
In the highest seat in the land
His idle hands the Devil's workshop
Generate more smoke than heat

Time and time again
What you said ain't what you mean
Even if all my bones are broken
I will drag myself back from the edge

To kill the King, the King is dead, long live the King
Kill the King, the King is dead, long live the King
I am the King, God save the King

A new precedent in pain (A new precedent in pain)
Mankind is blown to dust (Mankind is blown to dust)
An explosion of the brain (An explosion of the brain)
Spontaneously combust (Spontaneously combust)

Kill the King, the King is dead, long live the King
I am the King
Kill the King (I), the King is dead (I am), long live the King
I am the King

Kill the King (I), the King is dead (I am), long live the King
I am the King
Kill the King (I), the King is dead (I am), long live the King
I am the King
