Stoneface dog, swirling fog
Gates open on the dark, dark night
Standing stone, skull and bone
Dead witness to an unseen fight

Beat the drum, beat the drum
Beat forever on the endless march
Stricken dumb, cut and run
Someone's screaming and the sky is dark

Sword and shield
Bone and steel
Rictus grin
Deaf forever to the battle's din
Deaf forever to the battle's din, hey

March or croak, flame and smoke
Burn forever in eternal pain
Charge and fall, bugle call
Bone splinter in the driving rain

Horses scream, Viking dream
Drowned heroes in a lake of blood
Armoured fist, severed wrist
Broken spears in a sea of mud

Sword and shield
Bone and steel
Rictus grin
Deaf forever to the battle's din
Deaf forever to the battle's din, hey

Deaf forever
Stone dead forever

Mother Earth, Mother Earth
Enfold you in her cold embrace
Sinking down, killing ground
Worm crawling on your cold white face

Win or lose, naught to choose
All men are equal when their memory fades
No-one knows, friends or foes
If Valhalla lies beyond the grave

Sword and shield
Bone and steel
Rictus grin
Deaf forever to the battle's din
Deaf forever to the battle's din
Deaf forever to the battle's din
Deaf forever to the battle's din, hey
