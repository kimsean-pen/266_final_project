You were so smart then,
in your jacket and coat.
My softest red scarf was warming your throat.
Winter was on us,
at the end my nose,
and I'll never love England more than when covered in snow.

But a friend of mine says it good to hear,
that you believe in love even if set in fear.
Well I'll hold you there brother and set you straight
I don't really believe true love is frail and willing to break.

I will come back here, bring me back when I'm old.
I want to lay here forever in the cold.
I might be cold but I'm just skin and bones,
and I'll never love England more than when covered in snow.

I wrote my name in your book,
only God knows why,
and I bet you that he cracked a smile.
And I'm clearing all the crap out of my room,
trying desperately to figure out what it is that makes me blue,
and I wrote in a big letter to you,
and it's 22 pages front and back but it's too good to be used.
And I tried to be a girl who likes to be used,
I'm too good for that, there's a mind under this hat.
And I called them all and told them I've got to move

And I'm out on my own,
It's too hard
I'm out on my own
It's too hard

Feel like running,
feel like running,
running off.

And we will keep you,
we will keep you little one,
safe from harm,
like an extra arm you are a part of us.

You were so smart then,
in your jacket and coat.
My softest red scarf was warming your throat.

Winter will leave us,
left the end of my nose.
Well goodbye old England until next years snow.
