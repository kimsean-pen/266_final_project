Got bitten fingernails and a head full of the past
And everybody's gone at last
A sweet sweet smile that's fading fast
'Cause everybody's gone at last
And you don't get upset about it, no not anymore
There's nothing wrong that wasn't wrong before
Had a second alone with a chance let pass
And everybody's gone at last
Well, I hope you're not waiting, waiting around for me
Because I'm not going anywhere, obviously
Got a broken heart and your name on my cast
And everybody's gone at last, everybody's gone at last
