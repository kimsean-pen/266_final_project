Chances come to show
Your colours running out
They're sipping through the floor
They're gonna find you out
Expose for what you are
Your rumors don't work here
You told me try before
It's all up and look clear

And now you ask me to help you to work it out
It's not that easy your colours running out
It's more than ever thaught around

I din't think you've learned
The senses stays the same
Everything you are
Shift from day to day
This fingered by the line
I'm balanced by the sound
It's been ringing out for a year
Then is best to look ground

Now you ask me to help you to work it out
It's not that easy your colours running out
I owe you every joy of love

Now you ask me to help you to work it out
It's not that easy the colours running out
I owe you every joy of love
