There's a light
A light that shines on me
And all my friends and family would agree

Hey look, it's over you
Its shining brighter still
Hey man it's overdue
But it's your spotlight still

There is a feeling in the California air
There is lust for peace
And righteousness everywhere
Lust for me and you
And for our spirits too

There is a reason
And we play among the stars
A reason that we are just who we are
A reason that we thrive
Belief to keep alive
A reason that we sing
Our song and everything

There is a garden
In the expanse of your mind
The harvest will speak volumes in due time
Flowers they will bloom
And brother so will you
Teach us
So we radiate
Return us to our
Newborn living state

There is inspiration
In everyone you meet
Every human being on the street
They all sing a special song
And when you sing along
You are this for them
One note will start the feeling

Today you will grow
And though your heart was filled with stone
The chains that were so limiting
Well now they're gone
You cut them right and half
With your dream
And with your laugh

You are the sky
You are the sun
You are America and you are everyone

You are the miracle of love
With all your children at your feet
You are the ocean from above
So dear so deep

Keep us
Floating in mid air
In service to the feeling
Of creations precious secret: love
Believing in each other
As we dance into eternity

There's a light
A light that shines on me
And all my friends and family would agree
Hey look, it's over you
It's shining brighter still
Hey man it's overdue
But it's your spotlight still
