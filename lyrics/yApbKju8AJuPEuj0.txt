Carry on
When the valley's deep
I'll be strong
With a mighty love to
Carry on
Never sleep til' the new day dawns

There's a new breeze blowin' tonight
Clear away the past
Honey, free at last
Yes, I've paid for the choices I've made

No apologies from me
You know I'll never, no
Never lose my will
Never, never standin' still

I'll carry on
When the valley's deep I'll be strong
With a mighty love to carry on
Never sleep til' the new day dawns
I carry on

I stand alone in the eye of the storm
Pressures all around
Tryin' to wear me down

But it's all right
I won't give up the fight
I said, "Lord, lift me up!"
Let me rise above

I'll never
Nobody's gonna take my pride
I won't stop
I will not be denied

Carry on
When the valley's deep I'll be strong
With a mighty love to carry on, carry on
I'll never sleep till the new day dawns
I carry on

I won't let, I won't let nothing hold me
No, no I won't let
Won't let nothing hold me back
I won't stop now
Carry on, I'll carry on

Yes, I'll carry
I'll carry on, yeah
Yes I'll carry
Carry on, I'm gonna carry on
Yes, I'll carry
Carry on
Don't carry on without me

I said I'll never
Nobody's gonna take my pride
I won't stop I will not be denied

Carry on
When the valley's deep
I'll be strong with the mighty love to
Carry on, carry on
I'll never sleep till the new day dawns

When the valley's deep
Just carry on
I'll carry on
When the mountain's too high
You gotta carry on
I'll carry on
With the mighty love
I'll never sleep
I'll carry on till the new day dawns
