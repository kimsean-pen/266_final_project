My watch is blurry when I look down at my hands
I'm just another, alive with impossible plans
I turn the lights low but we both know where we are
And when it's over, what becomes of your pure heart?

A love that never seems too careful to confine will be forever
Never lost or too defined
To lose the feeling of an endless searching through
How to have made what is never about me or you
That is the kind of love I'd always dreamed to be
However painful, let it break down all of me

'Til I am nothing else but the feeling
'Til I am nothing else but the feeling
Becoming true
Becoming true
Can't help feeling the way that I do
Can't help feeling the way that I do
Become a prophet
Become a fool

I'll let the light shine in
I'll let the light shine in
I'll let the light shine in
May the best of you win
Who is your truest friend?
Are they there at your end?
I'll let the light be black
And let some tears be shed
Do it all over again
I'll let the light shine in

It's not gonna kill you, it's not gonna kill you
It's not gonna kill you, it's not gonna kill you
It's not gonna break you, it's just gonna shake you
Shake you alive
Baby
Oh, baby

I'll let the light shine in
I'll let the light shine in
I'll let the light shine in
May the best of you win
