I don't wanna be a fake friend
But I'm get caught up playing piggy in the middle
I wasn't gonna weigh in
Grill ya like barbecue

I don't wanna be a fake friend
But I've been told you hurting quite a bit and
Don't wanna see you cave in
Meet that version of you

Fronting all day, all night, all day

Ooh you play it cool with me
Put me off a couple days
You get round to it when you can
You're a very fucking busy man
Ooh you gotta move with me
Grab a pen and write it down
I'll get wise to you when I can
Got me feeling really fucking bad

Gotta play it cool, gotta play it cool
Gotta play it cool, gotta play it cool
Now we got the blues, now we got the blues
Now we got the blues, now we got 'em

I'm not tryin' to be your best friend
And I get we ain't caught up for a minute
Not trying to kid myself that
I'd fix you up good as new
Still I'm not coming here to make friends
So I'm gonna push if only just a little
Don't like to see you wearing
This happy person suit

Fake it all day, all night, all day

Ooh you play it cool with me
Put me off a couple days
You get round to it when you can
You're a very fucking busy man
Ooh you gotta move with me
Grab a pen and write it down
I'll get wise to you when I can
Got me feeling really fucking bad

Gotta play it cool, gotta play it cool
Gotta play it cool, gotta play it cool
Now we got the blues, now we got the blues

I'm gonna ride that wave
I'm gonna ride that wave
Oooooh
I'm gonna ride that wave
I'm gonna ride that wave

I'm gonna ride that wave
I'm gonna ride that wave
Over and over, under and down
I'm gonna ride that wave
I'm gonna ride that wave
All day, all night
All day all night

Ooh you're playin' cool with me
Put me off a couple of days
You get round to it when you can
Guess you're just a fucking busy man
Ooh you gotta move with me
Yeah, grab a pen and write it down
I'll get wise to you when I can
Got me feeling really fucking bad

Gotta play it cool, gotta play it cool
Gotta play it cool, gotta play it cool
Now we got the blues, now we got the blues
