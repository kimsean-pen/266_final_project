All we know

Sun beats down
Down on America
Down on American Gods
Playing live on Letterman

Life cuts hard
Out in America
So to all your American Gods
Theres no room for sentiment
And letting it go

Tell me all of my secrets
Tell me all of my lies
To sit ourselves among the best of all our American Gods
(All our American Gods)
All we know as truth

(oh in america)

Empires fall
When we move the unmovable
But all my intelligent friends
See a long term benefit
In letting it go

Tell me all of my secrets
Tell me all of lies
Show my life in a mirror
Through the opposite side
And we kill for that moment
When we long to take flight
And sit ourselves among the best of all our American Gods
All our American Gods

(All our American Gods)

Tell me all of my secrets
Tell me all of lies
Show my life in a mirror
Through the opposite side
And we kill for that moment
When we long to take flight
And sit ourselves among the best of all our American Gods

(All our American Gods)
All we know lies true
