Well I'm walking around in my mind
Your image looks me down and I'm blind
No matter how far I move away
I find myself coming back everyday
Oh, just let me go
Oh, just let me go
Oh, just let me go
Oh, just let me go

I know I shouldn't stay, you do have your ways
with me
But I want to see the colours of freedom
From you Maybe time be my friend
as i try to break from this trend
Maybe its harder than it sounds
Maybe my heart still pounds
Oh, just let me go
Oh, just let me go
Oh just let me go

Oh, just let me go
I know I shouldn't stay, you do have your ways
with me
But I want to see the colours of freedom
From you
From you
