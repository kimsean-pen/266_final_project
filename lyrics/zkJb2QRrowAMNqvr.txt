a backwards march
my back against
meadows of fear
where it all began
and there's a hunt
for they seak the whom
and the purest of hearts
let their spirits be consumed

there's a new world laid at your feet
we build an army from nothing
we raise our children to the beat it's comforting pounding, la

a forward talk
solely against
old ways and means
we're not like them, nesu
i'm on a hunt
to find the cure
and before i depart into the deepest blue

behind all insecurity
there is a wall of assurance
she is her own worst enemy
she fights her battles for no one
there's a new world laid at your feet
we build an army from nothing
we raise our children to the beat
of it's comforting pounding

let it sink in for a new beginning
you know better now
water fills her lungs and she's inhaling
you feel better now
underneath the stars her body sinking
you do better now
a heavy sigh then not a sound

we have no lives to sacrifice
she makes us sing
it dampens the cries
if there's a want
for something new
you might find me at the start
or where it ends for you
