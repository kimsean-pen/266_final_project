I refuse to shroud my past.
These walls in here allow no rest.
Tomorrow morning I'll be dead.
This town will burn before the sun
Will drown in the ocean.

Nothing will ever be the same again.

Yes, you can put me to the test.
Or, you can cut my tongue at last.
Ideas are wandering through my head.
What if all that I never said
Were true?
(And, if everything that was happening were due?)
Were true
(And, if all these things that were happening were really due?)
