I got a gun, I keep it on my shelf and wait at home for you
Well, I won't use it 'less you force me to
I got a kiss from my right fist and it's been wound up tight for you
I won't use it 'less you force me to

You wanna love me, you want it
You wanna love me
You wanna love me
I wanna love you, too, I wanna love you, too
I wanna love you, too, I wanna love you, too

I got a girl, I think she's so tough
Man, the things I put her through
Well, I don't hurt her, but she wants me to
She's got a gift with her two lips
She speaks her twisted point of view
Well, I don't like it, but she wants me to

She wanna love me, she wants it
She wanna love me
I wanna love her, too, I wanna love her, too
I wanna love her, too, I wanna love her, too
I wanna love her, too, I wanna love her, too
I wanna love her, too, I wanna love her, too
I wanna love her, too, I wanna love her, too
I wanna love her, too, I wanna love her, too
I wanna love her, too, I wanna love her, too
I wanna love her, too, I wanna love her, too
I wanna love her, too, I wanna love her, too
I wanna love her, too, I wanna love her, too
