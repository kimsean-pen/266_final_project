You get up every morning
From the alarm clock's warning
Take the eight-fifteen into the city
There's a whistle up above
And people pushing, people shoving
And the girls who try to look pretty

And if your train's on time
You can get to work by nine
And start your slaving job to get your pay
If you ever get annoyed
Look at me, I'm self-employed
I love to work at nothing all day

And I've been takin' care of business
Every day
Takin' care of business
Every way

I've been takin' care of business
It's all mine
Takin' care of business
And working overtime
Work out

If it were easy as fishin'
You could be a musician
If you could make sounds loud or mellow
Get a second-hand guitar
Chances are you'll go far
If you get in with the right bunch of fellows
People see you having fun
Just a-lying in the sun
Tell them that you like it this way
It's the work that we avoid
And we're all self-employed
We love to work at nothing all day

And we've been takin' care of business
Every day
Takin' care of business
Every way
We've been takin' care of business
It's all mine
Takin' care of business
And working overtime
Funky

Woo, all right, oww!
I love it

Take good care of my business
When I'm away, every day
Woo

(Ha ha, whoo hoo, oh yeah)

You get up every morning
From alarm clock's warning
Take the eight-fifteen into the city
There's a whistle up above
And people pushing, people shoving
And the girls who try to look pretty

And if your train's on time
You can get to work by nine
And start your slaving job to get your pay
If you ever get annoyed
Look at me, I'm self-employed
I love to work at nothing all day

And I've been taking care of business
Every day
Takin' care of business
Every way
I've been takin' care of business
It's all mine
Takin' care of business
And working overtime, take care

Takin' care of business, woo
Takin' care of business
Takin' care of business, yo
Takin' care of business

Takin' care of business
Every day
Takin' care of business
Every way
Takin' care of business
It's all mine
Takin' care of business
Working overtime, woo

Takin' care of business
Takin' care of business
We've been takin' care of business
We've been takin' care of business, woo

Takin' care of business
Takin' care of business
Takin' care of business
