Dim the light, it hurts my eyes
it scars my skin and shatters my lies
fold the blinds, let's stay inside

Take my hand, I'll give you strength
come with me, we'll make our way
through the light
into the night

Welcome to my world
it's calm and cold
Welcome to my soul
it's withered and old

Welcome to my mind
tread lightly and slow
Welcome to my love
touch it and make it grow

We belong to this, this protected room
the world outside is for the ones
that's not afraid to lose

So take my hand, you are invited in
Share my darkness and my lusts
I'm filled to the brim
