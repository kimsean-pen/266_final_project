All your fears are lies
All your fears are lies
All your fears are lies
All your fears are lies

Clip-less, falling, limping, crawling
Biting, fighting
Back from dying
Endless ending
And comprehending
Nothing of the scent she's sending

Loosely buying the tv lie
And the maggot man will never cry
Corralled like a cat
With my head hit the sack
And I feel like I'm tied to the railroad track

All your fears are lies
All your fears are lies
All your fears are lies
All your fears are lies

Clip-less, falling, limping, crawling
Biting, fighting
Back from dying
Endless ending
And comprehending
Nothing of the scent she's sending
Loosely buying the tv lie
And the maggot man will never cry
Corralled like a cat
With my head hit the sack
And I feel like I'm tied to the railroad track

All your fears are lies
All your fears are lies
All your fears are lies
All your fears are lies

Clip-less, falling, limping, crawling
Biting, fighting
Back from dying
Endless ending
And comprehending
Nothing of the scent she's sending
Loosely buying the tv lie
And the maggot man will never cry
Corralled like a cat
With my head hit the sack
And I feel like I'm tied to the railroad track
