What you see is what you say, close your eyes, break in the day
Wind is blowing from the east where the day is born and ceased
Please be kind, draw the dreams you found in the morning trace
Draw the lines, draw the brown eyes and the foreign place
Draw the pines and the forest thighs and the magic face
Sun that rises it waits a while it will give you space

Seasons die, they become the rhymes of the memories
Summer nights and the fears that thrive through the winter rains

What you see is what you say close your eyes, break in the day
Wind is blowing from the east where the day is born and ceased
Aspen groves where the northern winds bring the wintery glow
Spiders crawl where the willow limbs sagging down so low
Draw the pines and the forest thighs and the magic trace
Sun that rises it waits a while it will give you space

Seasons die, they become the rhymes of the memories
Summer nights and the fears that thrive through the winter rains

These autumn days are long and grim,
the gap between the real and dreamt
These autumn days are long and grim,
the gap between the real and dreamt
Dreamed porcelain dolls with weird
smiles were holding giant butterflies
Dreamed porcelain dolls with weird
smiles were holding giant butterflies
