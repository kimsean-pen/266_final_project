I need a sign,
to let me know you're here
All of these lines are being crossed
over the atmosphere

I need to know,
that things are gonna look up
'Cause I feel us drowning
in a sea spilled from a cup

When there is no place safe
and no safe place to put my head
When you can feel the world shake
from the words that are said

And I-I-I-I'm,
calling all angels
And I-I-I-I'm,
calling all you angels

And I won't give up,
if you don't give up
I won't give up,
if you don't give up
I won't give up,
if you don't give up
I won't give up,
if you don't give up

I need a sign
to let me know you're here
'Cause my TV set
just keeps it all from being clear

I want a reason
for the way things have to be
I need a hand
to help build up some kind of hope
inside of me

And I-I-I-I'm,
calling all angels
And I-I-I-I'm,
calling all you angels

When children have to play inside,
so they don't disappear
While private eyes solve marriage lies
'cause we don't talk for years

And football teams are kissing queens
and losing sight of having dreams
In a world where what we want
is only what we want until it's ours...

And I-I-I-I'm,
calling all angels
And I-I-I-I'm,
calling all you angels
And I-I-I-I'm,
calling all angels
And I-I-I-I'm,
calling all you angels
calling all you angels

(I won't give up,
if you don't give up)
calling all you angels
(I won't give up,
if you don't give up)
calling all you angels
(I won't give up,
if you don't give up)
