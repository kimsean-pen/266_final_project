Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uhh

It seems to me so strange
Check wallet for his name
His face is in the muck
I think his zippers stuck

He is perfect for me
To practice surgery
When blood coagulates
Its time to operate
Just keep it going
Just keep it going

Just keep it going

He's not dead, he's gonna live
He's not dead, he's gonna live
I see his eyes rolling back in his head
He's not dead, he's gonna live
He's not dead, he's gonna live
I see his eyes rolling back in his head
He's not dead, he's gonna live
He's not dead, he's gonna live
I see his eyes rolling back in his head
He's not dead, he's gonna live
He's not dead, he's gonna live
I see his eyes rolling back in his head

Come on let's take him home
I think I heard him groan
Hold on or he will sink
Just keep it going

You say you're done but I know you can fake it
I can take it!

Just keep it going
Just keep it going
Just keep it going

He's not dead, he's gonna live
He's not dead, he's gonna live
I see his eyes rolling back in his head
He's not dead, he's gonna live
He's not dead, he's gonna live
I see his eyes rolling back in his head
He's not dead, he's gonna live
He's not dead, he's gonna live
I see his eyes rolling back in his head
He's not dead, he's gonna live
He's not dead, he's gonna live
I see his eyes rolling back in his head
In his head (Keep it going)
In his head (Just keep it)
In his head (Keep it going)
In his head (Just keep it going)
In his head (Keep it going)
In his head (Just keep it going)
In his head (Keep it going)
In his head (Just keep it going)
Keep it going
Just keep it going
Just keep it going
Just keep it going
Just keep it going
