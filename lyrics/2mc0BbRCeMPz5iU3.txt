(Ziltoid) Yes, I feel like a bit entertainment. Time to destroy a planet... Which one shall it be?
This one? No. Too feeble... This one, yes perhaps, yes. Indeed, this one shall do nicely.
Commander!
(Commander) Yes, Captain Ziltoid?
(Ziltoid) Divert all the power from the main engines to the front guns.
(Commander) Yes, Captain Ziltoid. Will there be anything else?
(Ziltoid) Take 90% of the surplus power, and divert it to the solar awakening device.
(Commander) Aye aye, Captain
(Ziltoid) We must summon the 6th dimensional planet smasher. I feel like a bit of fun. Summon him!

(Planet Smasher)
Who dares awaken the Planet Smasher?!
(Ziltoid) It is I, the 4th dimensional Ziltoid the Omniscient!
(Planet Smasher)
Cherish the mind, colour your mind
Cherish your mental sanctum

Coward to war, coward to war.
Coward to war on the Earth!

Cursed to be by the sun
Power denotes you're the only one who
Channels the mind, channels the mind,
Channels the mind of the Earth!

Cherish the pain, cherish the name
Cherish your mental weaponry

Cower towards, cower towards
Cowards remain on the Earth

Tell me what you want from me!

(Ziltoid)
All I want to be is the universe
Parallel to beings around all of us
Conduit to see through the omniverse
Letting the bombs go into tomorrow

Pull! (Smasher!)
Pull! (Smasher)
Bow to the valley below!
Bow down! (Smasher!)
Pull! (Smasher)
Bow to the valley below!

(The Hippies of virtual world 72) Please do not release the Planet Smasher, mighty Ziltoid!
We mean you no harm!

Pull! (Smasher!)
Bow down! (Smasher)
Bow to the valley below!
Pull! (Smasher!)
Bow down! (Smasher)
Bow to the valley below!

Smasher!

(Ziltoid)
All I want to be is the universe
Parallel to beings around all of us
Conduit to see through the omniverse

Begone! Foul Pest! And by the way, The name's Herman.
And I hate musicals!
