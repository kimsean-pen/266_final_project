Said she Rafiki, you a lion, Mufasa
Baby ain't nothing 'bout me PG, rated X for extraordinary
The Mary got me merry, now I'm singing like Mary Mary
The coupe going stupid, call it Cupid it's February
Lil boo got them juices, heal me up with the elderberry
Typhoon in that Poom Poom, taste better when it's vegetarian
I milk the game like moo-moo-moo, bitch get out the way
A St. Louis nigga give you Jason Voorhees or Jayson Tatum

A St. Louis nigga give you Jason Voorhees or Jayson
Shoot these niggas, lights out, dip the barrel in mashed potatoes
Shoot these niggas, lights out, dip the barrel in mashed potatoes

Father you
Told me come through with the follow through
Pour my heart out my pores
You can smell what I pour leaking out my follicles
5 A.M. leaving Follies finally, bouta go cop a 9-piece
Lemon pepper wet to dry my tummy, Remy got me slutty
She call me her lil baby, I call her my lil buddy
Hit her up like mhmm, come through for a lil Cudi
Hit her up like mhmm, come through for a lil Cudi
Hit her up like mhmm, come through for a lil Cudi
I'm flee like 10 puppies, these Japanese
I don't drink champagne but fuck it, clack the drinks
Overseas with the G's that's hard, concrete shit
'Cause these niggas been my boys from the cement, believe it
I fingered the fire, then figaro heat up Lebron
Look at the time, a quarter to nine, a nigga just ordered my nine
Hakuna Matata, I look like my father
You a lion, Mufasa (I need you)

Said she Rafiki, you a lion, Mufasa
Baby ain't nothing 'bout me PG, rated X for extraordinary
The Mary got me merry, now I'm singing like Mary Mary
The coupe going stupid, call it Cupid it's February
Lil boo got them juices, heal me up with the elderberry
Typhoon in that Poom Poom, taste better when it's vegetarian
I milk the game like moo-moo-moo, bitch get out the way
A St. Louis nigga give you Jason Voorhees or Jayson Tatum

St. Lou', came from St. Lou', straight from St. Lou'
St. Lou', St. St. Lou', St... St. Lou'
