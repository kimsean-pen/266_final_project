Walls collapse, on the city of refuge!!
Under the enormity, of it's own violence!!
Roads bend slowly, in on themselves!!
With the sorrow, of generations!!
Buildings stained, pitch black lean!!
In the carcass, of time glazing over!!
They bite and latch, at the throat of morality!!
Strangle and smother the future of all!!
Gnawing at old flesh, barking at the sun!!
Within Armageddon, humans eat each other!!
Their teeth pull and tear, at the chords of memory!!
Gore the human soul, dowse the human spirit!!
Man will fail!!!!
Man will always fail!!!!
Man will fail!!!!
Man will always fail!!!!
