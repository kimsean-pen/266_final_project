I know you've heard these words a hundred other times before
And you've been hurt and so your heart has chose to close the door
love broke your heart and brought you lies
look in my eyes
you'll see a love that's deep and true
tender and strong and all for you
you can trust this love
honest, that's the honest truth.

from the heart
i'm giving you everything, everything
from the heart
i promise you that i'll be there
i'll be there to love you
from the soul
i'm showing you all i feel, all i feel is
from the heart, from the heart.

i will protect you and respect you and be all you need
and when you reach for love you'll only need to reach for me
these arms will never let you down
they're staying around
i'll walk with you through every storm
i'll keep you safe, i'll keep you warm
and you'll have no doubt
you're the one i'm living for

repeat chrous

i'll provide the love you need
just trust my touch
believe in me
i'll never make you cry
giving all i've got with all i've got inside.
