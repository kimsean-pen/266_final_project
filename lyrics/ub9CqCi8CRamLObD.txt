I hear your voice
But it can't bring me back
I'm dreaming of all the things
I ever thought I had
I'm pushing down
I'm diving deep
Yeah slow dive to my dream
I'm feeling good, yeah
I'm feeling free

Slow dive, you can't touch me now

I close my eyes
And let the ground slip
From my mind
I'm falling now
I'm diving now
I'm gliding in the sky
Graceful birds will whisper
As I sadly pass them by
He's feeling good, yeah
He's feeling free

Slow dive, you can't touch me now
