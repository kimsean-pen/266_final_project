Sometimes I doubt the path I chose
Sometimes my dreams feel all on hold

There's no doubt that this will make me strong

Because it's the hardest thing I've ever done

Despite this cruel world
And all my best efforts
You surprise me with just how perfect you are

Even with all my flaws
And my bad examples
You surprise me with
Just how perfect you are

And when I'm lost
You search for me
And when I doubt
You're my belief
I'm suppose to be
The stronger one
You always seem
To prove that theory wrong

Still, I hold my breath each time you go

Out in the world that's beyond my control

If you are dreaming
I never want to wake you up

When I'm all in a spin

Full of cynicism
You remind me of just how perfect you are

When I'm at my wit
