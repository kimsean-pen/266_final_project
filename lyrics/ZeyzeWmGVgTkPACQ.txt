Watch the moment as it fades
And tell yourself it ain't like dying
Have you got something for the taste?
Because the chemicals are kicking in
So pray the morning never comes
I've given up on damning
And you know I couldn't say it
But I was hoping I would drown...
I was hoping I would drown

Half the world is keeping me whole, I know
A symphony to keep you in the dark, I know

Now I've been rowing oceans in your sleep
And yet by giving it it's giving in
I left enough for you to read to try to take it back
But I was hoping I would drown

Half the world is keeping me whole, I know
A symphony to keep you in the dark, I know

As we fade never knowing if we'll dream about it
And as we fall hoping we had said enough to begin
We are the same, all alone we'll face our doubts in the end
But keep your hands upon the wheel
Darling, I'm afraid
Be yourself when you're full of doubt
Hold on to the reins
Be yourself, and when it's falling down
Listen to the rain
Be yourself when you're calling out
Darling, we're the same
So keep your hands upon the wheel
