movement outside, silence inside
restless lovers spread your wings as the day begins

it's just the sun rising
it's just the sun rising
it's shining
it's just the sun rising
it's just the sun rising

learn to love your secret life, still calm and gentle life
your resolution comes too fast, now the night is past

it's just the sun rising
it's just the sun rising
it's shining
it's just the sun rising
it's just the sun rising

smiling, gliding, breathless you're riding
love is just a state of mind that we leave behind

it's just the sun rising
it's just the sun rising
it's shining
it's just the sun rising
it's just the sun rising

let yourself go

it's just the sun rising
it's just the sun rising
it's shining
it's just the sun rising
it's just the sun rising
it's shining.

it's just the sun rising
it's just the sun rising
it's shining
it's just the sun rising
sun rising

life, love... (adlib to fade)
