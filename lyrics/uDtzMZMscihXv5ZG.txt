Hope it dries the mouth
The enemy clear
The trees pulled out
And the song
That's still within
Flattens the void that Moi began

Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
It's going to overrun this town
As soon as the moon goes to nothing
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
They're always going to run you down
It's better to face my something

So the roots were long
Each flower a claw that reminds the man
And love still kept you there
The memory earthed for us to share

You laid the land
Laid bare
So, all I do is stare and

Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
It's going to overrun this town
It fallows you everywhere
They're always going to run you down
It's better to face my something
It's better to face my something

You're their fort standing
Nothing can shake your walls
One will that's worth so many
The leopard at their throats

You're their fort standing
Nothing can shake your walls
One will that's worth so many
The leopard at their throats

You're their fort standing
You're their fort standing
You're their fort standing
You're their fort standing

Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
It's going to overrun this town
As soon as the moon goes to nothing
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
They're always going to run you down
It's better to face my something
