Live in this moment like there is no past
All that matters is to be who you are
Be in this moment judgments will not last
Urge yourself again to claim back your life
Take a leap into the dark
Dare to dive and fall
The point of no return restrains us

Shine through the sky
Beyond the matrix
Feel what it's like
To reach divinity
Aim at the sky open your mind
Then you will be balanced and free
Be the master over your own energy

Shake off oiled feathers leave your past behind
Use your inner force to reach your true self
When there's no future you can't be occupied
By non-essential waste and ruins of the past
Recreate your hologram
Dare to dive and fall
The point of no return restrain us

Shine through the sky
Beyond the matrix
Feel what it's like
To reach divinity
Aim at the sky open your mind
Then you will be balanced and free
Be the master over your own energy

Someday you'll open up again
To learn and grow
Someday you'll have to reach for new endeavors
To perceive your inner self
Perceive your soul
Someday you'll start to live your life

Shine through the sky
Beyond the matrix
Feel what it's like
To reach divinity
Aim at the sky open your mind
Then you will be balanced and free
Be the master over your life
Stay in charge maintain your duty
Dive into the sea of pure tranquility
