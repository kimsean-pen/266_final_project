It's dark and cold tonight
I'm walking all alone
And one step at a time
I'm getting closer

I know she's hard to find
Instinctively I try
To take the path of love
Into the night

There would be no reason
If you really didn't care
There would be no reason for love

The door is open wide is anybody there?
I know this must be the room in your heart
I really don't know why but it's so easy to breathe
I know this must be the room in your heart

No answers question me
No one's been here before
I'm the first to see
The light at your door

If I could hold you now
I wouldn't disagree
With these four walls
You're protecting me

There would be no reason
If you really didn't care
There would be no reason for love

The door is open, is anybody there?
I know this must be the room in your heart
I really don't know why but it's so easy to breathe
I know this must be the room in your heart

Oh yeah, I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel the love that's surrounding me
Coming out of you

The door is open wide, is anybody there?
I know this must be the room in your heart
I really don't know why but it's so easy to breathe
I know this must be the room in your heart
Is anybody there
The door is open wide, is anybody there?
I know this must be the room in your heart
I really don't know why but it's so easy to breathe
I know this must be the room in your heart
