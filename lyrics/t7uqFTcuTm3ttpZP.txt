Oh, this is what it's coming to
Another Waterloo
You wanna put me underground
Cause I'm overused
Giving up as you're pulling me down
I will make you come unglued

You can cover me in subtleties
What an effigy!
I can fake it, cause you'll never be real to me
I'm innocent
I know I'm near the end
But if I can't understand, I will never win

The more I know my mind
The more I leave you all behind
Living in the shadow of doubt
I'll never obey, but I'll always decide

All my hopes survive
I've gotta do it alone
I will burn alive in the House Of Gold & Bones...

Oh, you're the epitome of all the shit in me
And I'm surrounded by the people I will never be
Either way, I've got nothing to prove
To a son of a bitch like you

Well this is hell, and I wanted it
But I'm an idiot...
It's a phase, cause I know I'm illegitimate

Kill it
I wanna see it!
I wanna feel it!
I won't be here forever!

The more I know my mind
The more I leave you all behind
Living in the shadow of doubt
I'll never obey, and I'll always decide

All my hopes survive
I've gotta do it alone
I will burn alive in the House Of Gold & Bones!

The more I know my mind
The more I leave this world behind
Living in the shadow of doubt
I'm already gone, I'm already alive!

All my hopes survive
I've gotta do it alone
I will burn alive in the House Of Gold & Bones...

All my hopes survive
I've gotta do it alone
I will burn alive in the House Of Gold & Bones!

In the House Of Gold & Bones!
In the House Of Gold & Bones!
