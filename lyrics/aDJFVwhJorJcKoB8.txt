Careful when you open
It's easy to be broken
In the strangest fashion
You start a chain reaction
When You look my way
Something's pounding away
And I wonder if I ever felt this before

And All this time
Oblivious To what you make so obvious
I can't believe I never noticed my heart before

You are reaching something that is beating
I can't believe I never noticed my heart before
Over and again, racing out of my skin

I can't believe I've never noticed my heart before
At least it was never until I noticed
You and your ways
Capture what I've misplaced
In the perfect fashion
Just watch my heart's reaction

This point of view is nothing that I'm used to
But I won't close my eyes cause they're on to you

And All this time
It was staring me blind
I can't believe I never noticed my heart before

You are reaching something that is beating
I can't believe I never noticed my heart before

Over and again, racing out of my skin
I can't believe I've never noticed my heart before
At least it was never until I noticed You.
The only time I ever noticed my heart was
When I noticed You, Yeah
The only time I ever noticed my heart was

When I noticed You, Yeah
You yeah
You yeah!
1-2-3!

You are reaching for something that is beating
I can't believe I never noticed my heart before
Over and again, racing out of my skin
I can't believe I've never noticed my heart before
Til I noticed you yeah
I noticed you yeah
When I noticed you yeah
You yeah
When I noticed you yeah
I noticed you yeah
That's the only time I ever noticed my heart before.
