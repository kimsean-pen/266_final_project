In between the lines
We replace somebody
How often do I find
Revolution in me

Watch the space that's left by those who're gone
The names of men
Written for only the desperate to find
Better yet again gather what we know
And start to show
These many miles of woe, so

In between the lines
We replace somebody
How often do I find
Revolution in me
A mean design
This mind and body
When the two collide
Revolution in me

I'm tired of all these bad signs
And now there's no time to wait for people
To change their minds
'Cause from now on their burden is mine
Without their screaming
When they say they're leaving
Now is only to remind, remind

In between the lines
We replace somebody
How often do I find
Revolution in me
Revolution in me
A mean design
This mind and body
When the two collide
Revolution in me

In between the lines
We replace somebody
How often do I find
Revolution in me
A mean design
This mind and body
When the two collide
Revolution in me
