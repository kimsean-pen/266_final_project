Tuesday wakes up silent and there aren't enough pills to sleep (cut out)
Like a miswired short wave radio
It's over but nothing can change to make this right (try again)
When you live in a nightmare, its written all over your face

And in a short time
You're never the same again
The distance is streamlined
between decision and defence

Distorient the senses, loss of identity
No one to trust, no one to trust

Life runs through this trade
I am no killer, but I still hide my face, in the coming days

I wake up every morning from the same dream (kill it)
But you can't change the letters when the ink dries
I woke up on the sidewalk and everything just changed (come on)
And now the lights are blinking but I can't see anything

Life runs through this trade
I am no killer, but I still hide my face, in the coming days
Life runs through this trade
I am no killer

Everything's falling apart, Everything's falling apart
Everything's falling... apart
Crumpled paper, crushed tin cans, broken bottles
paper scraps, we're all the same, we're all the same, paper scraps
We're all the same, we're all the same

We all look the same
We all look the same
We all look the same
But I am the killer

And in a short time
Your never the same again
The distance is streamlined
Between decision and...
