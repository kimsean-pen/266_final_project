(Morgoth:)
Sit now there,
And look out on the lands
Where evil and despairt come upon those who thou lovest

Howest dare you mock me,
And to question the power of Melkor,
Master of the fates of Arda?

Therefore, with my eyes thou shall see,
With my ears thou shall hear.
Never shall thou leave from this place
Until all is fullfilled,
Until it's bitter end.

(Orcs:)
Lord and Master! Lord and Master!
Lord and Master! Lord and Master!
Lord and Master! Lord and Master!
Lord and Master! Lord and Master!
