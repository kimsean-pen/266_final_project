Looking back on a past when we still had a chance
We were pawns in a game that we could not win
Now we're alone, just a pick and stone
We're dreaming of a future when our ship comes in

Dreaming of a future when our ship comes in

Hey, ho
A prisoner's song
Pawns in a game that we could not win
Hey, ho
A prisoner's song
Dreaming of a future, when our ships comes in

A prisoner to my thoughts a number and a cell
Locked up like a dog in this worldly hell
Marching along, another man on the gang
I'm shackled and sentenced to the ball and chain

Shackled and sentenced to the ball and chain

Hey, ho
A prisoner's song
Marching along, another man on the gang
Hey, ho
A prisoner's song
Shackled and sentenced to the ball and chain

We count the days and nights
We're paying with our lives
We're paying for our wrongs
Singing a prisoner's song
Singing a prisoner's song
Looking back on a past when we still had a chance
We were pawns in a game that we could not win
Now we're alone, just a pick and stone
We're dreaming of a future when our ship comes in
Dreaming of a future when our ship comes in
