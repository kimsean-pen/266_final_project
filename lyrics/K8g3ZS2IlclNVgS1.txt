When we were out on the beach that night
The sun was down and the tide was high
And as the wind picked up you softly said
"You've made a big mistake"

These weeks have been
Everything to me, I'm a fool for her
She looks to sea, "Darling, why pick me?
I'm not made for love"
You're not made for love

Well you've made a big mistake
You've made a big mistake
And when I think of all the things I've shared
Love must've got the best of me
'Cause I've found my place
But on the wind you said
"You've made a big mistake"

Three weeks that mean
Everything to me just flew by for her
She speaks down to me
"Darling, what do you think?
I'm not made for love"
You're not made for love

Well, you've made a big mistake
You've made a big mistake
Well, you've made a big mistake
You've made a big mistake
Well, you've made a big mistake
You've made a big mistake

When we were out on the beach that night
When we were out on the beach that night
When we were out on the beach that night
When we were out on the beach that night
When we were out on the beach that night

The sun was gone and the tide was high
