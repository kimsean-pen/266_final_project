Miss Independent
Miss self-sufficient
Miss keep your distance, mmmm
Miss unafraid
Miss out of my way
Miss don't let a man interfere, no
Miss on her own
Miss almost grown
Miss never let a man help her off her throne
So, by keeping her heart protected
She'll never, ever feel rejected
Little miss apprehensive
Said ooh, she fell in love

What is this feeling taking over?
Thinking no one could open the door
Surprise, it's time, to feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent's no longer need to be defensive?
Goodbye, old you, when love, is true
Misguided heart
Miss play it smart

Miss if you wanna use that line, you better not start, no
But she miscalculated
She didn't wanna end up jaded
And this miss decided not to miss out on true love
So, by changing a misconception
She went in a new direction
And found inside, she felt a connection
She fell in love
What is this feeling taking over?
Thinking no one could open the door

Surprise, it's time, to feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent's no longer need to be defensive?
Goodbye (goodbye), old you (old you), when love, is true (when love, is true)
When Miss Independent walked away
No time for love that came her way
She looked in the mirror and thought today
What happened to miss no longer afraid?

It took some time for her to see
How beautiful love could truly be
No more talk of why can't that be me
I'm so glad I've finally seen
What is this feeling taking over?
Thinking no one could open the door
Surprise (surprise), it's time, (ya) to feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent's no longer need to be defensive?
Goodbye (goodbye), old you, when love, is true (when love, is true)
