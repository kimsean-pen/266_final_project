I got this soul crow on my shoulder
The evil eyed leads a curious fight
And even angels can get caught in the act
With their halos round their ankles

Must be something in the water
Part time lovin' on a criminal scale
Two glass mantras on a hook, on a rail
Both trying to come together

You see me down on easy street,
Just trying to find my feet
Feels like I'm doing the same old shit
Over a different beat
Let us go somewhere
Where all the gods can't see
Alone and alive

Yeah, you should taste her majesty
My lil' cherry blossom
Just like a crow, you come and go
My lil' cherry blossom
My lil' cherry blossom

And all the rest seems circumstantial
Scattered cross a less predictable stage
Scrambled softly, they're all over your plate
I'll go and eat it all, again

You see me down on easy street,
Just trying to find my feet
Feels like I'm doing the same old shit
Over a different beat
Let us go somewhere
Where all the gods can't see
Alone and alive

Yeah, you should taste her majesty
My lil' cherry blossom
Just like a crow, you come and go
My lil' cherry blossom
My lil' cherry blossom
