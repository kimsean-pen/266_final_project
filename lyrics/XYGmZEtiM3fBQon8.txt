Behold
The new hate with all the same lost values
Forsake
What lives deeper in death we're all believers
Raise up your sirens, break through the silence
We are united in the search for something more

Cross your heart, open your mind
Hide your face in their disguise

Even when I fall down to my knees
I never say a prayer I don't believe
And I don't wanna look up to the Son
But I will never be the faithless one

No I will never be the faithless one

Refuse
To destroy the altars we are serving
The truth
In living is that our souls are searching
Live with defiance it's time to fight
Don't ever let them keep your words from being heard

Cross your heart
Open your mind
Hide your face in their disguise

Even when I fall down to my knees
I never say a prayer I don't believe
And I don't wanna look up to the Son
But I will never be the faithless one

No I will never be the faithless one

Even when I fall down to my knees
I never say a prayer I don't believe
And I don't wanna look up to the Son
But I will never be the faithless one

Even when I fall down to my knees
I never say a prayer I don't believe
And I don't wanna look up to the Son
But I will never be the faithless one

No I will never be the faithless one

And I will never be the faithless one
