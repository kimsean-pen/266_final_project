Your rigid eyes stare into gloom,
I'm pouring out my grief to you...
Should I escape?
Nothing but silence where I stand,
Just a slight light at the end to pretend
I could escape.

White walls coming closer and closer,
Absorb my words without response.

I am your guide out of the dark
At the back of beyond
I hear your cries although they're gone.
Strain to scream my heart to you,
From my lips no sound escapes,
Just light from the moon... a twilit cry...

Trying to pick the better side
Stay in darkness, chase the light,
Am I wrong, or am I right?
Painful sun is touching your face,
A single ray may recall you to life.
I am your guide out of the dark

At the back of beyond
I hear your cries although they're gone.
Through the night, out of the dawn
I am by your side, but you are still alone.
Oh...
I am your guide out of the dark
At the back of beyond
I hear your cries although they're gone.
Through the night, out of the dawn
I am by your side, but you are still alone.
