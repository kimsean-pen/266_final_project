Well I'm standing here looking at you
What do I see? I'm looking straight through
It's so sad when you're young
To be told you're having fun

So unplug the jukebox and do us all a favor
That music's lost it's taste so try another flavor

Well I'm standing here what do I see?
A big nothing threatening me
It's so sad when you're young
To be told you're having fun

So unplug the jukebox and do us all a favor
That music's lost it's taste so try another flavor
Antmusic, antmusic, antmusic, antmusic

So unplug the jukebox and do us all a favor
That music's lost it's taste so try another flavor
Antmusic, antmusic, antmusic, antmusic

Don't tread on an ant he's done nothing to you
There might come a day when he's treading on you
Don't tread on an ant you'll end up black and blue
You cut off his head, legs come looking for you

So unplug the jukebox and do us all a favor
That music's lost it's taste so try another flavor
Antmusic, antmusic, antmusic, antmusic

So unplug the jukebox and do us all a favor
That music's lost it's taste so try another flavor
