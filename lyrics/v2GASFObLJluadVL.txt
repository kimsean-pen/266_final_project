Got ghosts in the shower
Ghosts in the shower
Fog on the mirror
Got ghosts my shower

Got ghosts in the shower
Ghosts in the shower
Fog on the mirror
Got ghosts my shower

And every time I sing my tune that girl would sing

(Who which you are)
(Yes you are)
(Who which you are is now, is now)
(Yes you are is now)

Got ghosts in the shower
Ghosts in the shower
Fog on the mirror
Got ghosts my shower

Got ghosts in the shower
Ghosts in the shower
Fog on the mirror
Got ghosts my shower

And every time I sing my tune that girl would sing

Ghosts in the shower
Ghosts in the shower
Fog on the mirror
Got ghosts my shower
