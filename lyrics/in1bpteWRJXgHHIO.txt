dreary moon
out my window
hello, hello
to you

i concede
every moment
with you
with me

dreary moon
out my window
hello, hello
to you

i can see
every meaning
with you
with me

an evolution
the only way
i can explain anything
from loving you
always

a heavy burden
the holy way
i can escape anything
but loving you
always
