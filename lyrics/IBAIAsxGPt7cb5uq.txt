Is that you banging on my door at three a.m.
And are you wasted again?
Normally I? d stay in bed
So if I get up and open the door don't let it go to your head

It's just lust
It doesn't mean I love you
It's just lust
It doesn't mean I love you

Your jealousy and insecurity can be so over the top
I get so fatigued by these long emotional relationship talks
I'd really much prefer my own company most of the time
I never said I can't live without you baby, I just said you look good tonight
Normally I? d be making tracks, there's only one reason I came back

It's just lust
It doesn't mean I love you
It's just lust
It doesn't necessarily mean that I even like you very much

It's just lust
It doesn't mean I love you
It's just lust
It doesn't mean I love you

It's just lust
It doesn't mean I love you
It's just lust
It doesn't mean I love you

It's just lust
It doesn't mean I love you
It's just lust
It doesn't mean I love you
Normally I? d kick you to the curb
