Let's start the magic
Let's start the sun
Let's stop the holy
Four three two one

Last of devotion
Tune out the stunts
Tune in tomorrow
Here come the runts
Here come the runts

Here come the runts
Here come the runts
Ah yeah

(Wooh, wooh, wooh)

Everyone come along
Here come the runts
Here come the runts
Ah yeah

(Ooh ah, ah, ah)

Okay, I am a runt
Baby, you are a runt
Baby, we are the runts
I am a runt
Baby, you are a runt
Baby, here come the runts

I am a runt
Baby, you are a runt
Go and gather the runts
I am a runt
Baby, you are the runt
Mama, here come the runts
