Not what you need
Not what you need
We've been seduced by suffering
In spite of separation

Embedded in my head
The hallucination settles

If our memories don't drag their feet in dirt
Their steps can't be retraced
So we spin until we're sick
Longing for the loss of balance
A fall that carries us from heaven to our grave

You haunt me
You haunt me like an empty home
Priceless possession
I bring you with me wherever I go
Wander through me
Rearranging my insides in search of sleep
So well rested
You forget to bring me with you when you leave

Punish my body for the things my soul has seen
I've been staring into sunlight counting backwards
While the radiance blinds me
Flawed reflections will make themselves at home
Convincing us to walk barefoot through miles of broken mirrors

You haunt me
You haunt me like an empty home
Priceless possession
I bring you with me wherever I go
Wander through me
Rearranging my insides in search of sleep
So well rested
You forget to bring me with you when you leave

Hollow out my body
I know you need somewhere to sleep
Change the locks on doors I've left open inside of me
Hollow out my body
I'm not what you need
(Not what you need)
In spite of separation
We've been seduced by suffering

You haunt me
Like an empty home
You haunt me

Migrate as you may
Swallowing your spare key for safekeeping
Wander where you please
Inside of me
You haunt me
