The way your hair swings over your eyes
The motor in my head turns
Wanting you for such a long time
In my mind, a heart, a lesson to learn

Do do do
You'll never know I'm after you
Do do do
You'll never know

And you smell like
How angels oughta smell
And you look like
You're ready to go
So hold my hand
I'll take you everywhere
Anywhere you want to go

The way your words keep me in line
I know what I'm here for
Waking up to the grin of your eyes
It's something I'll get used to, oh

Do do do
You'll never know I'm after you
Do do do
You'll never know

And you smell like
How angels oughta smell
And you look like
You're ready to go
So hold my hand
I'll take you everywhere
Anywhere you want to go
So come on and hold my hand
(Hold my hand)
I'll take you everywhere
(Everywhere)
Anywhere
I'll take you anywhere
So let's go

The way your hair swings over your eyes
The way your words keep me in line
I'm telling you for the very last time
You better know

And you smell like
How angels oughta smell
And you look like
You're ready to go
So hold my hand
I'll take you everywhere
Anywhere you want to go
So come on and hold my hand
(Hold my hand)
I'll take you everywhere
(Everywhere)
Anywhere you wanna go

Do do do
Do do do
Do do do

So come on and hold my hand
(Hold my hand)
I'll take you everywhere
(Everywhere)
Anywhere you wanna go
So come on and hold my hand
(Hold my hand)
I'll take you everywhere
(Everywhere)
Anywhere you wanna go
