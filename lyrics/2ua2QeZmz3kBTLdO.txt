You don't fucking know me
You just know my fucking face
You don't fucking know me
Bitch you don't even know my name
(Sheesh)

I got diamonds below me
You don't even know me
But you my fucking homie, hey
You my fucking homie, hey

I got diamonds below me
You don't even know me
But you my fucking homie, hey
You my fucking homie, hey

I'm just trying to romanticize
I'm talking 10 PM watching Zoey 101 on Nick at Nite
I'm a Danger Boy, bring my switchblade to the fight
I'll bring the codeine if you bring the Sprite
I'll bring the codeine if you bring the Sprite
I think of you almost every night
You give me goosebumps like R.L. Stine
Let's take it slow and turn off the lights
I could watch a sunset forever with you

Danger Boys, we are many
Danger Boys, we are few

I got my lean
Girl, my diamonds, it's 2002

Danger Boys, we are many
Danger Boys, we are few

I got diamonds below me
You don't even know me
But you my fucking homie, hey
You my fucking homie, hey

I got diamonds below me
You don't even know me
But you my fucking homie, hey
You my fucking homie, hey

Niggas be running they mouth
Niggas go quiet soon as my switchblade is out
Let me show you what I mean
Danger Boys, we can be more than just killers and fiends
Wish you could see what I see
Diamonds for sale on the beach
I'm the man of your dreams
You will be so much more comfortable
Once you come out of them jeans
I'll max out on your booty cheeks
Don't come at me with that poopy breath

Smoking blunts on rooftops
We don't give a fuck about no cops
No dollars on my debit card
And if I O.D. in this bar
Bitches get off, they own me over my dead body
Don't do it for thotties
do it for diamonds

I got diamonds below me
You don't even know me
But you my fucking homie, hey
You my fucking homie, hey

I got diamonds below me
You don't even know me
But you my fucking homie, hey
You my fucking homie, hey
