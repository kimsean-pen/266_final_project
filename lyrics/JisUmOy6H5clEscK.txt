Standing here in front of the mirror
It's gonna be alright tonight
Feelin' hot, yeah, I'm on fire
I'm never ever goin' to tire

Tonight, it's gonna be alright
Chasing the night, it's gonna be alright
Chasing the night, chasing
Chasing the night, it's gonna be alright

Live my life as I choose, I paid my price
Paid my dues, you know I need no alibi
Daytime troubles fading, nights intoxicating
Gonna have it all tonight that ain't no lie

Tonight, it's gonna be alright
Chasing the night, it's gonna be alright
Chasing the night, chasing
Chasing the night, it's gonna be alright

Rock all night, sleep all day
It don't matter what they say
Ain't never gonna change my ways
And I won't be back till Monday

Feelin' exasperating, excitement generating
I'm never ever gonna tire, city is overloading
The circuits are exploding
Ain't comin' down, no, I'm too wired

Tonight, it's gonna be alright
Chasing the night, gonna be alright
Chasing the night, chasing
Chasing the night, it's gonna be alright
Chasing the night

Tonight, it's gonna be alright
Chasing the night, it's gonna be alright
Chasing the night, chasing
Chasing the night, it's gonna be alright

Tonight, it's gonna be alright
Chasing the night, it's gonna be alright
Chasing the night, chasing
Chasing the night, it's gonna be alright

Chasing the night, it's gonna be alright
Chasing the night, it's gonna be alright
Chasing the night, chasing
Chasing the night, it's gonna be alright

Chasing the night, it's gonna be alright
Chasing the night, it's gonna be alright
Chasing the night, chasing
