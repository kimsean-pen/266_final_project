Love of self I possess
Thru life to death
Yigga y'all listen
It's da upfront fresh
My level is seldom seen
Few and far between
Them fools they couldn't
Douse my keen
Lean to da mean
Thoroughbred
Pickyhead
Strapped in a bass trap down I get
Sunset to sunset
We don't sweat yet
Cool we don't fret
While the dubs dem hold me
I'm picky with precision
I made my decision
Now death itself
Can't hold this down
Coz the seeds of progress
Them done get sow
My tuff back
Broke the cane in four
Face flat to the floor
But I found the strength
To commence with a brand new
Sense of self
Eurozulu coming through
Tokyo train style hipper to da coup

Down like dirt man we dusted (get up)
Down like dirt man we dusted (get up)

Nuff of dem ah question my
Rebel-like flex
But I won't waste my breath
I let action speak
Although this feat stands
Taller than the peak of Everest
I visualise embrace
The progress
Chin high puffed chest
I step right to it
The choice is there is no choice
But to pursue it
Soul on the mind
Mind on the soul
My stuggle remain
But my insight grows

Down like dirt man we dusted (get up)
Down like dirt man we dusted (get up)
Down like dirt man we dusted (get up)
Down like dirt man we dusted (against the grain, we shall remain)

Yeah, steaming on

Gaining nuff girth
Gaining nuff ground
Movement tight planet wide flight
Inner sight set to step to the height
Left of the field now looking good
Wed to this wayward bounce
Proud to renounce
I'm steadfast
Stuck in my way
I heed not no hearsay
I put my trust in my own
Perceptions of knowledge and self.

Down like dirt man we dusted (get up)
Down like dirt man we dusted (get up)
Down like dirt man we dusted (get up)
Down like dirt man we dusted (get yourself into harder)
(get up)

The power of the inner eye huh
Met the strength of weed
Groove, world, birth to the next realm

Motions splendid, it bring quality
Now my foresight sees with nuff clarity
Motions splendid, it bring quality
Now my foresight sees with nuff clarity
