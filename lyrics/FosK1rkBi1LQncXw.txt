Don't try to fight
What's not your fault
Let go, reach out
The choice is yours to find

Inside you've got
The light to guide
Your fate decides
The roads you're going to find.

Relax, slow down
Let hope decide.
Even though it's hard to forget
When you can't afford love
Chasing all your thoughts you know that
You'll be all right in time.

Inside you've got
The light to guide
Your fate decides
The roads your going to find.

Inside you've got
The light to guide
Your fate decides
The roads you're going to find.
