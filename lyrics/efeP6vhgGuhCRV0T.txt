I was dreaming of a past
and my heart was beating fast
I began to lose control
I began to lose control
I didn't mean to hurt you
and I'm sorry I made you cry
I didn't want to hurt you, no I didnt
I'm just a jealous guy

I was feelin insecure
you might not want me anymore
I was shivering inside

I was shivering inside

I didn't mean to hurt you
and I'm sorry I made you cry
I didn't want to hurt you, no I didn't
I'm just a jealous guy
I'm just a jealous guy
I'm just a jealous guy, yes I am
I'm just a jealous guy, yeaaaa
I dont want nooo body lookin at you
cause im a jealous guy baby
