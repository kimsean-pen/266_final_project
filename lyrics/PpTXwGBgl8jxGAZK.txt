I want it all to bring things up.
I tried it all to gauge what's wrong with me.
The tired eyes that shielded us
Took all my weakness to extremes.

Nobody put your hands up to say you know.
The lead is galloping up, behind, so close.

Too much time to make things up
And analyze the motions carefully.
Till the waves are washing over.
I capsize and feel the drunken sea.

Nobody put your hands up to say you know.
The lead is galloping up, behind, so close.
Nobody put your hands up to say you know.
The lead is galloping up, behind, so close.

Nobody put your hands up to say you know.
The lead is galloping up, behind, so close.
Nobody put your hands up to say you know.
The lead is galloping up, behind, so close.
