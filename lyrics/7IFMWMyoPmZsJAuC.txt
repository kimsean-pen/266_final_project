I see you lookin, looking right at me
Even though youre eyes are turned away
Before you open up your mouth
I know the words your about to say

I may look nervous, not as nervous as you
You and I both know what we both wanna do

Let's not waste time, let's just do, what we both wanna do

I see you walkin, walkin down the street
Lookin like you don't know where to go
I can see it in your eyes that your minds out of control

I may look nervous, not as nervous as you
You and I both know what we both wanna do

Let's not waste time, let's just do, what we both wanna do
