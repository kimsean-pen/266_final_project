Youre settle your arms
Let em stays on that sit
Like a shadow of our love
That was so deep
But Im too tired baby ooh,
Im too tired baby ooh,
Go fly you your own let your
And distract all the others
But Im too tired baby ooh,
Im too tired baby ooh,
We start two bodies
We found a place to be free
And left all the religion, try to
But Im too tired baby ooh,
Im too tired baby ooh,
Im too tired baby ooh,
Im too tired baby ooh,
But Im too tired baby ooh,
Im too tired baby ooh,
