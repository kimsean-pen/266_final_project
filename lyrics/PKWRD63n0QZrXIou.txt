Chorus:
This land is your land, this land is my land
From California, well, to the New York Island
From the redwood forest, to the gulf stream waters
I tell you, This land was made for you and me

As I went walking down that ribbon of highway
I saw above me that endless skyway
Now I saw below me that golden valley
And I said: This land was made for you and me.

As I was walking, they try to stop me,
They put up a sign that said, it said "Private Property."
Well, on the back side, you know it said nothing!
So, it must be that side was made for you and me.

One bright sunny morning, well, in the shadow of a steeple;
Down by the relief office, I saw my people.
You know, they stood hungry; I stood wondering,
I was wondering if this land made was for you and me?

This land is your land, this land is my land
From Riverside, California, to the Staten Island
Well, oh, down to Modesto, Georgia, don't forget to say Philadelphia, oh
we moving on down to Mississippi, Houston, Texas, ah LA,
you know, This land is your land, this land is my land.
This land is your land
You've got to believe, This my land
This land was made for you and me
