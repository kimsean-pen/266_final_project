The stones that gather left forever damned
The absence of what was and what one can't understand
The undertow that drags as you lose another day
The voice that brought you peace has nothing left to say

The ashes that fall one more time
Mourn the past and all that once shined

As hope begins to falter in this void where you reside
The spiral into nothing where you confide

The ashes that fall one more time
Mourn the past and all that once shined

I keep my silence
Don't need to approve
If I walk away
It's what I choose
Oh yeah!

The ashes that fall one more time
Mourn the past and all that once shined
