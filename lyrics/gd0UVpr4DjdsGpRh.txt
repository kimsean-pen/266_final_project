I think that I would like
To invite everyone I've known
Dead and alive
To a street where we can be
Finally free

Well, they would come in droves
Wearing their hearts on their sleeves, oh no
How good it felt to have them worn
Just like they should

And everybody here wants to know
Did everybody say what a good day that it was
For everybody here who said what a good day it was?

Did they smile 'cause they like it,
Did they smile 'cause they like it,
Did they? Whoa.

Suddenly, we all got young
Running circles around ourselves
Just for fun
And oh, how good it felt
To be young and loved
And feel it in our bones

And everybody here wants to know
Did everybody say what a good day that it was
For everybody here who said what a good day it was?

Did they smile 'cause they like it,
Did they smile 'cause they like it,
Did they? Whoa. (2x)

We go there when we're in trouble
We got old and old age made us humble
You and I are alone

That it felt like this, we were never told
That it felt like this we were never told
And it scares us bad so we'll have to be bold
But there's still one thing that we need to know.

Did everybody say what a good day that it was
For everybody here who said what a good day it was?

Did they smile 'cause they like it,
Did they smile 'cause they like it,
Did they? Whoa.
