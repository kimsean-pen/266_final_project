We are in exile
You know
We were wrecking our lives
You know
We were hostile
And we fought to the dead

Don't be afraid to miss me
Don't be afraid to miss me
Don't be afraid to miss me

I am in exile
I know
I am wrecking your life
I was hostile
And we fought to the dead

Don't be afraid to miss me
Don't be afraid to miss me
Don't be afraid to miss me
Don't be afraid to hate me

Don't be afraid to miss me
Don't be afraid to miss me
