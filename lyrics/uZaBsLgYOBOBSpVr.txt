Got a new woman
Found her in an old bar
Got me a woman, baby
And took her back to my car

There she goes in the morning
There she goes in the morning sun
There she goes in the evening
There she goes when the day is, day is done

Got another woman
I found her on my new phone
Really should see her photos
Too bad they weren't her own

There she goes in the morning
There she goes in the morning sun
There she goes in the evening
There she goes when the day is, day is done

Got a new woman
Found her in a trash can
Think this is the woman, baby, I really do
Better tell my hand

There she goes in the morning
There she goes in the morning sun
There she goes in the evening
There she goes when the day is, day is done
