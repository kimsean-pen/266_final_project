Oh oh, how you are my hero?
Oh oh, how you're never here though?
Remember times when you put me on your shoulders
How I wish it was forever you would hold us

Oh oh, right now I'm too young to know
How in the future it will affect me when you go
Oh oh, you could have had it all
You and me and mum you know, anything was possible

I won't be the lonely one sitting on my own and sad
A fifty year old reminiscing what I had
I won't be the lonely one sitting on my own and sad
Forget your dad, he's gone, forget your dad, he's gone

He's gone, he's gone
He's gone, he's gone, ohh

All I wanted was a kick about in the park
For you to race me home when it was nearly getting dark
How I could've been yours, and you be mine
It could've been me and you until the end of time

Oh oh, do what you want, when you want
Be as fuckin' insincere as you can
What kind of way is that to treat your wife
To see your son on Saturdays, what way is that to live your life?

I won't be the lonely one sitting on my own and sad
A fifty year old reminiscing what I had
I won't be the lonely one sitting on my own and sad
Forget your dad, he's gone, forget your dad, he's gone

He's gone, he's gone
He's gone, he's gone, ohh
He's gone, he's gone
He's gone, he's gone, ohh

I won't be the lonely one sitting on my own and sad
A fifty year old reminiscing what I had
I won't be the lonely one sitting on my own and sad
Forget your dad, he's gone, forget your dad, he's gone

He's gone, he's gone
He's gone, he's gone, ohh
He's gone, he's gone
He's gone, he's gone, ohh

He's gone, he's gone
He's gone, he's gone, ohh
He's gone, he's gone
He's gone, he's gone, ohh

Oh, he's gone, he's gone
He's gone, he's gone
He's gone, he's gone
He's gone, he's gone, ohh
