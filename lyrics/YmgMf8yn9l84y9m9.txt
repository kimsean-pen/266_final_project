I hear all about what you can do
But I've got to know, is it true?
You're telling me to trust, what should I believe?
You promised so much but talk is cheap

You told me that you're serious
But I got to know for sure
You say how much you want me
But I've heard it all before

Prove your love, got to prove your love
If you want to be with me tonight
Show your stuff, 'cause words are not enough
I wanna hear your body talk to mine

Boy, I can feel a love is on the rise
A message revealed in your eyes
You know, I can't wait to know your passion
It's not to late, so take some action

Can you say that when you're through
I'll know, what love is all about?
Well, baby, I've been patient, now
I'm ready to find out

Prove your love, got to prove your love
If you want to be with me tonight
Show your stuff, 'cause words are not enough
I wanna hear your body talk to mine

You can tell me that you're serious
But I got to know for sure
You say that you want me
But I've heard it all before

Prove your love, got to prove your love
If you want to be with me tonight
Show your stuff, 'cause words are not enough
I wanna hear your body

Prove your love, got to prove your love
If you want to be with me tonight
Show your stuff, 'cause words are not enough
I wanna hear your body talk to mine

Prove your love, got to prove your love
If you want to be with me tonight
Show your stuff, 'cause words are not enough
I wanna hear your body

Prove your love, got to prove your love
If you want to be with me tonight
Show your stuff, 'cause words are not enough
I wanna hear your body
