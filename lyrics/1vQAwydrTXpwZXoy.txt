Quarters clinkin in my altoids tin
Feeling wild . . . gonna break this five . . .
But they don't got them dank doritos
Or them jalapeño cheetos

Bodega run oo-oo-ooh
Do ya wanna share a yoo-hoo?
lil debbie's giving me the eye down that aisle,
But pass me a bag o the hot fries, baby

This band is boring me
Let's cross the street
To where they got them dank doritos
And them jalapeño cheeto-oo-ooos

Bodega run oo-oo-ooh
Do ya wanna share a yoo-hoo?
lil debbie's giving me the eye down that aisle,
But pass me a bag o the hot fries, baby
