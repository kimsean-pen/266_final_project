I've never thought I would put my freedom
In your hands, in your tiny hands
I've never thought I would give you my freedom
Till you came into the world
And our love is stronger than a flood
Bigger than a mountain
Deeper than the darkest sea
And our love is stronger than a flood
Bigger than a mountain
Deeper than the darkest sea
Your soul is like a pure light
Guide me in the darkness
With you I am not afraid of the surprises
Or what the future will bring for me
Or what the future will bring for me
Achoro m ka i nwe obi uto
Achoro m ka i nwe obi uto
Achoro m ka i nwe obi uto
(I want you to be happy)
Cause, our love is stronger than a flood
Bigger than a mountain
Deeper than the darkest sea
And our love is stronger than a flood
Bigger than a mountain
Deeper than the darkest sea
And our love is stronger than a flood
Bigger than a mountain
Deeper than the darkest sea
And our love is stronger than a flood
Bigger than a mountain
Deeper than the darkest sea
And our love is stronger than a flood
Bigger than a mountain
Deeper than the darkest sea
And our love is stronger than a flood
Bigger than a mountain
Deeper than the darkest sea
And our love is stronger than a flood
Bigger than a mountain
Deeper than the darkest sea
And our love is stronger than a flood
Bigger than a mountain
Deeper than the darkest sea
