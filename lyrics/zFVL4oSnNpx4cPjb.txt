I don't get enough sleep
Paranoid being
I heard the rain but I thought I heard keys
I couldn't see if there was cameras on me
I'm afraid to make contact
I'm afraid to make contact, woah
What's a month when the whole year is bad?
Had a bad couple nights, but I'm back
Yeah I'm back to the secrets we kept
I kind of like how the cat's in the bag
And I like how she acts like a cat
And I know that it's not what I want
What I want is her love to myself
What I want is for her to react
I'm going back to bed
I'm going back to the water
I feel more pain than I mention
Saw light shine through on the altar (Come on, come on)
See through
Do more for you than I need to
I feel like you wear a mask when I meet you
Shadows in the yard, what do we do?

Another mess last week
Chaos in me
If this is love why is it hard for me to breathe
Don't want no one to have advantage over me
I want you totally
Symbiotic being
Saw you in soft light looking at me
Felt you in past tense leaning on me
I feel a crisis looming over me
I'm afraid to make contact
'Cause your tone might change
Might forget my name
I'm afraid to make contact, woah

I'm afraid to make contact
I'm afraid to make contact, woah
