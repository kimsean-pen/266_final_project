This is all or nothing
It's now or never, go on take your shot
This is all or nothing
No looking back, this is all we've got
This is all or nothing
Can you keep up? Tell me can you keep up? (Keep up)
This is all or nothing
Nah-nah you won't get me, nah-nah I don't think so

Today's the day
I'm gonna top what I've done by giving more than I have before
Gonna leave my mark in the world
Shut out the demons and strike a chord
For the ones who can't speak
For the ones who are too scared to dream
For the ones who feed the disease
You better run 'cause it all ends here shutting down the fear

So you better bring it, yeah
So you better bring it
Break it down

This is all or nothing
It's now or never, go on take your shot
This is all or nothing
No looking back, this is all we've got
This is all or nothing
Can you keep up? Tell me can you keep up? (Keep up)
This is all or nothing
Nah-nah you won't get me, nah-nah I don't think so

You say you want it, do you know what it takes?
You got the drive, you should show it and say less
Yeah, there's more to life than just living in pleasure
But are you clutch when under the pressure?
You say you want it?
Well, are you ready to risk everything with the chance of defeat? Nah

So you better bring it, yeah
So you better bring it
Let's go

This is all or nothing
It's now or never, go on take your shot
This is all or nothing
No looking back, this is all we've got
This is all or nothing
Can you keep up? Tell me can you keep up? (Keep up)
This is all or nothing
Nah-nah you won't get me, nah-nah I don't think so

Nah-nah, I don't think so

For the ones who can't speak
For the ones who are too scared to dream
For the ones who feed the disease
You better run 'cause it all ends here shutting down the fear

Run
'Cause it all ends here shutting down the fear
Run
I said run
Yeah
'Cause it all ends here shutting down the fear

This is all or nothing
It's now or never, go on take your shot
This is all or nothing
No looking back, this is all we've got
This is all or nothing
Can you keep up? Tell me can you keep up? (Keep up)
This is all or nothing
Nah-nah you won't get me, nah-nah I don't think so
