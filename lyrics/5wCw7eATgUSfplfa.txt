Down, baby gonna drag me down
Down to the ground
I don't want you
Drag me down, baby gonna drag
Me down to the underground
Why don't you?

Down, baby drag, drag me down
Won't make a sound
I want you to
Drag down, baby drag, drag me down
I'll carry your crown
If I can go to

You're so beautiful
You're so beautiful
Are you ready for your fall?
Where we disintegrate in love

Down, baby let's drag it down
Down to the ground
I'm with you
You can only be safe and sound
When I'm around
I got you (I got you)

Down, baby, we're going down
Won't make a sound
It is all you (It's all you)
Drag us down, baby drag, drag it down
Lay it on the ground
How could you? (How could you?)

You're so beautiful
You're so beautiful
Ready for the fall?
Where we disintegrate in love

You're so beautiful
You're so beautiful
Are you ready for the fall?
Where we disintegrate

You're so beautiful
You're so beautiful
Are you ready for your fall?
Where we disintegrate in love

You're so beautiful
You're so beautiful
Are you ready for the fall?
Where we disintegrate
