Don't let my feet run over you
I know you know it's the blame about it
So don't let my feet run over you
I know you know

Beat the need

Defeat the need
Bloom to sonic fade

Don't let my feet run over you
I know you know it's the blame about it
So don't let my feet run over you
I know you know

Beat the need

See left you me
Feel the morning air

Don't let my feet run over you
Don't let my feet run over you

Beat silent need
Feel the morning air
See left you me
Bloom to sonic fade
