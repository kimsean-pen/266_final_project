Don't you remember the nights in December
The booze and the mates and the fenders
Of the band you thought was sick
Don't you remember the way that girl looked at you
While you held her hair while she puked in the loo
And still kissed her anyway

So tell me one more time
That I've been trashing your bedtime
I hear you knock, knock, knock
On the door and you let me know
Pipe down, it'll have to go

Baby don't tell me you're too old
To have a little bit of fun sometimes
Slow down and dance awhile
Mister 10 PM bedtime
Baby don't tell me you don't get why
I need my friends and a bottle and a guy
Forget the day, I love the night
Mister 10 PM bedtime

Don't you remember the lines and the beer cans
The shouts and the screams and the naughty hands
In your mates bedroom
Don't you remember not washing for a week or a two
The neighbors have said they hated you
Cause newsflash, that's you

Don't tell me one more time
How I've been trashing your bedtime
I hear you knock, knock, knock
On the door and you let me know
Pipe down, it'll have to go

Baby don't tell me you're too old
To have a little bit of fun sometimes
Slow down and dance awhile
Mister 10 PM bedtime
Baby don't tell me you don't get why
I need my friends and a bottle and a guy
Forget the day, I love the night
Mister 10 PM bedtime

It's bedtime on your floor
Turn off the lights but your eyes want more
Not bedtime on our floor
We making noise and your mind wanders
Do you think you're a bore, we're a chore
Do you never miss passing out on your floor?
Mister, do you wanna talk?
Something tells me you don't want this anymore

So tell me one more time
That I've been trashing your bedtime
I hear you knock, knock, knock
On the door and you let me know
Pipe down, it'll have to go

Baby don't tell me you're too old
To have a little bit of fun sometimes
Slow down and dance awhile
Mister 10 PM bedtime
Baby don't tell me you don't get why
I need my friends and a bottle and a guy
Forget the day, I love the night
Mister 10 PM bedtime
Mister 10 PM bedtime
Mister 10 PM bedtime
Mister 10 PM bedtime
Mister 10 PM bedtime
