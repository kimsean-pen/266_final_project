Was in my teeth and my tongue lifted
Glue shot your lips, let us take a rest
On my mouth is a factory for every toxic part of speech I spew

Why learn to lose, been afraid to ask
Caught my reflection in some see watch glass
Oh, my face is enable to convey how very awful we '

Laugh out of habit, apple I'm scared of it
I smoked my senses, it made me sentimental
I see me and you in the tiger tank
Signaling my ' I've been totally charged
Spilled some bottles out this old bomb

Lights can be so the empty love
Spin out the sweet stuff of street wise smile
Oh, my guy deserves the fiercest blows
You never thought you'd have to throw

Laugh out of habit, apple I'm scared of it
My psyche, my senses make me so '
I see me and you in the tiger tank
Signaling as they are to look down at us
Limb for every limb to look up
Limb for every limb to earn

Don't even care if they take my legs
I've limped before, I can limp again
No more limp is not able to despise
How very awful what I'm doing
