I can't remember why I left my hometown
And why I moved to this city, that got me stranded by the tide
I wonder who I was those days, who I'm going to be
But to secure peace is still the best way to prepare for war

This world made me an alcoholic
This world makes me wanna die in my sleep
This world made me a junkie, dyed-in-the-wool
This world made me a razoreater, a homeless fool...

No Man is an Island, entire of itself
Every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main
I am involved in mankind, and so are you
Cause we are both part of this vast and moribund clutter
And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls
Cause it tolls for you and me... ...it tolls for you and me...

I didn't believe you, as you once compared love to flames
But I guess you were right, cause both leave nothing but ashes
For me, love was never tied to conditions
In the end I loved you... ...but I chose darkness...

I chose darkness...

My dear I lost you, as this city lost me
We lost our shelter, we even lost the sea
Day after day keeps elapsing, some day we'll call it years
I'm on my own now... ...but every stranger looks like you...

The traces we leave are vague, but they still catch sight
Sadly, I'm still lost in this city where I shouldn't be at all
It's hard to wake up from a nightmare, when your're not even asleep
But this world breaks everyone, and afterwards some are strong at the broken places...
