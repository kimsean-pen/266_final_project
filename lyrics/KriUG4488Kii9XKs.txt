Take a step inside my mind
As my eyes are open wide
In my sleep I turn and toss
To rebuild the heart I lost

You can tell me what you want
Fooled me once and love was lost
Paper thin your words they haunt my dreams the seams have come undone.

Don't you dare say I'm gonna make it
Cause I don't believe a word you say

Don't you dare say I'm gonna make it
Cause I don't believe a word you say
There's a sickness living inside me
You can spare me all your sympathy

Take a second of your time
Realize you're wasting mine
In the night I lie awake
Why rebuild a heart that breaks

You can tell me what you want
Fooled me once and love was lost
Paper thin your words they haunt my dreams the seams have come undone

Don't you dare say I'm gonna make it
Cause I don't believe a word you say
There's a sickness living inside me
You can spare me all your sympathy

So spare me all your sympathy

I'm sitting, waiting on the sun to rise
I know it never will

It comes as no surprise
So won't you stare into my hollow
eyes
They look so hungry now
It comes as no surprise
Don't you dare say I'm gonna make it
Cause I don't believe a word you say
There's a sickness living inside me
You can spare me all your sympathy
So spare me all your sympathy
