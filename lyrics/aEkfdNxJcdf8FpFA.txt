Stubborn Jabos rip the sky
on wings of inferno into chaos
Burnt offering - killing ground
drowning in blood over and over again
See naval fire rain down
living and dead unite in a stream of anguish

A dance in the sands
of Juno and Sword
a waltz in the flames
of June 44

Hunkered down in fertile Normandy plains
blending seamlessly into the terrain
Swift death in the hedges - Panthers reign
sweeping forward over scorched domains

Unending rosebeds of death
half-timbered graveyards as far as hell can see
Bouqet of hopeless faces
awaiting sudden death in a sea of flames
Falling grace - the saints are down
bleeding profound from the wounds of the afterlife

A dance in the sands
of Juno and Sword
a waltz in the flames
of June 44

A twirl in the shame
of a brethren war
a waltz in the flames
of June 44
