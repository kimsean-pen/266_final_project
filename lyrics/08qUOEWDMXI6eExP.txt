Baby
Are you holding the key
Was it you that put a lock on my door
Who sent you
Are you as deep as the sea
Well it takes a deep womb
To shelter me

I can hold you, girl
And watch your heart settle down
Feels like home
But I'm lost somehow

God made you beautiful
I made you cry

So listen, babe
The sun's going down
You know what I mean
There ain't much time

Cause we're the wild seed, girl
And this land's being farmed
You know a farmer takes great pride
In what he leaves behind

God made you beautiful
I made you cry
