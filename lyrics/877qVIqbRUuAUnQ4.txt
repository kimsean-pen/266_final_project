I want to draw you a floorplan
Of my head and heart
I want to give directions, helpful hints.

What you'll be looking for
What you'll be looking for

I know I'll hold this loss in my heart forever
I know I'll hold, I'll hold
I know I'll hold this loss in my heart forever
I know I'll hold, I'll hold

All eyes are on me now
All eyes are on me now

I want your lungs to stop working without me
I think about writing you
I thought about calling you
What was I looking for
What am I looking for

I know I'll hold this pain in my heart forever
I know I'll hold, I'll hold
I know I'll hold this pain in my heart forever
I know I'll hold, I'll hold

All eyes are on you now
All eyes are on you now

I shouldn't go
But I can't really help it
When I feel this pressure
I shouldn't go
But I can't really help it
When I feel this pressure

All eyes are on me now
All eyes are on me now
All eyes are on me now
All eyes are on me now
All eyes are on me now

I shouldn't go
But I can't really help it
When I feel this pressure
I shouldn't go
But I can't really help it
When I feel this pressure

I shouldn't go when I feel this building
I shouldn't go when I feel this building
I shouldn't go but I can't really help it
When I feel this pressure
