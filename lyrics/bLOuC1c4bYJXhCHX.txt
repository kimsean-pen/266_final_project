I try but I can't seem to get myself
To think of anything but you
Your breath on my face
Your warm gentle kiss, I taste the truth
I taste the truth

You know what I came here for

So I won't ask for more

I wanna be with you
If only for a night
To be the one who's in your arms
Who holds you tight
I wanna be with you
There's nothing more to say

There's nothing else I want more than to feel this way
I wanna be with you

So I'll hold you tonight
Like I would if you were mine
To hold forever more
And I'll savor each touch that I wanted

So much to be here before (To feel before)

How beautiful it is
Just to be like this

I wanna be with you
If only for a night
To be the one who's in your arms
Who holds you tight

I wanna be with you
There's nothing more to say
There's nothing else I want more than to feel this way
I wanna be with you
Oh baby
I can't fight this feeling anymore
It drives me crazy when I try to
So call my name
Take my hand
And make my wish
Baby, your command
Yeah
I wanna be with you
There's nothing more to say
There's nothing else I want more than to feel this way
(I wanna be) I wanna be with you (I wanna be with you)
I wanna be with you
Wanna be with you (Yeah)
(I wanna be with you) I wanna be
I wanna be with you
(I wanna be)
(I wanna be)
(I wanna be with you) Yeah
(I wanna be with you)
I wanna be, I wanna be baby
I wanna be
(I wanna be with you)
I wanna be with you, yeah
I wanna be with you
