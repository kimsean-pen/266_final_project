I've got a secret for the mad
In a little bit of time it won't hurt so bad
And I get that I don't get it
But you will burn right now but then you won't regret it

You're not gonna believe a word I say
What's the point in just drowning another day?
And I get that I don't get it
But the world will show you that you won't regret it

Little things, all the stereotypes
They're gonna help you get through this one night
And there will be a day
When you can say you're okay
And mean it

I promise you
It'll all make sense again
I promise you
It'll all make sense again

There's nothing to do right now but try
There are a hundred people who will listen to you cry
And I get that they don't get it
But they love you so much that you won't regret it

You're at the bottom, this is it
Just get through, you will be fixed
And you think that I don't get it
But I burned my way through and I don't regret it

Little things, all the stereotypes
They're gonna help you get through this one night
And there will be a day
When you can say you're okay
And mean it

I promise you
It'll all make sense again
I promise you
It'll all make sense again
I promise you
It'll all make sense again
I promise you
It'll all make sense again
