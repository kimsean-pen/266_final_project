We used to listen on vinyl
behing a hand rolled cigarette
Mess around in the blue room
to that song that i can't forget
I would wear your old dress shirt with nothing underneath
Remember when you ruined dinner tryna sneek a peek at me
I know it all got so final
but it still makes me smile
We used to listen on vinyl

Gambino in the car
Frank Ocean on the stereo
Bubl√© under the stars
Tori Kelly with a melody
James Blake with a mellow beat

We would listen on vinyl
behind a hand rolled cigarette
Mess around in the blue room
to that song that i can't forget
I would wear your old dress shirt with
nothing underneath
Remember when you ruined dinner tryna sneek a peek at me
I know it all got so final
but it still makes me smile
We used to listen on vinyl

and show you the song I wrote about that night before the bar
Ed Sheeran with a melody
James Blake with a melow beat
We would

We would listen on vinyl
behind a hand rolled cigarette
Mess around in the blue room
to that song that i can't forget
I would wear your old dress shirt with
nothing underneath
And then you'd ruin dinner tryna to sneak a peek at me
And then it all got so final
but it still makes me smile
