Don't look back, a new day is breakin'
It's been too long since I felt this way
I don't mind where I get taken
The road is callin', today is the day
I can see, it took so long just to realise
I'm much too strong not to compromise
Now I see what I am is holding me down
I'll turn it around
I finally see the dawn arrivin'
I see beyond the road I'm drivin'
It's a bright horizon and I'm awaken
I see myself in a brand new way
The sun is shinin', the clouds are breakin'
'Cause I can't lose now, there's no game to play
I can tell there's no more time left to criticise
I've seen what I could not recognise
Everything in my life was leading me on
But I can be strong yes I could
I finally see the dawn arrivin'
I see beyond the road I'm drivin'
Don't look back, a new day is breakin'
It's been so long since I felt this way
I don't mind where I get taken
The road is callin', today is the day
I can see, it took so long just to realise
I'm much too strong not to compromise
Now I see what I am is holding me down
I'll turn it around
I finally see the dawn arrivin'
I see beyond the road I'm drivin'
Don't look back
Don't look back
Don't look back
Don't look back
