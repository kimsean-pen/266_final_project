Leaving me, I'm sad and blue
Left with nothing but a picture
Third or fourth weekend in June, December seems to come to soon.

Will you wait until tomorrow? Will you wait until...

Head is swirling with the scene of you and him embraced in rapture.
Dirty, trying to come clean, but every thought I have obscene.

Will you wait until tomorrow? Will you wait until...

Quilted on my hands.? think of me all dug and cutie?
Struck another shot up to 24 hours in tune

Will you wait until tomorrow? Will you wait tomorrow?
Will you wait until tomorrow? Will you wait tomorrow?
