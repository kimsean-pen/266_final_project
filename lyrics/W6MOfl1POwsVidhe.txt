It's been like this from the start
One piece after another to make my heart

You mistake the game for being smart
Stand here, sell this to hit your mark
But the sound of the steel and the crush and the grind

It all screams who am I to decide my life
But in time it all dies
There's nothin' left inside

Just rust and metal that was never even mine
I would scream, but I'm just this hollow shell
Waiting here, begging please

Set me free so I can feel
Stop trying to live my life for me
I need to breathe, I'm not your robot

Stop telling me I'm part of the big machine
I'm breaking free, can't you see?
I can love, I can speak

Without somebody else operating me
You gave me eyes and now I see
I'm not your robot, I'm just me

All this time I've been mislead
There was nothing but crosswires in my head
I've been taught to think that what I feel

Doesn't matter at all till you say it's real
I would scream, but I'm just this hollow shell
Waiting here, begging please

Set me free so I can feel
Stop trying to live my life for me
I need to breathe, I'm not your robot

Stop telling me I'm part of the big machine
I'm breakin' free, can't you see?
I can love, I can speak

Without somebody else operating me
You gave me eyes and now I see
I'm not your robot, I'm just me
I'm not your robot, I'm just me

I'm not your robot
I would scream, but I'm just this hollow shell
Waiting here, begging please
Set me free so I can feel
Stop trying to live my life for me
I need to breathe, I'm not your robot
Stop telling me I'm part of the big machine
I'm breakin' free, can't you see?
I can love, I can speak
Without somebody else operating me
You gave me eyes and now I see
I'm not your robot, I'm just me
I'm not your robot
I'm Just me
