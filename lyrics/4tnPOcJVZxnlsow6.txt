Tell me what you'd do
If I would do it like you
Do it all for you
Do it all for you
Tell me what you'd do
If I would do it like you

Do it all for you
Do it all for you
Do it all for you
Do it all for you
Do it all for you
Do it all for you

Something inside controlling
Takes me high enough, my mind keeps falling
Like running morphine, it's wonderful going blind
Love keeps crawling
Are we losing time?

I'm trying to get control of this love
(But I'm losing all, losing all)
I'm trying to get control of this love
(But I'm losing, losing)
I'm trying to get control of this love
(But I'm losing all, losing all)
I'm trying to get control of this love
(But I'm losing, losing)

Riding just for the high now
Making you forget this time was wrong
No vision- no controlling
Most wonderful minds are blind
This love desire it cannot read my mind

I'm trying to get control of this love
(But I'm losing all, losing all)
I'm trying to get control of this love
(But I'm losing, losing)
I'm trying to get control of this love
(But I'm losing all, losing all)
I'm trying to get control of this love
(I'm losing, I'm losing, I'm losing, I'm losing)

Tell me what you'd do
If I would do it like you
Do it all for you
Do it all for you
Tell me what you'd do
If I would do it like you
Do it all for you
Do it all for you

Love control
Love control
Love control
Love control

I'm trying to get control of this love
(But I'm losing all, losing all)
I'm trying to get control of this love
(But I'm losing, losing)
I'm trying to get control of this love
(But I'm losing all, losing all)
I'm trying to get control of this love
