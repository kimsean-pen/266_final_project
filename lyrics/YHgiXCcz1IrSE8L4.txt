The mystery of death before us
Soon every night can bring the light, and close my eyes
Sometimes life in here is too limited
Sometimes we don't care at all, sometimes

Time will change the familiar face
Brightest colors fade to gray
The fear is real, one winter's day brings the clarity

I feel the time is catching up with us
How many days until it's hunger is satisfied?
Leaving the final golden days
We are the last amazing grays
Hoping the young will lead the pack now

I can feel my heart is beating, still
I can see you with my eyes, I still see
But I can't run the way my children can
Can't accept the helping hand, leave me

You are the strong one, trust in me
You must lead instead of me, now
There's no time, don't hesitate
Or you will also find your fate

I feel the time is catching up with us
How many days until it's hunger is satisfied?
Leaving the final golden days
We are the last amazing grays
Hoping the young will lead the pack now

In the eyes of every newborn, I see the future
Life is just a phase
I close my eyes and see them all here beside me
The last amazing grays

In the eyes of every newborn, I see the past times
A familiar face
I close my eyes and see them, waiting for me
Amongst the amazing grays

Mountain seems to befall this last time, marking the moment
I have found my place
I closed my eyes and joined them, guarding the young
Amongst the amazing grays
