I think cancers gonna kill me
'Cause I got a real bad sunburn when I was 13
Couldn't sit in a classroom chair for at least a week
Maybe I shouldn't have fallen asleep
In that hot, hot sun without a little bit of sunscreen
Don't let this reflect too badly on my character

I think a car is gonna kill me 'cause I
ride my bike consistently throughout the city
And we all know, it's only so long before you get hit
But on that idea, I'm getting more used to it

I don't care to think about it twice
Maybe I should just be a little more kind
Is it fear or awareness that keeps me alive?
Maybe I should just be a little more kind

I think a plague is gonna kill me 'cause my
body cannot fight off all the bugs that are in me
We all know I'm pretty good at getting sick
Maybe I'll continue to age and the
reaper keeps a distance until I am old one day
But I'm not sure that I'd honestly prefer that
It's not a matter-of-fact, but rather something to look at

I don't care to think about it twice
Maybe I should just be a little more kind
Is it fear or awareness that keeps me alive?
Maybe I should just be a little more kind
