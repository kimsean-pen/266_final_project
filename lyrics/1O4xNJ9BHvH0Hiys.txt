Here in this diary I write you visions of my summer
It was the best I ever had
There were es and sing alongs
And that unspoken feeling
Of knowing that right now is all that matters

All the nights we stayed up talking
Listening to 80's songs
And quoting lines from all those movies that we love
It still brings a smile to my face

I guess when it comes down to it
Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up
These are the best days of our lives
The only thing that matters is just following your heart
And eventually you'll finally get it right

Breaking into hotel swimming pools
And wreaking havoc on our world
Hanging out at truck stops just to pass the time
The blacktop singing me to sleep
Lighting fireworks in parking lots

Illuminate the blackest nights
Cherry cokes under this moonlit summer sky
2015 Riverside, it's time to say goodbye
Get on the bus, it's time to go

Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up

These are the best days of our lives
The only thing that matters is just following your heart
And eventually you'll finally get it right
(Get it right)

(Get it right)

Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up
These are the best days of our lives
The only thing that matters is just following your heart
And eventually you'll finally get it right

Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up
These are the best days of our lives
The only thing that matters is just following your heart
And eventually you'll finally get it right
