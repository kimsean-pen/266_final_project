Sunlight angles on
Wooden floor at dawn
Ceiling fan is on
Chopping up our dreams

What is left of them
Take to sleep again
Where I dare pretend
I'm more than I seem

Tears give trigger
Yours remind me
Of the ice melting in my glass

Finally full again
So I listen for
Your lips to break apart
Into words

It definitely starts
To spoil my heart
Well somewhere there's war
Well sometimes there's art

It definitely starts
To spoil my heart
Somewhere there's war
Sometimes there's art

When you work it up
I'm gonna shake it off
I'm gonna shake it off
I'm gonna shake it off
Shake it off
Shake it off
Shake it off
Shake it off

Hotels hold me
Thoughts arousing
So many hearts
Meeting in one place

Like a giant
Beast with many souls
Now just a body
Full of holes

When you work it up
I'm gonna shake it off
I'm gonna shake it off
I'm gonna shake it off
When you work it up
I'm gonna shake it off
I'm gonna shake it off
I'm gonna shake it off
Gonna shake it off
Shake it off
Shake it off
Shake it off
