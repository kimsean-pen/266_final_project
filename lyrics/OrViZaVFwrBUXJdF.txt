I'll take care of you
Have faith that when you call my name
I'll be there

It was a straight-faced lie I believed
It was a straight-faced lie
You would ever leave me
So for now I'll keep believing your words
And soon enough my strength will return

I'll take care of you
Have faith that when you call my name
I'll be there
I'll be right there

So keep breathing
Keep that sweet heart of yours beating
I'll be right there
I'll be right there

Let me draw the blinds for you
You can watch the sunset from the bed
In your hospital room
Until you're sleeping
And I'm sure I don't understand
How I found a love so pure

I'll take care of you
Have faith that when you call on me
I'll be there
I'll be right there

So keep breathing
Keep that sweet heart of yours beating
I'll be right there
I'll be right there

Don't lift a finger let me show you
The only way to let this go
Don't lift a finger, let me hold you
Hold you here until the pain has all gone

I'll take care of you
Have faith that when you call my name
I'll be there
I'll be right there

So keep breathing
Keep that sweet heart of yours beating
I'll be right there
I'll be right there

I'll take care of you
Have faith that when you call my name
I'll be there
I'll be right there

So keep breathing
Keep that sweet heart of yours beating
I'll be right there
I'll be right there
I'll be right there
I'll be right there
