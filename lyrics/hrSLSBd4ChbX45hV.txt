Sweat, tears under every pole
Let out on the marble floor
I been knocked out, crawling from the dust
Roughed up but I love the rust
See more than the city piece [?]
Church [?] when I kiss my teeth
Kicked out, yeah, they pushed me down
But my life vest left me out to drown

I can't reclaim it, I came for blood
I wanna take it, but weight is not enough
I need a [?], light it up on fire

I didn't come this far to only go this far
I didn't come this far to only go this far
I didn't come this far to only go this far
I didn't, I didn't, I didn't come this far, no

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, come this far
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, come this far

Knee deep in a muddy trench
The players had to stay behind their picket fence
Had I face painted all black and blue, yeah
You're gonna come at me, I'm gonna come at you

I can't reclaim it, I came for blood
I wanna take it, but weight is not enough
I need a [?], light it up on fire

I didn't come this far to only go this far
I didn't come this far to only go this far
I didn't come this far to only go this far
I didn't, I didn't, I didn't come this far, no

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, come this far
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, come this far

Uh, uh, I didn't, uh, uh, I didn't
Uh, uh, I didn't come this far

I didn't come this far to only go this far
I didn't come this far to only go this far
I didn't come this far to only go this far
I didn't, I didn't, I didn't come this far, no

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I didn't come this far
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, oh, oh
