We both went out on a saturday night
He said "What's up?" I told him "I'm alright"
They want him off but still there he ran me down
Broke his heart and that's when they shut it

How can you love her
Can you love her
Can you love her
She's got no heart
Got no heart
Got no heart

How can you love her
Can you love her
Can you love her
She's got no heart
Got no heart

Asked for a drink, I said "What, you fancy?"
Went back to his as though he had meant it
Went from behind and that's when I chanted

(Beat depression, love, obsession)
(Beat depression, love, obsession)

(Oh!) All his friends about me in his bed
I cried and cried and that's when they chanted

How can you love her
Can you love her
Can you love her
She's got no heart
Got no heart
Got no heart

How can you love her
Can you love her
Can you love her
She's got no heart
Got no heart
Got no heart

But he sleeps at nights
I think you should
Find new feelings
Cause you don't love me at all!
Take him don't do your side (?)

Regret!
Just cause it feels good
And just because you can, don't mean that you should

No regret!
Just cause it feels good
And just because you can, don't mean that you should

No regret!
Just cause it feels good
And just because you can, don't mean that you should

No regret!
Just cause it feels good
And just because you can, don't mean that you should!

Now can't you beat depression, love, obsession!
Beat depression, love, obsession!
Beat depression, love, obsession!
Beat depression, love, obsession!

How can you love them
Can you love them
Can you love them
They've got no heart
Got no heart
Got no heart

How can you love them
Can you love them
Can you love them
They've got no heart
Got no heart
Got no heart

I think you love what they said
They've got no heart to say
But they think so nuts
I think you should
Find new feelings
Cause they don't love you!
Take them something new heart(?)

(No! No! No! No! Uh.! No.! Uh...)
