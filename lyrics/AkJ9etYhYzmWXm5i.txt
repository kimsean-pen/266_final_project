Speak to me one last time
Smile at me once more
I cannot bear this distance
Our memories galore

In lucid dreams I'm dancing
My cries echo unheard
Your soul now deaf to
My every bitter word

My muted love
May you rest forever
Cradled to the sounds of this lullaby

In our sweet atonement
We slumber secretly
We'll never comprehend that
We never should have been
Oh this true love story
Is buried in memories

Let me crawl inside you
To open your weary eyes
Heal the wound that broke you
Recover all goodbyes

My muted love
When were we raided?
Who dare leave us jaded and torn

In our sweet atonement
We slumber secretly
We'll never comprehend that
We never should have been
Oh this true love story
Is buried in memories

In our sweet atonement
We slumber secretly
We'll never comprehend that
We never should have been
Oh this true love story
Is buried in memories
And my voice was silenced
The moment we started to dream
