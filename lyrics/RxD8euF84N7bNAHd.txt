Everybody needs a prayer, and needs a friend
Everybody knows the world's about to end
Everybody wants to know what the end will be
Everybody wants to look before they leave
Everybody wants to sip of wine to drink
Everybody wants a little more time to think
Everybody needs a reason why they run
Everybody wants to know what they're running from

And I can see your fever's on the rise
I can all the water in your eyes
And I can see the way the water leads
Love will lead us all to smithereens
Dying is easy, I believe my love and my love relieves me
Dying is easy, I believe my love and my love relieves me
You said it was everything...

Everybody takes forever to fall asleep
Everybody's got a love they don't want to keep
Everybody needs a prayer, and needs a friend
Everybody knows the world's about to end

And I can see your fever's on the rise
I can see the water in your eyes
And I can see the way the water leads
Love will lead us all to smithereens
Dying is easy, I believe my love and my love relieves me
Dying is easy, I believe my love and my love relieves me
You said it was everything...
And I'm gonna let it in

And I can see your fever's on the rise
I can see the water in your eyes
And I can see the way the water leads
Love will lead us all to smithereens
Dying is easy, I believe my love and my love relieves me
Dying is easy, I believe my love and my love relieves me
You said it was everything...
And I'm gonna let it in
