You and that white Tshirt
You and that summer dress
I was hoping I could make you notice
Promise that I won't forget

Well I know it wasn't always easy
Read you like an open book
You can always see right through me
Baby one glance is all it took

Do you remember that hot July
Lighting up the night like fireflies
Time flew by
Counting up stars in the blackest sky
And I know its not like it once was
Something that I need to remind you of
You and I still light up the night like fireflies

You and I all savvy
You were always making me wait
When I knew I was ready
Come on baby, its never too late

Do you remember that hot July
Lighting up the night like fireflies
Time flew by
Counting that star in the blackest sky
And I know its not like it once was
Something that I need to remind you of
You and I still light up the night.

I can still feel that hand in my hair
I can still see that spark in your eye
Making me laugh like you are standing right there.
Take me back to.
when we were just catching fire.
when we were just catching fireflies

Do you remember that hot July
Lighting up the night like fireflies
Time flew by
Counting that star in the blackest sky
And I know its not like it once was
Something that I need to remind you of
You and I still light up the night like fireflies
