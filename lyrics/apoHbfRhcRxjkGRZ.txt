Somedays aren't yours at all
They come and go
As if they're someone else's days
They come and leave you behind someone else's face
And it's harsher than yours
And colder than yours

They come in all quiet
Sweep up and then they leave
And you don't hear a single floor board creak
They're so much stronger
Than the friends you try to keep
By your side

Downtown, Downtown
I'm not here
Not anymore, I've gone away
Don't call me, don't write

I'm in love with your daughter
I wanna have her baby
I'm in love with your daughter
So can I please?

Downtown, Downtown
I'm not here
Not anymore, I've gone away
Don't call me, don't write

I've gone away
Don't call me, don't write
Don't call me, don't call me, don't call me
Don't write, don't write, don't write
Don't write, don't write

Somedays aren't yours at all
They come and go as if they're someone else's days
They come and leave you behind someone else's face
And it's harsher than yours
