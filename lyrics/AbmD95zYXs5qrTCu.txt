How can you sleep at night, knowing the injustice thats all around you.
Start again, (start again) you're living on the edge of existence

A life of luxury to the unworthy
Selfishness and greed is all that I see
Complete disregard for your surroundings
You've taken all of this for granted

I gave you everything you ever needed
And you just threw it all away

All around you is a dying world
The war you don't see
Start again

How can you sleep at night, knowing the injustice thats all around you.
Start again, (start again) you're living on the edge of existence

Rationality outweighed by excessive demand
Caught in a state of civil unrest
Your fighting for a change in a failing system
A meaningless victory for an unfit cause
The population's interests invested in a finite solution

All around you is a dying world
The war you don't see
Start again

How can you sleep at night, knowing the injustice thats all around you.
Start again, (start again) you're living on the edge of existence

Fall in line
Your lack of action will be your downfall
Save yourselves
From this cancerous mindset forced upon you
You'll soon be past the point of no return
Forget everything that came before, when will you learn?

I gave you everything you ever needed
And you just threw it all away
