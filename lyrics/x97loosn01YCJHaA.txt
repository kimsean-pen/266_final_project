I'm feeling lonely
I need you closer
Your heart is distant
And will not listen
What will it take to reach you

I'll travel beyond
The weakened threshold
To keep you safe from
Your suffering

You always told me
You wanted closure
With no resistance
I said it's over
Release my feelings from your mind

The nightmare's ending
I will not suffer
This place is home now
I let you go
