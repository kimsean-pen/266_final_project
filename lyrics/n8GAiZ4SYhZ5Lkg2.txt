Floating on while the world is sinking
Umbrellas in the cups we're drinking
I love it, la la love it
Love it, la la love it
Light it up in the darkest hour
Our dreams only getting louder
I love it, la la love it
Love it, la la love it
This is our time now
Nothing left to think about
Baby, let your hair hang down (I love it, la la love it)
Down, down down (love it, la la love it)
These are our last words
Gonna be the last ones heard
Baby, when we crash and burn (I love it, la la love it)
Burn, burn, burn

We're just kids setting stuff on fire
We are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we are
We're just kids setting stuff on fire
We are, we are, we are

We are, we are, we are

We're just la la la la la la
Shouldn't tell you that I see through your dress
No shame in a drunken secret
I love it, la la love it
Love it, la la love it
Little lady, come a little closer now
You can save me while the stars are falling down
I love it, la la love it
Love it, la la love it
This is our time now
Nothing left to think about
Baby, let your hair hang down (I love it, la la love it)
Down, down down (love it, la la love it)
These are our last words

Gonna be the last ones heard
Baby, when you crash and burn (I love it, la la love it)

Burn, burn, burn
We're just kids setting stuff on fire
We are, we are, we are

We are, we are, we are
We're just kids setting stuff on fire
We are, we are, we are

We are, we are, we are
We're just la la la la la la
Nights are red and days are gold
Sun goes out, the moon is full

Just us kids letting go
Just us kids letting go
Nights are red and days are gold
Sun goes out, the moon is full

Just us kids letting go
Just us kids letting go
We're just kids setting stuff on fire
We are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we are
We're just kids setting stuff on fire
We are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we are
We're just kids
