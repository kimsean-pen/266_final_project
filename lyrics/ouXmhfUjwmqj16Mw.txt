We sleepwalk into fire
A cloud of doubt just passed us by
We hide the truth behind a screen
This fire won't burn my dream

Weightless you were dreaming
When you wake don't forget
This world keeps turning
If the sun sets to the west

They put their trust in tarot cards
New Age of Reason proved us right
Suspicion drives as nature screams
This fire won't burn my dream

Weightless you were dreaming
When you wake don't forget
This world keeps turning
If the sun sets to the west

Weightless you were dreaming
When you wake don't forget
This world keeps turning
If the sun sets to the west

Burning it keeps turning
If the sun sets to the west
Burning it keeps turning
If the sun sets to the west

And if the world should stand still
There won't be much left to say
I'll find the next rugged hill
And let the wind blow your name away

Weightless you were dreaming
When you wake don't forget
This world keeps turning
If the sun sets to the west

Weightless you were dreaming
When you wake don't forget
This world keeps turning
If the sun sets to the west

Burning it keeps turning
If the sun sets to the west
Burning it keeps turning
If the sun sets to the west
Burning it keeps turning
If the sun sets to the west
Burning it keeps turning
If the sun sets to the west
