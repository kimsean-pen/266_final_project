Birds are circling above
They're called back to a waiting glove
Oh, why don't they fly away?
Surely they'd have guessed by now
There is no gun to shoot them down
And still, they stay for what they say

Are they killing them with lies?
Are they fighting for their lives?
Killing them with thoughts?
Can they never get enough?
Killing them are we killing
Killing every single feeling?
It's a trained response

Birds are circling above
They're called back to a waiting glove
This sordid game it bears my name
I have worshiped some false gods
I've run to them like Pavlov's dogs
To hide my shame and fan the flame

Are they killing them with lies?
Are they fighting for their lives?
Killing them with thoughts?
Can they never get enough?
Killing them are we killing
Killing every single feeling?
It's a trained response

We're all preset to reset to
Die
To die
We're all preset to reset to die
We're all preset to reset to die
Somebody told me once
Beat them till they start to get used to it
Next thing they're lining up

Are we killing it?
Are we killing it?
Are we killing it?
Are we killing it?
Are we killing it?
Are we killing it?
Are we killing it?
Are we killing?
