Heart and soul
Baby, there's no goal
Turn the lights on bright
You're a rock and roll star

Feel my love
Coming from the heavens above
When my eyes meet your eyes
You know it's true

Baby, come dance with me
Baby, come dance with me
On TV, at the TV station

Baby, come dance with me
Baby, come dance with me
On TV, at the TV station

You are lost and I'm at home
And nobody wants
To be here alone

Ooo, baby's in mint condition
Man, I'm doin' some dirty wishin'
Let's both get on that rocket to the stars

Baby, come dance with me
Baby, come dance with me
On TV, at the TV station

Baby, come dance with me
Baby, come dance with me
On TV, at the TV station

Baby, come dance with me
Baby, come dance with me
On TV, at the TV station

Baby, come dance with me
Baby, come dance with me
On TV, at the TV station

Baby, come dance with me
Baby, come dance with me
On TV, at the TV station

Baby, come dance with me
Baby, come dance with me
On TV, at the TV station
