Everlasting friend
Why are you so certain?
Why do you defend
This contagious burden?
Are you still here?

This confrontation killing the perfect one
Alien shivers stalling his victory run (come along with me)
Drifting away as the dopamine ray of his sun appears

Radiant and free
Eyes were sore from laughter
Now you claim to see purpose in disaster
Are you still here?

This confrontation killing the perfect one
Alien shivers stalling his victory run (come along with me)
Drifting away as the dopamine ray of his sun appears

This confrontation killing the perfect one
