Medicate this world with death
We've raped every resource again and again
Breed your children to do the same
To open the wounds and rip out the veins

There's nothing fucking left
This is what you wanted
This is what we get
Only in greed
Will your heart turn black
The more you take
The less we have

There's nothing fucking left
Can you count the list of failed accomplishments?
There's an end and a cure to living selfishly
For you and me and everyone to see

Fatal to the earth
Fatal to the earth
Ignored every sign
We all live in regret this time

Fatal to the earth
Fatal to the earth
Now there's nothing left
We've bred ourselves to die
Mankind denied

Medicate this world with death
With death

You can say goodbye
You can try to deny but we're the reason why
And you can say goodbye
You can try to deny but we're the reason why
We're the reason why
FATAL
This is what you want
This is what we get
A world left in regret
Mankind Denied
