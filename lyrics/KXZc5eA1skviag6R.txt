Brandy, Brandy, Brandy

I don't even know how it got this way
When I first met you I never thought your love was true
But I'm glad I saw just what was in store
All the while you plan to be my man, now I'm in love with you

You make me happy, make me feel so good
With the things you do for me, oh baby can't you see that
You make me happy, make me feel so good
With the things you do for me, oh baby, baby, baby

In search of happiness, I tried to find that one
Who can make my life so complete, baby
If I only knew that someone was you, boy
There would have been more happy days
So don't you go away

No one can make me feel this way
You always seem to make my day
So don't you go away

You make me happy, make me feel so good
With the things you do for me, oh baby can't you see that
You make me happy, make me feel so good
With the things you do for me, oh baby, baby, baby

No one, only you can make me feel this way
You always seem to brighten up my day

You make me happy, make me feel so good
With the things you do for me, oh baby can't you see that
You make me happy, make me feel so good
With the things you do for me, oh baby, baby, baby

You make me happy, make me feel so good
With the things you do for me, oh baby can't you see that
You make me happy, make me feel so good
With the things you do for me, oh baby, baby, baby

You make me happy, make me feel so good
You make me happy, make me feel so good
With the things you do for me, oh baby, baby, baby
You make me happy, make me feel so good
With the things you do for me, oh baby can't you see

You make me happy, make me feel so good
With the things you do for me, oh baby, baby, baby
You make me happy, make me feel so good
With the things you do for me, oh baby can't you see that
You make me happy, make me feel so good
With the things you do for me, oh baby, baby, baby
