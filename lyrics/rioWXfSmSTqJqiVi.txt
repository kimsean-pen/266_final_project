Okay! Pretty
What is brand new, exactly I think of you
You'll touch me in a minute
But that's not what I want to do

We are two strangers
We might never have met
We can talk forever
I understand what you said

But I'm not in love, what does it take to fall in love?
Do people really fall in love?

You know it
Is there a time for this? Is this responsibility?
Girl time, boy time
Is that the difference between you and me?

I won't ask any questions
Who needs to make a new start
I choose to believe you
I said before that I can't

'Cause I'm not in love, what does it take to fall in love?
Do people really fall in love?

Feelings
Take it easy, baby
Don't let your feelings get in the way
I believe someday we'll live in a world without love

I can answer your questions
If you won't twist what I say
Please respect my opinions
They will be respected someday

But I don't need love, there'll come a day when we won't need love
I don't believe that we don't need love
