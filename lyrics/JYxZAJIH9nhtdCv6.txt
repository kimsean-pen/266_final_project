We wear red so they don't see us bleed
Hundred dollar bills under our sleeve
We intend not to sleep till we're dead
Drink our problems right out of our heads
Singing oh oh oh oh oh
Trouble
Singing oh oh oh oh oh
Here comes trouble
Dangerously having the time of our lives
These boys are just poisonous thorns in our sides
Starting fires wherever we go
Watching Em gamble everything they own
Singing oh oh oh oh oh
Trouble
Singing oh oh oh oh oh
Here comes trouble
Trouble coming in the dead of night
Trouble making everything alright
It's in your blood
It's in your bones
You cannot sleep for
You cannot sleep for
Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh
Tr-tr-trouble trouble
Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh
Here comes trouble trouble
There are dogs on the loose, there are snakes in the desert
I'm that knife your boot, girl I gotcha
I'm your number two man in a fight
We are revolutionaries tonight
Singing oh oh oh oh oh
Trouble
Singing oh oh oh oh oh
Here comes trouble
