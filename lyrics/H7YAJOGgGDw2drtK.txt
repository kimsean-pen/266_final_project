Never got love from a government man
Heading downstream till the levee gives in
What can i do to get the money
We ain't go the money, we ain't gettin' out

Look at me
I Just can't believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be (I just wanna be)
Look at me
I Just can't believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be

Look at me
I Just can't believe
I just wanna dream (dream, dream, ...)

Look at me
I Just can't believe
What they've done to me (me, me, ...)

Look at me
I Just can't believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be (I just wanna be)
