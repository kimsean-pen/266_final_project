Lady, lady, lady, lady powers
Lady, lady, lady, lady powers

The other day you said you'd buy me flowers
Saw you had me waiting here for hours
Empty handed, took for granted
My lady, lady, lady, lady powers
The other day you said you'd take me dancing
Nothing special, just a touch of romancing
I can't stand it, how you take for granted
My lady, lady, lady, lady powers

I'm not gonna beg for your respect
I won't be defined by your eyes
You can't refuse, I shouldn't have to use
My lady, lady, lady, lady powers
Lady, lady, lady, lady powers

I know that you think I'm going crazy
But I'm not gonna settle for anything short of amazing
Couple billion on the earth
Do you think I deserve someone that puts me first?

I'm not gonna beg for your respect
I won't be defined by your eyes
Beauty in lies, unsatisfied
All the things we do for your kind
You can't refuse, but shouldn't have to use
My lady, lady, lady, lady powers

Lady, lady, lady, lady powers
Lady, lady, lady, lady powers
Lady, lady, lady, lady powers

And I could damn my body and my bones
But that would only tear me from my throne

My lady, lady, lady, lady powers
Lady, lady, lady, lady powers
Lady, lady, lady, lady powers
Lady, lady, lady, lady powers
Lady, lady, lady, lady powers
