Stood out on the backroads
To see if you would come back
I hadn't seen you in a little while
But I was ready to give another try

And someone told me that you moved to New York
When I wrote to you, you told me not to find you anymore
Is that how we gotta leave it?
'Cause I'll meet you anywhere you wanna go

We surrender our souls, but it takes more
You brought the apple juice, should I sip the end?
Hennessy in my blood, I couldn't let it show
Did I do the same for you, and would you hit the L

I tried to listen to my good sense
I tried to listen to my friend
But I wanna see you in your new life
Wanna see you standing at the city's edge

And someone told me that you moved to New York
When I wrote to you, you told me not to find you anymore
Is that how we gotta leave it?
'Cause I'll meet you anywhere you wanna go

We surrender our souls, but it takes more
You brought the apple juice, should I sip the end?
Hennessy in my blood, I couldn't let it show
Did I do the same for you, and would you hit the L
We surrender our souls, but it takes more
You brought the apple juice, should I sip the end?
Hennessy in my blood, I couldn't let it show
Did I do the same for you, and would you hit the L

Would you hit the L, would you hit the L
Would you hit the L, would you hit the L
Would you hit the L, oh, would you hit the L
