Hi again, this is me, at home I am
So wide awake, depressed for a lifetime
Coffee's up, my second cup, who gives a fuck?
I'm up at eight, I'm in bed by midnight
Made the bed, passing time, put laundry in
I think it's great: domestic in my life
It's raining now, like everytime that we go out
I'm not divine, can't change it, but I'll try

Failing health, failing smile, 10, 000 likes
No ego here, isn't only been a year, right?

In a strange way
Think I'm back to myself
When I'm back here
I know nobody else
Is nobody there?
Me and you alone
When you leave for work
When I sleep at home
Yeah, it hurts me
Just to leave and come back
Hey, come back here
Need your help to relax

So I guess today's the day I make a break
My heart, it craves attention and spotlight
