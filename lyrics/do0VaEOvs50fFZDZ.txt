There's no escape, heaven can wait
There's no escape and time is running out
Heaven can wait, come hell or high water

Dragged into a world with voices unheard and silent screams
Forced into this hell where evil compels and shatters your dreams
Trapped in this underworld, confused on how this came to be
A path you walk has lead you on a trail of misery
Unsure of your fate, uncertainty waits your struggle within
No end and no beginnings

Is this the afterlife?

There's no escape and time is running out
Heaven can wait come hell or high water
There's no escape and time is running out
Heaven can wait come hell or high water
Hell or high water

Time testing your fate just left as you waste or hope disappears
So someone disrupt now nothing is left, death is hunting the weak
Now break these chains with broken bones, become the enemy
The end is sight, now you're the hearth to show no empathy
Unsure of you fate, uncertainty waits your struggle within

No end and no beginnings

Is this the afterlife?

There's no escape and time is running out
Heaven can wait come hell or high water
There's no escape and time is running out
Heaven can wait come hell or high water

I can't let you
I won't let you
Go

No end and no beginnings

Is this the afterlife?

There's no escape and time is running out
Heaven can wait come hell or high water
There's no escape and time is running out
Heaven can wait come hell or high water
