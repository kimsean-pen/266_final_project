Patter on a window, the flicker of a flame
Hole in a nickel; beauty unexplained
I don't know how
I don't know how
I don't know now
In a hotel- room 12
Manhattan, Chicago, Colorado Springs
Portland, Seattle, down the Rocky Mountain range
I've seen it all, yet there's so much more to see
I've said so much, yet there's so much more to say
But I don't know how

I don't know how
I don't know how
I don't know now
In a hotel- room 12, room 12
I don't know how
I don't know how
I don't know now
In this hotel, hotel - room 12

I feel like this when I am cooped up on the floor
I feel like this when there's a knock on the door
I feel like shit over the toilet hungover
When I feel like this I'd like to feel a little more
But I don't know how

But I don't know how
I don't know how
I don't know now
I don't know how
I don't know how
I don't know now
