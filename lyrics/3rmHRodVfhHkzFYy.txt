So sweetened your doomed for a well garnished life
Flourished and sprayed with perfume
So sweetened your doomed for a well garnished tomb now

Textiles with textures caressing your skin
Woman so primitive looking content
Pout your lips your such a bird
Shhh don't utter a word

Don't wrinkle your forehead
Don't even think recommendation
From a magazine pout your lips
Your such a bird
Don't utter a word

Flourished and sprayed with perfume
So sweetened your domed for a well garnished life
Flourished and sprayed with perfume
So sweetened you doomed for a well garnished tomb now

Flourished and sprayed with perfume
So sweetened your domed for a well garnished life
Flourished and sprayed with perfume
So sweetened you doomed for a well garnished tomb now

Puddle clip claps in healthy cells
And glittering skin such an atomic bomb
When she steps in

What an ideal
To make you proud lick her face
And tell her wow pout her lips
She's such a bird shhh, don't utter a word

It's a recommendation
