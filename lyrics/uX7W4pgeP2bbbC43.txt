Heavy growth, harder life
Tread the water, or you die
It's the pressure of ours

Got the shore, got the wave
It's the only things we have
It's the treasure of ours

What is the point of making it right?
What is the point of making it right?

This is the one I wanted to say
This is the one I wanted to say
What I wanted to...
What I wanted to...
This is the thing I wanted to say
Nothing at all

What I wanted to...
What I wanted to say
Nothing at all
Nothing at all

What I wanted to...
What I wanted to...
Pleasure is ours

What I wanted to say
Nothing at all
Wanted to...

This is the thing I wanted to say
This is the one I wanted to say
This is the one I wanted to say
What is the point of making it right?
