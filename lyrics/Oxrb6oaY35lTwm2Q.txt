here's a guy with a search history darker
than a sea trench telling you how to live
Closet, crawlspace, and attic full of skeletons
A grown man who can't handle his life for shit
A scummy fraud who wants to be your boss, can't handle his shit

Seen'm before
There's always one
He's hard to miss
A born asshole
Keeping tabs on
Running tattle
On the people making things

There's a guy in a group chat with klansmen telling you how to live
Just a matter of time till he's the one twisting in the wind

But man it makes me sick to sing this
