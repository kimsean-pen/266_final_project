What you were, what it was
You were fixing to get lost
I tried to tame you, it wasn't long 'til you were takin' off
Lightly, I was on your mind
Lonely on the road at night
You're still a wild one, but what is it you're running from?
All scared, like you're staring down the barrel of the gun
No pistol could get you, no rifle could shoot fast enough
Some try to love you, but it's never long before you shake 'em off
Lightly, I was on your mind
Lonely on the road at night
Lights so low and glare in your eyes
Jump the gun and you were too shy
Lightly, I was on your mind
Lonely on the road at night
Lights so low and glare in your eyes
Jump the gun and you were too shy.
