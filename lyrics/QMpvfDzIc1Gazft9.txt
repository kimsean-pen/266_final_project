I've been wasting my time
But damn it feels right
I've been wasting my time
But damn it feels right
I've been wasting my time
But damn it feels right
I've been wasting my time
But damn it feels right

I've been gone, gone, gone, not for good
It was just one try and I will hunt
I've been gone, gone, gone, not for good
Oh, I need it, I need it, I need it
'Cause I won't be tried
Oh, and I'll be going all night till the daylight

I've been wasting my time
But damn it feels right
I've been wasting my time
But damn it feels right

I've been gone, gone, gone, not for good
It was just one try and I will hunt
I've been gone, gone, gone, not for good
Oh, I need it, I need it, I need it
'Cause I won't be tried
Oh, and I'll be going all night till the daylight

I've been wasting my time
But damn it feels right
I've been wasting my time
But damn it feels right

I've been wasting my time

But damn it feels right
I've been wasting my time
But damn it feels right
