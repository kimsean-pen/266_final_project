I want
to play with you tonight
hold me
thats all thats on my mind
baby
somethings feel so right
maybe
we could play tonight
I want to be
somewhere with you
I want to do just what you want to do
I want to be
all over you
I've got a dream and you could make it true

Cause I'm...
I'm fascinated by your love boy
and I'm fascinated by your love toy
Oh, I'm fascinated by the way you make me feel
Cause I'm...
I'm fascinated by your love boy
and I'm fascinated by your love toy
and I'm fascinated by the way you make me feel
Love me
until the morning light
please me
make me feel alright
kiss me
let me make you mine
I love it
loving you so tight
come on, come on,
I want to be with you
come on, come on,
I won't get over you
I want to do just what you me to
I got a dream and you can make it good

Cause I'm...
I'm fascinated by your love boy
and I'm fascinated by your love toy
Oh, I'm fascinated by the way you make me feel
Cause I'm...
I'm fascinated by your love boy
and I'm fascinated by your love toy
and I'm fascinated by the way you make me feel
(Instrumental)
I'm...
I'm fascinated by your love boy
and I'm fascinated by your love toy
Oh, I'm fascinated by the way you make me feel
Cause I'm...
I'm fascinated by your love boy
and I'm fascinated by your love toy
and I'm fascinated by the way you make me feel
(Instrumental)
