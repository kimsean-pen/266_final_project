Every time I'm walkin' down the streets
Some pretty mama start breakin' down with me
Stop breakin' down, yes stop breakin' down
The stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby
It'll make you lose your mind

I can't walk the streets now con, consulate my mind
Some no-good woman she starts breakin' down
Stop breakin' down, please stop breakin' down
The stuff I got it gon' bust your brains out, baby
It'll make you lose your mind

Now, you Saturday night women's, you love to ape and clown
You won't do nothin' but tear a good man reputation down
Stop breakin' down, please stop breakin' down
The stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby
It'll make you lose your mind

Now, I give my baby, now, the ninety-nine degree
She jumped up and throwed a pistol down on me
Stop breakin' down, please stop breakin' down
Stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby
It'll make you lose your mind

I can't start walkin' down the streets
But some pretty mama don't start breakin' down with me
Stop breakin' down, yeah stop breakin' down
The stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby
It'll make you lose your mind
