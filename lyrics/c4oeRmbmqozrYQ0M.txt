I've been chained here
Too afar to break a window
Constant chain [?]
To pretend that you're a victim

The stutter says a lot

If this is true I'll do it all again
(The stutter says a lot)
Put it all in the
Reaction is fake
I'll believe anyway
And that's the part you chose to break

You were tangle of wavelength
Just to pacify the

To pretend that you're an expert

[Pre-Chrous)
The stutter says a lot
Without reaching up for anything so I could find a way out

If this is true I'll do it all again
(The stutter says a lot)
Put it all in the refrain
Reaction is fake
I'll believe anyway
And that's the part that you chose to break

We find a place
To pretend that you're a victim
Just to pacify the impulse
The stutter says a lot
And if I stay I won't hold you up
And if I stay
