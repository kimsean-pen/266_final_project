Aye, YB, let's pipe 'em up, bro!

And there's too many hoes, had to switch locations
Bad bitch black, and the next bitch Asian
Ben 10 wrist and it hit so brazy
Wockhardt got me faded, pourin' up the red and it look like crazy
These niggas been tryna' take my cadence
Nigga on fuck shit, we so heinous

Fuck it up, dash in the demon
In all [?] and I'm leavin'
Gang in the bih we'a show 'em how we bleedin'
I just hit the bih, fuck her friend in the evenin'
I'mma go big on big, I turn five to a ten
No pass, slime your kin
I ain't here to fight with no friends
Out of my skeleton, geek on a it
We brought the choppa like, who want it?
Bro takin' these bitches put two on 'em
Beatin' on the brick, young nigga hot, put some lean on a bitch
Beam on the blick, make steam when it hit
Niggas cream with the sip
Big long shot, gotta lean on the stick

And there's too many hoes, had to switch locations
Bad bitch black, and the next bitch Asian
Ben 10 wrist and it hit so brazy
Wockhardt got me faded, pourin' up the red and it look like crazy
These niggas been tryna' take my cadence
Nigga on fuck shit, we so heinous
And there's too many hoes, had to switch locations
Bad bitch black, and the next bitch Asian
Ben 10 wrist and it hit so brazy
Wockhardt got me faded, pourin' up the red and it look like crazy
These niggas been tryna' take my cadence
Nigga on fuck shit, we so heinous
