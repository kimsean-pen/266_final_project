So you and me we've been hanging out now
Ever since we were kids just kicking around this town
So you know me and I don't back down
I know what I want and I think I've found it.

I want you to be my girl
I want you to be my girl
So we touched a Supernova
So we touched a Supernova

So you know me and I'm on the right track
Going to get out of here and never come back
So you know me when I'm on the attack
Ain't no use in fighting back

I want you to be my girl
I want you to be my girl
So we touched a Supernova
So we touched a Supernova

Supernova
Supernova

When I'm low well I know who to call
When I think I'm about to hit the wall
Sorry baby I know you would never ever let me fall
Every time I turn around baby there you are
Just shining down on me like a blazing star

Yeah, that's what you are
Your a blazing star
That's what you are
That's what you are
That's what you are

So we touched a Supernova
So we touched a Supernova

So you and me we've been hanging out now
Ever since we were kids just kicking around this town
So you know me and I don't back down
I know what I want and I think I've found it

I want you to be my girl
I want you to be my girl

So we touched a Supernova
So we touched a Supernova

So we touched a Supernova
So we touched a Supernova

Supernova
Supernova
