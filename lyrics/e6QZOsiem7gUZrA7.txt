Well it's a silly thing
That I've been wondering

Shall we drink a toast to absent minded friends
To all who turn to corner
To those who went round the bend
Everybody raise your glasses
Drinking and drown
Melancholy for the masses
Love come down

Well it's a silly thing
That I've been wondering

Maybe you'll never bridge the gulf
Baby you're just too sensitive
Are you numb enough
Can we ever feel this impending void
Have we become what we intended to avoid

Have you ever smiled for too long
Till you're aching
Have you ever laughed till you cried
Till your heart is breaking
Have you ever smiled for too long
Till your aching
Have you ever laughed until your heart was breaking

(well it's a silly thing that I've been wondering)

Love is always riddled with selfishness
Few will find joy in their big success
From the sublime to the ridiculous in the blink of an eye
Funny all too funny, you're funny guy

If it's too much to feel
Come this way my friend
Try to keep it unreal
Feels good to let yourself descend
No pretend we can transcend our everyday existences
No distances
How did we come undone
Became what we've become

Have you ever smiled for too long till you're aching
Have you ever laughed till you cried till your heart is breaking
Have you ever smiled for too long till you're aching
Have you ever laughed until your heart is breaking

(how did we dome undone become what we've become)

Have you ever smiled for too long till your aching
Have you ever laughed till you cried till your heart was breaking

(how did we come undone became what we've become)

Have you ever smiled for too long
Have you ever laughed until your heart was breaking

(how did we come undone become what we've become) (x2)
