You remind me I live in a shell
Safe from the past and doing okay
But not very well
No jolts no surprises no crisis arises
My life goes along as it should
It's all very nice but not very good...
And I'm ready to take a chance again
Ready to put my life on the line
With you...
Been living with nothing to show for it
You get what you get when you go for it
And I'm ready to take a chance again with you...

When she left me in all my despair
I just held on my hopes were all gone
Then I found you there
And I'm ready to take a chance again
Ready to put my love on the line
With you
Been living with nothing to show for it
You get what you get when you go for it
And I'm ready to take a chance again
Ready to put my love on the line
With you
Been living with nothing to show for it
You get what you get when you go for it
And I'm ready to take a chance again
Ready to take a chance again with you...
With you...
