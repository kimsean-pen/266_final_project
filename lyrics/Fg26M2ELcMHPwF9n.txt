Come down to the Black Sea swimming with me,
ah-oh

Go down with me
fall with me
lets make worth it

ah-oh
A thousand nights have passed

change doesen't happen overnight
Not visible at first

It's important to hold on (hold on)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
inject your advice to me
Oh, oh, oh, oh
incinerate our shackles
Come down to the Black Sea swimming with me

ah-oh
Go down with me
fall with me

lets make worth it
ah-oh

You rise, I fall,
I stand, you crawl

You twist, I turn,
who's the first to burn
You sit and stay,
I don't to obey
Where do we land in the Black Sea?
Oh, oh, oh, oh in the Black Sea

Where do we land in the Black Sea?
You're giving up, I'm tired
The tug of War that we're playing

I'm not giving up in truing to tell you
Oh, oh, oh, oh inject your advice to me

Oh, oh, oh, oh incinerate our shackles
Come down to the Black Sea swimming with me ah-oh

Go down with me fall with me lets make worth it ah-oh
You rise, I fall, I stand, you crawl
You twist, I turn, who's the first to burn
You sit and stay, I don't to obey
Where do we land in the Black Sea?
Oh, oh, oh, oh in the Black Sea
Where do we land in the Black Sea?
Grip your hands tired of what's your worth
Watch yourself beg hanging on to Earth
Love, War, Pain, Life everything's the same to me
So come down to the Black Sea swimming with me ah-oh
Go down with me fall with me lets make worth it ah-oh
Come down to the Black Sea swimming with me ah-oh
Go down with me fall with me lets make worth it ah-oh
You rise, I fall, I stand, you crawl
You twist, I turn, who's the first to burn
You sit and stay, I don't to obey
Where do we land in the Black Sea?
Oh, oh, oh, oh in the Black Sea
Where do we land in the Black Sea?
