I have seen
On that far hill
Serpents locked
In war
Love is the law
Love under will
The heart of the master
Scars me
The mark of cain
A new sun dawns
The eagle spreads
Its wings
The light brings pain
Thirst, evil dawn
Fallen angel
Fall for me
I have seen
On that far hill
Churches locked in war
Love is the law
Love under will
The heart of the master
Chains me

Through a lost embrace - on an Eastern plain
Where crippled winds give birth
To different shadows and different guilts
To squawling breath and squealing tongues
The Abbey shattered
By cloistered boots
The earth's inferno
Reigns
Books of pleasures
Books of blood
The blood of Martyrs
Rule again

I have seen
On that far hill
Angels locked in war
Love is the law
Love under will
The heart of the master
Guides me.
