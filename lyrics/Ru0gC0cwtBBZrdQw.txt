Here it comes, subject the terror you forgot
No memories from the past
The unexplainable starts to appear
As your sub-consciousness begins to come back again

Reality fades away
You try to find a solution
Here it's coming now, indecision
You freak as you can't see through all the confusion

There is no time, no time to regret
The eraser's coming for your life
You got to run, stay away from the light
The eraser's here to twist your mind

Feel your soul connected to the universe
The solstice complete
They controlled your thoughts
You will remember now, what it's all about

Twist the end around, violation
It's burning deep and twisting under your skin
It scares you forever
The proof you'll find in your dreams

There is no time, no time to regret
The eraser's coming for your life
You got to run, stay away from the light
The eraser's here to twist your mind

There is no time, no time to regret
The eraser's coming for your life
You got to run, stay away from the light
The eraser's here to twist your mind
There is no time, no time to regret
The eraser's coming for your life
You got to run, stay away from the light
The eraser's here to twist your mind
