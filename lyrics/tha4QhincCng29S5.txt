Cast into the flame
Dark horizons bridge the gap between Life and Loss
Through the windowpane
We behold the death of the gods

Pray for forgiveness, we have put the needs of the few on top again
Preying endlessly on the abyss of pride we've lost

We were the disadvantaged, yet we saw the signs
(Of demise)
The truth still denied
Buried deep behind the lies
As we try to hide; our tragedy disguised
As we all stand petrified, we die alone; betrayed in time

We're lost
Falling apart again
In dust
Is this the way it ends?

Their backs are turned
Their eyes avert.
Washed away with all but a whisper
The lies we share, the blood we spread

As the knife burned deeper in my sunken skin
I think "how innocent we used to be."
I only hope when they destroy our lives that they look us in the eyes

We're lost
Falling apart again
In dust
Is this the way it ends?

Their backs are turned
Their eyes avert.
Washed away with all but a whisper
The lies we share, the blood we spread
Ushering us to the end

Our fate is sealed; our time has come
The vultures circle over us
Forever marked
How could you turn your backs as it all falls apart?

FOREVER MARKED

With the knife to the neck of change, we stood there staring
A lie
All but a whisper; a back step toward progress

We're lost
Falling apart again
In dust
Is this the way it ends?

Their backs are turned
Their eyes avert.
Washed away with all but a whisper
The lies we share, the blood we spread
Ushering us to the end

Cast into the flame
Dark horizons bridge the gap between Life and Loss
Through the windowpane
We behold the death of the gods

We're lost
Falling apart again
In dust
Is this the way it ends?

We're lost
Falling apart again
In dust
Is this the way it ends?
