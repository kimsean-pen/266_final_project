Sweet confetti out looking for a saviour
Finding it hard to break the chain
Nothing ventured nothing gained
Ice cream, beauty, acting on her best behaviour
Finding it hard to bite her tongue
Feeling so old as the night is young

Six foot leaning on a lizard chest
Two red dragons ironed on his vest
All that money you deserve the best
I'm impressed
I'm impressed
I'm impressed

What you've got isn't all that you've been given
Changing your body like you change your jeans
Nothing is ever as it seems
Something tells me it's a marriage made in heaven
Stealing your look from a magazine
Playing the part from a movie scene

Six foot leaning on a lizard chest
Two red dragons ironed on his vest
All that money you deserve the best
I'm impressed
I'm impressed
I'm impressed

Everyday is like your birthday
But the candles burning
Don't you see, don't you see

Six foot leaning on a lizard chest
Two red dragons ironed on his vest
All that money you deserve the best
I'm impressed
I'm impressed
I'm im

Six foot leaning on a lizard chest
Two red dragons ironed on his vest
All that money you deserve the best
I'm impressed
I'm impressed
I'm impressed

Oh, I'm impressed
I'm impressed
Don't like you, but I'm impressed
I'm impressed
Don't like you, but I'm impressed
Don't like you, but I'm impressed

Ah, I'm impressed
I'm impressed
Yea yea, I'm impressed
I'm impressed
I'm impressed
Don't like you, but I'm impressed

I-I-I'm impressed
I'm impressed
I-I-I'm impressed
I'm, I'm impressed

I'm impressed, ah ah
I'm impressed
Don't like you, I'm impressed
