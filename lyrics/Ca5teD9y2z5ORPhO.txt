I might not ever work things out
I might live my whole life not knowing how
I've survived up until now
And it's all been worth it
It's just hard sometimes in the heat of the moment
I can't see through these eyes at times
How the picture really sits
It's hard without a frame
To understand how big the picture is
Just how big the picture really is
And if it fits

It's a wonder
If we'll ever figure some things out
The truth behind it all
What goes on behind some closed doors
I'm just standing here on the ground
But my head's always up in the clouds

I might not ever work things out
I might live my whole life not knowing how
I've survived up until now
And it's all been worth it
It's just hard sometimes in the heat of the moment

It's a wonder
If we'll ever figure some things out
The truth behind it all
What goes on behind some closed doors
I'm just standing here on the ground
But my head's always up in the clouds
