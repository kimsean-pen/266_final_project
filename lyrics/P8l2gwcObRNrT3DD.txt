My homie since knee high
We came up on the south side
Where you had to beat the street lights home
We got into some street fights
But the next day we be right back, get it on
Wherever there was me, there was you
And we were like crew
Straight to junior high school
Then you messed it all up
Started pushing up
Kissed me and I fell in love

Shorty's a little taller now
Into big things, he's a baller now
His heart never changed
I can see he's still down
I can't forget him
More than his voice is changing now
All that I see is rearranging now
Just ain't the same
Catching feelings now
I should tell him

Ooooh when the the boy next door
Don't want to be my homeboy no more
Saw something that he never saw before
I think he wants to be my baby (my baby)
Been thinking 'bout him all my life
Now I see him in a whole new light
Something about it feels so right
That's why
I think he wants to be my baby, baby

Every night when we get home
Under covers talking on the phone
Here comes my mother
It's way too late
Might get in trouble
My heart can't wait
So much to say
Writing 'til my hand cramps up
4 pages saying I'm in love
I got more than a crush
Can't get you off my mind
Come pick me up baby
I'm sure I'll be fine when I look into your eyes

Shorty's a little taller now
Into big things, he's a baller now
His heart never changed
I can see he's still down
I can't forget him
More than his voice is changing now
All that I see is rearranging now
Just ain't the same
Catching feelings now
I should tell him

Ooooh when the boy next door (next door)
Don't want to be my homeboy no more
Saw something that he never saw before
I think he wants to be my baby, baby
Been thinking 'bout him all my life
Now I see him in a whole new light
Something about it feels so right
I think he wants to be my baby, baby

Chocolate covered candy kisses
They keep me reminiscing
All I want is what your giving
Nothing like your affection
So in love and you're the reason
There's no more lonely season
Lately boy, you drive me crazy
Think I wanna be your baby
Chocolate covered candy kisses
They keep me reminiscing
All I want is what your giving
Nothing like your affection
So in love and you're the reason
There's no more lonely season
Lately boy, you drive me crazy
Think I wanna be your baby

Oh-we-oh oh oh oh
He don't wanna be my homeboy no more
Oh-we-oh-we-oh-we-oh oh oh oh
Oh-we-oh-we-oh-we-oh oh oh oh
Oh-we-oh-we-oh-we-oh
Why why why why why
Now homeboy wants to be my baby, be my baby, be my baby
Oh-we-oh oh oh oh
Thing's ain't gonna be the same no more
I know my homeboy wants to be my baby, be my baby, be my baby
