Everywhere you go
Anything you do
No matter what you say
You can't shake this feeling
Never can you wait
Always on the move
You're in and out of love
You never see it coming

Everywhere you go
Anything you do
No matter what they say
You can't shake this feeling
Never can you wait
Always on the move
You're in and out of love
You never see it coming now

Everywhere you go
Anything you do
No matter what you say
You can't shake this feeling
Never can you wait
Always on the move
You're in and out of love
You never see it coming
Searching for your inspiration
Look beyond your motivations
Try to read this body language
Find I'm between love and anguish
Straight to ten right from the start
Got restless legs and a restless heart
Out of control
We take these chances
Always under fire
We dance our dances

Everywhere you go
Anything you do
Everywhere you go
Anything you do

Everywhere you go
Anything you do
No matter what they say
You can't shake this feeling
Never can you wait
Always on the move
You're in and out of love
You never see it coming
Everywhere you go
Anything you do
No matter what you say
You can't shake this feeling
Never can you wait
Always on the move
You're in and out of love
You never see it coming now

Everywhere you go
Anything you do
Everywhere you go
Anything you do

Straight to ten right from the start
Got restless legs and a restless heart
