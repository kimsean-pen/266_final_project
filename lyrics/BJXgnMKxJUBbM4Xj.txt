A hole in my heart, changing desire
My softest command set this love on fire
Give in, breathe out
I'm lost this time, I cannot deny it
I'm in a different state of mind

Can we be just who we are
Doesn't matter if the road is far
Cus there are no regrets and there is no stress
Together we are limit-limitless
We can be just who we are
Doesn't matter if the road the road is far
Nobody can break our way to success
We're forever limit-limitless

Two hearts can collide encourage the power
When two worlds embrace
Each other's desire
I see it clear this state I'm in
And words can define it
It's a different state of mind

Can we be just who we are
Doesn't matter if the road is far
Cus there are no regrets and there is no stress
Together we are limit-limitless
We can be just who we are
Doesn't matter if the road the road is far
Nobody can break our way to success
We're forever limit-limitless

'Cause I, I keep believing that
I can keep breathing, if just for one night
And I, I cannot get enough of you
'Cause you are the reason I fought it

Can we be just who we are
Doesn't matter if the road is far
Cus there are no regrets and there is no stress
Together we are limit-limitless
We can be just who we are
Doesn't matter if the road the road is far
Nobody can break our way to success
We're forever limit-limitless
