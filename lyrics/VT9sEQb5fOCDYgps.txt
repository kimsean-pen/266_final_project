(Verse)
I hear a voice, hear a voice that I recognize,
Pulling me closer.
Your every word, every word that I hear tonight
It's winning me over.

There's no use running, what we got coming
You don't have to be afraid.
We're standing on, standing on, on the edge of grey.

(Pre-Chorus)
It starts with a whisper, then a heartbeat,
The world is way inside
Till you got me, you're all I hear tonight.

(Chorus)
It's getting louder and louder
One voice at a time.
Then you softly start to blow my mind.
Can't stop the whisper, can't stop the whisper.
The whisper it's never been so loud.

(Verse)
You hit the note, strike a chord like a symphony
Taking me over.
Cause you're the one, you're the one who can light that spark
Blow it all open.

It's just one reason for what I'm feeling,
I can only hear the truth
Call me now, call me now,
Yeah, it was always you.

(Pre-Chorus)
It starts with a whisper, then a heartbeat,
The world is way inside
Till you got me, you're all I hear tonight.

(Chorus)
It's getting louder and louder
One voice at a time.
Then you softly start to blow my mind.
Can't stop the whisper, the whisper.
Cause we can't seem to stop, can't seem to stop,
Cause we're shouting it out, shouting it out,
Can't stop the whisper, the whisper
It's never been so loud, so loud.
It's never been so loud, so loud.
The whisper, the whisper,
The whisper, the whisper.

Can't stop the whisper, can't stop the whisper,
The whisper.
Cause we can't seem to stop, can't seem to stop,
Cause we're shouting it out, shouting it out,
Can't stop the whisper, the whisper
It's never been so loud, so loud.
It's never been so loud, so loud
