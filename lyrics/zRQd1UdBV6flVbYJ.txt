I thought I was a star
Until I started fading
From the sky I freefall
Every single day I
Go out look up at where I'm from
Cos I thought I was a star

How long, tell me how long
Can this go on
Like we're floating in the arms of God
With the wild ones, with the wild ones
And we rage on
Til we're blazing in the sun

I thought we'd gone too far
We started walking on the water
Felt like we'd been reborn
When we woke up in nirvana
Up in the clouds not coming down cos
I thought we'd gone too far

How long, tell me how long
Can this go on
Like we're floating in the arms of God
With the wild ones, with the wild ones
And we rage on
Til we're blazing in the sun

We got hearts
Hearts they'll never tame
That's who we are
We'll burn the night away
We'll ride this wave
And no we'll never fall
Can you hear the call
Can you hear the call of the wild ones?
With the wild ones, and we rage on
Til we're blazing in the sun

How long, tell me how long
Can this go on
Like we're floating in the arms of God
With the wild ones, with the wild ones
And we rage on
Til we're blazing in the sun
