These days, your light beams penetrate
The sorrowed skin that I've been living in
But still I wait for the piercing pain
I'll feel when your feelings fade
I feel so good today

The sun is just a copper coin
I flip in bets against the void
Imitating choice
'Til I feel good again, I'll keep them in a tin can
Then I'll have copper coins to spare

Ooo

Will you remember me when our spirits scatter off?
I know I'm an artist cause I just can't stand the thought
That a love as beautiful as ours could be
Forgotten
