Our time is ending, I feel it's only just begun
And I'm frustradewd, I can't believe you're not the one
My ears are bleeding, her voice resides inside my head
And now I'm choking, release this noose around my neck!

Will I just fall to pieces?
Or am I all alright?
To iron out my creases, you must lacerate me 'til they're gone

These are my final words to you!
I know you're listening, can you hear me
The time has come to say goodbye
These are my final words, to you!

The clock is ticking, my heart is bursting through my chest
And now I'm crying, the tears are pouring off my face,
The chair is cracking

Her voice resides inside my head,
And now it's over,
You put this noose around my neck

Will I just fall to pieces?
Or am I all alright?
To iron out my creases, you must lacerate me 'til they're gone

These are my final words to you!
I know listening, can you hear me
The time has come to say goodbye
These are my final words, to you

Heaven, where is my angel?
I need her now, holding me!
Heaven, where is my angel?
I need her now, holding me tonight!

Now!

Will I just fall to pieces?
Or am I all alright?
To iron out the creases, you must lacerate me 'til they're gone

These are my final words to you
I know you're listening, can you hear me
The time has come to say goodbye
These are my final words, to you
