All the ways that you think you know me
All the limits that you figured out
Limits that you figured out
(Mmm)
Had to learn to keep it all below me
Just to keep from being thrown around
Just to keep from being thrown around
Yeah!
Every single time the wind blows
Every single time the wind blows
I see it in your face
(Mmm)

In a cold night
There will be no fair fight
There will be no good night
To turn and walk away

To burn me with fire
Drown me with rain
I'm gonna wake up
Screaming your name

Yes I'm a sinner
Yes I'm a saint
Whatever happens here
Whatever happens here
We remain

(Mmm)
Now we talk about a wasted future
But we take a good look around
Yeah we take a good look around

(Mmmm)
Yeah we know it, it hasn't been for nothing
'Cause we'll never let it slow us down
No we'll never let it slow us down
(Oh yeah)

Every single time the wind blows
Every single time the wind blows
I see it in your face
(Mmm)

In a cold night
There will be no fair fight
There will be no good night
To turn and walk away

So burn me with fire
Drown me with rain
I'm gonna wake up
Screaming your name

Yes I'm a sinner
Yes I'm a saint
Whatever happens here
Whatever happens here
We remain

Said, said we remain
We remain

Burn me with fire
Drown me with rain
I'm gonna wake up
Screaming your name

Yes I'm a sinner
Yes I'm a saint
Whatever happens here
Whatever happens here
We remain
