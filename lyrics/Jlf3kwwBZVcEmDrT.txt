I trusted a priest
I fell to his feet
And he raised me up there
Then cut me off at the knees

I trusted the law
They didn't help me at all
I wound up black, blue, screwed
In the back of his car

I don't want to wake up alone
I need you to hear me now
I don't want to do it alone
I need you here with me now

I don't want to wait for your love
I need you to save me now

They got me and I'll never give up
But I need you to save me now

Well they feed upon the poor
My head is banging on the floor
Yes it's over, yes it's over
They're lying

I don't want to wait for your love
I need you to save me now
Save me now

I once had a girl, I gave her my world
But she played around, put me down
Still wanted the pearl

So I went to a priest
Yes I fell to his feet
And he just raised me up
To cut me off at the knees

I don't want to wake up alone
I need you to hear me now
I don't want to do it alone
I need you here with me now

I don't want to wait for your love
I need you to save me now
They got me and I'll never give up
But I need you to save me now

'cause the priest and the law
Truth is pounding at the door
Yes it's over, yes it's over
They're dying

I don't want to wait for your love
I need you to save me now
Save me now

I don't want to wake up alone
I need you to hear me now
I don't want to do it alone
I need you here with me now

I don't want to wait for your love
I need you to save me now
They got me and I'll never give up
But I need you to save me now

Well they feed upon the poor
My head is banging on the floor
Yes it's over, yes it's over
They're lying

I don't want to wait for your love
I need you to save me now
Save me now
