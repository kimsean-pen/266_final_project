If it wasn't the ocean
Wasn't the breezes
Wasn't delights
Then there might be no need

If i could sleep through the coal mines
If i could breathe and eat dirty
If i'd have worked til summer
Maybe i wouldn't feel so humble

Oh, you
It's always you
It's always you

If red roses weren't so lovely
If wine didn't taste so good
If stars weren't so romantic
Then i could've what i should

Oh, you
It's always you
It's always you
Oh, you
It's always you
It's always you

If your love, i could command it
Get your head to understand it
I'd go twice around the world
Even though i may not find it

Oh, you
It's always you
It's always you
Oh, you
It's always you
It's always you

Oh, you (wasn't the ocean)
It's always you (wasn't the breezes)
It's always you (wasn't delights, then there might be no need)
Oh, you (wasn't the ocean)
It's always you (wasn't the breezes)
It's always you (wasn't delights, then there might be no need)
