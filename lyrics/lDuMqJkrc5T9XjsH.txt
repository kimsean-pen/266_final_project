I talked myself into a tailspin again
Tryin' to make somethin' never meant to happen
Happen
I wasted water again
This is a drought, my love
And I used you up
This is a drought, my love
And I used you up
I'm not proud of what I chose to do, darlin'
But I allowed myself to use of you, darlin'
Upon looking back, I can see
How selfish I had been
I loved you wastefully, darlin'
I tricked myself into disbelievin'
Tellin' myself nothing too hard to imagine could ever happen
I wasted water again
This is a drought, my love
And I used you up
This is a drought, my love
And I used you up
I'm not proud of what I chose to do, darlin'
But I allowed myself to use of you, darlin'
Upon looking back, I can see how selfish I had been
I loved you wastefully, darlin'
I loved you wastefully
