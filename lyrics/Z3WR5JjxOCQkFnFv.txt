I'm so tired of falling in love, finding it easier to fall out
I can't deny it
I feel it inside, oh, cupid's fire
Oh, you can't hide

I'm falling in love again, ain't nothing I can do
Falling in love again and this time it's with you
When I fall, it's always the same
And I'm so tired of playing this game, oh

It's been so long now since I gave up my heart
I've kept it locked down, I don't wanna get it harmed
So let me tell you now, I just wanna be sure
That you won't hurt me, oh, can you promise me that?

Falling in love again, ain't nothing I can do
Falling in love again, girl, and this time it's with you
When I fall, it's always the same
And I'm so tired of playing this game, oh

You got to tell me if you're gonna break my heart
'Cause I don't want to take a chance
And if it ain't true
All it's gonna be is nothing but a poor romance

So give me that promise to hold on
And I'll never let you go
I gotta have something to go on
I'm letting you know

Falling in love again, ain't nothing I can do
Falling in love again, girl, and this time it's with you
When I fall, it's always the same
And I'm so tired of playing this game, well

Falling in love again
(I'm falling now, I'm falling)
Falling in love again
(Girl, you got me, yeah, you got me, oh)

I'm falling in love again
(Oh, I'm falling now)
I'm falling in love again

Falling in love again
Falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
