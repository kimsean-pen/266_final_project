When the limbs have all been shaken 'til there's no more fruit to bear
When the tiger's barely up to feed the sleepers at the wheel
When you run out pretending and there's nowhere left to run
But you keep running, running, running, running, running

Look up
Hey
Look up
Hey
Look up
Hey
Look up
Hey
Look up
Hey
Look up
Hey

And I heard we'll meet our end on bridges built across the sky
But when you say it, I believe you, and it almost sounds alright
Tell the losers, tell the winners, the same ship will bear us all
But all I want is to want nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

Look up
Hey
Look up
Hey
Look up
Hey
Look up
Hey
Look up
Hey
Look up
Hey
