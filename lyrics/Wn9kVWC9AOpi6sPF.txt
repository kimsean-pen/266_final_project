North coast swells
I feel it when the cold comes in
Run red deer
They'll need you when they hunt your skin

Evening came
To the corners of my mind again
Cold and clean
A ringing on an open plain

But it seems so long, my friend
My memory is all but gone
Back to my whispering mind

Pale sun rose
A shimmer on the dusty morn
Wheel will turn
Spinning and my past will burn

But it seems so long, my friend
My memory is all but gone
Back to my whispering mind

I wait with all threats
While the Earth, it slowly spins
I recall some other place, son
Of the time just for the moment

But it's been this way for a thousand years
For the North
But I'm starting to forget
I'm starting to forget
