I've been meaning to forget you
And God knows just what that means
Even so, I try to get through
Even lonely in my dreams
Now and then I like to get around
Now that you're alone don't you live here?
Someone's lies, they just get better

There's that song, touch her body here
It's gonna get worse
Don't say you live here
Don't let it get cursed

I've been living like I'm locked up
I can see the midnight skies
Sometimes love it would sustain you
Only if you're on my side
Now and then I like to kid around
Some might say I just don't let up
Life's not long why don't you live it?

There's that song, touch her body here
It's gonna get worse
Don't say you live here
Don't let it get cursed
Touch your body here
It's gonna get worse
You know you don't live here
Won't let it get cursed
Touch your body

Touch your body here
