One by one, drinks are gone
Do I have to stay?
Hate the sound of one more pound
As it rolls away

Why did I need your proof?
When I knew the truth

And I don't know why
I just let it slip by
Me all the time
I just wish you'd 've tried

I don? t want to know your game
Let alone her name
No matter what you say to me
We are not the same

Why do you make me cry?
Try to justify
Don't right your wrong with my mistakes
'Cause my head's held high

And I don't know why
I just let it slip by
Me all the time
I just wish you'd 've of tried

And I don't know why
I just let it slip by
Me all the time
I just wish you'd 've of tried

Dreams we have as kids all fade away
Now, it's not the same

And I don? t know why
I just let it slip by
Me all the time
I just wish you'd 've of tried

And I don't know why
I just let it slip by
Me all the time
I just wish you'd 've of tried, yeah
