My hands are tied, the spirit is gone
All that was right is now forlorn
And where is the fire that once was inside
The spirit is gone
My hands are tied

There's a silver snake guarding my heart
It spits and curls itself around
The silver coil is all you get
I told you to take it slow
I told you I was young

Oh, and I will follow you all across the ocean
Where everything begins anew and is kept in motion
Oh, I will follow you all across the ocean
Where everything begins anew

My hands are tied
The spirit is gone
And where is the fire
That once kept me going
There's a silver snake inside my head
This silver coil is in my hide
This silver coil is all you get
This silver coil is on my tongue
This silver coil is all you'll taste
This silver coil around my lungs

Oh, now I will follow you all across the ocean
Where everything begins anew and is kept in motion
Oh, I will follow you all across the ocean
Where everything begins anew

My hands are tied
The spirit has gone
And where is the fire
That once kept me going

Oh, and now I will follow you all across the ocean
Where everything begins anew and is kept in motion
Oh, I will follow you all across the ocean
Where everything begins anew

My hands are tied
The spirit has gone
And where is the fire
That once kept me going
