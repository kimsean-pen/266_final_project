Come on baby, it'll be alright
Come on darling, let's go out tonight
I tell you if I could be so bold
Of all the ways I love you
(But you gotta)

Cool your battles
Stop the hating
All that matters
We'll be waiting for

So what happened to the peace and love
Sat there somewhere up above
We can make it right through the night
You can count on my forever
(But you gotta)

Cool your battles
Stop the hating
All that matters
We'll be waiting for

Cool your battles
Stop the hating
All that matters
We'll be waiting for
