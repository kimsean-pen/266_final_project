I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
Life is a maze, and love is a riddle
I don't know where to go, can't do it alone
I've tried, and I don't know why

Slow it down, make it stop
Or else my heart is going to pop
'Cause it's too much, yeah, it's a lot
To be something I'm not

I'm a fool, out of love
'Cause I just can't get enough

I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
Life is a maze, and love is a riddle
I don't know where to go, can't do it alone
I've tried, and I don't know why

I'm just a little girl lost in the moment
I'm so scared, but I don't show it
I can't figure it out, it's bringing me down
I know I've got to let it go
And just enjoy the show

The sun is hot in the sky
Just like a giant spotlight
The people follow the signs
And synchronize in time

It's a joke, nobody knows
They got a ticket to the show

Yeah, I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
Life is a maze, and love is a riddle
I don't know where to go, can't do it alone
I've tried, but I don't know why

I'm just a little girl lost in the moment
I'm so scared, but I don't show it
I can't figure it out, it's bringing me down
I know I've got to let it go
And just enjoy the show, oh
Just enjoy the show, oh, oh

I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
Life is a maze, and love is a riddle
I don't know where to go, can't do it alone
I've tried, and i don't know why

I'm just a little girl lost in the moment
I'm so scared, but I don't show it
I can't figure it out, it's bringing me down
I know I've got to let it go
And just enjoy the show

Dum-be-dum
Da-dum-be-dum
Just enjoy the show
Da-dum-be-dum
Da-dum-be-dum
Just enjoy the show

I want my money back
I want my money back
I want my money back
Just enjoy the show

I want my money back
I want my money back
I want my money back
Just enjoy the show
