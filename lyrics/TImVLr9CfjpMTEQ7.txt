Yes I'll hope I will provide you
Happiness is going to stay
Loneliness won't last forever
Don't be shy, don't be afraid
Do your thing
Behave yourself
Do your thing
Behave yourself
Don't waste time with life in illusion
Don't waste love with hope
I'll guess makes you get a wrong business
Till you find a better way
Do your thing
Behave yourself
Do your thing
Behave yourself
Don't waste time with life in nonsense
Happiness is going to stay
Loneliness won't last forever
Don't be shy
Yes I'll hope I will provide you
Happiness is going to stay
Loneliness won't last forever
Don't be shy, don't be afraid
Do your thing
Behave yourself
Do your thing
Behave yourself
Do it! (repetido)
You've got to do it!
And you've better do it!
