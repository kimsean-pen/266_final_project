Don't you shut your eyes
Don't hide your heart behind a shadow
‘Cause you can count on me as long as I can breathe you should know
I'll carry you through the night, through the storm
Give you love only love in return

I can't jump over buildings I'm no hero
But love can do miracles
I can't outrun a bullet, I'm no hero

But I would take one for you
Be sure I would
I've fallen from grace yeah I'm much less a saint than a sinner
No ain't no superhuman cause that's just in the movies
I know
But i'll carry you through the night, through the storm
Give you love always love in return

I can't jump over buildings I'm no hero
But love can do miracles
I can't outrun a bullet cause I'm no hero
But I would take one for you
I can't jump over buildings I'm no hero
But love can do miracles

I can't outrun a bullet cause I'm no hero
But I'd spill my blood for you
If you need me to I'll be there
Yeah yeah…

Uh…uh uh uh uh…
Don't say this is over
Look at them better days
Oh don't say this is over
There's no loser
Look at them better days

And try again!
I can't jump over buildings I'm no hero
But love can do miracles
I can't outrun a bullet cause I'm no hero
But I would take one for you
I can't jump over buildings I'm no hero
But love can do miracles
I can't outrun a bullet cause I'm no hero
But I'd spill my blood for you
If you need me to i'll be there
Yeah...
