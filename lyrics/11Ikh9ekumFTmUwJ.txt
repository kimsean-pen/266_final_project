I can't imagine, living, without you (without you, oooh),
My world would just stop, spinning, without you (ooh without you),
Floating on a cloud each time you say my name,
I wanna scream out loud you're driving me insane (driving me crazy baby),

Each time you call i wanna fall,
Deeper and deeper and deeper,
Each time we kiss i'm feeling it,
Deeper and deeper and deeper
When you love me like you do baby, i wanna give my all to you,
Take full control, please baby go,
Deeper and deeper and deeper

You say you would do, anything, for me (for me),
You knew how i kept my everything, for you (for you),
I promise i'll make sure to keep you satisfied,
Just trust me baby hold me tight, enjoy the ride (i'm gonna drive you crazy)

Each time you call i wanna fall,
Deeper and deeper and deeper,
Each time we kiss i'm feeling it,
Deeper and deeper and deeper
When you love me like you do baby, i wanna give my all to you,
Take full control, please baby go,
Deeper and deeper and deeper

Each time you call i wanna fall,
Deeper and deeper and deeper,
Each time we kiss i'm feeling it,
Deeper and deeper and deeper
When you love me like you do baby, i wanna give my all to you,
Take full control, please baby go,
Deeper and deeper and deeper

I'm floating on a cloud, each time, when you say my name,
I wanna scream out loud you're driving me insane (yeah yeah),

Each time you call i wanna fall,
Deeper and deeper and deeper,
Each time we kiss i'm feeling it,
Deeper and deeper and deeper
When you love me like you do baby, i wanna give my all to you,
Take full control, please baby go,
Deeper and deeper and deeper

Each time you call i wanna fall,
Deeper and deeper and deeper,
Each time we kiss i'm feeling it,
Deeper and deeper and deeper
When you love me like you do baby, i wanna give my all to you,
Take full control, please baby go,
Deeper and deeper and deeper

Go deeper, go deeper
