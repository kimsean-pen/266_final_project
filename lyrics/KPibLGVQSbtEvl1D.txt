A swollen tongue, a plastic gun
Red burn from an orange sun
These oil rigs will crack and run
These palm trees will be chopped to a stump

I've wandered, seen visions, I never could fit in
I'm out there, you'll find me, I never lost that easy

You imitate, all night stay awake
You study ancient intelligence
It's a lonely life by candlelight
To make believe, you talk to the dead

I've wandered, seen visions, I've gone off the deep end
I'm out there, you'll find me, I never lost that easy

My drunken confession, sick in the bathtub
While you take your make-up off
You take yourself so serious
If we didn't laugh, we're crying all the time

I've wandered, seen visions, I've gone off the deep end
I'm out there, you'll find me, I never lost that

No matter where I've been, I never could fit in
Don't worry where I'll be, I never lost that easy

I never lost that easy
I never lost that easy
