I got mine, bounce, this ain't about you
I'm gettin' what I want, and I want it now, boo
This ain't about love, its a transaction
I'm gettin' what I want, and I want action

Pics in my DM, 4 a.m
Don't know your name cause I don't care
And put me in a hotel, not a motel
Fat ass, high class, do it so well
Fat ass, high class, do it so well
Fat ass, high class

Fuckboy, you're just a fuckboy
F-C-K-boy
Fuckboy, you're just a fuckboy
F-C-K-boy

Don't ruin it, be a good boy
Play my game, you are my toy
This ain't about love, its a transaction
I'm gettin' what I want, my satisfaction

Pics in my DM, 4 a.m
Don't know your name cause I don't care
And put me in a hotel, not a motel
Fat ass, high class, do it so well
Fat ass, high class, do it so well
Fat ass, high class!

Fuckboy, you're just a fuckboy
F-C-K-boy
Fuckboy, you're just a fuckboy

Get that pussy so hot, don't quit
My pussy, my candy stick
Get that pussy so hot, don't quit
My pussy, my candy stick
Get that pussy so hot, don't quit
My pussy, my candy stick
Get that pussy so hot, don't quit
My pussy, my candy stick

Fuckboy, you're just a fuckboy
F-C-K-boy
Fuckboy, you're just a fuckboy
F-C-K-boy
