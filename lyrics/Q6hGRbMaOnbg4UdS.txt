There's a light in you
That tears me down to nothing
There's an angel in your eyes
There's a hope inside
That you can make it better, you see right through my disguise

When it rains it pours
And everybody stumbles
I won't let them bring you down

I won't let you down
When the seasons change
I won't go down
I'll fight through the pain
I'll be there right by your side
I'll never let them bring you down
When the seasons change

There's a hope in me
That I will die for something
Was there fire in my eyes?
All this pain inside
Will it be this way forever? I can run but I can't hide

When it rains it pours
And everybody stumbles
I won't let them bring you down

I won't let you down
When the seasons change
I won't go down
I'll fight through the pain
I'll be there right by your side
I'll never let them bring you down
When the seasons change

When the seasons change
And we're in for colder weather, look for me on the divide

I won't let you down
When the seasons change
I won't go down
I'll fight through the pain
I'll be there right by your side
I'll never let them bring you down
I won't let you down
When the seasons change
