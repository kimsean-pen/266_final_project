Don't give it up
Don't worry if the sun don't shine, you've seen it before, you don't need to worry
Every day's an uphill climb, nothing has changed
Believe me when I tell ya

Don't give it up (up, up, up, up)
Don't give it up (up, up, up, up)
Don't give up, you know it's true
Gotta do what you wanna do

Don't give up, you don't have to
Gotta do what you wanna do

Oh yeah
Don't give it up, you know it's true
Gotta do what you wanna do
Don't worry if the sun don't shine

You've seen it before, you don't need to worry
Every day's an uphill climb, nothing has changed
Believe me when I tell ya
Don't give it up (up, up, up, up)

Don't give up, you know it's true
Gotta do what you wanna do
Don't give up, you don't have to
Gotta do what you wanna do
Oh yeah
Don't give it up, you know it's true
Gotta do what you wanna do
Eeeh yeah yeah
