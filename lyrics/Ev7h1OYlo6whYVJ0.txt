I'll be gone now, either way that the wind blows
I'll be back thought, leave a light in the window
When the waves die down, i'll be halfway round and i'll call you
When the sun blocks, out hold the radio up to the phone

I was dreaming
I was heading west, thirty days faster
Had a fever, woke up in a sweat, bailing out the water

Can't go on
Can't go back

Can't go on

Can't go back

Heard your voice coming through the noise
Wrote it in the radiologue
Hurt my head wondering what you said
So i threw it overboard

Can't go on
Can't go back
Can't go on
Can't go back

Can't go on

Can't go back

I was dreaming
I was heading west, thirty days faster
Had a fever, woke up in a sweat, bailing out the water

Can't go on
Can't go back
Can't go on
Can't go back

Can't go on

Can't go back
