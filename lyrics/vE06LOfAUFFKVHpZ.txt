I cant feel nothing at all
Drug market, sub-market
Sometimes I wonder why I ever got in
Blood market, love market
Sometimes I wonder why they need me at all!

Zydrate comes in a little glass vial
(A little glass vial?) (A little glass vial!)
And the little glass vial goes into the gun like a battery
And the Zydrate gun goes somewhere against your anatomy
And when the gun goes off it sparks
and you're ready for surgery (Surgery)

GraveRobber, GraveRobber
Sometimes I wonder why I even bother
GraveRobber, GraveRobber
Sometimes I wonder why I need you at all!

And Amber Sweet is addicted to the knife
(Addicted to the knife?) (Addicted to the knife!)
And, addicted to the knife,
she needs a little help with the agony (Agony!)
And a little help comes in a little glass
vial in a gun pressed against her anatomy
And when the gun goes off Miss Sweet is ready for surgery (Surgery)

GraveRobber, GraveRobber
Sometimes I wonder why I need you at all
(It's clean, it's clear, it's pure, (It's what?) it's rare)
It takes you there (It what?) It takes you there
(A little jump) Before the cut (Why agonize? Anesthetize)
'Cause surgery is what she needs to change inside (To feel alive!)

Mag's contract's got some mighty fine print
(Some mighty fine print?) (Some mighty fine print!)
And that mighty fine print puts Mag in a mighty fine predicament
If Mag up and splits her eyes are
forfeit, and if GeneCo and Rotti so will it
Then a Repo Man will come and she'll pay for that surgery (Surgery)
(I can't feel nothing at all!)
