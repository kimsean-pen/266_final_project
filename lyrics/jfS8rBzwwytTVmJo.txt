All I need is what you've got
All I'll tell is what you're not
All you know is what you hear
I get this way when you come near

Then I know it's gone too far
Uh, oh, I touched your star
And it felt so right
Just like the hush of midnight
And then you said
With me it's touch and go-o-o-o
Touch and go-o-o-o

All I need is you tonight
Flying like a cement kite, yeah
In your headlock on the floor
Who could ever ask for more

And I know it's gone too far
Uh, oh, I touched your star
And it felt so right
Just like the hush of midni-ight
And then you said
With me it's touch and go-o-o-o
Touch and go-o-o-o

All I want is you tonight
I guess that dress does fit you tight, yeah
You know that look does make me shake
It almost looks too good to fake

And I know it's gone too far
Uh, oh, I touched your star-r-r
And it felt so right
Just like the hush of midni-ight
Then you said
With me it's touch and go-o-o-o
Touch and go-o-o-o

Well it's touch and go-o-o-o
Its touch and go-o-o-o

Well it's touch and go-o-o-o
Touch and go-o-o-o
Touch and go-o-wo yeah
Well it's touch and go-o-o-o
Touch and go-o-o-o
Touch and go
All I need is what you've got
