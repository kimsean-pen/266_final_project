Tremble tremble at the taste of
Tremble tremble at the taste of
Tremble tremble at the taste of
In his hands

Tremble tremble at the taste of

Tremble tremble at the taste of
In his hands

Oh what a violent game, stole but I still remain
Man, be my enemy, oh but he knows
My needs

Tremble tremble at the taste of
In his hands
Tremble tremble at the taste of
Tremble tremble at the taste of

Oh what a violent game, stole but I still remain
Man, be my enemy, oh but he knows
My needs, my needs

Tremble tremble at the taste of
Tremble tremble at the taste of
Tremble tremble at the taste of
In his hands

Tremble tremble at the taste of
Tremble tremble at the taste of
Tremble tremble at the taste of
In his hands

Tremble tremble at the taste of
Tremble tremble at the taste of
Tremble tremble at the taste of
In his hands

Tremble tremble at the taste of
Tremble tremble at the taste of
Tremble tremble at the taste of
In his hands

Stole but I still remain, oh what a violent game
Man, be my enemy, oh but he knows
Stole but I still remain, oh what a violent game
Man, be my enemy, oh but he knows

My needs
My needs
My needs...
