On our way to death
On our way to death

I thought of you
As you were falling through

I thought of you
As you were falling through

Angels suffering
Angels fall from light
Angels sickening
Angels suffer

I thought of you
(We breath from the same mask)
As you were falling through
(We breath from the same mask)

She purrs and sabers light (I thought of you)
(We breath from the same mask)
She purrs and sabers light (as you were falling through)
(We breath from the same mask)

Angels suffering
Angels fall from light
Angels sickening
Angels suffer

I want in (on our way to death)
And I want in (on our way to death)

(We sink to the bottom)
And I want in (we sink to the bottom)
(On our way to death)

(We sink to the bottom)
And I want in (we sink to the bottom)
(on our way to death)

She said rebellion (we sink down)
(we sink down)
And I want in (on our way to death)

She said rebellion (we sink down)
(we sink down)
and I want in (on our way to death)
