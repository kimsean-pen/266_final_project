Cosmia laughs down. Blissless moments hushed.
"the wage of sin is death, said he"
Might you stare sin in the face?
Long ache eternal, heathen begot
litmus revealing the unbound beast:
the de-evolution of the human heart
the tissue of every single muscle, acidic.
the neuron of every single cell, polluted.
whispers of thy spirit, snuffed out forever.
hands of the Earth, cauterized together.
working the palms of itself into dust.
brooding blood gaze: lecherous lust.
Each step is taken in betwixt the hare's eyes.
Each hart is slaughtered under jesuit guise.
Each hole, once more is bored and filled repeatedly.
Each vole and mouse, their breath silenced eternally.
Gorge on death. Worship the life.
Walk into the light.
