Far from our citadels
We know we can get you where you are
No one can touch us
And we will strike you from afar
There is no one to hold our fire

Don't try to retaliate
You don't know how many that we are
There is no one to hold our fire

Yeah, we will cause you pain
Yeah, we will cause you pain
And yeah, we know who we are
And yeah, we know who we are
No we're not naming any names
No we're not gonna name any names
