I woke up as I waited
Bleeding slow
There was no way to
Make all this blow over so
I started writing the ending
I said too much
And you just kept on pretending
For both of us

I could never speak in a way
You wanted to hear
I couldn't convey
We were just sinking too fast to save
The two of us
Whispering hope away

All the days that I've counted
You'll never know
All that I promised, you doubted
I told you so
Forget the words that were spoken
And thoughts erased
Let's burn the path that was chosen
Without a trace

I could never speak in a way
You wanted to hear
I couldn't convey
We were just sinking too fast to save
The two of us
Whispering hope away

I could never speak in a way
You wanted to hear
I couldn't convey
We were just sinking too fast to save
The two of us
Whispering hope away
