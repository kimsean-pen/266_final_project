A thousand days have passed you by
Pushed and pulled and dragged you down
Broke your ground and sealed it off
All those borders made it through the lines

You've been saved... this time
You've been saved... this time
You've been saved... this time
This time

A thousand days have passed me by
Pushed and pulled and dragged me further from your eyes
A thousand ways to be saved
I can't seem to find my way

You've been saved... this time
You've been saved... this time
You've been saved... this time
This time

If there's a way, I think you've lost it
Turned and fell and lost your ground
If you make it through you'll want me back
I'll be needing you, next time

You've been saved... this time
You've been saved... this time
You've been saved... this time
This time
