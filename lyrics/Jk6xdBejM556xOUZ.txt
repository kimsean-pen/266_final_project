Gather 'round on a Sunday
Should have got something on the night before
Now you're gonna have to score
So unfamiliar

And you're looking around for the number
And you're waiting on your connection
And is it pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up
Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up
Pick up, pick up, pick up
Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up
Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up

You're gonna have to take a right
Out of our territory
And we're gonna get a slap on reality on the way
So unfamiliar

And it's crumblin' down around you
And you're not goin' where you want to
And now they're checkin' your spellin'
And you're headed in the wrong direction
And you're lookin' for a public phone
You're lookin' for a public phone
So unfamiliar

And the boys in the back
Green light, green light, turn left, turn left, turn left
No right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right
No right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right

You're gonna have to take a right
Out of our territory
And we're gonna get a slap on reality on the way
So unfamiliar

So unfamiliar (Familiar)
Unfamiliar
And the boys
And the boys in the back
Green light, green light, turn left, turn left, turn left
No right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right
No right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right
You're gonna have to take a right
Out of our territory
