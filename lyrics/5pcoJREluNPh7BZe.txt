Sittin' by the fire late at night,
With my friends talking about the good times
Keys were good, can't complain this time
Soaked up lots of sun down at the beach

I'm not concerned underneath the winter sky,
Of what lies on the other side
Knock back a few more rolling rock
I wonder if they're alcohol free?

So this Is America?
Far from the sleet and misery.
Don't ruin my euphoria,
Seems like livin' here comes here easily
I wis I were american

Would I be a Democrat or Republican,
Livin large in the land of the free
Do you wish you were American?
Does your blood run red white and blue?

So this Is America?
Leaders of Democracy
Don't ruin my euphoria,
And tell me what I do not see
So this Is America?
Bless this land of the free
Don't ruin my euphoria,
And tell me what I do not see
I wish I were american...
