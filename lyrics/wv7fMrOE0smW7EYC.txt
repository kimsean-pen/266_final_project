You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last
But whatever it is you think you need, you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun
Look out, the saints are comin' through
And it's all over now, baby blue

The highway is for gamblers, you better use your sense
Take whatever you've gathered up from coincidence
The empty handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
The sky too now is folding up on you
And it's all over now, baby blue

All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
Your empty handed armies are all going home
Your lover who just walked out your door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor
The carpet too is moving under you
And it's all over now, baby blue

Leave your stepping stones behind, there's someone that calls for you
Forget the dead you've left behind, they will not follow you
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore
Strike another match, let's go start a new
'Cause it's all over now, baby blue
