Hey man
Please don't make a sound
Take a look around
Can't you see what's right in front of you?
Ahh, have a little taste
No more time to waste
You don't wanna get left behind, 'cause it's all coming down right now
How hard is it to see?
Put your faith in me
I sure wouldn't want to be
Praying to the wrong piece of wood
You should
Get where you belong
Everything you know is wrong
Come on, sing along, everybody now

God given
And He gives us sight
And we see the light
And it burns so bright
Now we know we're right
When His kingdom come
And Thy will be done
We have just begun
We're the chosen ones

I would never tell you anything that wasn't absolutely true that hadn't come right from
His mouth and He wants me to tell you

Wait...
Step into the light
How can this be right?
I'm afraid we're going to ask you to leave
Guess you can not win
With the color of your skin
You won't be getting into the Promised Land
This is just another case
You people still don't know your place
Step aside, out the way, wipe that look off your face
'Cause we are the divine
Separated from the swine
Come on, sing along, everybody now

God given
And He gives us sight
And we see the light
And it burns so bright
Now we know we're right
When kingdom come
And Thy will be done
We have just begun
We're the chosen ones

And He gives us sight
And we see the light
And it burns so bright
Now we know we're right
When His kingdom come
And Thy will be done
Now we've just begun
We're the chosen ones

I would never tell you anything that wasn't absolutely true that hadn't come right from
His mouth and He wants me to tell you

God given
