Youths dem ballin' out
Hear the ghetto youths dem ballin out
Di youths dem ballin' out
Hear the ghetto youths dem ballin out
Di youths dem saying justice ah weh dem really need overall
Di way dem deal wid mankind... All mi gyal start ball
Justice ah weh di youths dem need overall
Di way dem deal wid mankind
She nah go cry fi no guy inna nah 3 piece suit
Nor no pretty bwoy inna nuh crisp Nike boot
She nuh ball fi nah dapper
She nuh cry fi nah doop
She shed those lonely tears
For di little ghetto youths weh balling
Stary stary X-News and Gleaner
Foot might be dirty but his heart is much cleaner
And those politicians fightin down sensimillia
Get up every day dem want fi run this arena
Extra, extra... read all about it
Ghetto youths in need and there is no doubt about it
If baby want feed and can't do without it
Big 45 goin to scout it
Youths dem ballin' out
Hear the ghetto youths dem ballin out
Di youths dem ballin' out
Hear the ghetto youths dem ballin out
Jack and Jill went up the hill to sell some marijuana
Buck up the fed dey broke jack crown
And Jill came tumbling after
Little Bo peep she had lost her sheep
To thief inna di pasture
And if one try do dat again
It's goin to bring disaster
King of Kings and di Lord of Lords
Everlasting Everlaster
Inspire I and I to be a microphone blaster
We nah goin bow down to no slave master
Help di youths first and ask di question dem after
Youths dem ballin' out
Hear the ghetto youths dem ballin out
Di youths dem ballin' out
Hear the ghetto youths dem ballin out
Di youths dem saying justice ah weh dem really need overall
Di way dem deal wid mankind... All mi gyal start ball
