How can it all be out of my hands
Throw up a coin and live how it lands
There are rules, there are rules
And I'll learn them all somehow
I'm a fool, I'm a fool
That it has taken me until now
A mixed-up puzzle afraid to change
Break me into pieces to rearrange
There were times, there were times
That I thought you were the sun
Now I know, now I know
You could never be the one
