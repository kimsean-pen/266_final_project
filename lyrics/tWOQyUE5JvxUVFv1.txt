I have to follow my heart
Life, it, it just seems right, now

And when I had you
I didn't always want you, baby
I'd cry myself out
But you survived and this amased me

Stiv, stiv, God made it claw
(Even into)
Call, call, calling to yourself
(Calling to find)
Then find anger's a part of me
(Anger's a cannibal)
You won, you'se flawless, little fell
