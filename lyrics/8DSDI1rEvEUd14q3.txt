Insatiable weakness
That reaches forever
But forever is known
Not known for forgiveness
Forgiven for filth
Filth in injections
Injections of Wealth
From a world I can't see
Playing with liquid
Liquid corrodes

It's the scene of a lifetime
You'll be chained at the coming hour
You did what you wanted
At a pinnacle of power

It soothes your soul
When you cross that line
You chose your role
You crossed that line

The play of a lifetime
Alone in the looming tower
You wait for a life line
Foundations crushed

Opportunist fucks enslave you
Enslave and bind
