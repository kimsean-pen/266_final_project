Just thinking about us I've come undone
Looking back I don't know who lost or won
Tell me now, tell me now
Expressions in my mind that I can't translate
But I know that I will learn to appreciate
Tell me how, tell me how

It's been a little while since we have ended
We haven't mended, we haven't mended
It's been a little while since we have ended
We haven't mended, we haven't mended

It's getting close, it's getting close, it's getting close
It's getting close, It's getting close, It's getting close
It's getting close

I'm all I can blame I'm not keeping score
I just wish I could find who I was before
Can't go back, I'm okay

It's been a little while since we have ended
We haven't mended, we haven't mended
It's been a little while since we have ended
We haven't mended, we haven't mended

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
What am I supposed to when most of me still belongs to you
What am I supposed to when most of me still belongs to you
What am I supposed to when most of me still belongs to you
It's been a little while since we have ended
We haven't mended, we haven't mended
It's been a little while since we have ended
We haven't mended, oh we haven't mended
It's getting close, it's getting close, it's getting close
It's getting close, it's getting close, it's getting close
It's getting close, it's getting close, it's getting close
It's getting close
What am I supposed to when most of me still belongs to you
What am I supposed to when most of me still belongs to you
It's getting close
