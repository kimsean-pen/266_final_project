They threw me out of the club
The club I built with my own two hands
They threw me to the streets
Into the streets where all the gangs hang

I committed no crime
They threw me no lies

Just threw me out the club
Just threw me out the club
Into the darkest alley
They threw me out the club
They threw me out the club
Into the darkest alley

They threw me to the wolves
They proceeded to rip me apart
They threw me to the sea
Into the path of the hammerhead sharks

I committed no crime
They threw me no lies

Just threw me out the club
Just threw me out the club
Into the darkest alley
They threw me out the club
They threw me out the club
Into the darkest alley

But don't build a dance floor on top of a dungeon
And don't forget friends are peace sharing above
People stop to nothing, they want to be seen there
They flock from the valleys into the city
The building looks dinkley, the first sight is pretty
But inside they find our shame and self pity
The dance floor collapses into the dungeon
The dancers descend into different directions
Nobody believes that this is the tension
But ever detached from informations

I pull my position from under the rubble
Scraping the dust from under myself

I pick myself up, I pick myself up
Into the blazing sunset
I pick myself up, I pick myself up
Into the blazing sunset

I pick myself up, I pick myself up
Into the blazing sunset
I pick myself up, I pick myself up
Into the blazing sunset
