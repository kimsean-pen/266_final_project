Holding on with all I have inside for the sake of my life
I'm pulled underwater
Crying out I call for anyone to share this fight
But I'm sinking farther
So weathered, worn and battered, I will stay
Keep treading, as I'm dreading the waves
My hands are tied but I will make it
I'm not shaken
Even when my mind's exhausted, I survive
And the world tries to drown you out
Flooding your life like water-filled lungs
Waiting for the day this storm will pass and leave my life
It only makes me stronger
I don't want to wait, but all that has been on my mind is, how much longer?
So weathered, worn and battered, I will stay
Keep treading, as I'm dreading the waves
My hands are tied but I will make it
I'm not shaken
Even when my mind's exhausted, I survive
And the world tries to drown you out
Flooding your life like water-filled lungs
And the waves try to wash you away
Brace yourself, head high, heart strong
I will keep my head and heart above the waves
My hands are tired but I will make it
I'm not shaken
Even when my mind's exhausted, I survive
My heart is tired but it's not breaking
Now I'm awakened
No matter what the cost is, I survive
And the world tries to drown you out
Flooding your life like water-filled lungs
And the waves try to wash you away
Brace yourself, head high, heart strong
