You know you need a fix when you fall down
You know you need to find a way
To get you through another day

Let me be the one to numb you out
Let me be the one to hold you
Never gonna let you get away

The shoulder you cry on
The dust that you die on

I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer
Love me till it's all over, over
'Cause I'm the shoulder you cry on
The dust that you die on
I, I can be a painkiller, killer, killer

I know what you want so desperately
You know I give you one for free
Forever you're coming back to me

Now I'm gonna give you what you need
'Cause I know what you feed on
And what you lean on
And what you lean on

The shoulder you cry on
The dust that you die on

I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer
Love me till it's all over, over
'Cause I'm the shoulder you cry on
The dust that you die on
I, I can be a painkiller, killer, killer

Did you find another killer?
Did you find another killer?

I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer
Love me till it's all over, over
'Cause I'm the shoulder you cry on
The dust that you die on
I, I can be a painkiller, killer, killer

Painkiller
