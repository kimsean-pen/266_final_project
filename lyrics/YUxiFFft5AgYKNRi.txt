Can you pass the happiness, please
I need to top off my drink
I love the way that you are
I wanna know how you think
I feel at home with these notes
I feel at home when I speak
I'm thinking all this shit
Will never catch up with me
She said that trash hangs with trash
And I'm the worst of the worst
With expectations that failed
You know somebody gets hurt
I am the scratch on your eye
I am the worst of my kind
I am the trailer
The park
The first
To lie, shit

I think that things will get worse
Before they finally get worse
And with my head in my hands
I'm finally laid off at work
And with this college degree
I guess I'll do this for free
I'm thinking all this shit
Has finally caught up to me

I'd like to say that I'm wrong
But hey dude I'm always right
I'm condescending to you
You're condescending to life
You probably think that line's cool
You'll probably post it online
Just know that I don't like you
So please just don't waste your time

And Wes is looking at me
While I'm recording this song
He's probably laughing right now
Just while I break the fourth wall
Saying "what's up to you all"
Just kidding I don't even care
I hope you turn this shit off
And you just get yourself out there

They say trash hangs with trash
And I'm the worst of the worst
With expectations that failed
You know somebody gets hurt
I am the scratch on your eye
I am the worst of my kind
I am the trailer
The park
The first
To lie
