Overnight scenes, dinner and wine, Saturday girls
I was never in love, never had the time
In my hustle and hurry world
Laughing myself to sleep, waking up lonely
I needed someone to hold me, oh

It's such a crazy old town, it can drag you down till you run out of dreams
So you party all night to the music and lights
But you don't know what happiness means
I was dancing in the dark with strangers
No love around me when suddenly you found me, oh

Girl you're every woman in the world to me
You're my fantasy, you're my reality
Girl you're every woman in the world to me
You're everything I need
You're everything to me, oh girl

Everything good, everything fine, that's what you are
So put your hand in mine and together we'll climb
As high as the highest star
I'm living a lifetime in every minute that we're together
And I'll stand right here forever, oh

Girl you're every woman in the world to me
You're my fantasy, you're my reality
Girl you're every woman in the world to me
You're everything I need
You're everything to me, oh girl

Girl you're every woman in the world to me
You're my fantasy, you're my reality
Girl you're every woman in the world to me
You're everything I need, you're everything to me
Girl you're every woman in the world to me
You're my fantasy, you're my reality
Girl you're every woman in the world to me
You're everything I need, you're everything to me
