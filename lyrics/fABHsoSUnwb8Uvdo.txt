The minus is loveless
he talks to the land
and the leaves fall
and the pond over-ices
she don't know the system, plus
she don't understand
she's got all the wrong fuses and splices
she's not going to fix it up
too easy
The masking tape tangles
it's sticky and black
and the copper
proud headed queen lizzie
conducts little charges
that don't get charged back
well the technical manual's busy
she's not going to fix it up too easy
and she holds out her flashlight
and she shines it on me
she wants me to tell her
what the trouble might be
well i'm learning
it's peaceful
with a good dog and some trees
out of touch with the breakdown
of this century
they're not going to fix it up
too easy
We once loved-together
and we floodlit that time
input-output-electricity
but the lines overloaded
and the sparks started flying
and the loose wires
were lashing out at me
she's not going to fix that up
too easy
but she holds out her candle
and she shines it in
and she begs him to show her
how to fix it again
while the song that he sang her
to soothe her to sleep
runs all through her circuits
like a heartbeat
she's not going to fix it up
too easy
