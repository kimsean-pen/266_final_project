Yeah, she said (she said)
Get outta my way cause I'm goin' somewhere
This is not where I wanna be
You can say what you want
You can tell me I'm wrong
La dee da, La dee dee
Get off of my back, stop sayin' that
Cause I'm not afraid a heights
I may never get where I'm goin'
Yeah, but then again I might
You can't get inside my head
Can't be my safety net
I'm standing on the edge, yeah

I know it's a long way down
But you can't walk the wire
For anybody else
I might hit the ground
But at least I'll have a story to tell
She said, I gotta find out for myself

(She said, she said, she said) she said
Get outta my space
And rememeber this face cause it's not who I wanna be
Oh, at the end, oh the day I got something to say
La dee da, la dee dee
Somewhere, nowhere, don't care, anyplace but here
Oh, if ya don't believe in magic
Then watch me disappear
You can't get inside my head
Can't be my safety net
I'm jumpin' off the edge, yeah

I know it's a long way down
But you can't walk the wire
For anybody else
I might hit the ground
But at least I'll have a story to tell
She said, I gotta find out for myself

(She said, she said, she said) she said
La la la la la la La la la la la
La la la la la la
Oh la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la

I know it's a long way down
But you can't walk the wire
For anybody else
I might hit the ground
But at least I'll have a story to tell
She said, I gotta find out for myself

I know it's a long way down
But you can't walk the wire
For anybody else
I might hit the ground
But at least I'll have a story to tell
She said, I gotta find out for myself

She said, she said
Get outta my way cause I'm goin' somewhere
This is not where I wanna be
