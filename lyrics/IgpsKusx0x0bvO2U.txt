I am selfish when I need you
I am the blistering side of the wall in the back of your room
We watched the sea turn away from the shore and head back out the way that it came
If you are chasing your love, you don't want it enough and it's best just to walk away
Tell yourself your pride is just the same
Trying not to count the days 'til mine gets washed away
Carry your head up along the way
And you'll say you lack the courage and the guts of a hero even when they're on your side
Let's watch the middle fade away 'til it's all gone
I am selfish when I need you
I am the blistering side of the wall in the back of your room
I am the envy of what you're afraid to write and that's fine
Seems to me like everyone around here is just waiting
I don't wanna move cause it's just enough
I don't wanna blink cause I might miss it
Tell me when it gets to be too much
Carry your head up along the way
And you'll say you lack the courage and the guts of a hero
And everybody's on your side
We'll watch the middle fade away 'til it's all gone
I am selfish when I need you
I am the blistering side of the wall in the back of your room
I am the envy of what you're afraid to write and that's fine
All we need is a place we can be alone
Just with you and with me and without all this desperate weight that I have
All I want is to just be honest
You're the piece that I just found out how to fit to and I don't see you anymore
I am selfish when I need you
I am the blistering side of the wall in the back of your room
I am the envy of what you're afraid to write and that's fine
You lack the courage and the guts of a hero
And everybody's on your side
We'll watch the middle fade away 'til it's all gone
I just wanna waste your time
