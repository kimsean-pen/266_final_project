I'm calling you when I feel alone
I called just not long ago
Why you missing my good intentions?
I'm far away from home
But I know that's not the point
Maybe I forgot to mention

That I'm always around to be what you need
And I'm thinking about you
Always thinking about us two
Getting around to be what you need

Your love got me on a wire
You're driving me wild
Your love take it just a little bit higher
And out of my mind
You're driving me (wild)
You're driving me wild

You're calling me just to say hello
Hoping I was coming over
But I'm stuck in Copenhagen
And I didn't pick up the phone
I was just in the middle of something
Maybe I forgot to mention

That I'm always around to be what you need
And I'm thinking about you
Always thinking about us two
Getting around to be what you need

Your love got me on a wire
You're driving me wild
Your love take it just a little bit higher
And out of my mind
You're driving me (wild)
You're driving me wild

Don't blame what I used to be
Will never be the same if you don't believe
And if you walk away from you and me
I'm nothing, you're driving me (wild)

Don't blame what I used to be
Will never be the same if you don't believe
And if you walk away from you and me
I'm nothing (I'm nothing, baby)

Your love got me on a wire
You're driving me wild
Your love take it just a little bit higher
And out of my mind
Yeah, yeah, you're driving me (wild)

Oh no, you're driving me wild, baby
It's like I can't keep up with you
Oh, yeah, yeah, you're driving me wild, baby
You're driving me wild
