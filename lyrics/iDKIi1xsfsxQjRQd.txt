Close your eyes
You're weightless now
Floating safely off the ground
Far above
Keep rising up
You're racing towards the stars

You've waited all your life
To leave it all behind

Rise up
Forget abour your suffering
Float up
Forget about the pain
Leave it all and start again

Don't you cry
You've made it out
You're safe from all alarm
And all the traps
That held you back
Are far below you know

You've waited all your life
To leave it all behind

Rise up
Forget about your suffering
Float up
Forget about the pain
Leave it all and start again
