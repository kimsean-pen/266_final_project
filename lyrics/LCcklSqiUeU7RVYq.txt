There's a road that I must go
There are short cuts that I know
But I know that we'll make it eventually
On a starlight ride

There's a fire down below
(That remains in me)
When the chilly winds will blow
(It will comfort me)
But as long as we let all our feelings show
It will never die

Feel the magic in the air
(On a summer night)
See the road ahead is clear
(Not a soul in sight)
Let's take every moment and drink it down
Like a mellow wine

In the slipstream of the night
(I hear music play)
Though its road is crystal bright
(Seems so far away)
And it leads us from here to forevermore
On a starlight ride
