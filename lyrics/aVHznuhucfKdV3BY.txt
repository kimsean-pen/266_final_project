Please don't let me go

Last night I had that dream again
I tried to run back to you
But the devil held me by my sins
Til I had nothing to lose
And I woke up calling out your name
But the past it hangs like a noose
And for me to ever let you down
Was the last thing that I wanted to do

I need this more than you know
I need a miracle
Tell me I'm not alone
Please don't let me go
I need this more than you know
I need a miracle
Tell me I'm not alone
Please don't let me go

I'll pull the knife out slow
Till I'm somebody new
And then just before the blood runs down
I will tell you that there's some for you

I need this more than you know
I need a miracle
Tell me I'm not alone
Please don't let me go
I need this more than you know
I need a miracle
Tell me I'm not alone
Please don't let me go

Please don't let me go
Cause I need this more than you'll ever know
The silhouette of who we are
Tells me I'm not where I belong
But we're too old for dying young
Dying young

I need this more than you know
I need a miracle
Tell me I'm not alone
Please don't let me go
I need this more than you know
I need a miracle
Tell me I'm not alone
Please don't let me go
I need this more than you know
I need a miracle
Tell me I'm not alone
Please don't let me go
Please don't let me go
