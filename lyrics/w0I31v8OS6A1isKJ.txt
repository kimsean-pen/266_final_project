Yonder rides the Archer
lost in lawless lands
Onward rides the Archer
alone in lawless lands
Some strange power beckons
from beneath the ancient sands

No woman will have him
No man calls him friend
No woman will have him
Exiled and outlawed
by his only kin

Through twilit skies he rides
Searching the darkened side of the world
Into the night
Never knowing he has been lead astray

Through lawless lands he flies
Across the burning face of the world
Under the suns
His life begins to slip away

...a shining angel descends
Down from the sky
Her coming was foretold
