I hear your heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat
Playing with my mind
Oh, I need you wrapped around me
Just like I be on a veil

But now I'm only lonely, lonely
Holding on to you
Oh, I need you back here with me yeah
I think you want it too

Now I feed you with a new emotion
Heal you when you cry
I'll be your loving doctor of the night

Do you wanna
Take me tonight
Do you wanna
Make me at night
Do you wanna
If you wanna, take what you need

(Do you wanna)
(Make it alright)
(Do you wanna)
(Heaven's tonight)
(Oh baby, do you wanna)
(If you wanna, take what you need)

I hear your heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat
Begging for more
Oh, I need to hear that question
Like a dancer needs the floor

And now you're only, only, only
Holding on to me
Oh, now tell me that you're coming back
One word is all I need

Now I feed you with a new emotion
Heal you when you cry
I'll be your loving doctor of the night

Do you wanna
Take me tonight
Do you wanna
Make me at night
Do you wanna
If you wanna, take what you need

(Do you wanna)
(Make it alright)
(Do you wanna)
(Heaven's tonight)
(Oh baby, do you wanna)
(If you wanna, take what you need)

Do you wanna
Take me tonight
Do you wanna
Make me at night
Do you wanna
If you wanna, take what you need

Do you wanna
Make it alright
Do you wanna
Heaven's tonight
Do you wanna
If you wanna, take
