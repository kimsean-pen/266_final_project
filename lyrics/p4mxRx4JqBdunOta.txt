We got to make a connection
Now and here man London calling eyy
No time for no laughing
Size ten boot them your Dr. Marten
Could have gwarn bad prefer to be free
Something I don't wanna see
Babylon all around me
Babylon all around me

Don't break it, can't break it all
Don't break it, can't break it all
Don't break it, can't break it all
Kingdoms rise and fall

I'm not being funny at all
From I can tell
It's no laughing matter
I'm telling you all
I'm not being funny at all
From I can tell
It's no laughing matter

Are you hearing me now blud
Loud and clear man, you ere dem most good, eyy
Now there's too much talking
Time fe pay attention, no skylarking
You know this car keeps stalling
Cha fuck this car we better off walking
Something I don't wanna see
Babylon all around me
Babylon all around me

Don't break it, can't break it all
Don't break it, can't break it all
Don't break it, can't break it all
Kingdoms rise and fall

I'm not being funny at all
From I can tell
It's no laughing matter
I'm telling you all
I'm not being funny at all
From I can tell
It's no laughing matter

Telling you all
I'm telling you all
I'm telling you all
It's no laughing matter

Don't break it, can't break it all
Don't break it, can't break it all
Don't break it, can't break it all
Kingdoms rise and fall

I'm not being funny at all
From I can tell
It's no laughing matter
I'm telling you all
I'm not being funny at all
From I can tell
It's no laughing matter

Telling you all
I'm telling you all
I'm telling you all
It's no laughing matter
Telling you all
I'm telling you all
I'm telling you all
It's no laughing matter
