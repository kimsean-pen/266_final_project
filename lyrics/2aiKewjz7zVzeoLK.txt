I watch you walk in churches so tall
I hear you talk and make my heart explode
I hear the silence - A desperate scream
We move in closer and the choir sings
I hear the silence - A desperate scream
We move in closer and we forget everything

I watch you walk on ancient stones
I hear you your lips speak tarot cards
I hear the silence - An occult reading
That says many things, so many things
Besides this I know one thing
And the choir sings
And we forget everything
