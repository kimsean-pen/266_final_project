All the windows swear to miss you
And the doors are cell-block tight
Sweet sedation, sweep the issues
And the clocks about to strike

Did he call you down, are you back just yet?
Waiting now, please come set me free
And the only sound is a minute left
This could be
This could be the last time

It's a chance to fix mistakes
One more for the last time
Don't you throw our dreams away
Don't waste this chance with your smile
Ten seconds left on this star
This could be the last time

Along the staircase I dream to hear you
In a whisper-quiet room
Space for thinking
Space to scream to
But the echoes sound like you

Not the stars at night in a pitch black sky
I don't know, just wants to see you
But the time is right and it only flies
This could be
This could be the last time

It's a chance to fix mistakes
One more for the last time
Don't you throw our dreams away
Don't waste this chance with your smile
Ten seconds left on this star
This could be the last time

It's only ours
It's only now
This simple wish
It's only tonight

This could be the last time

Now we've made our last mistakes
One more for the last time (this could be, this could be...)
Don't you throw our dreams away (this could be...)
Don't waste this chance with your smile (this could be...)
Ten seconds left on this star (this could be...)
This could be the last time

It's only ours
It's only now
It's only tonight
