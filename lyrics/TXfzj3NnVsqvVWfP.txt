I saw them all around today
They don't stop, they won't go away
They love the darkness in my eyes
Help me find a way out when I'm lost within myself
Lost within myself
When I'm lost within myself
They show me everything I need
There's nothing wrong with a little greed
Never enough to satisfy
Such a driving desire that burns inside

My life came with it's own scars
I don't need you to tell me about your sorrow
I can't say I've seen it all
But I live for the things that keep me hollow

Everyday I look into the mirror
Staring back I look less familiar
I've seen all seven faces
Each one looks a lot like me

They all look like me
I never see them coming but they show me more of myself
Drawn into the depths I never knew existed
Launching me face first into the pleasures of pure lust and greed

I am becoming all things envied, I am the excess
I want it all
More pain, more sex, more lies, more of everything

My life came with its own scars
I don't need you to tell me about your sorrow
I can't say I've seen it all
But I live for the things that keep me hollow

Everyday I look into the mirror
Staring back I look less familiar
I've seen all seven faces
Each one looks a lot like me
I've seen all seven faces
Each one looks a lot like me
They all look like me

I am becoming all things envied, I am the excess
I want it all
More pain, more sex, more lies, more of everything
Everything
