Ain't no sunshine when he's gone.
It's not warm when he's away.
Ain't no sunshine when he's gone.
And he's always gone too long.
Anytime he goes away.

I Wonder this time where he's gone.
wonder how long he's gonna stay.
Ain't no sunshine when he's gone.
And this house just ain't no home.
Anytime he goes away.

I know x 16

What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better you never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did

But when it gets cold outside
And you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face
Of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

I know where he's gone
Oh he's gone too long
Anytime he goes away
Anytime he goes away
Anytime he goes away
