There's nothing left for me to say to you
And maybe I was wrong
Maybe we got caught up
Please believe me, I don't wanna be a star
I thought of you this evening
Wondered how you're feeling

Could've kept my love
You're a stranger still
When I check my phone it's always for you
Since you left my heart there's a vacancy
Now I'm torn apart while I wait to heal

I put it out my mind till the afternoon
And you get hold of me
Enveloped in a feeling
With no reaction on which to hang my hope
Love can be misleading
When I'm always leaving

Could've kept my love
You're a stranger still
When I check my phone it's always for you
Since you left my heart there's a vacancy
Now I'm torn apart while I wait to heal

Say you want, say you want
Say you want me to save you
I'll wait, I'll wait for you
Say you want, say you want
Say you want me to save you
I'll wait, I'll wait for you

Could've kept my love
You're a stranger still
When I check my phone it's always for you
Since you left my heart there's a vacancy
Now I'm torn apart while I wait to heal

Could've kept my love
You're a stranger still
When I check my phone it's always for you
Since you left my heart there's a vacancy
Now I'm torn apart while I wait to heal

If I had you to myself
I'd be happy where I am
If I had you to myself
I'd be happy where I am
If I had you to myself
I'd be happy where I am
If I had you to myself
I'd be happy where I am
