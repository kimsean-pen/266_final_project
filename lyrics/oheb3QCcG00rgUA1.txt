Hush don't speak a word about the dreams that i live for
it hurts to reach you when i'm down
dont speak again, i'm still waiting for my turn
it hurts to reach you when i'm down

my dreams are growing into
frustrations when i hear your voice
(feeding me til i'm choking)
my ears are ringing louder
repeating words that bring me down
(ringing, my ears are bleeding)

so hold your breath and spare me
the pointless conversation, im running out of patience
don't blame me for trying to reach

hush don't speak a word about the dreams that i live for
it hurts to reach you when i'm down
dont speak again, i'm still waiting for my turn
it hurts to reach you when i'm down

as you are moving forward
i feel as if i can't catch up
(trying so hard to reach you)
i'm stuck here at the bottom
you're too high up to come back down
(trying so hard to reach you)

so hold your breath and spare me
the pointless conversation, im running out of patience
don't blame me for trying to reach
hush don't speak a word about the dreams that i live for

it hurts to reach you when i'm down
dont speak again, i'm still waiting for my turn
it hurts to reach you when i'm down
silence your harsh words my dear my ears are ringing of this I can't stop thinking of it
(i try to reach you but i fall)
hush don't speak a word about the dreams that i live for
it hurts to reach you when i'm down
dont speak again, i'm still waiting for my turn
it hurts to reach you when i'm down
