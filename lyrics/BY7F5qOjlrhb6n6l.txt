strangers
talkin' bout my life
changes
they're gonna take my side
revelation
in a station
is followin' a man
an' right in this moment
i'm in torment
hear your voice again
i say man
you're my midnight man
can't escape your voice on the radio
i try it but i can't
for i need you badly
man
you're my midnight man
hold me in your spider web
midnight man
rages
tearin' up my mind
pages
i'm skimmin' to kill time
far 'till morning
hear a warning
from the borderline
an' right in this moment
i'm in torment
hear your voice again
i say man
you're my midnight man
can't escape your voice on the radio
i try it but i can't
for i need you badly
man
you're my midnight man
hold me in your spider web
midnight man

i say man
you're my midnight man
can't escape your voice on the radio
i try it but i can't
for i need you badly
man
you're my midnight man
hold me in your spider web
midnight man
