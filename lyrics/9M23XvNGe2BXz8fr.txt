only the heartache
it's only the loneliness
only a feeling
it's going away
only gets harder
to be in this moment
only a feeling
it's going away

already over
this picture of loneliness
put on your shoes now
you're walking away
I know we had something
I'm left in this moment
left with my lonely heart

cry all the way home
tears are yours
they'll dry on their own
cry all the way home
left with my lonely heart

only the heartache
a picture of loneliness
only a feeling
It's going away
I know we had something
I'm left in this moment
left with my lonely heart

what can I tell you about myself
I was a looser
superstition future
I would tell you
but it's all in the computer
superstition future
