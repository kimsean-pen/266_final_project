I got my mind set on you
There's nothing you can do to change my mind about it
Inside out, you're beautiful
There's nothing you can do to change my mind about you

It started innocent enough, with a day just like any other
Woke up late and running behind
Americano on the corner, she came without a warning
Knocked my drink all over me
She said,
"Sorry I was rushing and I gotta get to work."
After that I didn't hear a single word she said
I was caught off-guard by her turquoise eyes
I knew right then I had to make her mine

I got my mind set on you
There's nothing you can do to change my mind about it
Inside out, you're beautiful
There's nothing you can do to change my mind about you

Turned out my pocket, a crumpled up paper she gave me the day before
A scribbled message and a number
Said "Call me later".
Who am I to keep her waiting?
So without hesitation I sat down, started contemplating
If I wait to call her, would it be too late?
I'm staring at the phone, but I don't know what I'd say
Something about this girl drives me crazy

I got my mind set on you
There's nothing you can do to change my mind about it
Inside out, you're beautiful
There's nothing you can do to change my mind about you

It started innocent enough, with a day just like any other
Woke up late but right on time
I got halfway out the door, then heard,
"Where are you going?"
She grabbed me by the wrist, she pulled me back in to bed
Pressed her lips against my ear and here's what she said, yeah

I got my mind set on you
There's nothing you can do to change my mind about it
Inside out, you're beautiful
There's nothing you can do to change my mind about you

I got my mind set on you
There's nothing you can do to change my mind about it
Inside out, you're beautiful
There's nothing you can do to change my mind about you
