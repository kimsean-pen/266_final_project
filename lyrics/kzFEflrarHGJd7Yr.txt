If my heart's a cold
And my voice cracks at hello
Well lately I've been feeling kinda tired
And if I seem a little strange
Like something in me's changed
It's just the way I am
Look under the lights
And if you turn around
And my love falls to the ground
It's only cause somebody knocked me
And if I turn away
Call my name and just remember baby I can't stay
Goodbye

Goodbye, but if I cry
It's not because my heart is broken
It's only cause the smoke got in my eyes
Yeah if I cry it's only cause I watched the show
The smoke in the eyes
Oh, in your eyes

Yeah I know you have doubts
But I'm down but I'm not out
And I told I'll be fine
I just need a little time
When you look into my eyes
I won't let you back inside
I'm surrounded by the walls
I'm not missing you at all
If I turn away
Call my name and just remember baby I can't stay
Goodbye

Goodbye, but if I cry
It's not because my heart is broken
It's only cause the smoke got in my eyes
Yeah if I cry it's only cause I watched the show
The smoke in the eyes
Oh, in your eyes

In your eyes
The smoke gest in your eyes
For the very last time
Told you down'
Nothing more the smoke in my eyes
For the very last time
Told you darling'
The smoke gets in your eyes
In your eyes, in your eyes.
