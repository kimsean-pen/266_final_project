i was told this in a distant land
where tortured souls have to fight together in anguish
and the scenes of the show are of a cruel and violent nature
scenes of pain and cruelty are there to be seen
the arena the town the place was set for all to watch and see
i was told this in a distant land
where the oppressor ruled with an iron hand
and the mission of saddened complacency
left cold and emotionless by history
scenes of pain and cruelty are there to be seen
all the while i should have known it was you killing me

somewhere east of eden the designs will never change
vented through other's fear the world stops at the end of the hall
we watch the life force fade away
and that's the price we shall have to pay
(once you are dead how could the children have known)
