There's always an, 'I'm sorry'
After every outburst, another apology
There's always a make up
After every freaking break up
So tell me, why we're doing this?

Why, oh, why do we play this game?
Always want the last word
It's a war that no one can win
We just keep getting hurt

You're the only one that can make me this mad
Walk away, walk away
You're the only one that can hurt me this bad
Can't walk away, walk away

But I want you for myself
I still want you for myself
I want you for myself
Because I want you for myself

You creep under my skin
And then you ruin my make up
You know exactly how to tick me off
And yet I can't resist you
When you're kissing my face off
And everything's forgiven and forgot

I try and try to convince myself
That this ain't gonna work
Why, oh, why is the thought of you
Being gone so much worse?

You're the only one that can make me this mad
Walk away, walk away
You're the only one that can hurt me this bad
Can't walk away, walk away

But I want you for myself
I still want you for myself
I want you for myself
Because I want you for myself

Why, oh, why do we play this game?
Why, oh, why we just keeping getting hurt?

You're the only one that can make me this mad
Walk away, walk away
You're the only one that can hurt me this bad
Can't walk away, walk away

But I want you for myself
I still want you for myself
I want you for myself
Because I want you for myself
