Is it you my bleeder despoiler
All that was and never were
Hard drugs and heavy religion
All that was because of her

Is it you my bleeder despoiler
All that never came to be
Hard luck and quick decisions
All this because of me

And it's safe
Let your mind just float away
This time
We might find a way
There are words still left to say
For those departed
We'll remain

Is it you my bleeder despoiler
These words weren't meant to last
Rough love and premonitions
All going nowhere fast

Is it you my bleeder despoiler
Our love's a funeral pyre
Hard times and quick decisions
Who knows what's left inside

And it's safe
Let your mind just float away
This time
We might find a way
There are words still left to say
For those departed
Let them stay
