The breath, a path of struggle
Fingers in flesh, the soil
Sew an infertile seed of dreams
That fail

Chimed songs of youth
Discord in ruin
And what was left to grow
Withdraws as age is longed

Echoes belittle
Boot to neck
Invitation of hope
Still deceives

Endeavor to climb, only to see
Achievements evade
To crawl and undermine
And cause my undoing

Ashamed to see
A change for nothing, and nothing ahead
Something is lost, nothing is gained
The world is ours, to share and stain

...A change for nothing
...Nothing ahead

Caving In, accepting failure, cessation

If only it could be
More than a gift of self
To share and stain
A starless world lost of it's horizon
