She only likes it when it's hot. She doesn't like the cold.
She said I got a bright idea, "Let's go to Mexico."
$500 in the bank, things are looking bad.
Imagine if we gotta eat, things are looking sad.

Barely in love (repeat) (chorus)

She looked into the sun and said, "What's on your mind?"
Whee, Ha, lookatiaa, lookatiaa, sun shining all the time (sun shining all the time)
She picked up the fan and let the trailer go
She only likes it when it's hot. Doesn't like it when it's cold

When you really think about it, love is truly powerful
the undeniable force that makes it magnetic
and you can't explain it, you do what you do
can't noboday play the fool like (something something something?)

Barely in love (repeat) (chorus)
