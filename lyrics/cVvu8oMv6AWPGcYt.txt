We met, we spoke, you kissed me
Never thought you ever would
Confused, I should be careful
But it felt so good
Had a lot of heartache in the past
I'm afraid of walking on the grass
Maybe this is happening to fast
Should I be running for protection?
I'm mad about ya
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Baby keep it coming
I don't want it to end
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Oh what you doing baby do it again
Ready for an intimate connection
Ready for an intimate connection
Be my intimate connection
I lie awake
And wonder if
I'm better of alone
My minds made up
And now I'm reaching for the phone
Now I'm reaching, now, now, now
Had a lot of heartache in the past
I'm afraid of walking on the grass
Maybe this is happening to fast
Should I be running for protection?
I'm mad about ya
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Baby keep it coming
I don't want it to end
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Oh what you doing baby do it again
Ready for an intimate connection
I'm in love
Ready for an intimate connection
I'm in love
Be my intimate connection
Ready for an intimate
Ready for an intimate
Ready, ready for an intimate connection
Ready for an intimate connection
Be my intimate connection
Ready for an intimate connection
I'm mad about ya
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Baby keep it coming
I don't want it to end
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Oh what you doing baby do it again
Ready for an intimate connection
I'm in love
Ready for an intimate connection
Be my intimate connection
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Baby keep it coming
I don't want it to end
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Oh what you doing baby do it again
Ready for an intimate connection
Ready for an intimate connection
Be my intimate connection
