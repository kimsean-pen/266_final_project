See the valley deep
You're like water at the foothills
Got you running like a stream
You know there's too much world to see still
But come home safe
Come home safe
Any given day
Any given night
You went running out the gate
No you never lost your place
You never left my mind
Won't you come home safe
The door is always open wide
I'm talking visionary
The higher the climb
The deeper the desire
And there's nothing like hope to carry
A hundred million miles to touch the holy fire
Just come home safe
Come home safe
Any given day
Any given night
You went running out the gate
No you never lost your place
You never left my mind
So won't you come home safe
The door is always open wide

All around the world
Around the world and back
Touch the greatest lights with everything you have
Just come home safe
Just come home safe
Any given day
Any given night
You went running out the gate
No you never lost your place
You never left my mind
Just come home safe
The door is open
Open wide
Come home safe
The door is open
Open wide
