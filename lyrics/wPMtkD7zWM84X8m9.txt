Woah now
Me deh pon di go now
Tell dem watch it ina traffic, Koffee nuh slow down
Ina mi zone
Alto to Baritone
Soon dem a go see seh is a Queen deh pon di Throne

Me nu waste time with the music
In yuh ears like any q-tip
Used to Facetime with the Blues
Til Reggae bassline mek me lose it
A nu monopoly
Walshy build the riddim, put da song ya pon it
Now dem all up on me
Say dem badder dan me
So me kill dem and study dem anatomy
Dem nuh understand me
But dem
Seh dem loving the flow now
When them see me all over the media
And them hear me deh pon Wikipedia
Used to fast, now me all a get speedier
I a born storm
Fyah cyah calm
Shotter than a copper, what a Bam Bam
Tell Jenella, Cinderella, John, Tom
Say a prayer, get a choir ensemble

Woah now
Me deh pon di go now
Tell dem watch it ina traffic, Koffee nuh slow down
Ina mi zone
Alto to Baritone
Soon dem a go see seh is a Queen deh pon di Throne

Warning dem!
5 Star seh we warning dem!
Ina night, ina morning
Jah cover we like a awning den
March out and we storm in
And one people we forming
'Cause the disparity alarming
Regarding the place wa we born in, woie!
Folks nu waa fi hear a next shot
Rather Koffee tear a next track
Give it to them like a crusade
Tell them we deh pon a new wave
Unu nuh see nutn yet tho
Mi come wid di fyah, get low!
Lyrics put your very welfare pon the death row
Pon the wet floor!

Woah now
Me deh pon di go now
Tell dem watch it ina traffic, Koffee nuh slow down
Ina mi zone
Alto to Baritone
Soon dem a go see seh is a Queen deh pon di Throne

Check check check, new Day
Better put the Koffee pon yuh checklist
Nobody never did expect this
Now dem watching me, watching me like Netflix
Na leave them ina silence
Dem a wait pon me fi bring the vibes
Jamaican people, leave the violence!
Cya read, well read between the lines!
Well mi hear seh the gun dem pile a Bay
And dem have dem ina wide array
How them reach Spanish Town and all Mobay
Have them all a spray
While a child a play
Tell some police da effort deh na go work
Protect the peace and Lowe the dawta skirt!
Needlessly display them armor
Then a drape mi brother
Bwoy drape yuh father shirt!

Woah now
Me deh pon di go now
Tell dem watch it ina traffic, Koffee nuh slow down
Ina mi zone
Alto to Baritone
Soon dem a go see seh is a Queen deh pon di Throne
