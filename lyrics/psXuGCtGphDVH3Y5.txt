Listen, honey, to every word I say
I know that you don't trust me
But I'm better than the stories about me
Everybody messed it up someday
Ain't got no rhyme or reason
All I know is I'm yours, yours, yours
With every season

Baby girl, with the broken smile
Would you mind if I stayed a while?
And if you're bored I can light your fire
If that's what you want, if that's what you want
I admit that I've done some wrong
But those wrongs helped me write this song
And through it all I figured out where I belong

Right by your side, right by your side

They say that hearts don't lie
The head might try but it won't be right
You tell me what you feel inside
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

Listen, honey, to every word I say
I know that you don't trust me
But I'm better than the stories about me
Everybody messed it up someday
Ain't got no rhyme or reason
All I know is I'm yours, yours, yours
With every season

Baby girl, let your hair hang down
And if we're lost, baby let's get found
And with the words flipping upside down
Let's make it right, let's make it right
They say that hearts don't lie
The head might try but it won't be right
You tell me what you feel inside
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

Listen, honey, to every word I say
I know that you don't trust me
But I'm better than the stories about me
Everybody messed it up someday
Ain't got no rhyme or reason
All I know is I'm yours, yours, yours
With every season
Yours, yours, yours
With every season

Winter, summer, spring, or fall
I'll be on the line when you fall you call
Winter, summer, spring, or fall
I'll be on the line when you fall you call
Winter, summer, spring, or fall
I'll be on the line when you fall you call

Listen, honey, to every word I say
I know that you don't trust me
But I'm better than the stories about me
Everybody messed it up someday
Ain't got no rhyme or reason
All I know is I'm yours, yours, yours, with every season
