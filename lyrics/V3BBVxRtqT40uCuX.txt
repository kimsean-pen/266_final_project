I wanna hold em like they do in Texas Please
Fold em let em hit me raise it baby stay with me
Love the game intuition play the cards with spades to start
And after he's been hooked I'll play the one that's on his heart

Oh o-oh oh oh o-oh oh
I'll get him hot, and show him what I've got
Oh o-oh oh oh o-oh oh whoaa oh
I'll get him hot, and show him what I've got

Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(She's got to love nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(She's got to love nobody)

P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face

I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be
A little gambling is fun when you're with me
Russian Roulette is not the same without a gun
And baby when it's love if it ain't rough it isn't fun

Oh o-oh oh oh o-oh oh
I'll get him hot, and show him what I've got
Oh o-oh oh oh o-oh oh whoaa oh
I'll get him hot, and show him what I've got

Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(She's got to love nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(She's got to love nobody)

I won't tell you that I love you
Kiss or hug you
Cause I'm bluffin' with my muffin
I'm not lying I'm just stunnin' with my love-glue-gunning

Just like a chick in the casino
Take your bank before I pay you out
I promise this, promise this
Check this hand cause I am marvelous

I'm marvelous, I'm marvelous
I'm marvelous so marvelous
She's got to love nobody
Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
She's got to love nobody
