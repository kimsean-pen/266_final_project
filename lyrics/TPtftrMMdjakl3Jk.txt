You go where the wind blows
Destroying everyone on your path
I'm done feeding your ego
Forgetting everything that we had

Funny how history ends in an instant
How something so close can end up so distant

Dancing on the line
Of the great divide
Wash my hands, turn my back
I don't need the memories we had
I'm leaving you behind
Across the great divide

Good luck when you wake up
And realize all that you've lost
Shining lies are what you made of
I hope it worths the price that it costs

Funny how history ends in an instant
How something so close can end up so distant

Dancing on the line
Of the great divide
Wash my hands, turn my back
I don't need the memories we had
I'm leaving you behind
Across the great divide

I let you go, so let me go
Let us go
I let you, I let you
I let you go, oh

Dancing on the line
Of the great divide
Wash my hands, turn my back
I don't need the memories we had
I'm leaving you behind
Across the great divide
The great divide
Hey, yeah
