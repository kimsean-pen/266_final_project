I've got a splitting headache
Chew aspirin for the pain
I'm on my wagon rolling
Like a freight train
Another darkest day
Always in harms way
Got a new bruise swelling
Beaten by the bottle

So beautiful and so strange
Scatter all the pieces
The puzzle will remain the same
So hideous, so deranged
Crawling through the tunnels
Lost inside the maze

Tremble like an earthquake
Weight shifts inside me
The crucifix I'm dragging
Nailed to the hard way
They wont forget me
The walls are bloodstained
As my will unravels
Broken like a bottle

So beautiful and so strange
Scatter all the pieces
The puzzle will remain the same
So hideous, so deranged
Crawling through the tunnels
Lost inside the maze

So beautiful and so strange
Dropping little pebbles
Lost inside of this head space
So hideous so deranged
Winding through the tunnels
Again lost inside of

Lost inside of me
Lost inside of me

You stole the matches
You lit the fuse
You let the boiler swell
I tied the noose on you

So beautiful and so strange
Scatter all the pieces
The puzzle will remain the same
So hideous, so deranged
Crawling through the tunnels
Lost inside the maze

So beautiful
(You we're beautiful)
And so strange
(But not as strange as me)
So hideous
(Like the voice inside me)
So deranged
Locked inside my cage

Lost inside of me
Lost inside of
Locked inside of me
Locked inside of
