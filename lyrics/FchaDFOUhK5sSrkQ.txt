Drink seltzer smoke weed when you can't sleep.
Think about shooting birds,
everyone has got a violent streak.
I think my face looks like glass,
but my body feels plastic.

Melt me into a bottle.
I wish that I was a baby sucking on myself.
Boogie down to the water.
I thought that maybe
I could be the lake's daughter.
Because I float like an infant inside of it,
weightless in the lake
It's got nothing to take from me.

I feel like a child
hiding behind your tombstone.
But the graveyard's not lonely.
Plus, who doesn't love a good cemetery?

I feel like a fetus.
Because my eyes are not open,
and I don't have fingernails.
Can't claw my way out of anyone, or anything.

Hold me under the water,
My lungs are filling with plankton.
But the lake is not lonely,
No need for you to come with me.
