Leopard garden
walk backwards
like you, with me, before.
Hot dog let's play games,
you catch me
I catch you
no love can cut our knife in two.
Somewhere in space,
someone else plays our game.
Inflatable face,
chameleon ways to reach you.
Alien days,
its the longest day till i seen you.
Psychic way,
wait till i heal you.

(healing humming melody)

No love,
no love,
no love,
can cut our knife in two.
No love,
no love,
no love,
can cut our knife in two.
No love,
no love,
no love,
can cut our knife in two.
No love,
no love,
no love,
can cut our knife in two.
And it's a runaround runaround,
And it's a runaround runaround,
And it's a runaround runaround,
And it's a runaround runaround,
And it's a runaround runaround,
And it's a runaround runaround,
And it's a runaround runaround,
And it's a runaround runaround,
No love,
no love,
no love,
can cut our knife in two.
No love,
no love,
no love,
can cut our knife in two.
No love,
no love,
no love,
can cut our knife in two.
No love,
no love,
no love,
can cut our knife in two. see less
