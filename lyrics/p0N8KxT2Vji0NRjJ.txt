How can you love someone like me
How can you touch
Make myself bleed
How can you love someone like me
How can you touch
Make myself bleed

The pain won't pass away
I take the way I feel to put you down

How can you love someone like me
How can you touch
Make myself bleed
How can you love someone like me
How can you touch
Make myself bleed

How can you love someone like me
How can you touch
Make myself bleed
How can you love someone like me
How can you touch
Make myself bleed
