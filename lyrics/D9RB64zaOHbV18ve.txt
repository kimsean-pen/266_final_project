I miss you like a past life
I can't remember if
You were ever mine to miss

I miss you like we both died
Our time together, a star-crossed endeavor

My head is an unmade bed
Abandoned arms and legs and intimate things
Finding their way into these twisted sheets
I need a maid or another mother
More than the strain of an absent lover

My head is an empty bed
Just the thought of being seen is more than I can take
I never met a mirror that I couldn't break

I'll miss you in the next life
