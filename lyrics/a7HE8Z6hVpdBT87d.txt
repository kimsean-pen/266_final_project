Declining
All color fading
Defining
Time coming for me
Rescinding
My inspiration
Receding consciousness

Back in the day, I can recall that
My thoughts were unclouded and sage
There was no black
Staining the walls of my memories
Now there's a haze pushing me sideways
And leaving me nothing to gain
Taking me back
Locking me cold in disparity

Where was I meant to be?
I feel I'm lost in a dream
Long for the day I can be myself

When I'm free
When my sun has set
Released my soul forever
I'll have no regret
To be free
I'll exist again
No more lost endeavors
Nothing to contend
When I'm free

Color declines all that defines me
Is falling away, far behind
Nothing to keep me with the time
The here and now

Where am I meant to be?
I feel I'm lost in a dream
Yearning again only to be myself

When I'm free
When my sun has set
Released my soul forever
I'll have no regret
To be free
I'll exist again
No more lost endeavors
Nothing to contend
When I'm free

(Cure me, free me, help me, see me
No more worry, no more losing)

Time is just a concept
And always the first thing to fade
(No more heartache, no misery)
Agony and weakness
Nothing we can never evade
(No more worry, no agony)
Years are cruel, they break us
Bringing on decay and despair (we despair)
(No more heartache, no despairing)
Awareness and perception
Something we can never repair (no repair)
(No more worry, no repairing)

Freedom for me is all I'm really wanting, needing
Give me power to break out
I can't hold on for any longer
My time has come to end it all

No one to blame
Fate's only random
It's nothing we'll ever explain
So it remains

Where was I meant to be?
I feel I'm lost in a dream
Long for the day I can be myself
Free
When will I be unleashed?
It's not the way it should be
Yearning again only to be myself

(Unleash my consciousness!)

When I'm free
When my sun has set
Released my soul forever
I'll have no regret
To be free
I'll exist again
No more lost endeavors
Nothing to contend
When I'm free
