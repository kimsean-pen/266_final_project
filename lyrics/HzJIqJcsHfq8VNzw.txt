I was at a funeral the day I realized
I wanted to spend my life with you
Sitting down on the steps at the
Old post office
The flag was flying at half-mast
And I was thinking 'bout how
Everyone is dying
And maybe it's time to live
I don't know where we're going
I don't know what we'll do
Walked in to the Thrif-tee
Saw the man with the hollow eyes
Who didn't give me all my change
But it didn't bother me this time
'cause I know I've only got
This moment
And it's good
I went to the gas station
Old woman honked her horn
Waiting for me to fix her car
I don't know where we're going
I don't know what we'll do
Laying in bed tonight I was thinking
And listening to all the dogs
And the sirens and the shots
And how a careful man tries
To dodge the bullets
While a happy man takes a walk
And maybe it's time to live
