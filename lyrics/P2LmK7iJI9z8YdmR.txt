Come over here, babe it ain't that bad
I don't claim to understand the troubles that you've had
But the dogs you say they fed you to lay their muzzles in your lap
And the lions that they led you to lie down and take a nap
Are the ones you fear are wind and air? And I love you without measure
Seems we can be happy now be it better late than never

Sweetheart come, sweetheart come
Sweetheart come, sweetheart come
Sweetheart come, sweetheart come
Sweetheart come, sweetheart come
Sweetheart come, sweetheart come
Sweetheart come, sweetheart come
Sweetheart come, sweetheart come to me

The burdens that you carry now well they're not of your creation
So let's not weep for their evil deeds but for their lack of imagination
Today's the time for courage, babe, tomorrow can be for forgiving
If he touches you again with his stupid hands his life won't be worth living

Sweetheart come, sweetheart come
Sweetheart come, sweetheart come
Sweetheart come, sweetheart come
Sweetheart come, sweetheart come
Sweetheart come, sweetheart come
Sweetheart come, sweetheart come
Sweetheart come, sweetheart come to me

Walk with me now under the stars it's a clear and easy pleasure
And be happy in my company for I love you without measure
Walk with me now under the stars, it's a safe and easy pleasure
It seems we can be happy now, it's late but it ain't never
It's late but it ain't never, it's late but it ain't never
