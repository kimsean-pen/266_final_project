I know you moved onto someone new
Hope life is beautiful
You were the life of me to find my truth
I just wanna say, thank you

Leaving to find my soul, told her I had to go
And I know it ain't pretty when our hearts get broke
Too young to feel this old, watching us both turn cold
Oh, I know it ain't pretty when two hearts get broke

Yeah, I know it ain't pretty when two hearts get broke

I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
These days, these days

Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
These days, these days

Three years of ups and downs, nothing to show for it now
And I know it ain't pretty when the fire burns out
Calling me when I'm drunk, remind me of what I've done
And I know it ain't pretty when you're trying to move on, yeah

I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
These days, these days

Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
To these days, these days, uh

Cigarettes in the ash tray, reminiscing on those past days
I thought you'd end up with my last name, but that changed

And I travelled around the world, think where you living at now?
I heard you moved to Austin, got a new apartment and settled down
And every once in a while I start texting
Write a paragraph, but then I delete the message

Think 'bout you like a past time
I could cry you a river, get you baptised or
I wasn't ready to act right
Used to always think I'd get you back, right

They say that things fall apart (Yeah)
We were gonna move to Brooklyn, you were gonna study Art
Love is just a tool to remind us who we are
And that we are not alone, and we're walking in the dark

I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days
