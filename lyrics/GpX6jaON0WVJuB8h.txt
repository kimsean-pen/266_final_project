I'm jealous of the rain
That falls upon your skin
It's closer than my hands have been
I'm jealous of the rain
I'm jealous of the wind
That ripples through your clothes
It's closer than your shadow
Oh, I'm jealous of the wind, cause

cause I wished you the best of
All this world could give
And I told you when you left me
There's nothing to forgive
I always thought you'd come back, tell me all you found was
Heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way
You're happy without me

it's hard for me to say
you're jealous of the way
jealous of the way
it's hard for me to say
oooooh I'm jealous of the way
jealous of the way
woooooooh oooh oooh
it's hard for me to say

woooooh i'm jealous of the way hey
woooooh ooooh ooh
i'm jealous of the way
You're happy without me
you're happy without me
you're happy without me
