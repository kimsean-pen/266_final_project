Yo, BMT, I'm on a big man ting
I ain't going into clubs without my big hand ting
Got eleven on my finger that's a big man ring
Yeah I got a big bag, no bin man ting
See me jumping in the Porsches with them big back tings
All I really know for sure is I won't kiss that ting
Big man ting, my niggas tryna bring straps in
See them in some big jackets on some Big Shaq ting

BMT, my Rollie that's a prezzie, not a GMT
I'm rolling with my black youngsters they're not CMG
I'm at the block or at the top that's where you're seeing me
My nigga Stro, serving 3 on 3's out that GLE
My mummy told me that they're playing me on the BBC
My youngens always doing shootings on a wheelie spree
So all they really got is dirt bikes like DBE
My teacher was a bitch, she never did believe in me
But now she's looking lost
'Cause her whole year's wages; that's my booking cost
Man it feels like it's been ages since I cooked a block
But that's 'cause I let young niggas jugg it off, we're seeing them
Turning 18 I went to adult jail, I'm seeing men
Going in a cell for a 1 on 1 and there's 3 of them
Still I got it cracking, I'm never feeling wet
Got a brick off my akhi Khaled, nigga we the best

Yo, BMT, I'm on a big man ting
I ain't going into clubs without my big hand ting
Got eleven on my finger that's a big man ring
Yeah I got a big bag, no bin man ting
See me jumping in the Porsches with them big back tings
All I really know for sure is I won't kiss that ting
Big man ting, my niggas tryna bring straps in
See them in some big jackets on some Big Shaq ting

Yo big man ting, I'm on some big man stuff
You ain't never bought no bricks
'Cause that's some big man grub
I'm in the G-Wagon, vanishing, big man trap
All my niggas are attracting is them big back sluts
Yo I'm jiggy jiggy with it, I'm busy busy with it
My nigga he gets lizzy with it, now we're on a prison visit
Bumbaclart, man has some pretty girls scratching up my foreign car
Yo that's a problem darg
But yo, big man ting
All I'm hearing these days is can you bring man in
I was trapping all night and you weren't with that ting
You was outside raving on some wingman ting
Little silly pricks, and I got pretty chicks tryna send me images
Tryna make me finish with the missus
But I ain't gonna finish with the missus she's the realest
Just come and buss it open once you're finished with the dishes

Yo, BMT, I'm on a big man ting
I ain't going into clubs without my big hand ting
Got eleven on my finger that's a big man ring
Yeah I got a big bag, no bin man ting
See me jumping in the Porsches with them big back tings
All I really know for sure is I won't kiss that ting
Big man ting, my niggas tryna bring straps in
See them in some big jackets on some Big Shaq ting
