Your last hope it echoes
Screaming woah
But come down, the first blow
It sounds like oh
It can't be black and white
We're on the other side tonight
We break free, we break free
From pain, unite
And look into my eyes
A love overdue

Burn our names under the stars
And we'll live until the sky gives up
Watch our flame light up the dark
They won't find us in the book of love

A whole new dimension is waiting
Surrender intentions and watch you blow
So leave the world behind and listen to your heart
It's time to break free, to break free
So list your life, our love is on the line
Forever with you

Burn our names under the stars
And we'll live until the sky gives up
Watch our flame light up the dark
They won't find us in the book of love
Woah
And we'll live until the sky gives up
Woah
They won't find us in the book of love

(It's out of our control)
(So give in to the chemicals)
It's out of our control
If you don't try you'll never know
So give in to the chemicals
It's never too late
They're only testing our faith
No it's never too late

Burn our name under the stars
And we'll live until the sky gives up
Watch our flame light up the dark
They won't find us in the book of love

And we'll live until the sky gives up
They won't find us in the book of love
