She took me in and fed me kindly
But who is this tramp sat in front of me?
She smiled and said, "Jilly I be!"
Then she shouted her name into the street
I told her I was missing but she said, "Where have you been?
How can you lose a place, my friend, if it was never real?"
I said I feel like I have fallen asleep
Like this is all just a part of a wicked dream
When I wake up, you'll see what I mean
I'm not meant to be stuck in this poverty
She said, "I can see infinity glint in every gleam
You see the light as would a bug who can't pass through a screen!"

Raise your voice, Joyce
Raise your voice, Joyce
Raise your voice, Joyce
Raise your voice, Joyce
She paid her way
She's not a slave
Joyce Tops
I'm okay

She paid her way (Raise your voice)
She's not a slave (Raise your voice)
Joyce Tops
Raise your voice, Joyce
I'm okay (Raise your voice, Joyce)

Raise your voice, Joyce
Raise your voice, Joyce
Raise your voice, Joyce
Raise your voice, Joyce

I still think I'd like to leave
I'm soiled and my colleagues are waiting for me
If I beg, I bet they'll let me back in
Now would you kindly let me out of this bin?
She said, "Take you opportunities and shove them up your ear
Listen to the thunder boy, it calls for you to hear!"
Then, moldered in my suit and tie
In the filth when I started to cry
She knocked the glasses right off of my eyes
She is the stain that will never come dry!
She said, "Scream at me oh stirring child, scream your little scream
In the morning world you are the only you who's ever been
There is another history behind the one you've seen
So weep until there's nothing left to weep and then be free!"

Raise your voice, Joyce
Raise your voice, Joyce
Raise your voice, Joyce
Raise your voice, Joyce
Joyce, Joyce
Raise your voice, Joyce
Raise your voice, Joyce

She paid her way (Raise your voice)
She's not a slave (Raise your voice)
Joyce Tops
I'm okay
Raise your voice
Raise your voice
Raise your voice, Joyce
Raise your voice

I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay
