Pay no attention
To the man behind the curtain
He's a brainless, heartless, coward
With no power
That's just another trick of his
He ain't no wiz so don't feed his fire

Jump in my balloon
I'll take you higher
Take you somewhere over the rainbow
Get your ticket to the show
Heels clicking, here we go
Cause you already know

There's no place like (home)
There's no place like (home)
There's no place like (home)
There's no place like
(We're straight out of Oz, there's no place like)
There's no place like home

Is where the heart is
Some brainiacs will tell you home is where your house and car is
But if you're brave enough to love the ones you hate the hardest
You might find (home)
You might find (home)
Cause sometimes

Home is where your deepest scar is
Society will try to cast you where they think your part is
Give awards and accolades to what they think a star is
But go find your (home)
Go find your (home)

Pay no attention
To the lies they try to feed ya
It's a wicked, twisted fable
He's not stable
It's just another box of tricks
Some crock of shit
And good dreams go
Wasted
Hungry for the fame
Don't let them taste it
He's been stealin' dreams
9 to 5, Monday to Friday
Imma tell the story my way
Cause the only way home ain't on this yellow brick highway

There's no place like (home)
There's no place like (home)
There's no place like (home)
There's no place like
(We're straight out of Oz)

And if you're lost out there
In the night, wishing on stars
Wonderin' who you are
Just know that you're never alone
And there's no place like home

And we gon' fight and we gon' cry
And I'm gon' fight for you until I die
Right there is right where you belong
And there's no place like home

Pay no attention
To the man who'll try to change ya
He's a dark, familiar, stranger
But that's a danger
The storm is strong
But it won't be long
And no matter where you roam
There's no place like
Home
