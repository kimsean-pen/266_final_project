Might remember all the books I never read
Might remember all the looks I never said
I'm not ready
I'm not ready

Don't forget that you're not like the other kids
Don't forget that doesn't matter what you did
I'm not ready
I'm not
No

Hey Hercules
It don't work for me
Hey Hercules
I know your tricks

So don't forget that you didn't always turn your back
Don't forget that you are laying your own track
I'm not ready
I'm not ready
Ooh

Maybe someday I will meet her on the way
Maybe someday she will hear the words I say
I'm not ready
I'm not ready

Hey Hercules
It don't work for me
Hey Hercules
I know your tricks
I know your tricks

Oh it's just like
That one dance

Hey Hercules
It don't work for me
Hey Hercules
I know your tricks
I know your
Hey
Aaahhh
