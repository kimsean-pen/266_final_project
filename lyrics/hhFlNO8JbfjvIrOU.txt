If life was a gun, with only one bullet
And you were the one to walk right through it
Look up at the sun, and shout
The abyss within, the abyss without

Put the black in my heart, put the black in my soul
These things are made to be let go
Put the black in my heart, put the black in my soul

Put the black in my heart, put the black in my soul
These things are meant to be let go
Put the black in my heart, put the black in my soul

It's in my mind, it's in my mind after all
Nothing but time, nothing but time is my fault
I'm floating between the white and black
The abyss within, the abyss without

Put the black in my heart, put the black in my soul
These things are meant to be let go
Put the black in my heart, put the black in my soul

Put the black in my heart, put the black in my soul
These things are meant to be let go
Put the black in my heart, put the black in my soul

Put the black in my heart, put the black in my soul
These things are meant to be let go
Put the black in my heart, put the black in my soul

Put the black in my heart, put the black in my soul
These things are meant to be let go
Put the black in my heart, put the black in my soul
