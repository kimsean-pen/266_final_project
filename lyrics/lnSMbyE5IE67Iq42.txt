How could she ever fool around?
Don't know what she was thinking 'bout?
While you were giving love
She let you down

Boy I know that you want to be alone
'Cause she broke your heart and she sent you home
And you're wondering why
She was so cold

Well then they lie, they have to lie again
'Cause the lying never ends, so

Truthfully, even if you don't believe
You will always hear the truth, come from me
Baby, I'll never lie and you're the reason why
I will always tell the truth, 'cause the truth resides in me

Boy I know it's a crying shame
Baby no no you shouldn't blame
Yourself for what she did
She was insane

Maybe where you go I will go
Whatever makes you happy, let me know
My heart will be right there
To console you

Maybe the lies will never begin
I will be your lover, your best friend, so

Truthfully, even if you don't believe
You will always hear the truth, come from me
Baby, I'll never lie and you're the reason why
I will always tell the truth, 'cause the truth resides in me

I will never say goodbye
And I don't want to see you cry
God only knows I love you
But it's written in my eyes

You are the only one for me
There's no way I could ever leave
I would never, no never never lie to you
Truthfully

Truthfully, even if you don't believe
You will always hear the truth, come from me
I'll never lie and you're the reason why
I will always tell the truth, 'cause the truth resides in me
