Heaven is all gone
Empty in my arms You wanna see us be nothing nothing
Where do we belong?
We have to stay strong
We are an army of used up freaks

Standing on the battleground
Standing on the front
Can't see my way out
Standing on the pinnacle
Standing on the sun
Can't see my way out

One by one we turn our hands to guns
One by one they fall down

Kept down so long
Sick of living in the middle
If you stand for nothing
You'll fall for anything
Our time is now
We won't stand down
Wake up scream out
We are the chosen ones

Standing on the battleground
Standing on the front
Can't see my way out
Standing on the pinnacle
Standing on the sun
Can't see my way out

One by one we turn our hands to guns
One by one they fall down (they fall down)
One by one they fall down

Standing on the battleground
Standing on the front
Can't see my way out
Standing on the pinnacle
Standing on the sun
Can't see my way out

One by one we turn our hands to guns
One by one they fall down

One by one they fall down
One by one they fall down
One by one they fall down

One by one they fall down
One by one they fall down
One by one they fall down
