Call back the CAPCOM
Tick off the time bomb
Let felicity fly!

Armor the air lock
Blanket the bed rock
And kiss the planet goodbye!

Dear God, I was terribly lost
When the galaxies crossed
And the sun went dark
But dear God, you're the only North Star
I would follow this far

Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
(Through the galaxies)
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da

Fight back the flight deck
Bring on the break neck
Cue the solar eclipse!

Summit the sunset
Dub-tail the dragnet
And blow your backbone to bits

Dear God, I was terribly lost
When the galaxies crossed
And the sun went dark
But dear God, you're the only North Star
I would follow this far

Oh telescope
Keep an eye on my only hope
Lest I blink and get swept off the narrow road
Hercules, you've got nothing to say to me
'Cause you're not the blinding light that I need
For He is the saving grace of the galaxies!
(Galaxies, galaxies, galaxies, galaxies)
He is the saving grace of the galaxies

Dear God, I was terribly lost
When the galaxies crossed
And the sun went dark

But Dear God, you're the only North Star
I would follow this far!

(I would follow this far!)
