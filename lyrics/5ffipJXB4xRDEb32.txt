Your imagination gets so twisted when you
Think you've seen my worst
But I have an instinct that can never be reversed
My vengeance is a curse

I want to watch you bleed
You're the crime but I'm the scene

Back against the wall so
It's kill or be killed
no other choice then blood's gonna spill
Back against the wall so
Forget or forgive
But after all this I never will

Don't be ashamed of all the monsters in your head
All of us are
Sick! Sick! All of us are Sick!
Sick! Sick! All of us are Sick!

I want to watch you bleed
You're the crime but I'm the scene

Back against the wall so
It's kill or be killed
No other choice then blood's gonna spill
Back against the wall so
Forget or forgive
But after all this I never will

Sick. Sick. All of us are sick.
Sick. Sick. All of us are
Sick! Sick! All of us are Sick!
Sick! Sick! All of us are Sick!

My sanity slid far from me
Revoked by rage it's driven me insane

Back against the wall so
It's kill or be killed
No other choice then blood's gonna spill
Back against the wall so
Forget or forgive
But after all this I never will
Back against the wall so
It's kill or be killed
No other choice then blood's gonna spill
Back against the wall so
Forget or forgive
But after all this I never will
Sick! Sick! All of us are Sick!
Sick! Sick! All of us are Sick!
