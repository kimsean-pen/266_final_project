Anoint my head anoint my feet
Send your angels raining down
Here on the battle ground
For your glory
We're taking territory
Fighting unseen enemies
Like never before
We're Waging War

I'm tired of principalities
Messing with me
(Waging war)
I'm tired of the devil
Stealing from me
(Waging war)
I promise he won't get
One more thing
(Waging war)
I'm taking it back
Taking territory
(Waging war)
I'm ready for the battle
I'm ready to win
(Waging war)
My weapon of power
He lives within
(Waging war)
I can't be defeated
The enemy's gotta flee
(waging war)
I'm taking it back
Taking territory

Going into battle

Going into battle
Going into battle

Be my sword
Be my shield
As we claim the victory
Over the enemy
In your name
Your rule and rain

Never being defeated anymore

We're waging war
Be my sword

Be my shield

As we claim the victory
Over the enemy

In Your Name
Your rule and reign
Never being defeated anymore
We're waging war
I'm tired of principalities
Messing with me

(Waging war)
I'm tired of the devil

Stealing from me

(Waging war)
I promise he won't get
Get one more thing

(Waging war)
I'm taking it back

Taking territory

(Waging war)
I'm ready for the battle
I'm ready to win
(Waging war)
My weapon of power
He lives within
(Waging war)
I can't be defeated
The enemy has gotta flee
(waging war)
I'm taking it back
Taking territory
Going into battle
Going into battle
Going into battle
Send your fire
Send your fire
Fire by night
Cloud by day
A strong tower
Send the latter rain
Lion of Judah
Lord, God
Mighty In battle
Since you did it back then
We know you'll do it again
Fire by night
Cloud by day
A strong tower
Send the latter rain
Lion of Judah
Lord, God
Mighty In battle
Since you did it back then
We know you'll do it again
We're going into battle
We're going into battle
We're going into battle
Fire by night
Cloud by day
A strong tower
Send the latter rain
Lion of Judah
Lord, God
Mighty In battle
Since you did it back then
We know you'll do it again
Fire by night
Cloud by day
A strong tower
Send the latter rain
Lion of Judah
Lord, God
Mighty In battle
Since you did it back then
We know you'll do it again
So we're waging war
I'm tired of principalities
Messing with me
(Like never before) (Waging war)
I'm tired of the devil
Stealing from me
(Waging war)
I promise he won't get
Get one more thing
(Waging war)
I'm taking it back
Taking territory (I'm taking it back)
(Waging war) (I'm taking it back)
I'm ready for the battle
I'm ready to win
(Waging war)
My weapon of power
He lives within
(Waging war)
I can't be defeated
The enemy has gotta flee
(waging war)
I'm taking it back (We're waging)
Taking territory (We're waging)
We're waging war oh,
Waging War!
