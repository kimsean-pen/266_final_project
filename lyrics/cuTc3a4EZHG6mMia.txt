You're like a flower
That can't hide it's fragrance
We sense you where you go
You never chose the easy way
I don't know where you get your strength from
It's always been that way with you
Oh, but you're of ruby gold
Now they wanna eat you whole

Everybody wants to be you, do it like you do it cause you
Everybody wants to be you, chew it like you chew it
Cause you
You're too good to be true
That's why
Oh, they wanna have your shine
They think you got a price

You're an oasis
You're connected to a spring
You're ever flowing
You're the open source and they use you
Til you're no use to them

Oh, but you're of ruby gold
Now they wanna eat you whole
Oh baby you're a star
Give them all you got

Everybody wants to be you, do it like you do it
Cause you, everybody wants to be you
Chew it like you chew it

You hold the secret everybody wants to own
They need it, they ask you what you smoke
They wanna smoke it, cause they're desperate
To look at the world through your eyes
They think they need to get high to love
And get love

Everybody wants to be you
You feed my soul, let me grow and grow, where would I be without you
