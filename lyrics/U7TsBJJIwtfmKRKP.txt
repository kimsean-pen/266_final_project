Do you remember when the walls fell
Do you remember the sound that the door made when you closed it on me
Do you know that I went down to the ground
Landed on both my broken hearted knees

I didn't even cry
Because pieces of me had already died

I'm a ghost
Haunting these halls
Climbing up walls that I never knew were there
And I'm lost
Broken down the middle of my heart, heart
I'm broken down the middle of my heart, heart, heart

You know you make me a ghost
You make me a ghost

I'm an invisible disaster
I keep trying to walk but my feet don't find the solid ground
It's like living in a bad dream
I keep trying to scream but my tongue has finally lost its sound

I've got to say goodbye
To the pieces of me that have already died

I'm a ghost
Haunting these halls
Climbing these walls that I never knew were there
And I'm lost
Broken down the middle of my heart, heart
I'm broken down the middle of my heart, heart, heart

You know you make me a ghost
Oh you make me a ghost
You make me a ghost
(you take the breath all away from me, you take it away)
You make me a ghost

I don't cry
I don't try anymore

And I'm lost
Broken down the middle of my heart, heart
I'm broken down the middle

I'm a ghost
Haunting these halls
Climbing up walls that I never knew were there
And I'm lost
Broken down the middle of my heart, heart
I'm broken down the middle of my heart, heart, heart

You know you make me a ghost
You know you make me a ghost
