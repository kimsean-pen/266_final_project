I know these things have passed you by
I know it's tough to even try
It's such a different kind of scene
I know you don't know what I mean

Yeah, well, I tried to tell you before
I know all you want is more
I'll always tell you different stuff
No matter what, won't be enough

I figure, it'll be cool sometime
After I've cooked everyone I find
I can only take it to that certain place
It's just not cool, look at your face

Whenever you get in my face
There's something strange I start to taste

Hold back, hold back, hold back
Hold back, hold back, hold back

It's all restrain I'm gettin' these days
Is it okay or am I out of place?

So every time you see me now
You psyche for a minute 'til you remember how
I crawl here inside in mind with muck
You stopped smiling, remember how everything sucked?

Dancing around what I could say
'Cause I just can't live that way
Hold back, that's not enough to stay

Hold back, hold back, hold back
Hold back, hold back, hold back
Hold back, hold back, hold back
Hold back, hold back, hold back
