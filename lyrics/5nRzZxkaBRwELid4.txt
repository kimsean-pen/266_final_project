Celebrate, everybody, cele-brate
Celebrate, oh everybody, everybody celebrate

Sitting in my mom's old minivan
Radio up, how you color me bad
Living up the days like they're never gonna change
It didn't stay like that
I hate to say it's been too long
Old school days, I miss those old school songs

This is my throw, this is my throwback song
It's just like the ones, the ones that we used to know
This is that music that makes me better
This is the feel that turns me on
Oh everybody's got that window down
Summertime, turn it up, sing-a-long

So...
Celebrate,
Everybody, cele-brate
Celebrate,
Oh everybody, everybody celebrate

Lying in my bed going what if, what if
Well what if I just don't care?
We all got the same hearts
Beat beat beat beat beating
Let me take you there
You do you, I'll do me
I just miss the way we used to sing

This is my throw, this is my throwback song
It's just like the ones, the ones that we used to know
This is that music that makes me better
This is the feel that turns me on
Oh everybody's got that window down
Summertime, turn it up, sing-a-long

So, so...
Celebrate,
Everybody, cele-brate
Celebrate,
Oh everybody, everybody celebrate

Celebrate,
Everybody, cele-brate
Celebrate,
Oh everybody, everybody celebrate

In the basement, after dark
Truth or dare with, Jimmy Clark (who?)
In the basement, after dark
Truth or dare with, Jimmy Clark
Celebrate, everybody, cele-brate
Celebrate, oh everybody, everybody celebrate

This is my throw, this is my throwback song
It's just like the ones, the ones that we used to know
This is that music that makes me better
This is the feel that turns me on
Oh everybody's got that window down
Summertime, turn it up, sing-a-long

So, so...
Celebrate,
Everybody, cele-brate
Celebrate,
Oh everybody, everybody celebrate

Celebrate,
Everybody, cele-brate
Celebrate,
Oh everybody, everybody celebrate

Celebrate,
Everybody, cele-brate
Celebrate,
Oh everybody, everybody celebrate
