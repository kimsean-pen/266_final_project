Yeah, I'm preaching on this one
If they become violent, don't expect us to remain silent

This goes out to all the tainted racists and nazi believers:
Why don't you go find a bunker
And follow your fucking leader!

Throw a molotov and let us play catch with it
Nazi scum! Watch 'em run!
Throw a molotov and let us play catch with it
Traitor Trump set us up - fuck him up!
Throw a molotov and let us play catch
with a fist to the face of the 'superior race'
Cause now there's consequences when you advocate hate
Stepping out of the shadows was your latest mistake

If you want a war, you gonna limit your life span
Just like some nazis, the fascists, the ku klux klan
You don't belong on this land
If you're a true believer of the great deceiver
Then hunker down in a bunker, and follow your leader

Throw a molotov and let us play catch with it
Nazi scum! Watch 'em run!
Throw a molotov and let us play catch with it
Traitor Trump set us up - fuck him up!
Throw a molotov and let us play catch
with a fist to the face of the 'superior race'
Cause now there's consequences when you advocate hate
Stepping out of the shadows was your latest mistake

It's a season of treason,
Opportunists and demons
Moraly suffocated
Mentally constipated
Are you a true believer of the great deceiver?
Then hunker down in a bunker, and follow your leader

Throw a molotov and let us play catch with it
Nazi scum! Watch 'em run!
Throw a molotov and let us play catch with it
Traitor Trump set us up - fuck him up!
Throw a molotov and let us play catch
with a fist to the face of the 'superior race'
Cause now there's consequences when you advocate hate
Stepping out of the shadows was your latest mistake

Come on!
Resistance rising!
Here we go!

Stars and stripes!
Fuck your flak!
We ain't never going back!
Stars and stripes!
Fuck your flak!
We ain't never going back!
Stars and stripes!
Fuck your flak!
We ain't never going back!

So if you're a courageous racists and a nazi believer:
Then why don't you hunker down in that bunker
And follow your fucking leader
