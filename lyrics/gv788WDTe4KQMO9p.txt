I'm Creedence Clearwater Wright
best friend of Elodie Eye.
we've been tight since Percy Elementary
class of 1985
we moved together out to Philly after college
took a two bedroom at South & 9th
I sold my violin so we could have it easy
El got her grandmother's money when she died

we laughed like we were queens
& split our ballgowns at the seams
& every single time I'd dream
it was only El & me
but then she slipped away from me
she met a boy from New Jersey
& they fell fast in love of course
I swear it felt like a divorce

this September I'll be 26 years old
& El's the only one besides my dad
who's ever said I love you Creedence

took got a job downtown
it's an hour on the bus each way
typing letters for a lawyer in a bad toupee
it's dumb I know but it pays okay

& did I mention I moved out
I got my own place off of South
& I've been living hand to mouth
for going on a year by now
& yes I still see El around
it's different but I can't say how
she cut her hair it's back to brown
she's living with her boyfriend now

& since September I've been 26 years old
she's still the only one besides my dad
who's ever said I love you Creedence
