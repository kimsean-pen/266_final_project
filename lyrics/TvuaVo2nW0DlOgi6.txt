Thought that I'd be better off
If I were on my own
I tried to put my finger
On the moment we went wrong

But the taste turned bitter
So I pulled the trigger
Not so easy to move on
I guess I should have known

Ice cold, I freeze up when I see ya
Left you just to find out that I need ya
So far, I wanna pull you closer
I wish we could start the whole thing over

Ever since I left you
I've been trying to get you back
And it keeps getting worse
I'm burning on the inside
And the truth is that I didn't know how good you were

Until you were gone
Until you were gone

I was always told that only time would heal the pain
And even though it's been so long, it still hurts just the same
Yeah, you know I'm finding that the break was binding
I take back everything I said, ooh, won't you just come home?

Ice cold, I freeze up when I see ya
Left you just to find out that I need ya
So far, I wanna pull you closer
I wish we could start the whole thing over

Ever since I left you
I've been trying to get you back
And it keeps getting worse
I'm burning on the inside
And the truth is that I didn't know how good you were

Until you were gone
Until you were gone
Until you were gone
Until you were gone
