I was lonely only I didn't know it
I was so sad only I didn't show it
You came like the sun breaking through the clouds
And I found you're what I couldn't live without

With you I feel the other half of my heartbeat
I'm complete
In you I hear the other half of my heartbeat
That's all I need
No I didn't know what I was missin'
Oh but baby since we've been kissin'
I can feel the other half of my heartbeat
It's so sweet lying here with you

You look at me and I see my reflection
You understand who I am needs protection
The way you rush to me
The way you take my hand
And I follow you to fall down in the sand

With you I feel the other half of my heartbeat
I'm complete
In you I hear the other half of my heartbeat
That's all I need
No I didn't know what I was missin'
Oh but baby since we've been kissin'
I can feel the other half of my heartbeat
It's so sweet lying here with you

[Spoken:]
My heartbeats like a drum when I hear you come

You came like the sun breaking through the clouds
And I found you're what I couldn't live without
With you I feel the other half of my heartbeat
I'm complete
And you will heal me up again from my heartbeat
That's all I need
No I didn't know what I was missin'
Oh but baby since we've been kissin'
I can feel the other half of my heartbeat
It's so sweet lying here with you
