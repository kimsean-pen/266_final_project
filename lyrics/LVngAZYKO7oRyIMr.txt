The solution to peace isn't clear
The terrorist threat is a modern fear
There are no jobs for the young
They turn to crime, turn to drugs

Battle ships crowd the sea
Sixteen year olds in the army
Our jails are filled to the max
Discrimination against the blacks

Planet Earth 1988
Planet Earth 1988
It's too late, it's too late, it's too late

Russians and Americans war machine
Will destroy mankind's dream
They shoot their missiles in the air
They do not care, they do not care

Guerrilla armies rule the streets
No more Christmas or 'Trick or Treat'
Is this what the future will bring?
I pray for peace more than anything

Planet Earth 1988
Planet Earth 1988
It's too late, it's too late, it's too late

The solution to peace isn't clear
The terrorists threat is a modern fear
There is no future for the youth
There is no hope for the young

Death destruction, bombs galore
The rich are laughing at the poor
Our jails are filled to the max
Discrimination against the blacks

Planet Earth 1988
It's too late, it's too late, it's too late
