I took my lover to the sea
drowned him precious bride to be
bleeding heaven from the start
woe is rapture ripped apart
hey you're honest, aren't you?
Show me rapture torn apart
everybody's riddled with disease
but I bet you say, "not me"
so honest, aren't you?
You're so honest, aren't you so?

my, aren't you
surely the finest of the brigade?
my, aren't you
always right a portrait of dignity?
my, aren't you
innocent and never suspectable
my, aren't you

wait
you smell like shit, not the truth
full of device, not devotion
conscience came right up to you
and then you threw it back
you are the scum of the earth
you are the scum of the ocean
to you it's above as below
you smear your filth across the world
you smear your filth across the world
you smear your filth across the world
you smear your filth across the world
