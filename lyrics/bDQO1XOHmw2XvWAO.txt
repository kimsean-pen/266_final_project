Wish I was, yeah, a Wild West Hero

Sometimes I look up high and then I think there might
Just be a better life
Away from all we know, that's where I wanna go
Out on the wild side

And I wish I was
Oh, a Wild West Hero

Ride the range all the day, till the first fading light
Be with my Western girl, 'round the fire, oh, so bright
I'd be the Indians' friend, let them live to be free
Ridin' into the sunset, I wish I could be

I'd ride the desert sands and through the prairie lands
Tryin' to do what's right
The folks would come to me, they'd say, "We need you here"
I'd stay there for the night

Oh, I wish I was
Oh, a Wild West Hero

Ride the range all the day, till the first fading light
Be with my Western girl, 'round the fire, oh, so bright
I'd be the Indians' friend, let them live to be free
Ridin' into the sunset, I wish I could be

Oh, I wish I was
Oh, a Wild West Hero
I wish I was
Oh, a Wild West Hero
Oh, I wish I was
Oh, a Wild West Hero
Wish I was
Oh, a Wild West Hero

Wish I was a Wild West Hero
