Can't control the restless part of me
Bowing down our heads to love and greed
I wonder, can't deny, it's in my head
Our world in flames, the blood we shed

Walls are falling down on us

We wanna scream our pain
And break away from the dark
Caught in this wicked game
We know that nothing stays the same
'Cause we're living in a mad world, mad world
We're living in a mad world
We're living in a mad world, mad world
We're living in a mad world, mad world

Trying to hold on to all we know
But one day turn around and let it go
Restless, can't deny the dreams we had
Are glowing sparks, the fire ain't dead

Walls are falling down on us

We wanna scream our pain
And break away from the dark
Caught in this wicked game
We know that nothing stays the same
'Cause we're living in a mad world, mad world
We're living in a mad world
We're living in a mad world, mad world
We're living in a mad world, mad world

We hate, we love, we're fighting
This world is tearing us apart
And piece by piece we're crumbling
We're crumbling

We wanna scream our pain
And break away from the dark
Caught in this wicked game
We know that nothing stays the same
'Cause we're living in a mad world, mad world
We're living in a mad world
We're living in a mad world, mad world
We're living in a mad world
We're living in a mad world
We're living in a mad world
We're living in a mad world
We're living in a mad world, mad world
