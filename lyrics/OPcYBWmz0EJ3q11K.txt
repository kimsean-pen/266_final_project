I read the signs but I don't care
I'll risk it all just to wake up with you
I'll cross the line 'cause I'm not scared
Even if I fall I'm gon' be there for you
Yeah, I'm gon' be there for you

I promise you I won't run away
'Cause even your bed feels good to me
You make me crash, you make me fly
Oh, but I love it
Trust me that I won't run away
'Cause even your wrong feels right to me
You take me low, you take me high
Oh, but I love it

I love it
I love it

I'll go insane, but I don't mind
I'll lose it all just to lay there with you
I'll take the pain, oh it's so right
Even if we fall I will be there for you
Yeah, I will be there for you

I promise you I won't run away
'Cause even your bed feels good to me
You make me crash, you make me fly
Oh, but I love it
Trust me that I won't run away
'Cause even your wrong feels right to me
You take me low, you take me high
Oh, but I love it

I love it
I love it
