Full moon - raise the rainbow
The sea experts - prepare the bow
An optical miracle - a moon as high as one

Two hundreds
High strain
Threaten the mankind
Among two storms

It buzzes around your ears
An easy day will follow the twilight
It must be the last full moon
It's near the promised time

The thunder bears two mothers
The mother bears two sons
Echoes in the distance
All turn to sun's size

It's hot althought it's midnight
The mothers died at once
Father itself the rainbow
Both sons will last no more
