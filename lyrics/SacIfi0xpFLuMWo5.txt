Oh God grant me the serenity to accept the things that I cannot change
The courage to change the things that I can
The wisdom to know the difference
Oh ooh and God give me the courage to love with an open heart

(2X)
To love with an open heart

I wanna love with an open heart
Oh ooh oh with an open heart
