Boo yah
There's a place in the way outta sphere
Do ya
Want to burn the midnight oil
Does it fool ya
When you think there's no way out of here
Let it pull ya
From the outside to within
The light inside is burning bright
The light makes everything all right
The light inside is burning bright
The light inside oh yeah alright

Introduce you to my point of view
Me, i
Wanna get under your skin
I wanna thank you
For the pleasure that i get from you
I wanna drag you
From the outside to within'
The light inside is burning bright
The light makes everything all right
The light inside is burning bright
The light inside oh yeah alright
The light inside is burning
The light inside is burning
The light inside is burning bright
The light inside oh yeah alright
The light inside is burning bright
The light makes everything all right
The light inside is burning bright
The light inside oh yeah alright
