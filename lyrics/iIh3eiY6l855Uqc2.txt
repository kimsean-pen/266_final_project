I reached down and found the wrong
Parts that's been stripped down
I beckoned you my tender one
Could you to respect its roundness
Take a hard hit
And be careful with this
I feel softness in your eyes
The warmth of brown
I feel softness everywhere
Soft spots that need to be found
And take a hard stand
And you extend your hand
And cradle my tenderness
