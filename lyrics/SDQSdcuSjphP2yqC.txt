We can make you happy
With these little pills of love and care
We can see a break-in
But these pills will bring these cracks together
It's just an error on your system
Reboot and start again
Then place your back on the line
So you never do what you do best
Why do we just do what we're told to do?
They push a button, we come running through
They burned our circuits just to hide the truth
From me and you
Why do we just do what we're told to do?
They push a button, we come running through
They burned our circuits just to hide the truth
From me and you
We see machines repeat the same thing
But we are just the same without the safety
Just a complicated routine, a smokescreen
We see machines repeat the same thing
But we are just the same without the safety
Just a complicated routine, a smokescreen
Why do we just do what we're told to do?
They push a button, we come running through
