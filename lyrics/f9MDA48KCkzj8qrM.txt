Sleep with all the lights on,
You're not so happy, you're not secure.
And you're dying to look cute in your blue jeans,
but you're plastic just like everyone, just like everyone.
And that face you paint is pressed,
impressing most of us as permanent,
and I'd like to see you undone.

College night will draw the crowds.
Dorms unload and you're heading out,
Here is your moment to shine.

Making up a history,
It's nothing from the life you lead,
but man, will they buy all your lines?

Sleep with all the sheets off,
bearing your mattress, bearing your soul.
And you're dying to look smooth with your tattoos,
but you're searching just like everyone, could be anyone.
And those friends that you have are the best
impressing most of us as permanent,
and I'd like to see you undone.

Youth's the most unfaithful mistress,
Still we forge ahead to miss her,
Rushing our moment to shine.

Making up a history,
It's nothing from the life you lead,
but man will they buy all your lines?

We're not twenty-one,
but the sooner we are,
the sooner the fun will begin,
so get out your fake eyelashes,
and fake i.d's,
and real disasters ensue,
it's cool to take these chances.
It's cool to fake romances.
and grow up fast, and grow up fast,
and grow up fast, and grow up fast.
