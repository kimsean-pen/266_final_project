So many fools blocking my motion
Clouding my eyes must be the potion
Spots on my eyes must be the lotion
Spots on my eyes must be the lotion

Love in a void, it's so numb
Avoid in love, it's so dumb
Love in a void

So many bigots for my liking
So many critics too few writing
Rabid dogs that aren't biting
Rabid dogs that aren't biting

Love in a void, it's so numb
Avoid in love, it's so dumb
Love in a void

Jaded reputation on which you're staking
Lots of money for the making
For all the stars they're just faking
For all the stars they're just baking

Love in a void, it's so numb
Avoid in love, it's so dumb
Love in a void

Love is, love is, love in a void
Avoid in love, it's so numb
So dumb

Love is, love is, love in a void
Avoid in love, it's so numb
So dumb
Love in a void, it's so numb

Love in a void, avoid in love
It's so numb, so dumb
Love in a void
