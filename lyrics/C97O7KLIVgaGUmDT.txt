Trust is all it takes
But people make mistakes

Sunshine fades to gray
The second I'm away
Minutes turn to hours
Without you

Time keeps marching on
Now summers been and gone
And I'm still here alone
Still waiting

I'm on my own
A million miles away
Temptation all around
It won't be long
So please be strong
'Cos I'm holding on for you

I'm holding on
I'm holding on for you

Trust is all it takes
But people make mistakes
'Cos we are only human
Let's face it

I might struggle through the day
Pretend that I'm okay
I make believe that you're here
Beside me

'Cos, I'm on my own
A million miles away
Temptation all around
It won't be long
So please be strong
'Cos I'm holding on for you

You are the only one that I truly believe in
So don't ever think that I would ever deceive ya baby
Without a doubt you are my rhyme and my reason
And I won't let you down

I'm holding on
I'm holding on for you
I'm holding on
Yes, I'm holding on for you

I'm holding on, yeah, yeah
I'm holding on for you
I'm holding on
Yes, I'm holding on for you

'Cos, I'm on my own
A million miles away
Temptation all around
It won't be long
So please be strong
I'm holding on for you

I'm on my own
Feeling blue
Miles from home
I'm lost without you
But I'll be strong
Keep holding on
Holding on for you

I'm holding on
I'm holding on for you
I'm holding on
Yes, I'm holding on for you

I'm holding on, yeah, yeah
I'm holding on for you
I'm holding on
Yes, I'm holding on for you

I'm holding on
