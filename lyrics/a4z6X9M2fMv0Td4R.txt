I am the one who can please you, ain't that what you said?
You seemed so alone, I guess I was easily led
I showed you my love and babe, I guess that it went to your head
When you were hungry I brought you your breakfast in bed

Come on, even it up, even it up, even it up
Come on, even it up, even it up, even it up

Well, a good man pays his debt
But you ain't paid yours yet
Come on and even it
It's time you even it, even it up

Well I took you over the tracks when you wanted some sin
I brought you satin and herbs from the places I been
Well now something tells me, baby you're going to use me again
You think you can lay down the how and the where and the when

You think you can
I tell you, even it up, even it up, even it up, right now
Oh well, even it up, even it up, even it up

I don't want to bum it all
No, but this ax
So she got to fall
Even it, come on, even it, even it up, baby

Even it up, even it up, even it up
Even it up, even it up, even it up

Even it up, even it up, even it up
Even it up, even it up, even it up

Even it up, even it up, even it up
