I feel like I have seen it all
So show me something new
It needs to be the real thing
And something we can choose
Put me on a pedestal
And get me all enthused
Let's find a place to getaway
Where we can never lose

But my soul is breaking,
world is shaken
What can I do
We are out of time, can't realize that
now we are through
Oh!

I feel like I have seen it all
Now show me something new
Something that can save us all
And keeps me close to you

But my soul is breaking,
world is shaken
What can I do
We are redefined but terrified by what
we will lose

You tell me what you want
And I give you what you need
We don't realize we're redefined
You tell me what you want
And I give you what you need
We don't realize we are redefined

But my heart is breaking,
soul is shaken
What can I do
We are redefined but love is blind so
we can't break loose

You tell me what you want
And I give you what you need
We don't realize we're redefined
You tell me what you want
And I give you what you need
We don't realize we are redefined
