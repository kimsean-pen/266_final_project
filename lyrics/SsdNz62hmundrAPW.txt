Never been in love
Cause a girl like me
Never had someone to care for
Never thought there could be
Someone special for me
And now I'm all in love
Cause a girl like me
Waited patiently for someone
Someone to care for me
And there will never be

No more lonely, no more just me
I've been there before
Ain't going no more
And now that you're here I
Never wanna say goodbye love
Never wanna be without you
No more crying, no denyin'
I'm in love with you
And now that you're here I
Never wanna say goodbye love

Now it's time for me
To find out what a first time love could mean
Little scared but it's cool
Cause it's worth it
Now I finally fell in love
And I know that it
Gots to be for real
(So real)
It's the way that I feel
So come share my world with me
(Share my world)
So there will never be

No more lonely, no more just me
I've been there before
Ain't going no more
And now that you're here I
Never wanna say goodbye love
Never wanna be without you
No more crying, no denyin'
I'm in love with you
And now that you're here I
I never wanna say goodbye love
(Never wanna say)

So I'm standing here
Arms open wide
Ready to give my heart
I'm sure this time
Love's gonna last for life
Baby I know things change
And there might be some rain
But the clouds are gonna fade
And the sun is gonna shine again
Shine light on our love baby
So let's make it last forever

No more lonely, no more just me
I've been there before
Ain't going no more
And now that you're here I
Never wanna say goodbye love
Never wanna be without you
No more crying, no denyin'
I'm in love with you
And now that you're here I
I never wanna say goodbye love
