Standing in front of this bed with some matches, watch it burn
I pray my body burns too

Why do I do the things I do (things I do)
And they blind you (blind you)
And you are the only one who can see what I've done

Laying here doesn't feel the same
I need to get up and make a change
Get up and get over this
My voice it echoes
My thoughts collide
You said I'm dead to you, I bled for you
Now your dreams can come true

There's a place in my bed where you rested your head
Now I'm resting alone in this bed and it's cold
I feel like a ghost
These memories go up in smoke
You didn't want serious
And it made me delirious
2: 40AM, all I wrote was

Why do I do the things I do (things I do)
And they blind you (blind you)
And you are the only one who can see what I've done

Guess I'll never know what I meant to you
This year's been lonely but at least it's through
I'll write a letter to my former self
Dear Sad Ghost, why'd you put your heart on the shelf?

You took the fun out of living
When you took the life out of me
Take a look into your mirror
But you don't see yourself inside
Watch it crack, oh
Your bad luck started with me
But my good luck ended with you

I know you're drunk again
And not thinking clear
But when you write this down
At least try and sound a bit more sincere

Guess I'll never know what I meant to you
This year's been lonely but at least it's through
I'll write a letter to my former self
Dear Sad Ghost, why'd you put your heart on the shelf?
