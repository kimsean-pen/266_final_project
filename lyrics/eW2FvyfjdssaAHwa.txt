It's too late
You've said that you're trying
But something keeps falling
Anyway

Wasted,
we've used all our sorries
Shut your eyes now,
there's nothing to say
I listen,
but I know the truth
This is too easy
for you

Face-down,
the worst time for a drink
I need this
more than you do

Now time
to fill all these spaces
My hands draw in circles
in their shame

Too late,
the strings are all broken
Put away now,
there's nothing to say
