A'ight ya'll, how ya'll feeling tonight?
Thank ya'll for coming out to the Wise Underground Club
Our first act up, all the way from Memphis, Tennessee
Show 'em some southern love
JT & the Tennessee Kids, come on, give it up
Thank you for having us out tonight
We're JT & the Tennessee Kids
Ehem, 1, 2, 3

Hmmmm
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Like I'm in love with you

Didn't have to run, I knew it was love from a mile away
But I had to catch you, been running through my mind all day, baby
They all say I'm crazy, 'cause anybody, even when your father say
That I can't be with you, I don't hear a word they say

'Cause I'm in love with that girl
So don't be mad at me
'Cause I'm in love with that girl
So don't be mad at me

So what, you're from the other side of the tracks
So what, the world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax, guess what?
I'm in love with that girl
And she told me that she's in love with me

Now we didn't have to fall, but we fell in love to the bottom, babe
Knowing that I'd catch us like when you fell from heaven that day, baby
People always staring, but I don't even care nothing about it, babe
'Cause since I saw your face, I've been staring just the same
Yeah, mmm

I'm in love with that girl
So don't be mad at me
I'm in love with that girl (Ohhh, oh)
So don't be mad at me

So what, you're from the other side of the tracks
So what, the world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax, guess what?
I'm in love with that girl
And she told me that she's in love with me

Now pretty lady
You'll always be my baby, baby, baby
It's so amazing
How you became my baby, baby, baby
My little daisy, come here
Let me rock you like a baby, baby, baby
Pretty lady, don't you know
You'll always be my baby, baby, baby

To the bridge

Now don't it seem like these days
That everybody's got something to say
But I don't pay attention to the talk, baby
And I don't really care, if they stop and stare
'Cause they'll see my number one
My number one girl

I told ya
I'm in love with that girl (ohhohhh oh)
So don't be mad at me
I'm in love with that girl (oh no no)
So don't be mad at me (I don't care)

So what, you're from the other side of the tracks
So what, the world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax, guess what?
I'm in love with that girl (that girl)
She already told me that she's in love with me

Haha, no
I'm in love, yes, I'm in love with that girl
I don't care what people say, people say, uh
'Cause I'm in love with that girl...
