Do you love me? I can really move...
Do you love me? I'm in the groove...
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Now that I can dance
Watch me now!

Work it, work it out baby.
Work it, work it, well you're driving me crazy
Work it, work it, just a little bit of soul now.

I can mash potato, I can mash potato
I can do the twist, I can do the twist
Now tell me baby, tell me baby.
Do ya like it like this? (do ya like it like this?)
Tell me, tell me, tell me...

Do you love me? I can really move...
Do you love me? I'm in the groove...
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Now that I can dance
Watch me now!
