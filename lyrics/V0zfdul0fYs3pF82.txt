nicole will you carry my bible
it's dragging me down
and i cannot swim above this ground
my head is numb and my lungs are shot
i am something you could do without

so forget me
i'll fade away
but when i'm gone
devour me

nicole your face is dying before my eyes
and through the breath of my own lies
i'll wipe the blood from your tears
through your pointless suffering
