Wasting time on stupid things,
That's what I'm doin' today
Walking up and down the street,
You see me float away

I'm breaking in two
So what should I do
To make you all mine, all of the time

My mind is set on distant things,
My body has to stay
I'm trying to get across the street,
I see you walk away

I'm breakin' in two
So what should I do
To make you all mine, all of the time

Wasting time on stupid things,
That's what I'm doin' today
Walking up and down the street,
You see me float away

I'm breaking in two
So what should I do
To make you all mine, all of the time

I'm breaking in two
So what should I do
To make you all mine, all of the time
