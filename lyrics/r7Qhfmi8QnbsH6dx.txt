As I walk through the fire
I turn my eyes to see
They took us down to the wire
But it doesn't matter much to me
Into the badlands we ride
To a place they'll never get you
They know there's nowhere to hide
Behind the walls of Shockwave City
As the clouds struck on midnight
They turn their eyes to see
The flicker of the screen light
It was never gonna let them be
Into the darklands we fall
To an emptiness there waiting
They have their chains on us all
Behind the walls of Shockwave City
Shockwave City
Shockwave City
Shockwave City
Shockwave City
Shockwave City
Shockwave City
Shockwave City
Shockwave City
