Everyone living in Ghost Town
Everyone buried in wasteland
We don't want to
We don't have to
Be like that
Living in ghost town

All the boys shout it out loud now
All the girls scream it out louder
We don't want to
We don't have to live like that

Hold me back
You know were never gonna back down
Hold me back
You know were never gonna back down

We're dead in this ghost town
You better let go so
Let go
Let go of me

Were dead in this ghost town
You better let go so
Let go
Let go of me

Let go
Let go of me

Let go
Let go of me

Everyone living in Ghost Town
Everyone buried in wasteland
We don't want to
We don't have to
Be like that
Living in Ghost Town

All the boys shout it out loud now
All the girls scream it out louder
We don't want to
We don't have to live like that

Hold me back
You know were never gonna back down
Hold me back
You know were never gonna back down

We're dead in this ghost town
You better let go so
Let go
Let go of me

We're dead in this ghost town
You better let go so
Let go
Let go of me

Let go
Let go of me

Let go
Let go of me

It's nearly over
The last train is here
And it's leaving behind those years
These are the bad lands
The worst taste in fear
Making graves for the ones we left here

We're calling, calling
To say goodbye

We're dead in this ghost town
You better let go so
Let go
Let go of me

We're dead in this ghost town
You better let go so
Let go
Let go of me

Let go
Let go of me

Let go
Let go of me
