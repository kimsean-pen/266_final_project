Was it a dream?
Under the holy cross in the valley below
A mother and child
Emergency behind a yellow curtain
On the second floor
All the guardian angels at the door
With their long white coats and stethoscopes

In the middle of love
I'm a little white dove
I'm the heroine
In the middle of love
I'm the little white dove, yeah
In the middle of love
I'm a little white dove, yeah

Was it a dream?
When you called me "kitten" and "her majesty"
I'm your blood I want more
The water from my eyes fell to the floor

In the middle of love
I'm a little white dove, yeah
I'm the heroine
In the middle of love
I'm a little white dove, yeah

Hungry eyes watching over you
Petty crimes are the family jewels
We're living our lives and its happening over and over again
Whoo

Was it a dream?
Under the holy cross in the valley below
A mother and child
Eternity under a cool white sheet
Here we go

In the middle of love
I'm a little white dove, yeah
I'm the heroine
In the middle of love
I'm a little white dove, yeah
I'm the heroine
In the middle of love
I'm a little white dove
In the middle of love
I'm a little white dove

In the middle of love
In the middle of love
