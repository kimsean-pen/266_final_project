Hands full of sand slip away
Grains count minutes, days to years
Together a sinking raft of sheets
Cut apart the reefs, when I reach out

Finger glance off guard smiles
Recoil from the passing touch
The alone has become yours and mine
Stare until I'm blind island sun

So easy to forget
How to become someone else
The heart wants its way
It's hard to not be alone
On all sides, there is water
Filled with hurt
Drink from the ocean
The island sun
