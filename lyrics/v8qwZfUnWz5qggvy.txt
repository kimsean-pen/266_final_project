If only I could clear my eyes, then I might breathe once more
Then I might breathe again

Oh, sun and stars and oceans below me
Guide my strides over jagged shards underfoot.

To slash through the shroud...

Our path lays hidden, full of peril
How may we walk from here on?

And so the truth, that burned so bright
Now is rendered one thousand shards
