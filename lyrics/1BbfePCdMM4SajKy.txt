They got a ranch they call
Number Fifty-One
They got a ranch they call
Number Fifty-One
Can't see it all
'Less your flying by
Just sitting there square
Baking in the sun
Beneath the sky

They're gonna put it down
Right on the strip
They're gonna put it down
On the Vegas strip
They're gonna put it down
And step outside
Into the lights
Right outta that ship
Saying hi!

I was driving doing nothing on the shores of Great Salt Lake
When they put it on the air, I put it in the hammer lane
I soon forgot myeslf and I forgot about the brake
I forgot all laws and I forgot about the rain
They were talking on the 9 and all across the army band
Across the road they were turning around and headed south with me

It got so crowded on the road, I started driving in the sand
My head was feeling scared but my heart was feeling free
The desert turned to mud it seems that everybody heard
Everybody was remembering to forget they had the chills

Then I heard the voices on a broadcast from up on the bird
They were getting interviewed by some goodman whose name was Bill
I'm almost there to Vegas where they're puttin' on a show
They've come so far, I've lived this long, at least I must just go and say
Hello
