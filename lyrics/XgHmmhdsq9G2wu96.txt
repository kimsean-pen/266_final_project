Reason to be
Within these worlds in-deed
Come and see
How infinity is the key

The burning cold
Joins the new with the old

Time of the choice
Can you hear your voice
Everyone is here in the dark
A brightest shining star

The burning cold
Joins the new with the old

This is how it came to be
Realities were set free
It burns in you it burns in me
That is infinity

The burning cold
Joins the new with the old

The burning cold.
