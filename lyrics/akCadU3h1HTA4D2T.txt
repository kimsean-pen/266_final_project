Open me–
It all seems so fine and on the way
See pictures in my brain
I'm looking at you, I smile and you smile
Did you forget us dancing just the other day?
Yeah

It's better if you weren't welcome
Get out of my dream, I'm not the only one
Falling—when you seem so alive

I feel so blind
When I rise and rise
'Cause I feel so high and I need your love

But you let me down
Don't you let me down today
I need your love
But you let me down
Don't you let me down today

Alright, alright, alright! Please
Your smiling, clever face
Might dissolve into the dark
You ran the other way
I said, "Stay, we're singing old rhymes"
Like old souls, in a new time
I let you down on raven wings
To the other side, where sirens sing

What about me? I want you close to me
The sun has turned away and is smiling out to the sea
What the fuck do you wanna know?
This heart and soul is open to you now
So alive

I feel so blind
When I rise and rise
'Cause I feel so high and I need your love

But you let me down
Don't you let me down today
I need your love
But you let me down
Don't you let me down today
I need your love
