She's yelling on the phone,
she's yelling on the phone again.
And she's banging on the door;
she's losing all control again.
What's she doing in the tub?
She's shooting up the junk again.
And all the water in the stream
couldn't ever wash her clean, in my head.
And I'm leaving.

Demon with the needles leaning over your shoulder.
It's over.
I pictured this differently.
I cast us in perfect light.
I'd trade an eternity,
for what's been taken away.
Feels like
the future for you and me,
fades in the failing light,
this time you drowned us in misery,
that's why you forced me to say

Goodbye, my love, so long, you've thrown us away.

It's been going on for months,
said she'd only done it once with friends.
I couldn't keep her clean at all,
every dealer that she called was a friend.
Believe it.

Demon with the needles leaning over your shoulder.
It's over.

I pictured this differently.
I cast us in perfect light.
I'd trade an eternity,
for what's been taken away.
Feels like
the future for you and me,
fades in the failing light,
this time you drowned us in misery,
that's why you forced me to say

Goodbye, my love, so long, you've thrown us away.

I remember how it was, back when we were both in love again,
made-up memories.
They were few and far between, no it wasn't meant to be from then.

Been stuck inside a dream, woke up and I could breathe the air.
Been down this road before I'll make it on my own I swear.

Feels like,
I pictured this differently,
our lives,
I cast us in perfect light,
this time.
I'd trade an eternity, that's why, you f***ing forced me to say

Goodbye, I'm saving her, my love, I wave to her
So long, you've thrown us away.
