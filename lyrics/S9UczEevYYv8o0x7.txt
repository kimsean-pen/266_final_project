I don't want to go out
You don't wanna stay in
I guess we're gonna argue again

There's a tear in your eye
I guess we're gonna argue again,
wooohooo

But what I do is always
To you my heart is all so true
But I might argue again
You know that it's true
I'm loving you, I know, not again, we're arguing
