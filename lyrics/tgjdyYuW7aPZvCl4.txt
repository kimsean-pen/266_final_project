I've spent my whole life surrounded
And I've spent my whole life alone
I wonder why I never wondered why
The easiest things are so hard

I just want, I just want to love
I just want, I just want to love
I just want, I just want to love
I just want

Something, something for nothing
Yeah, something, something for nothing
'Cause I'm a beggar and a chooser
I'm accused and accuser
But nothing's unconditional

I hold the whole world accused
And I've only got myself to blame
I wonder why I never wondered why
The easiest things are so hard

I just want, I just want to love
I just want, I just want to love
I just want, I just want to love
I just want

Something, something for nothing
Yeah, something, something for nothing

I just want, I just want to love
I just want, I just want to love
I just want, I just want to love
I just want, I just want to love

Something, something for nothing
Yeah, something, something for nothing

'Cause I'm a beggar and a chooser
I'm accused and accuser
But nothing's unconditional
