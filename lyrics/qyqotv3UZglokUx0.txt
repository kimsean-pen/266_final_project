My brother, you love her,
But don't give up your instincts.
Hang onto you know what,
They'll be gone fast as you blink.
They're trained to seduce you,
Suck you dry quick as they can.
They bite down, reduce you,
Now you're barely a man.

Oh my God,
How could you deny the flood,
That's flowing through you?
Hey you, you're saying that,
She's all that you desire, liar.
Hey you, you think you can,
Throw water on this fire, liar.

It's not wrong to let go,
And let the woman ride you.
For fuck sake, don't lose touch,
With the dog that's inside you.
She wanted what you had,
You bet she smelt the spore.
Don't wimp up, fuck her up,
One more time, slam that door.

Oh my God,
How could you deny the flood,
That's flowing through you?
Hey you, you're saying that,
She's all that you desire, liar.
Hey you, you think you can,
Throw water on this fire, liar.
Oh my God,
How could you deny the flood,
That's flowing through you?
Hey you, you're saying that,
She's all that you desire, liar.
Hey you, you think you can,
Throw water on this fire, liar.

Liar!
Liar!
Liar!
Liar!

Oh my God,
How could you deny the flood,
That's flowing through you?
