If you had not
In my heart sunset
The asthma

If you and I stopped
Steer my heart, I'm ready
It's you, I, us now
Stirring my indulgent self tonight
Don't, don't fall
You saw my best world
The end of their love
You steer my heart, I'm ready

Dye all of my colors red
How'd you get this house? She said
She wondered
For a fire and clear am I
Bound for all the sun to spoil

You had me, meet the stuff
Say it is so familiar

If you and I stopped
Steer my heart, I'm ready
It's you, I, us now
Stirring my indulgent self tonight
Don't, don't stop
You saw my best world
The end of their love
You steer my heart, I'm ready

Dye all of my colors red
How'd you get this house? She said
She wondered
For a fire and clear am I
Bound for all the sun to spoil

Dye all of my colors red
How'd you get this house? She said
She wondered
For a fire and clear am I
Bound for all the sun to spoil

Dye all of my colors red.
How'd you get this house? She said
She wondered
For a fire and clear am I
Bound for all the sun to spoil
