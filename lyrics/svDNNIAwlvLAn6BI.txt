We are the love of strangers
That say a silent prayer
We are the love of mothers
That taught our hearts to care
We are, we are
We are the patients and
The sacrifice of yesterday
The silence in between the
Breaths of all the words we say
We are, we are

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

We are the proof of life
How our ancestors gave
We are the proof of love from
The cradle to the grave
We are, we are
We are the best of struggles
That we won't have to bear
We are the heir to all the
Prayers that float upon the air
We are, we are, we are

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

We are the seed of children that
May never know our names
We are the peace of people
That won't bow their heads in shame
We are, we are
We walk upon the Earth
We knock on heaven's door
We are the life that teems along
The deepest ocean floor
We are, we are, we are

Ooh

The present, the past
The future days to come
The alpha, the omega
We are everything in one
We are, we are

Ooh, we are
