Dancing in a coma
Eating sushi all alone
I disappear
Did I put myself here?
Snowflake in a desert
I'm her beacon and fluorescent
Is this real?
What's happening here?

I try to be human
But that never works
I'm lost in a gift shop
With hours to burn
I'm losing my grip here
I'm off the deep end
I wanna come back to me
I wanna come back
I wanna get out of my head

Thunder, now I'm gliding
Drinking caffeine till I'm flying like a kite
I'd try anything twice
Frozen thirty-something
Am I here or here for nothing?
I don't mind
And I'm losing my mind

I try to be human
But that never works
I'm lost in a gift shop
With hours to burn
I'm losing my grip here
I'm off the deep end
I wanna come back to me
I wanna come back
I wanna get out of my head
(I try to be human, I try to be human)

I try to be human
But that never works
I'm lost in a gift shop
With hours to burn
I'm losing my grip here
I'm off the deep end
I wanna come back to me
I wanna come back

I try to be human
But that never works
I'm lost in a gift shop
With hours to burn
I'm losing my grip here
I'm off the deep end
I wanna come back to me
I wanna come back
I wanna get out of my head
