Hold onto chance
Lest we bleed ourselves
Then save for the pets
They're the loneliest

Put into jars
We'll save this Earth
Put into jars
We'll save this Earth

We can't both become the same pawn
That's made to fall
Oil that taste like
Blood stole the summer scent
From me to you
You're stabbing me through you
You're stabbing you through him
And betting most of
This world

We'll add enough of the world

Steal from yourselves
It never felt so good
And fit from their hands
Confuse by opposites

Put into jars
We'll save this Earth
Put into jars
Keep safe this Earth

We can't both become the same pawn
That's made to fall
Oil that taste like
Blood stole the summer scent
From me to you
You're stabbing me through you
You're stabbing you through him
And betting most of
This world

We'll add enough of the world
This world
We'll add enough of the world

Feeling manic for a day
Depends on the trend
Depends on the surface
If the sun never sets

We can't both become the same pawn
That's made to fall
Oil that taste like
Blood stole the summer scent
From me to you
You're stabbing me through you
You're stabbing you through him
And betting most of
This world
This world
We'll add enough of the world
Is the main thing you'll shout
'Till the bitter end
Into Jars
