There's a patch of longing at the edge of town
Don't run so fast 'cause my heels get caught
An American tourist he says he wanted some rock
I could've just flipped the sign,
charged him anything, taken everything he's got
I saw a little sign up in the sky
Reminded me of something in your eye
That's Brighton pier, darling
Where the lights
They sing a sad, sad song
They sing a dirty old song
But we carry on
Across the wooden boards and then far out to sea
I never even realized you were seeing the same thing as me
I'm cutting up on Swinton street with my head held high
I kiss her on the lips and sometimes it's hard to say goodbye
Where the lights
They sing a sad, sad song
Sing a dirty old song
But we carry on
Where the lights
They sing a sad, sad song
Sing a dirty old song
But we carry on
(You're such a...)
They sing a sad, sad song
They sing a dirty old song
But we carry on
Where the lights
They sing a sad, sad song
They sing a dirty old song
But we carry on
(Where the lights) I knew it was a question, but I
(Sad, sad song) Didn't know the answer so I
(A dirty old song) Just looked away away and I
(Carry on) Kind of looked the other way and that's
(Where the lights) Over to the sea and that's
(Sad, sad song) Far from you and me
(Sad, sad song) Where the lights
I said we carry on
