Tell me why
I should let you survive
When you've poisoned
A handful of mine
Don't you know that revenge is mine?
And that sick thoughts flood my mind
About stabbing you with needles used
From drugged souls with claimed lives

Hide behind government lies
Where you're the dealer and we suffer
So some can go home to no mother
Or a brother who's hooked by a faceless crook
Because i believe your industry is rigged by the book

Tell me why
I should let you survive
When youve poisoned
A handful of mine

Id take your fucking life
Id take it for the loss of my own
And the thousands you have drowned
Creating broken homes

Tell me why I should let you survive
When youve poisoned a handful of mine
Id take your fucking life
Id take it for the loss of my own
And the thousands you have drowned
Creating broken homes
