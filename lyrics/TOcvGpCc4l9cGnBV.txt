I've gotta find a new way
I need to wake up and learn things today
I've been a week away
From feeling hopeless for also decay
Running blind all night
My brain stops to find out the time
It has been quite the climb
It's just a girl that I hope soon I'd find

(Somehow on the outside)
(Somehow on the outside)
Somehow on the outside
Somehow on the outside

I've been awake tonight
But having left home
I've started to cry
I'm feeling pain alright
Now believe me my brain is not too shy

Gotta find a new way
I need to wake up and learn things today
I've been a week away
From feeling hopeless for also decay

(Somehow on the outside)
(Somehow on the outside)
Somehow on the outside
Somehow on the outside
Somehow on the outside
Somehow on the outside
(Somehow on the outside)
(Somehow on the outside)
