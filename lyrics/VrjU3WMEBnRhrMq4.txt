Just like the white-winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singin'
Who? Who? Who?
Just like the white-winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singin'
Ooh, baby ooh, I said ooh

And the days go by
And the days go by
And the days go by
And the days go by
Just like the white-winged dove

And the days go by
Like a strand in the wind
In the web that is my own
I begin again
Said to my friend, baby
Nothin' else mattered (Nothin' else mattered)
He was no more than a baby then (Than a baby then)
Well he seemed broken hearted
Something within him
But the moment that, that I first laid
Eyes on him, all alone
On the edge of 17

Just like the white-winged dove
And the days go by
And the days go by
And the days go by
And the days go by
Just like the white-winged dove
