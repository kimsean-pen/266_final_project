we used to leave the blue lights on and there was a beat
ever since you have been gone it's all caffeine-free
faux punk fatigues
said it all before
they try to kick it, their feet fall asleep
get no harm done no
none of them want to fight me

combat baby come back baby
fight off the lethargy
don't go quietly
combat baby
said you would never give up easy
combat baby come back

get back in town I wanna paint it black
I wanna get around
easy living crowd so flat
said it all before
they try to kick it, their feet fall asleep
I want to be wrong but
No one here wants to fight me like you do

combat baby come back baby
fight off the lethargy
don't go quietly
combat baby
said you would never give up easy
combat baby come back

I try to be so nice
Compromise
Who gets it good?
Every mighty mild seventies child
Every mighty mild seventies child
Beats me

Do doo dooo
do doo dooo
do do dooo
do de do doo
do doo doo
do doo dooo
do do dooo
do de do doo

combat baby come back baby
combat baby come back
bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye baby
combat baby come back

how I miss your ranting
do you miss my all time lows
