You could have passed although moved away
Truth hurt people part you're not my only friend
Time stops never ends how long till then
You're not my only friend

Hey you didn't have to go
Hey you didn't have to go
Hey you didn't have to go

Have we been through everything meant to
Truth hurt people part
You're not my only friend
Everyone I love is so far away
You're not my only friend

Hey you didn't have to go
Hey you didn't have to go
Hey you didn't have to go
Hey you didn't have to go
Hey you didn't have to go
Hey you didn't have to go
