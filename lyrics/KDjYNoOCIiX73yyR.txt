I'll be coming down all summer long
Love the way it tastes
Just ride the feeling out before it's gone
Till I let you run away

I was chewing Juicy Fruit
Posting pics in Malibu
Thinking back to me and you
Sitting on my bed, yeah
Dyed my hair vanilla blue
Smoking in the living room
Wondering what you've been up to
Got you in my head

I was like, whoa
Don't know how you did, but you just knew it
Phone was blowing up, I thought I blew it
I ain't heard a word, I got used to it
Then you come around like, whoa
Now I'm driving over ‘cause I need it
Tell me that you love me, you don't mean it
But we take each other higher than the ceiling

I'll be coming down all summer long
Love the way it tastes
Just ride the feeling out before it's gone
Till I let you run away

I was chewing Juicy Fruit
We were out in Malibu
Wasting every afternoon
Laying in your bed, yeah
Bottles of this lightning
Champagne, I was vibing
You're so bad at timing
Here I go again

Got me like, whoa
Don't know how you did, but you just knew it
Phone was blowing up, I thought I blew it
I ain't heard a word, I got used to it
Then you come around like, whoa
Now I'm driving over ‘cause I need it
Tell me that you love me, you don't mean it
But we take each other higher than the ceiling

I'll be coming down all summer long
Love the way it tastes
Just ride the feeling out before it's gone
Till I let you run away

I'll be coming down all summer long
Love the way it tastes
Just ride the feeling out before it's gone
Till I let you run away

I was chewing Juicy Fruit
I was chewing Juicy Fruit
I was chewing Juicy Fruit
