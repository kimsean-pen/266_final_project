It's the tearing sound of love-notes
Coming out these rusted windows
And the view outside is sterile
And I'm only two cubes down
A photocopy all the things that we could be
If you took the time to notice me
But you can't now, I don't blame you
And it's not your fault that no one ever does

But you don't work here anymore
It's just a vacant 3 by 4
And they might fill your place
A temporary stand-in for your face

This happens all the time
And I can't help but think I'll die alone

So I'll spend my time with strangers
A condition, and it's terminal
In this water-cooler romance
And its coming to a close
We could be in the park and dancing by a tree
Kicking over blades we see
Or a dark beach with a black view
As pin-pricks in the velvet catch our fall

But you don't work here anymore
It's just a vacant 3 by 4
And they might fill your place
A temporary stand-in for your face

It happens all the time
And I can't help but think I'll die alone

I know you don't work here anymore
I know you don't work here anymore
I know you don't work here anymore
I know you don't work here anymore
I know you don't work here anymore
I know you don't work here anymore

Sometimes I think I'll die alone
Sometimes I think I'll die alone
Sometimes I think I'll die alone
live and breathe and die alone
Sometimes I think I'll die alone
sometimes I think I'll die alone
Sometimes I think I'll die alone
I'd think I'd love to die a-

Just (just)
Take (take)
I think I'd love to die
Me (me)
Down (down)
I think I'd love to die
Just (just)
Take (take)
I think I'd love to die
Me (me)
Down (down)
I think I'd love to die alone
I think I'd love to die alone
I think I'd love to die alone
I think I'd love to die alone
Live and breathe and die alone
I think I'd love to die alone
(I think I'd love to die alone)
I think I'd love to die alone...
