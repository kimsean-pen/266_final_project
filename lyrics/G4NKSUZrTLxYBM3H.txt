I know the truth behind you, there is nothing but fear
Hiding behind violence I felt year after year
Searching for someone to pay Darwin's price
Laughter echoes while you savour my cries

I can't forget it - the pain and the dirt that I had to swallow
This is the limit - the soul you rape will once be strong
You never get it - the tears of the past are the hate of tomorrow
Cursed Soulcrusher

There's no escape, everyday is a treadmill of pain
Working so hard for respect, but it all was in vain
No one would help little chaps picked half-dead
It's evolution, the strongest survive

I can't forget it - the pain and the dirt that I had to swallow
This is the limit - the soul you rape will once be strong
You never get it - the tears of the past are the hate of tomorrow
Cursed Soulcrusher

There's a refuge for me, but only in my mind
Outside it's raging on, on and on

Abusing for lust, instinct thirst for blood
Hunting day by day - tears will run dry to hate
For the weakest one is hacked till it's done
Till it's falling out of the nest, dead and gone
This sublime system of pure selection
Guarded carefully by the lies unquestioned
It is living on - it is killing on
While the protectors just watch

Do you really wonder when sometimes the revenge is on you?
