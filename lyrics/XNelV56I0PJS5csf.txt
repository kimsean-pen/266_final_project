Waiting for your call, I'm sick
Call, I'm angry
Call, I'm desperate for your voice
Listening to the song we used to sing in the car
Do you remember, Butterfly, Early Summer
It's playing on repeat
Just like when we would meet
Like when we would meet

'Cause I was born to tell you I love you
And I am torn to do what I have to
To make you mine
Stay with me tonight

Stripped and polished, I am new, I am fresh
I am feeling so ambitious
You and me, flesh to flesh
'Cause every breath that you will take
While you are sitting next to me
Will bring life into my deepest hopes
What's your fantasy?
What's your, what's your, what's your
What's your

'Cause I was born to tell you I love you
And I am torn to do what I have to
To make you mine
Stay with me tonight

And I'm tired of being all alone
And this solitary moment
Makes me want to come back home

And I'm tired of being all alone
And this solitary moment
Makes me want to come back home

And I'm tired of being all alone
And this solitary moment
Makes me want to come back home

And I'm tired of being all alone
And this solitary moment
Makes me want to come back home

'Cause I was born to tell you I love you
And I am torn to do what I have to
'Cause I was born to tell you I love you
And I am torn to do what I have to
To make you mine
Stay with me tonight
