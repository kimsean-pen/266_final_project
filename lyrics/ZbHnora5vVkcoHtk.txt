I told you I have to go
Not pretend I really know
I've got mad to get to the center of the storm
Of your name still carved into my bones
My sister peel, one in the same
Calls me senseless to her side
But on the place between the trains
You'll be a star within my sky

Unfinished business
Unfinished business
I'm not finished with this
This thing between just you and I

But for now don't wait for me
Cause I'll see you in my dreams
You'll be wearing red and I'll be wearing green
But for now don't wait for me

Unfinished business
Unfinished business
I'm not finished with this
This thing between just you and me

The rocks we sat on
They are still there right now
They are still there right now

Unfinished business
Unfinished business
I'm not finished with this
This thing between just you and me
