He brought her flowers on a Monday
Tuesday they spent all day in bed
Wednesday it rained
And Thursday was a river
Of the kind of words
She wished he hadn't said

He left her on a Friday
Her Saturday was shot
The bells in the cathedral rang on Sunday
But Monday flowers were all she got
He loved her
Then he loved her not

Some girls fall in love for money
Some girls are happy on their own
Some girls just want a man to hold them in their arms
Some girls go out at night
Some girls like staying home

He brought her flowers on a Monday
Tuesday they kept the curtains closed
Wednesday it rained
And Thursday was a river
Pulling petals down
From a single rose

He left her on a Friday
Her Saturday was shot
The bells in the cathedral rang on Sunday
But Monday flowers were all she got
He loved her
Then he loved her not

She woke up brave on Monday
To an empty window box
By Friday she was ready for the weekend
Monday flowers she forgot
She loved him
Then she loved him not
She loved him
Then she loved him not
