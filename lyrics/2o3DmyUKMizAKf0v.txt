Mrs. Lennon, oh Mrs. Lennon
Checking the sky to see if there's no clouds
There's no clouds
Oh then, I guess it must be alright

Mrs. Lennon, oh Mrs. Lennon
Making the tea and watching the sea
There's no waves
Oh then, I guess it must be alright

Silver spoon, oh silver spoon
I lost my silver spoon

And our children, oh our children
Did they have to go to war?
Yes, my love, it's okay
Half the world is always killed you know

Husband John extended his hand
Extended his hand to his wife
And he finds, and suddenly he finds
That he has no hands

They've lost their bodies
They've lost their bodies
Yes, they lost their bodies

Neither of them, oh neither of them
Ever left each other
Yes, my love, it's okay
Half the world is always dying you know
