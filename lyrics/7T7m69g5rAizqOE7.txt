Love hurts, love scars
Love wounds, and mars any heart
Not tough nor strong enough
To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud, holds a lot of rain
Love hurts... ooh, ooh love hurts

I'm young, I know, but even so
I know a thing or two, and I learned from you
I really learned a lot, really learned a lot
Love is like a stone, it burns you when it's hot
Love hurts... Ooh, ooh love hurts

Some fools rave of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess
They're not foolin' me

I know it isn't true, know it isn't true
Love is just a lie, made to make you blue
Love hurts...
Love hurts...
