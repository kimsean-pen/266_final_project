Breathe just keep breathing I tell myself
That it was all just a dream
No a nightmare I can't breathe
Falling false hope I had become lost
Always felt like I was the one who was forgot
A little worn a little torn

Bright lights it's getting hard to breathe
Black dreams pull me from underneath
Why don't you save me, save me?
Why don't you save me, save me?

Fake love, you took the missing piece
Eyes shut, forgetting what I believe
Why don't you save me, save me?
Why don't you save me, save me?
(Why don't you save me, save me?)

It was never as simple as black and white
I feel like I lost myself in life
I see you looking, looking back at me
I feel like you know me better than I know myself
I wish I knew myself that well

Bright lights it's getting hard to breathe
Black dreams pull me from underneath
Why don't you save me, save me?
Why don't you save me, save me?

Fake love, you took the missing piece
Eyes shut, forgetting what I believe
Why don't you save me, save me?
Why don't you save me, save me?

I've put you through hell and back
And I watched you fall between the cracks
I've put you through hell and back
And I watched you fall between the cracks

Why don't you save me, save me?
Why don't you save me, save me?
Why don't you save me, save me?
Why don't you save me, save me?

Fake love, you took the missing piece
Eyes shut, forgetting what I believe
Why don't you save me, save me?
Why don't you save me, save me?
