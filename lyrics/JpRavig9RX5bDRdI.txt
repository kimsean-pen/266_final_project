Lost in a fog
groaning an ode to a clear moon.
An empty song,
a flash of light in the storming.
Dawn
remembered
as a blade.
A stream
cutting
the world awake.
The only light:
imagined clear moon in a black sky.
A distant bell:
imagined clear moon in a black sky.
Through a wall of fog:
clear moon remembered.
I breathe in.
Imagined clear moon in a black sky.
