You say you've never seen the light before
Does anyone believe you?
Don't let them hear you say any more
Nothing's really safe around here

We are an imitation of the crown
We never turn the pages
They cannot let your spirit touch the ground
And nothing's going to change around here, no

Crack in the ceiling, hole in the wall
They bend you over but you won't crawl away
You've got two in the bushes, one in the hand
They'd make you over but they can't understand you
You're always going to be the wild one

Pretend that all you really feel is pain
Just hide behind some sorrow
How sad but you'd do it all again
Nobody changes around here

Cat in the cradle, man in the moon
They'd make you over but it's too soon to know, no
I smell smoke in the kitchen, fire in the hall
The train is coming and you can hear it calling
You're always going to be the wild one
Wild, wild one

Crack in the ceiling, hole in the wall
They bend you over now you won't crawl away
You've got two in the bushes, one in the hand
They'd make you over but they can't understand you
You're always going to be the wild one
Wild, wild, wild, wild one
