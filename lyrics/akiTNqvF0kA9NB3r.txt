Communication's never been
as easy as today
and it would make me happy
when you've gone so far away
if you'd send me an e-mail
that says 'I love you'
Send me an e-mail
that says 'I love you'

Now time and distance
melt away
No digital delay
And some things
can be written down
that we're too shy to say
Send me an e-mail
that says 'I love you'
Send me an e-mail
that says 'I love you'

There may be other
temptations in your life
Don't want to add more
complications to your life
but I'm sending this e-mail
to say 'I love you'

Now there's a ghost
within this house
You're haunting me tonight
I'm looking at some photographs
and thinking that I might
jump on a plane
and surprise you where
you are
but do you want me there?
I'm so insecure
but one thing would make me sure
if you'd
send me an e-mail
that says 'I love you'
Send me an e-mail
that says 'I love You'
