Miles
and miles
and miles

Before we reach the sand

Cacti
and cacti
and cacti
for miles
miles of dry land, dry land

We gonna make it
Oooh we gonna make it
We gonna take it
Oooh we gonna take it

Easy
Once we feel the sea breeze

My my my my my my my lover
My maker
My breaker

Take me by the hand
We could go walking for miles
Once we reach the sand
the sand

We gonna make it
Oooh we gonna make it
We gonna take it
Oooh we gonna take it

Easy
Once we leave the city

We gonna make it
Oooh we gonna make it
We gonna take it
Oooh we gonna take it

We gonna make it
Yeah, we gonna make it
Easy
easy

We gonna make it
Oooh we gonna make it
We gonna take it
Oooh we gonna take it

Easy
