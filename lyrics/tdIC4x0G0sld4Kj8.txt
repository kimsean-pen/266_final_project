Baby I'm in love
Baby I'm in love

Ah, don't be checking me
Baby I ain't free
Maybe on my own but
I'm not alone
I got, I got a good thing
Doesn't really matter boy what you have
I don't need no rock to be off the block
No more tears you bring, gonna change a thing
What we have is so real
You don't need to prove to me how he feels

'Cause I'm in too deep
To blow a good thing
And one nice mischief
Could cost me everything thing I want

'Cause baby, I'm in love with the one I'm with
Sorry if you don't approve
I've got plans with the one I'm with
They're a lifetime of being true
Maybe in a different place of time
Maybe that I might've changed my mind
But it's like this
Baby I'm in love with the one I'm with

I'm in love I'm in love
I'm in love I'm in love

It's the cheapest talk and the foolish walk
To be running games, and be hiding things
Behind the one you love's back
Don't be doing him, wrong like that
Yes it's flattering that you're feeling me
But I got to say that it's all for me
There's nothing that I will do (nothing I will do)
To run the risk of losing him over you

'Cause I'm in too deep
To blow a good thing
And one nice mischief
Could cost me everything thing I want

'Cause baby I'm in love with the one I'm with
Sorry if you don't approve
I've got plans with the one I'm with
They're a lifetime of being true
Maybe in a different place of time
Maybe that I might've changed my mind
But it's like this
Baby I'm in love with the one I'm with

I'm in love I'm in love
I'm in love I'm in love

'Cause my heart
Is taken by the one
That I got
And I am gonna prove
That you can trust someone
The one you love

'Cause baby I'm in love with the one I'm with
Sorry if you don't approve
I've got plans with the one I'm with
They're a lifetime of being true
Maybe in a different place of time
Maybe that I might've changed my mind
But it's like this
Baby I'm in love with the one I'm with

Oh baby I'm in love with the one I'm with

I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love
