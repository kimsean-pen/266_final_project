There's a house with no door and I'm living there
At nights it gets so cold and the days are hard to bear inside
There's a house with no roof, so the rain creeps in
Falling through my head as I try to think out time

I don't know you, you say you know me, that may be so
There's so much that I am unsure of
You call my name, but it sounds unreal, I forget how I feel
My body's rejecting the cure

There's a house with no bell, but then nobody calls
I sometimes find it hard to tell if any are alive at all, outside
There's a house with no sound, yes, it's quiet there
There's not much point in words if there's no one to share in time

I've learned my lines, I know them so well, I am ready to tell
Whoever will finally come in
Of the line in my mind that's cold in the night, it doesn't seem right
When there's that little dark figure, running, somebody help me

There's a house with no door, there's no living there
One day it became a wall, well I didn't really care at the time
There's a house with no light, all the windows are sealed
Overtaxed and strained

Now nothing is revealed, but time
I don't know you, you say you know me, that may be so
There's so much that I am unsure of
You call my name, but it sounds unreal, I forget how I feel
My body's rejecting the cure, won't somebody help me
