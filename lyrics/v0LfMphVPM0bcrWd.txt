And I've heard what you've been
Thinking 'bout lately
And I can't say I
I haven't thought it too
And I know that it's on
And all of these things in the way
But you know that I'll be
I'm down when you choose me

She don't
She don't know why
Why she can't, hide
What it feels like
And it's 'cause

She's got the fever
I'm gonna tease her
I gotta see her
She's got the fever

And you've been checking
To see if I've called all day
And I've been drinking
Thinking what move to make
And since I came through
I know that you felt it too
And I want to know
Tell me the things that you've been through

And she don't
She don't know why
Why she can't hide
What it feels like
And it's 'cause

She don't
She don't know why
Why she can't hide
What it feels like
And it's 'cause

She's got the fever
I'm gonna tease her
I gotta see her
She's got the fever

And she don't
She don't know why
Why she can't hide
What it feels like
And it's 'cause

She don't
She don't know why
Why she can't hide
What it feels like
And it's 'cause

She's got the fever
I'm gonna tease her
I've gotta see her
She's got the fever
