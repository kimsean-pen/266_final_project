Sitting, staring,
watching all you leave
behind this
There is nothing
which has so much more to give
I lost
I lost you

You're putting down the memories
as if a nothing
has something more to give
I lost
I lost you

Who beats the clock for us?
Who was pretending us?
Don't scoff at us

Still sitting, staring, watching
how love had to live
and no more things to give

I lost
I really lost you
