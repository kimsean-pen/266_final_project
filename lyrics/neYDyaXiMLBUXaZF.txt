You ain't alone, so why you lonely?
There you go on the dark end of the street
Are you scared to tell somebody how you feel about somebody?
Are you scared what somebody's gonna think?
Or are you scared to wear your heart out on your sleeve?
Are you scared of me?
'Cause I'm scared the bomb gonna take me away

Oh, but I really don't know what I got to say
Alright, alright, alright, alright!
1-2-3, are you too scared to dance for me?

Bite the bullet or tug my sleeve?
Or are you scared out on your own two feet?
We really ain't that different, you and me

'Cause I'm scared the storm gonna take me away
But I really don't know what I got to say

Oh, alright, hold on, hold on, hold on
Cry, if you gonna cry
Come on, cry with me
Cry, if you gonna cry
Come on, cry with me
You ain't alone
Just let me be your ticket home
