It begins with them, but ends with me
Their son, Vaxus

Here, emotions behold
You've entered a Hell
Where the Devil is made of gold
Please, don't run your mouth
The questions before have no place in this haunted house
Reveal your selfish pleasure
One more time run for good measure
In the answer you hold
Time would be better off if our souls had been sold

Here where the light only dies to remember
In a place where the blind truly can see
Hear my voice dearly departed
I beg on my knees
It's been my pleasure
To serve your disease

Welcome home
Shed your skin and expose your bones
Take my hand
And follow us into the black
So far that we can't get back

Here, dig me a grave
And toss in the lives that you can't be bothered to save
With their blood on your hands
You enjoy the sun while you shit in the purest sand
Kiss your lover with that filthy mouth you fucking monster
Here as evil now gropes
It's caught us off guard with its hand reaching for our throats

Here where the light only dies to remember
In a place where the blind truly can see
Hear my voice dearly departed
I beg on my knees
It's been my pleasure
To serve your disease

Welcome home
Shed your skin and expose your bones
Take my hand
And follow us into the black
So far that we can't get back

There's no telling when the truth is clear
Pay it no mind
Lines were drawn for us
For all sides
In the afterglow
Echoes of time unfold
Give me your word my dear
And promise you won't let go

It's a shame I fear
For men to start
We walk their lines
All to play the fucking part
Shame I fear
For men to start
We walk their lines
All to play the fucking part

I fear we've got all we had wanted
Close your eyes and believe it didn't happen
Now shut your mouth beyond your lies
The world knows to stay away from you
In the blood you let run
They march as you lead
We laugh in the sun
Maybe that's all we need
I, and I, and I'm sorry
You can't escape

Here where the light only dies to remember
In a place where the blind truly can see
Hear my voice dearly departed
I beg on my knees
It's been my pleasure
To serve your disease

Welcome home
Shed your skin and expose your bones
Take my hand
And follow us into the black
So far that we can't get back

Welcome home

Welcome home
