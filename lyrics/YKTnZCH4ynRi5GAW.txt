Dark child
Hey baby

If I told you that, I wanted to see you
And if I told you that, I beg to please you
If I told you that, I'll always keep you
What would you say? If I told you that

Now tell me how you feel
If I told you that I have feelings for you, baby?
And would it be so wrong to say what's on my mind?
I'm sorry I have to, baby baby

We were friends but with time
What I feel deep inside for you has changed
But I'd give up on love, if I thought
That it was untrue for you

If I told you that, I wanted to see you
And if I told you that, I beg to please you
If I told you that, I'll always keep you
What would you say? If I told you that

I know that we are just friends
But what if I decide to bring something in? Oh yeah
I hope it won't offend the trust we have
'Cause I don't want this to end, no no no baby

If you think that we'll lose what we have
Then I'd just rather stay the same
'Cause I don't want to choose
Between two of the most precious things to me

If I told you that, I wanted to see you
And if I told you that, I beg to please you
If I told you that, I'll always keep you
What would you say? If I told you that

If we take this chance
And extend to each other, romance
And I hope it would be
The right thing for you and me, oh yeah

If I told you that, I wanted to see you
And if I told you that, I beg to please you
If I told you that, I'll always keep you
What would you say? If I told you that

If I told you that, I wanted to see you
And if I told you that, I beg to please you
If I told you that, I'll always keep you
What would you say? If I told you that

Would you be there for me?
Could you dare to hold me?
Will my feelings leave me
Lonely, if I told you?

If I told you that, I wanted to see you
And if I told you that, I beg to please you
If I told you that, I'll always keep you
What would you say? If I told you that

Would you be there for me?
Could you dare to hold me?
Will my feelings leave me
Lonely, if I told you?

Would you be there for me?
