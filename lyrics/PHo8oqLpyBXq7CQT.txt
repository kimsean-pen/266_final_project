Fast as the wind
The Invasion has begun
Shaking the ground
With a force of 1000 guns

First in the line of fire
First into hostile land
Tanks leading the way
Leading the way

Charging the lines with a force of a furious storm
Fast as the lightning phantom's swarm
200 miles at nightfall taken within a day
Thus earning their name, earning their fame

They are the Panzer Elite
Born to compete
Never retreat
(Ghost Division)
Leaving or dead
Always ahead
Fed by your dread

Always ahead as the Blitzkrieg rages on
Breaking morale with the sound of blazing guns
First in the line of fire
First into hostile land
Tanks leading the way
Leading the way

Leaving a trail of destruction through a foreign land
(Waging war with conviction)
Massive assault made to serve the Nazi plan
(Wehrmacht's pride, ghost division)
Communication's broken
Phantoms are far away
Thus earning their name, earning their fame

They are the Panzer Elite
Born to compete
Never retreat
(Ghost Division)
Leaving or dead
Always ahead
Fed by your dread

Pushing the frontline forth with a tremendous force
(Far ahead, breaks resistance)
Crushing the way for Panzer Corps
(Shows no fear, self-subsistent)
First in the line of fire
First into hostile land
Tanks leading the way
Claiming the fame

They are the Panzer Elite
Born to compete
Never retreat
(Ghost Division)
Leaving or dead
Always ahead
Fed by your dread

Panzer Elite
Born to compete
Never retreat
(Ghost Division)
Living or dead
Always ahead
Fed by your dread
