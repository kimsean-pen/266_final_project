Coals under foot
Burst into flames
Become the Earth's
Ashes remain

Awaiting sand
A burning man

Approach the door
Where I place blame
Take the first step
Cleansing my shame

Awaiting sand
A burning man

Coals under foot
Burst into flames
Become the Earth's
Ashes remain

Awaiting sand
A burning man

Approach the door
Where I place blame
Take the first step
Cleansing my shame

Awaiting sand
A burning man
