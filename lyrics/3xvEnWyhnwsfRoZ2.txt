Got a feeling in my head
Feels like thunder overhead
Intoxicated, can't stop the flow
This love is poison, but it's like gold

Give me direction out of the fold
Show me affection, I'll sell ya' my soul

It's official, You're fantastic
You're so special (So special), So iconic (So iconic)
You're the focus (The focus), of attention (Attention)
But you don't want it (You don't want it), cause you're so honest

If you break me, will you fix me?
And if I'm missing, will you miss me?
I'll regret it til' the day I die
Until you knew it was in my head

Feels like thunder, it's getting cold
This love is poison, but it's like gold

It's official, You're fantastic
You're so special (So special), So iconic (So iconic)
You're the focus (The focus), of attention (Attention)
But you don't want it (You don't want it), cause you're so honest (You don't want it)

You don't want it

It's official, You're fantastic
You're so special (So special), So iconic (So iconic)
You're the focus (The focus), of attention (Attention)
But you don't want it (You don't want it), cause you're so honest (You don't want it)

One of these days, one of these days
Right when you want me, baby, I'll be gone
Cause you're like plastic, you're artificial
You don't mean nothing, baby, so superficial
