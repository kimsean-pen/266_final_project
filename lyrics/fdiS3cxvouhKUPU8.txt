Do you believe in heaven above
Do you believe in love
Don't tell a lie don't be false and untrue
It all comes back to you

Open fire!
On my burning heart
I've never been lucky in love
My defences are down
A kiss or a frown
I can't survive on my own

If a girl walks in and carves her name in my heart
I'll turn and run away
Everyday we've all been led astray
It's hard to be lucky in love

It gets in your eyes
It's making you cry
Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do
You're looking for love
Calling heaven above

Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now, right now

Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now, right now

Empty dreams can only disapoint
In a room behind your smile
But don't give up
Don't give up
You can be lucky in love

It gets in your eyes
It's making you cry
Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do
You're looking for love
Calling heaven above

Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now, right now

Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now, right now

Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now, right now

Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now, right now, right now
