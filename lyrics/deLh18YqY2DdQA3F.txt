Right from the start, he lured me in
Took me the places that I've never been
I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love
He might have bent me but I didn't break
He rearranged the map I made
But I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love
Now am I crazy, why can no one understand
That i'll never find a better man? (oh no)
I'm just imagining a life without my baby
And I know, I know
This life ain't meant to be live without him
Without him
I know, I know
this life ain't meant to be live without him
Without him
This life ain't meant to be live without him
Without him
I know
They say this is America
Free speach, free will
But I don't even care at all
Can't seem to fight this
Needing him every day and night
Why can't I just try to speak my mind to him
Tell him all the things that he probably thought was coming
But didn't want him thinking that
I'm trying rush him
Please dear God give me the words
Cause you know my tongue ties
As soon as I see him, blushing
I get my thoughts put it on a page
I might get to find a way out the maze
That I built for myself
In some kind of haze
And if the right words come to me one by one
I hope he tells me that he loves me the same
I hope he don't laugh or worse, walk away
Cause the honest to God
Truth of the matter is
I just can't live my life without you
(without you)
Right from the start, he lured me in
Took me the places that I've never been
I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love (oh no, oh no)
He might have bent me but I didn't break
He rearranged the map I made
But I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love (oh oh no, oh no)
Now am I crazy, why can no one understand
that I'll never find a better man? (oh no, oh no)
I'm just imagining a life without my baby
And I know, I know
this life ain't meant to be live without him
Without him
This life ain't meant to be live without him
Without him
I know
I'm not one to really talk at all
Speak up only when the time is right
Or when it call for the big guns
Problem is where to speak from
I hear it's your heart that does all the talking
Hurry up you got no time to waste
Cause this is the man I'm loving for always
And the honest to God
Truth of the matter
I just can't see my life going on without you
Now am i crazy, why can no one understand
that i'll never find a better man?
(oh no, oh no no no no)
I'm just imagining a life without my baby
And I know, I know
this life ain't meant to be live
without him without him
this life ain't meant to be live
without him without him
I know
