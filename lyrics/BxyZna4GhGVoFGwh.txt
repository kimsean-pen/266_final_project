Ooooh oooh ooooh
Ooooh oooh ooooh
Ooooh oooh ooooh
Ooooh oooh ooooh

Into the night
Desperate and broken
The sound of a fight
Father has spoken

We were the Kings and Queens of promise
We were the victims of ourselves
Maybe the children of a lesser God
Between Heaven and Hell
Heaven and Hell

Into your eyes
Hopeless and taken
We stole our new lives
Through blood and name
In defense of our dreams
In defense of our dreams

We were the Kings and Queens of promise
We were the victims of ourselves
Maybe the children of a lesser God
Between Heaven and Hell
Heaven and Hell

The age of man is over
A darkness comes at dawn
These lessons that we've learned here
Have only just begun

We were the Kings and Queens of promise
We were the victims of ourselves
Maybe the children of a lesser God
Between Heaven and Hell

We are the Kings
We are the Queens
We are the Kings
We are the Queens
