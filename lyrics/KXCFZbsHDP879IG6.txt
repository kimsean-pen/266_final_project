I wanna be the one you call, every day and night
Are you gonna be the one who's always gonna treat me right
And when we get together turning down the lights
Need you 100 percent ah
I wanna be the one you tell all your friends about
Baby I'll be the one you just can't do without
You gotta give me everything, baby ain't no doubt
Give me 100, need you 100 percent
I wanna be the one you call, every day and night
Are you gonna be the one who's always gonna treat me right
And when we get together turning down the lights
Need you 100 percent ah
I wanna be the one you tell all your friends about
Baby I'll be the one you just can't do without
You gotta give me everything, baby ain't no doubt
Give me 100, need you 100 percent
Need you 100, need you 100 percent
