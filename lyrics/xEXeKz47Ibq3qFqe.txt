Now won't you run and tell your boyfriend
Tell him don't hold his breath for me
I got some money I was savin'
Got some hearts that I'll be breakin'
Know someday they'll make a martyr out of me
I know someday they'll make a martyr out of me

(She's so fine)

And I like sometimes to wave it high
Up where everyone can see
I'm a lady
Got my mind made up
Got my mind made up
I know I spend magic, reel it out
Try to hold a light to me
I'm a lady
Got my mind made up
Got my mind made up

I like to watch the way the wind blows
What does it know that I don't yet?
Oh oh, look so pretty now, you're just so sweet
But see how far you can get
See just how far you can get

(She's so fine)

And I like sometimes to wave it high
Up where everyone can see
I'm a lady
Got my mind made up
Got my mind made up
I know I spend magic, reel it out
Try to hold a light to me
I'm a lady
Got my mind made up
Got my mind made up

And the dream's all gone
And the dream's all gone
No one said no, no one said
Make something with what's in your head
And the dream's all gone
And the dream's all gone

And I like sometimes to wave it high
Up where everyone can see
I'm a lady
Got my mind made up
Got my mind made up
I know I spend magic, reel it out
Try to hold a light to me
I'm a lady
Got my mind made up
Got my mind made up

And I like sometimes to wave it high
Up where everyone can see
I'm a lady
Got my mind made up
Got my mind made up
I know I spend magic, reel it out
Try to hold a light to me
I'm a lady
Got my mind made up
Got my mind made up

(Got my mind made up)
(Got my mind made up)
(Got my mind made up)
(Got my mind made up, got my mind made up)
(Got my mind made up)
(Got my mind made up)
(Got my mind made up)
(Got my mind made up, got my mind made up)

And I like sometimes to wave it high
Up where everyone can see
I'm a lady
