Before loneliness will break my heart,
send me a postcard darling.
How can I make you understand?
I wanna be a woman.
Here, here I'm waiting for a little sign,
waiting 'til the end of time.
Send me a postcard darling.
Send me a poscard now.
Send me a postcard darling.
Send me a postcard now.
I can't take the lonely night,
I need someone I can turn to.
Look out the day I see a little sign,
I want to know if you're all mine (?).
Yeah, oh please don't let me down.
There ain't no lover like me in town.
Send me a postcard darling.
Send me a poscard now.
Send me a postcard darling.
Send me a postcard now.
Before loneliness will break my heart,
