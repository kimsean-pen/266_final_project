In my sleep, I tell myself
Anything, everything
When I wake, my lips are sealed
No words said, no words said
I fray like worn-out threads
The more I fret, the less I mend
I've lost faith in everything
Everything, everything
I can see right through myself
No one there, no one there
Now I know why everyone has
Turned away from my despair
I sense I've let down friends
All mistakes, all I've said
I've lost faith in everything
Everything, everything
You really gotta stop this now
You let yourself get too far gone
When you stray from the ones who love you
It gets so hard to find your way back home
Life is so complicated
Don't let your hopes and dreams disappear
Baby, we all lose faith in troubled times
You know I'm gonna be right here
Every day, I ask myself
How and when does sadness end?
Many ways to hurt myself
Lost again, lost again
I know I let down friends
Last mistake, no time left
I've lost faith in everything
Everything, everything
You really gotta stop this now
This is your last chance to turn around
I know we all lose faith from time to time
You better find your way back now
Maybe this hurricane is made of silver
Maybe the hills we climb are laced with gold
And we all lose faith in troubled times
But you gotta find your way back home
In my sleep, I tell myself
Anything, everything
