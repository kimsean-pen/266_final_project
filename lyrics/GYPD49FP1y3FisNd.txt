Eat, drink and be merry
For tomorrow we die
Eat electricity
Drink five of the seven seas
Here is a paralysed sleet
Here is a bubble bath rain
Acrid stench and festering tongue
New York, Moscow, Nairobi in flames

I don't know either, what is the answer?
We were told to expect more
And now that we've got more
We want more, we want more

We have moved from A to X
This welfare state is our progress
The size of it all carries us all along
More equals better, it's what we want
Our energy is endless it seems
It's there when we need it
We've got men on the job

We finance clinics to research
A cure for cancer, our least vague fear
A new kind of water
A new way of breathing
Always somehow a wonder cure all
Turns up when we need it
We've got men on the job

You know from experience
The creature comforts, a house that's warm
Your body would choose all this
Of course! It's innate we're selfish
But what if there's not enough to go round?
Defence is needed
We've got some odd men in odd jobs

We have moved from A to Z
This nuclear state is our demise
Fly away Peter, hide away Paul
Who can watch as the earth burns, shatters and dies?
Failsafe, foolproof, we've heard that before
Good sense is needed
Let's hope we've got men on the job
