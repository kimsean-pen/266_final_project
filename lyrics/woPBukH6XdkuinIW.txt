Are you ready to ride?
Put it in gear and drive
Rolling cool and high
And I am in skies

Can I fuck with you, baby? (I said)
Can I fuck with you, baby? (And no)
You're driving me crazy (I said)
Baby let me fuck with you, 'cause I know you love the shit I do

Come and get it (get it get it)
But only if you with it (with it with it)
It's getting late (late)
Baby, I can't wait

Are you ready to ride?
Put it in gear and drive
Rolling cool and high
And I am in skies

Can I fuck with you, baby? (I said)
Can I fuck with you, baby? (And no)
You're driving me crazy (I said)
Baby let me fuck with you, 'cause I know you love the shit I do

Come and get it (get it get it)
But only if you with it (with it with it)
It's getting late (late)
Baby, I can't wait

Are you ready to ride? (Oh oh, oh oh)
Put it in gear and drive (Oh oh, oh oh)
Rolling cool and high (Oh oh, oh oh)
And I am in skies (Oh oh, oh oh)
