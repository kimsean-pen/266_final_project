From the first time I saw you
I knew that you would be mine on day
Was something like a movie sceen watching you
Walking out of the sea
In slow motion water running down your chest is all I can see
You run your finger through you hair

Oh boy you are playing with my head

Drop it down low
Let me see you take my boody
To the ground now
Take it down town

Suave suave you rock bout
Caliente caliente you want some more
Move with the waves dont let me go
I am loca for you mi amor

I am loca loca
For you mi amor

Drop it down low
Let me see you take my boody
To the ground now
Take it down town
