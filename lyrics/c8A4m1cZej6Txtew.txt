No one looked . . .
as I walked by
Just an invitation
would have been just fine
Said
no
to him . . .
. . . again and
again
First he took my heart
and then he
ran
No one knows
how I
feel
What I said
unless you read between
my lines
One man walked away
from me
First he took my
hand . . .
Take me home . .!
. . . Stand back . .!
Stand back . .!
In the middle of my room
I did not
hear from you
. . . It's alright . .!
it's alright . .!
To be standing in a line
. . . Standing in a line . . .
To be standing in a line
I would cry . .!
. . . .
Do not turn
away my friend
Like a willow
I can bare
No man
called my name
No man came
So I walked
on down
away from
you
Maybe your attention
was more
than you could
do
One man . . .
did not call
He asked me for my
love
that was all
. . . Stand back . .!
Stand back . .!
In the middle of my room
I did not
hear from
you
. . . It's alright,
it's alright . .!
To be standing in a line
. . . Standing in a line . . .
To be standing in a line
I would cry . . .
. . . .
So I walked
on down the line for you
Maybe your intention
was more then
I could do
One man
did not fall
Well he asked me for
my love
that was all
. . . Stand back . .!
Stand back . .!
In the middle of my room
I did not hear
from you
. . . It's alright,
it's alright . .!
Well, you could be standing in . . .
Standing in a line . . .
You could be standing in a line
I would cry
Need a little . . .
. . . need a little sympathy
Well I need a little sympathy
Cry . . .
I need a little sympathy
Well, you could be standing in . . .
Stand back . .!
Well, you could be standing in . . .
Stand back . .!
Well, you could be standing in . . .
Stand back . .!
Take me home . .!
. . . Take me home . .!
Stand back . .!
Why don't you take
me home . .!
Well I need a little sympathy . . .
Stand back . .!
Well, you could be standing in . . .
Stand back . .!
Why don't you
take
me home . .!
Why, don't you
take
me home . .!
Stand back . .!
Take
me home . .!
It's alright . .!
Take
It's alright . .!
me home . .!
Yea . .!
