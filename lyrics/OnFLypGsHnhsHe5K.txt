When you lit that pipe,
it caused me a terrible fright.
The flame burned my hand,
I kicked my leg, you took my hand.

If you're on the water, water, water, water, water beware.
If you're on the water, water, water, water, water take care.

When you left that boat,
thought you'd sink if I couldn't float.
Would you lose your guilt,
if I was your daughter? Oh, father.

If you're on the water, water, water, water, water beware.
If you're on the water, water, water, water, water take care.

When you climbed that tree,
they should've never left you alone.
I wished I heard you shout.
I would've rushed down at the slightest sound.

If you're on the water, water, water, water, water beware.
If you're on the water, water, water, water, water take care.
