Roll down this way
They call that street by your name
With no doubt or shame
Or Shame

They call that street by your name
No ins, no outs
No ins, no outs
No ins, no outs
No ins

Wolves are discreet
No glory along the way
Never a game, a game

No glory along the way
No ins, no outs
No ins, no outs
No ins, no outs
No ins

Why can't they accept that you're living alone?
Because they don't understand that you're waging a war
And you can't understand why they're not by your side
But you can't break your stride
No you can't break your stride because
Everything, everything, everything's horrible
Everything, everything, everything dies
Everything, everything, everything's horrible
Everything, everything, everything, everything
Dies

No ins, no outs
No ins, no outs
No ins, no outs
No ins, no outs
