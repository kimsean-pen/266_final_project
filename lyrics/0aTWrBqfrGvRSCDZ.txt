You're too far to bring you close
And too high to see below
Just hanging on your daily dose

I know you never needed anyone
But the rolling papers for your grass
How can you give what you don't have?

You keep on aiming for the top
And quit before you sweat a drop
I feed your empty brain with your hydroponic pot

I bet you'll find someone like you
'Cause there's a foot for every shoe
And I wish you luck, but I've other things to do

I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain
But you're so in love with yourself
If I say "my heart is sore"
Sounds like a cheap metaphor
I won't repeat it no more

I'd rather eat my soup with a fork
Or drive a cab in New York
'Cause to talk to you is harder work

What's the point of wasting all my words?
If it's just the same or even worse
Than reading poems to a horse

You keep on aiming for the top
And quit before you sweat a drop
I feed your empty brain with your hydroponic pot

I bet you'll find someone like you
'Cause there's a foot for every shoe
And I wish you luck, but I've other things to do

I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain
But you're so in love with yourself
If I say "my heart is sore"
Sounds like a cheap metaphor
So I won't repeat it no more

I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain
But you're so in love, so in love with yourself
If I say "my heart is sore"
Sounds like a cheap metaphor
So I won't repeat it no more

I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain
But you're so in love, so in love with yourself
If I say "my heart is sore"
Sounds like a cheap metaphor
So I won't repeat it no more
