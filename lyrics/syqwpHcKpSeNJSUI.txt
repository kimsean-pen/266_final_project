He stares at the sky
Humbled by what he does not know
One looming eye
Its secrets still beyond his hold

"Why do you choose to taunt us so?"
"What earthly discourse could you know"
Fruitlessly reap and sow
Anointed in the sand below

Conduit; the sun speaks to you
In consummate form this child now is imbued
Collective incumbent, the way revealed to you
This congregation folds upon the grains that you choose

Born of the sand
The scraping masses of life
Born of the sun
May they be lifted on high
Born of the blood
Their sacrifice to the circles, when they are brought to the stone

Those born of blood, sand, stone
They have no right
Transcending what is known
I am the light

I am the sun
And I am the moon once told of
Empty my skin, I am ready
I am the sun
I am the moon
Empty your skin
I am ready

Born in the ash and then lead to the surface
Our day will never end
Born in the ash and then lead to the surface
The monarchy of the sun
Born in the ash and then lead to the surface
The sun will never set
Born in the ash and then lead to the surface
I am the way and the truth

Born of the sand
The scraping masses of life
Born of the sun
May they be lifted on high
Born of the blood
Their sacrifice to the circles, when they are brought to the stone.

I am the sun
And I am the moon once told of
Empty my skin, I am ready... for aeons to come

I am the sun
I am the moon
