He-hey
I was sitting all alone, yeah
A lot on my mind
I felt a tap on my shoulder
And I roll my eyes
I wasn't in the mood for another man
Telling me lies
But how can a girl say no when you flash that sexy smile

And you say
Uh huh, ay hey (eeey)
Wanna see you get nasty (Is that right?)
Wanna see you shake it down, babe (ayy)
He-hey

N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you just my type (boy you're just so nasty)
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby, I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you just my type

In the middle of the floor now
I just don't care
See my body so low now
The crowd stops and stares
Let 'em say what they want but I'm feelin' it
And it's for you baby
Tell me how can a girl say no when you calling out to me

And you say
Uh huh, ay hey (eeey)
Wanna see you get nasty (Is that right?)
Wanna see you shake it down babe (ayy)
He-hey

N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you just my type (boy you're just so nasty)
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby, I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you're just my type

What's your fantasy? (Ooh nasty, nasty)
Tell them all to me (ooh nasty, nasty)
Don't you be afraid (ooh nasty, nasty)
Share your nasty secrets baby, hey

Uh huh, ay hey (eeey)
Wanna see you get nasty (Is that right?)
Wanna see you shake it down babe (yeah)
He-hey

N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But boy you're just so nasty
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby, I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you just my type (boy, you're just so nasty)

N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby, I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you just so (dance this, hey)
