Now Daddy didn't like trouble
But if it came along
Everyone that knew him
Knew which side that he'd be on
He never was a hero
Or this county's shinin' light
But you could always find him standing up
For what he thought was right

He'd say you've got to stand for something
Or you'll fall for anything
You've got to be your own man
Not a puppet on a string
Never compromise what's right
And uphold your family name
You've got to stand for something
Or you'll fall for anything

Now we might have been better off
Or owned a bigger house
If Daddy had done more givin' in
Or a little more backing down
But we always had plenty
Just living his advice
Whatever you do today you'll have to sleep with tonight

He'd say you've got to stand for something
Or you'll fall for anything
You've got to be your own man
Not a puppet on a string
Never compromise what's right
And uphold your family name
You've got to stand for something
Or you'll fall for anything

Now I know that things are different
Than they were in Daddy's days
But I still believe what makes a man
Really hasn't changed

You've got to stand for something
Or you'll fall for anything
You've got to be your own man
Not a puppet on a string
Never compromise what's right
And uphold your family name
You've got to stand for something
Or you'll fall for anything

You've got to stand for something
Or you'll fall for anything
