I'm sick of following their rules that they set for me
Sick of following their rules they won't let me breathe
Sick of following their rules cause they're not for me
Not for me

I'm sick of following their rules
It's the last thing I'll ever do
Fighting everyday they want me just to be the same
I won't end up in this cage
I'll never live my life that way

Kickin' back they won't lock me in this cage
Kickin' back because I'm...

Sick of following their rules that they set for me
Sick of following their rules they won't let me breathe
Sick of following their rules cause they're not for me
Not for me

I'm sick of following their rules
Fighting their rules- sick of following
Fighting their rules- sick of following.

The last thing I'll ever do is follow you.
