I used to think being like you
Was a key to having everything
Every dream come true
I used to think following the crowd
Was the only thing that I could do
Until I found out

I'm okay (dig it)
Sometimes you gotta do your own thing (dig it)
Every Winter turns to Spring (get it)
And everybody's got their own wings

The little girl you knew
The one who never stood up to you
Who kept her silence too long
Well, she's gone with the wind
And now I'm standing my ground
Am who I am, and for that that I'm proud
And the girl that you knew
Well, she's gone with the wind

She's gone, gone
Well, she's gone, gone
She's gone, gone
Yeah, she's gone with the wind

I'm speaking up, my conscious is clear
And I don't care what anybodys thinks
I've released that fear
And I don't have to be what you want me to be
'Cause everytime I try to fit in
It feels like I'm in a prison

I'm okay (dig it)
Sometimes you gotta do your own thing (dig it)
Every Winter turns to Spring (get it)
And everybody's got their own wings

The little girl you knew
The one who never stood up to you
Who kept her silence too long
Well, she's gone with the wind
And now I'm standing my ground
Am who I am, and for that that I'm proud
And the girl that I was
Well, she's gone with the wind

She's gone, gone
Well, she's gone, gone
She's gone, gone
Well, she's gone with the wind

One look in my eyes
And you will see I'm different
I am finding myself everyday
And I'm on the way
I have changed

The little girl you knew
The one who never stood up to you
Who kept her silence too long
Well, she's gone with the wind
And now I'm standing my ground
Am who I am, and for that that I'm proud
And the girl that you knew
Well, she's gone with the wind

She's gone, gone
Well, she's gone, gone
She's gone, gone
Yeah, she's gone with the wind
