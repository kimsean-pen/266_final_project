I've been left out a while
I sold the family plot for time
I sold the only thing I like so I could taste it

You've been drinking all night
We both know when you're drunk the future rewinds
It happens every fucking time, but you erase it

All that I really wanted to do was leave it all
All that I really wanted to do was leave it all
For you

These are days that you finally find
That pure restitution is not on your side
There's never been a place to hid
You have to face it

Nobody thinks you're actually right
It feels like a battle it's more like a fight
You always bark you never bite
I don't believe you

All that I really wanted to do was leave it all
All that I really wanted to do was leave it up
To you

Let me make up my mind
Let me make up my mind
Let me make up my mind so I can change you

All that I really wanted to do was leave it all
All that I really wanted to do was leave it all
For you
