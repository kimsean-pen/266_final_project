I'm sorry for the time you spent waiting
For something that I knew I couldn't do
Watch me bury my secrets in a hole
Designed for me to fall into

I don't remember where we are
But I don't think it's very far
Build a house and pick your favorite color
To cut your hair, as if I could choose to be anyone

It's all so safe now
But when we met, things were scary
So I'm sorry if I acted brave
Because when we met, I was broken
With no intention of ending a game
That I still want to play
