It took a little longer than we hoped but it was worth it
Y'know it takes a village to raise a scheme
To patch the holes of the mausoleum
Well we're packing in the patronage like it's a lotto
(And everybody wins)
Now take a seat so the show can start
And will you welcome these works of art?
Isn't she beautiful?
No, maybe another one here could entertain
Oh yes, he said that every minutes worth the wait

Hey, it's a cry you can't contain
A release you couldn't estimate
And the secrets safe as long as you pay
It's so good to be so bad
You can leave it when you walk away
And pretend you've washed your hands of it

Last call for the Sunday spas and there's no room left for him and all
Will give a gift long overdue
And make a sultan or of you
That's right, yeah any troglodyte can have a life in the party as a socialite
Or if you look into my face
You can retire without a trace
Don't you bother with doubt

Hey, it's a cry you can't contain
A release you couldn't estimate
And the secrets safe as long as you pay
It's so good to be so bad
You can leave it when you walk away
And pretend you've washed your hands of it

Long was this road I've wandered
But short did my temperament slipped
Here I've helped you build a temple to deify this sorrowed state
Now who'd've blamed I for trying
If not someone had my wing
The noose would surely find me if I'm to widely
With what a life I've lived
The sail of a soul, it falls
As foolish as young resolve
It's better if I withdraw

Hey, it's a cry you can't contain
A release you couldn't estimate
And the secrets safe as long as you pay
It's so good to be so bad
You can leave it when you walk away
And pretend you've washed your hands of it
