With all these curves we might need to have the brakes looked at
So pop the hood and see what's good I need a toolin' man
My precious love I'm on a roll but my transmission's blown
I heard a thump and then a knock

I hear you work in a body shop
I hear you work in a body shop

You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on the line

You can polish the headlights
You can smooth out the fender
You can start the ignition
We can go on a bender

Stuck to the seat our body heat, what will you do with all of this
just shift the gears get outta here, were steppin' on the gas
We gotta bounce, we're goin fast, let's let the seat go back
You take the wheel, I'll sit on top

I hear you work in a body shop
I hear you work in a body shop

You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on the line

You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on the line

I'll work on the engine
Let me blow out a gasket
Tighten up the suspension
And you don't have to ask it

I hear you work in a body shop
I hear you work in a body shop

I would drive to the ends of the Earth for you
Jumpstart my heart you know what you gotta do
I would ride through the dark of the night with you
Cross my heart and hope to die it's true

You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on the line

You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on the line

I hear you work in a body shop
I hear you work in a body shop
I hear you work in a body shop
I hear you work in a body shop
I hear you work in a body shop
