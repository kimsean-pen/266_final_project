Please save me
I hope its not too late
Tortured by our last kiss and
all of our past mistakes
Now is the time we go forth
Show them what were made of
I hope everyone finds there way
but please don't wait up
Its kind of hard to imagine life
without you girl.
Can I... ever feel like myself again
This moments hard to come by.
The tears fall from your eyes 'cus these
flood waters to rise to my knees
in a attempt to drown
out the only sound
Escaping from my lungs
I love you
The smell of the air as we drive by
Puts me in another time
Sinking to my seat and I wonder
Exactly what went passing by
Its kind of hard to imagine life
without you girl.
Can I... ever feel like myself again
This moments hard to come by.
The tears fall from your eyes 'cus these
flood waters to rise to my knees
in a attempt to drown
out the only sound
Escaping from my lungs
I love you
The tears fall from your eyes 'cus these
flood waters to rise to my knees
in a attempt to drown
out the only sound
Escaping from my lungs
I love you
The tears fall from your eyes 'cus these
flood waters to rise to my knees
in a attempt to drown
out the only sound
Escaping from my lungs
I love you
