The sun is so hot
The drinks are so cold.
Your clothes just fall off
As the day goes
We're gonna stay up
Aint gonna lay low
We're gonna dance all night because we say so.
(Na na na...)
I'm thinkin' maybe, I can't have relationships.
'Cause lately, they're not making any sense.

And baby, you're the one thing on my mind but that can change anytime
'Cause there's so many fine women
That my head is spinnin'
And I've lost all feelin'
Everybody's singin'

Like, hey na na na

hey-hey na na na na
Hey na na na

hey-hey na na na na.
'Cause there's so many fine women

That my head is spinnin'

And I'm seeing double vision
Everybody's singin'
Like, hey na na na

hey-hey na na na na
Hey na na na
hey-hey na na na na.
na na na na
Let's do this outside
Shut down the whole block
Watch the girls struck ball like its a catwalk
We're living easy

We got the whole day and we can go hard
No matter what the cops say
(Na na na...)
I'm thinkin' maybe, I can't have relationships.

'Cause lately, they're not making any sense.
And baby, you're the one thing on my mind but that can change anytime
'Cause there's so many fine women
That my head is spinnin'

And I've lost all feelin

Everybody's singin'
Like, hey na na na
hey-hey na na na na
Hey na na na

hey-hey na na na na.
'Cause there's so many fine women
That my head is spinnin'
And I'm seeing double vision
Everybody's singin'
Like, hey na na na
hey-hey na na na na
Hey na na na
hey-hey na na na na.
(Na na na na...)
I see no vitals on your E-K-G
Dead on the dance floor.
We only clap because we need more.
3OH! 3 blowin' out your speakers.
(Hey!)
Blowin' out your speakers.
'Cause there's so many fine women
That my head is spinnin'
And I've lost all feelin'
Everybody's singin'
Like, hey na na na
hey-hey na na na na
Hey na na na
hey-hey na na na na.
'Cause there's so many fine women
That my head is spinnin'
And I'm seeing double vision
Everybody's singin'
Like, hey na na na
hey-hey na na na na
Hey na na na
hey-hey na na na na.
