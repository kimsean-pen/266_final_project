Revived, recreated
Every single burn I still feel it
Contaminated but I don't need the cure
No blood, no redemption
Every single lie I still hear them
Reaching for the sun I won't be ignored

I've been set ablaze
Now I can finally breathe

Caught in the flames, there's nowhere to hide
New light will break the shadows inside
Embrace the change and then you will find
New light will break the shadows inside
The shadows inside

Blinded, devastated
Everything I was imitated
You used to know me but you don't anymore
My world, my reflection
Everything I am separated
All I desired was the spark to restore

I've been set ablaze, set ablaze
And I don't want to change

Caught in the flames, there's nowhere to hide
New light will break the shadows inside
Embrace the change and then you will find
New light will break the shadows inside
The shadows inside

I burned away my past mistakes
The ashes fade and I remain

Caught in the flames, there's nowhere to hide
New light will break the shadows inside
Embrace the change and then you will find
New light will break the shadows inside

There's nowhere to hide
There's nowhere

Caught in the flames, there's nowhere to hide
New light will break the shadows inside
