Craving possession, material obsession
You function solitarily on lower brain transmission
You want it, you need it, you're never gonna get it
'Cause really what you're chasing is a lie to begin with

Paralyze
Manufacture aspiration
Design the ideal outcome
Would you like to hear your story?

All this time you've played the part
A part that was chosen just for you
Bite down on the painless
Enter the gates of Horn and Ivory

With fire at my back
I will tame the waters
I will learn to swim
Fear is not my master
With fire at my back
I will tame the waters
I will learn to swim
Fear is not my master

How do I breathe? You will choke
How do I walk? You will fall
Instinct to the extinct
Paralysis by analysis

Trapped in delusions, ghosts are out to haunt you
The world you've grown to love is slowly crumbling
You need it, you want it, you're never gonna get it
'Cause really what you're after is a fictional desire

With fire at my back
I will tame the waters
I will learn to swim
Fear is not my master
With fire at my back
I will tame the waters
I will learn to swim
Fear is not my master

Enter the gates of Horn and Ivory
Enter the gates of Horn and Ivory
