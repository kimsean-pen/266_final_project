I hear the chants from ancient winds
Like the darkness caresses my essence
The intensity of the crimson twilight
A twilight that will guide us to an empire...

Of forever pure tranquility, of darkness
For true tranquility can be found in our somber souls

Where perversions will prevail
A place of unremitting shadows
Where we savor the sadness of divinity... DIVINITY
The hour has arrived when perversions will prevail
The blood red skies will infest the heavens
The horns will guide us to paradise.
We will eternally live in so-called forsaken damnation
Indulging in the sweet hunger of temptation.

Like the darkness that caresses my essence
