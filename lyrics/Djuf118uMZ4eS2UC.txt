I never knew you before
I've been walking around
With my eyes on the floor
But now you're everywhere to me
You're every face that I see
Things ain't moving quick enough for me
I guess I've been running round town
leaving my tracks,
Burning out rubber, driving too fast
But I've gotta slow right down

Back to the moment the very start
Fom the very first day you had my heart
But I've gotta slow right down

Slow it down, down, down, down, down
down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
down, down, down

Wishing, wanting for something more
Always better than I had before
Who knew these dreams would come true?
And I run the red won't stop at night
I don't care for traffic lights
Things ain't moving quick enough for me

I guess I've been running round town
leaving my tracks
Burning out rubber, driving too fast
But I've gotta slow right down.

Back to the moment the very start
From the very first day you had my heart
But I've gotta slow right down

Slow it down, down, down, down, down
down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
down, down, down

I guess I've been running round
Town leaving my tracks
Burning out rubber, driving too fast but
I've gotta slow right down

Back to the moment the very start
From the very first day you had my heart
But I've gotta slow right down

I guess I've been running round town
Leaving my tracks
Burning out rubber, driving too fast
But I've gotta slow right down

Back to the moment the very start
From the very first day you had my heart
But I've gotta slow right down

Slow it down, down, down, down, down
down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
down, down, down
