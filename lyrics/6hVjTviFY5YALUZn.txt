Free from the torment of sin
All this I'm giving up much as
The sun would decide to give in
Explode into orange and hear
All the voices sing praises with hymns
Mark the birth of a change
Free from the torment of sin
All this I'm giving up

It's not me
Buried wreckage my soul
It's not me
So who am I now

Over and over again
A light with a sharpened edge
Cuts through the black
Empty space we call sky
Beginning the cycle that stays
And I know in my heart we all die

Like the day and the night
Like the sun in the sky
All this I'm giving up

It's not me
Buried wreckage my soul
It's not me
So who am I now

It's not me
Buried wreckage my soul
It's not me
So who am I now

Is there another side
Behind the black and white
A place I could meet you by
A place on the other side

I'll let you know when I go
I'll let you know when I go
When I'm gone

It's not me
Buried wreckage my soul
It's not me
So who am I now

It's not me
Buried wreckage my soul
It's not me
So who am I now

It's not me
Buried wreckage my soul
It's not me
So who am I now
