Two jumps in a week
I bet you think thats pretty clever
Don't you boy?
Flying on your motorcycle
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
You'd kill yourself for reacognition
Kill yourself to never ever stop

You broke another mirror
You are turing into something you are not

Don't leave me high
Dont leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

Drying up in conversation
You will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there wishing you could still make love

There the ones who'll hate you when you think you've got the world all succeed out
There the ones who'll spit at you
You will be the on screaming out

Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

Oh its the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing that you've ever,
Ever had
It's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing that you've ever had
Has gone away

Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
