It's in our home, please let it go.
Yes, you're climbing over top.
You called, you sounded weak
It all makes sense, it all...
I guess he got away
You don't need it anymore

So lock the door, cause we're all alone.
No shame in taking off everything you tried to hide.
So save your words or swallow 'em, oh
In the end we all fear the fall.

And these sharper words that I form
They're already gone now
With the ghosts, these ghosts that I've had
And these nights fade together
And they're all your own and alone

So lock the door, cause we're all alone.
No shame in taking off everything you tried to hide.
So save your words or swallow 'em, oh
In the end we all fear the fall.

I think it's time you let go of all
The things that keep you trapped on your back
And I promise that his taste won't last forever

I promise that he won't be me
I, oh I promise, he won't wake up
I promise that he won't be me,
I, oh I promise...

So lock the door, cause we're all alone.
No shame in taking off everything you tried to hide.
So save your words or swallow 'em, oh
In the end we all fear the fall.
