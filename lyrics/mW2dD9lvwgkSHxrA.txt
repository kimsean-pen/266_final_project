Forget my jealously
You swallowed the demons on your own
There's nothing left for me
I keep thinking back to when you said
"We own the night"

Stomp that feeling; your puke is a mutant
Can't think of who did this, well I grew stupid
Say accidents happen, it's admirable acting
Flicking the back of your ear with my finger

Separate is the way though, no second is the place though
Just fake it through the day and the night is your god
See you in battle; your boat is my paddle
Your life is my business; your plaque on my wall

Let your hair down have one more round
Drink til you believe it
Sloppy kisses, dirty wishes
Baby, this is living
Roller-coaster
Up and down in random motion
Oh come in closer
Ditch your problems, better days are coming

Get up off the wall come on get down get down
Give into moment and live now live now
Get up off the wall come on get down get down
Give into the moment, feel it now

I have the heart of a coward
Here in my arms is exactly where I want you
We own the night

Stomp that feeling; your puke is a mutant
Can't think of who did this, well I grew stupid
Say accidents happen, it's admirable acting
Flicking the back of your ear with my finger

Separate is the way though, no second is the place though
Just fake it through the day and the night is your god
See you in battle; your boat is my paddle
Your life is my business; your plaque on my wall

You'll forget I'm wrong

Call your phone and open my fate cuz I know you're so connected
I need poison mitigate my pain
Feel my toes go golden up in flames
Give me false hope in my veins
Tranquilize and modify my brain

Where did I go wrong?
There's nothing I can do the thrill is gone
So I play these nervous songs
Pretend that I'm not barely hanging on

And medicate
Medicate
Medicate me all night long
Medicate
Medicate
Medicate me all night long

Do it again, do it again, do it again, now grow.

I run quickly out of air, by the way I hate your celebration
I run quickly out of air, by the way I hate our aging faces
