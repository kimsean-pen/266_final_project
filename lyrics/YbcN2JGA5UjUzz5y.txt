Curious, babe your body's so damn curious to me
I been reckless, I been workin', finally found my ass some peace
Rollin' up this [?], these niggas follow me, dear god
Birds they fly by me, oh god 'cause I'm blown, that's fine by me
All my weights yeah, all my weights left [?] on the beach
I been reckless, I been workin', finally found my ass some peace
Blowin' up for so long, finally it's in my reach, oh god
I don't need no reason, finally it's in my reach

When I come through, when I dip out
We might love you, we might move towns
You could live like this, you could live like this
Get your wrist like this
From the surf to the beach, you could live like this
You're not my type, birds fly by night
