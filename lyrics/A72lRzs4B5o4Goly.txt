Where do I turn to
When there's no choice to make?
And how do I presume
When there's so much at stake?
I was so sure of it all

But what if I need you in my darkest hour?
And what if it turns out there is no other?
If this is our last hope
We would see a sign, oh
We would see a sign

Well I've been running from the ashes we left
Forgiveness speaks for itself, but how can I forget
When there's a stain on it all
But what if I need you in my darkest hour?
What if it turns out there is no other?
We had it all

If this is our time now
We wanna see a sign, oh
We would see a sign
So give us a sign
I need some guiding light
Children of darkness, oh
