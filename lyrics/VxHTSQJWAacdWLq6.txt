Lately baby

I've been thinking
How good it was

When you were here
And it ain't the wine

That I been drinking
For once I feel

My head is clear
But early this morning
When I opened up my eyes
That old lonesome feeling
Took me by surprise
I guess you meant more
To me than I realized
The love we had stays on
My mind
The love we had stays on

My mind
And boy
I've been remembering
The good times that we used
To share
My thoughts of you
Don't have an ending
And memories of you

Are everywhere
But why should I tell you
It's not your concern
You win some, you lose some

Well I've lost and I've learned

Is just I'm so lonely
With no place to turn

And here at the end
I'll find
The love we had

Stays bright on my mind
The love we had stays on my mind
Girl, if you were nearer

If you had a mirror

Maybe you could count my tears
And if you were nearer

It would all be clearer

How I wish that you were here
How I wish that you were here

How I wish that you were here
And baby boy I was tired
So I laid down to dream to a little while
But lately I've been so uninspired
Without the comfort of your smile
But I'm not complaining
Cuz that's just how it goes
There's always some heartache
In this world I suppose
But you can't even imagine
Nobody knows
The love we had
Stays on my mind
The love we had
Stays on my mind
The love we had
Stays on my mind
The love we had stays on my mind.
