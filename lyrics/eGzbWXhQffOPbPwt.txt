Lark throated spit through beaks tonight
These gagging chirps were written in disguise
What's that sound?
Caskets floating

Hey you, did you ever intend to sleep inside my tomb?
Would you ever pretend to kick from inside of this womb
Hey you, did you ever attempt the excavation of these fossils
And in case you haven't noticed, we're already dead, already dead

This gravity is a quadriplegic horse and carriage
This gravity is a quadriplegic horse and carriage
This gravity is a quadriplegic horse and carriage

Pendulum swing through tantrum slits
This scalpel's gaze untamed won't feel romantic
What's that sound?
Caskets floating

In layman's terms sewn by matrimony

Hey you, did you ever intend to
Hey you, would you ever attempt to
Hey you, did you ever attempt to
Hey you

This gravity is a quadriplegic horse and carriage
This gravity is a quadriplegic horse and carriage

What's that sound coming in?
Look at it fly
What's that sound that is coming?

This gravity is a quadriplegic horse and carriage
