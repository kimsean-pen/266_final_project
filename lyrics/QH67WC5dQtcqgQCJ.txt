I got troubled thoughts and the self-esteem to match
What a catch!
What a catch!
Whoa

You'll never catch us so just let me be
Said I'll be fine 'til the hospital or American embassy
Ms. Flack, said I still want you back
Yeah, Ms. Flack, said I still want you back

I got troubled thoughts and the self-esteem to match
What a catch!
What a catch!
And all I can think of is the way I'm the one who charmed the one
Who gave up on you
Who gave up on you

They say the captain goes down with the ship
So, when the world ends, will God go down with it?
Ms. Flack, said I still want you back
Yeah, Ms. Flack, said I still want you back

I got troubled thoughts and the self-esteem to match
What a catch!
What a catch!
And all I can think of is the way I'm the one who charmed the one
Who gave up on you
Who gave up on you

What a catch, what a catch
What a catch, what a catch

I will never end up like him
Behind my back, I already am
Keep a calendar this way you will always know
I said I got troubled thoughts and the self-esteem to match

What a catch!
What a catch!
And all I can think of is the way I'm the one who charmed the one
Who gave up on you
Who gave up on you
(Where is your boy tonight
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know)
(We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're goin' down swinging)
(Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance, these are the lives you'd love to lead)
(This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race...)
(One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories
Even though they weren't so great
He tastes like you, only sweeter...)
I got troubled thoughts and the self-esteem to match
What a catch!
What a catch!
