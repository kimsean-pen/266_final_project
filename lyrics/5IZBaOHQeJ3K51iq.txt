Sometimes I can see for miles
Through water and fire
From england to america
I feel life meet my eyes

And it's the best thing
It's the best thing
It's the best thing
A beautiful feeling

A smile from san diego
He's still a boy
Two ends to every rainbow
And a train from mexico

And he's the best thing
He is the best thing
He is the best thing
A beautiful feeling

And when I watch you move
And I can't think straight
And I am silenced
And I can't think straight

And it's the best thing
It's the best thing
The best thing
Such a beautiful feeling
