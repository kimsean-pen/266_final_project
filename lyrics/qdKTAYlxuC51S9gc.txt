Don't react
When I tell you

And don't react
When I tell you
That bright lights mean nothing to you

'Cause no one would know
The sound of a ghost
And I might be something to you

Beyond beautiful
Is the sound of a ghost
Can we lose our minds

And call it love
For the last time?
My darling never rests
Until the darker gets

The best of all we had
Can the cold carry on?
When the light means nothing to you

Then no one would know
The sound of a ghost
And I might be perfect with you

But no one would know
So tell me, tell me
Have you ever really danced on the edge?
Is something still scaring you?
Have you ever really danced on the edge?
The count of three is up
Have you ever really danced on the edge?
All right, then tell me so

Have you ever really danced on the edge?
Just hold my hand and jump
(...)
And bright lights mean nothing to you
Because no one would know
The sound of a ghost
Oh no one would know
The sound of a ghost
