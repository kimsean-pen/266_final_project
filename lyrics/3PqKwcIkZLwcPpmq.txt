No fame
All there is, all there was
On the second lady
Can't take a cent, take a cut
of that kind of rent
I'll stand, kind of pushed
Kind of bent, on this heavy land
I'll stand for the sake of my friend
I will see him there
Wow!
Down
Down

Count me down
Down
Down boy, down
Count me down
Down boy
Down boy
Down boy, down
The same
Not begin, not give up
In a better way again
Wash the stain off his bed
Not to split them up

I'll stand for the sake of my friend

I will see him there

Well, I will see him there
Wow! Ha!
Down
Down
Count me down
Down
Down boy, down
Count me down
Down boy
Down boy
Down boy, down
Ha!
Down
Count me down
Down
Down boy
