Rushed then told
They're bred to continually
Be at their marks
But some withhold
And won't be held
Under the spell

Bribes when tried
They focused on the burning
Of the men, 'til now
Got left inside the underbelly's choke

And you assumed
At least they'll call us
Men again
For those shadows
That keep on crawling
Out from under cloaks

Behold rest assured
The sleep walking elite
When their days
Are numbered like the shallow
When they sit
On their knees
On their knees
On their knees
As they sit
On their knees
On their knees
On their knees

And you assumed
At least they'll call us
Men again
For those shadows
That keep on crawling
Out from under cloaks

Cloaks

When you assumed
At least they'll call us
Men again
For those shadows
That keep on crawling
Out from under

When you assumed
At least they'll call us
Men again
For those shadows
That keep on crawling
Out from under...
