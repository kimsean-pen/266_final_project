Doctor, doctor, give me a lobotomy
So I don't see what is in front of me
Crash, bang! Goes the cradle
Doctor, doctor, give me a remedy
To a red button doomsday melody
Tick-tick, boom! And it's fatal
Doctor, doctor, consent happily
Take out my brain and my sanity
Your name's on the label
Doctor, doctor, call my family
Tell them that I went out easily
Put me on the table

'Cause I, I just want to be stupid
I, I just want to be stupid
Give me that one shot, two shot, blood clot (Hey, hey, hey)
'Cause in my mind I can't stop, won't stop (Hey, hey, hey)
Give me that one shot, two shot, blood clot (Hey, hey, hey)
'Cause in my mind I can't stop, won't stop

Doctor, doctor give me a lobotomy
So sick of my autonomy
Ding-dong, bang the gong
Doctor, doctor, give me your sympathy
'Cause I really need that surgery
Waitin' for so long

'Cause I, I just want to be stupid
I, I just want to be stupid

Give me that one shot, two shot, blood clot (Hey, hey, hey)
'Cause in my mind I can't stop, won't stop (Hey, hey, hey)
Give me that one shot, two shot, blood clot (Hey, hey, hey)
'Cause in my mind I can't stop, won't stop (Hey, hey, hey)
Give me that one shot, two shot, blood clot (Hey, hey, hey)
'Cause in my mind I can't stop, won't stop (Hey, hey, hey)
Give me that one shot, two shot, blood clot (Hey, hey, hey)
'Cause in my mind I can't stop, won't stop

Fuck!
I just want to be stupid

I don't wanna die
I don't wanna cry
I just wanna be
Out of my mind
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna cry
I just wanna be
I just want to be stupid

Give me that one shot, two shot, blood clot (Hey, hey, hey)
'Cause in my mind I can't stop, won't stop (Hey, hey, hey)
Give me that one shot, two shot, blood clot (Hey, hey, hey)
'Cause in my mind I can't stop, won't stop (I just want to be stupid)

Give me that one shot, two shot, blood clot (Hey, hey, hey)
'Cause in my mind I can't stop, won't stop (Hey, hey, hey)
Give me that one shot, two shot, blood clot (Hey, hey, hey)
'Cause in my mind I can't stop, won't stop (I just want to be stupid)
