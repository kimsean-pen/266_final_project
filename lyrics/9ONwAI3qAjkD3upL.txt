There was a time when I was younger
My love was cold and I didn't know wich way to go
Then I was found by a shiny flower
She took me in and saved me from stormy wind

Christine - everyday she is so good - so good to me
Christine - she's everything a man would ever need
Christine - she lifts me up when I'm feeling low
Christine you mean the world to me

The way she moves me with her secret smile
She don't wear no make up
She is pure and wild
I'm as happy as happy can be
Oh, Lucky man, the man it's me

Christine - everyday she is so good - so good to me
Christine - she's everything a man would ever need
Christine - she lifts me up when I'm feeling low
Christine you mean the world to me

Christine - everyday she is so good - so good to me
Christine - she's everything a man would ever need
Christine - she lifts me up when I'm feeling low
Christine you mean the world to me
Everyday so good to me
I'm as happy as a man can ever be
Christine I can't let go
I love you so
