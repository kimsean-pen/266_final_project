Blue and gold, the color of the skies below
Only in the light, only in the light, of this world
Swarm of bees, they form a pillow under me
They're buzzing in the light, buzzing in the light, of this world

I'm not alone in the mystery
I'm not alone in the mystery
I'm not alone
I feel at home in the mystery

Seems to me I'm watching someone else's dream
Only in the light, buzzing in the light, of this world
Solid gold, feeling of the sun below
Only in the light, I'm buzzing in the light, of this world
Buzzing in the light, buzzing in the light, of this world

I'm not alone in the mystery
I'm not alone in the mystery
I'm not alone
I'm at home in the mystery, yeah
