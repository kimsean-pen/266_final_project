My words come out like an avalanche in silence
And you've got oceans trapped in your eyelids
They tell me that no man is an island
But it feels like it's a storm that I've been fighting

And I used to listen to the radio
But I've got an army of voices in my head
Voices in my head
We used to live in stereo
But I've got an army of voices in my head
Voices in my head

How come the friends and the foes invisible?
Are the ones that make my soul most miserable?
Head's reeling from the feeling
In my mind but I feel in the physical

Why's the sunlight hiding?
Ain't letting any light in?
It's a storm that I've been fighting

And I used to listen to the radio
But I've got an army of voices in my head
Voices in my head
We used to live in stereo
But I've got an army of voices in my head
Voices in my head

And they're singing
I've got voices
(We used to live in stereo)
And they're singing
I've got voices
Yeah, I've got voices
I've got voices

Every moment crowded with choices
Speak to me and drown out the voices

And I used to listen to the radio
But I've got an army of voices in my head
Voices in my head
Voices, voices

We used to live in stereo
But I've got an army of voices in my head
Voices in my head
Voices...
