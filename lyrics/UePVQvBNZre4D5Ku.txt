I don't know how
To tell you I love you
To tell you I miss you
To tell you I care

I don't know how
To tell you it's right
When it feels so wrong
For you to be near

And I don't know why
The sun's in the sky
The rain it falls down
Down onto the ground

I've been in trouble
I've been let down
But please tell me now
You're sticking around

I don't know how
I don't know how
I don't know how
I don't know how
I don't know how
I don't know how
I don't know how
I don't know how

I've seen a million things
I've been around town
What I know now
Since you've been around

Born so young
Feel so old
I've been through the summer
Stuck around for the cold

You see me everywhere
You walk around without a care
You see me everywhere
You walk around without a care
You see me everywhere
You walk around without a care
You see me everywhere
You walk around without a care
You see me everywhere
You walk around without a care

I don't know how
I don't know how
I don't know how
I don't know how
I don't know how
I don't know how
I don't know how
I don't know how
I don't know how
I don't know how
