Jesus, come talk to me
I am but a blind mess, I am wild and free
I know that I need us, more than I need me
One more whiskey, I am wild and free

Ohh, but I'm a beat down, washed up, son of a bitch
I got one more cigarette and all my money is spent, but I'ma
Be damned if I let it keep me down

Oh yeah, I'm a beat down, washed up, son of a bitch
I got one more cigarette and all my money is spent, but I'ma
Be damned if I let it keep me down

Oh my mother, Mary, come walk with me
I am on four drugs, I am wild and free
I know that I failed less, the less I knew me
Wander through the darkness, and come walk with me

Oh yeah, I'm a beat down, washed up, son of a bitch
I got one more cigarette and all my money is spent, but I'ma
Be damned if I let it keep me down

Yeah yeah, oh, I'm a beat down, washed up, son of a bitch
I got one more cigarette and all my money is spent, but I'ma
Be damned if I let it keep me down, yeah yeah

You know that it's not over
It's okay to let yourself hurt
Swimming in the murky water, won't you come on out?

Yeah yeah, you know that it's not over
It's okay to let yourself hurt
Swimming in the murky water, won't you come on out? Yeah, yeah

We sing a beat down, washed up, beggar song
And we sing it even louder when the money is gone because we'll
Be damned if I let it keep us down

Ayy, yeah, I'm a beat down, washed up, son of a bitch
I got one more cigarette and all my money is spent, but I'ma
Be damned if I let it keep me down, yeah, yeah, yeah

You know that it's not over
It's okay to let yourself hurt
Swimming in the murky water, won't you come on out?

Ayy, yeah, you know that it's not over
It's okay to let yourself hurt
Swimming in the murky water, won't you come on out?

We sing a beat down, washed up, beggar song
And we sing it even louder when the money is gone, because we'll
Be damned if I let it keep us down

Ayy, yeah, oh, I'm a beat down washed up son of a bitch
I got one more cigarette and all my money is spent, but I'ma
Be damned if I let it keep me down
