"Hey ladies, what's up?"
"What kind of pick up line is that?"
"What did he say?"
"Oh my god, I can't believe it!"
"Ew, look at his hair!"
"Band guys are so lame!"
"Why's he staring at us?"
"Ew, what is he wearing?"
"Does that guy smell bad?"
"OK. so can I call you?"
------
Some girls are crazy
Just listen to what I have to say about it
You've gotta watch out for the beautiful ones
They'll twist your head right off your neck
And laugh about it with their friends
That's just one night for them

They target you with their eyes
And move with their lips
And it pulls you in

She shuts you down with her voice again
And now, are you listening?
This song goes out to girls
That we haven't met just yet
This song's for stupid girls
Who think that every boy is all about them
About them

These girls are crazy
Just listen to what I have to say about it
You've gotta watch out for the younger ones
They'll tightly wrap you around their fingers
And brag to all their friends
It's nothing but a game to them

They'll target you with their eyes
And move with their lips
And it pulls you in
She shuts you down with her voice again
And now are you listening?

This song goes out to girls
That we haven't met just yet
This song is for stupid girls
Who think that every boy is all about them
About them

You think you're on top of the world
When all the eyes are on you
Just wait until your heart breaks
And you'll know how I felt when I wrote...

This song goes out to girls
That we haven't met just yet
This song is for stupid girls
Who think that every boy is all about them
About them
