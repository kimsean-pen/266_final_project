With this tear
I thee want
I long for you to talk to me like you did
That night in the restaurant

You spoke of love so openly
And again and again you promised me
That you'd never leave
But now you're gone

With this voice
I thee call
Sometimes I catch myself
Calling your name
When you're not there at all

Please tell me what I did wrong
Why must I hear your voice inside my head
All day and all night long
It's not fair

(Bridge) (Ad-lib)

With these arms
I held you
When you told me you were dying
I had less courage it's true
And you wrote every day
Writing 'bout the things
That we could do
When your pain went away
But all that went away was you

With this tear
I thee want
I long for you to talk to me like you did
That night in the restaurant

With this tear
I thee want
I thee want
I thee want
I thee want

With this tear
I thee want
I long for you to talk to me like you did
That night in the restaurant you spoke of love so openly
And again and again you promised me
That you'd never leave
But now you're gone

With this tear
