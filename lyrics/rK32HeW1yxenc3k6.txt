Rock it out, man
Sing the song today
Do it right man
Night and day
Rain falls down on me
Rain, rain, rain, rain
It falls on the trees
And it falls on the stones
And it falls on the earth
And old dry bones
Rain falling all over the world
Rain falling on the little boys (and girls)
It falls in the pudles
And it falls in the snow
It falls wherever you go
It falls in the desert
When you're dying of thirst
It falls when you think
You're the last
But you're the first
