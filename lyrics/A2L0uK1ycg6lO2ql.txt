When we spoke you were throwin' those words at me
I didn't understand what I did wrong
I got on a plane to Miami
And when I got back you were gone

And now all I have
Is an empty flask
'Cause I'm still attached
And I've got to find a way
To get you back
Get you back
Get you back
Get you back

I still smell your perfume on my pillow
(Chanel No. 5)
You lit up the room when the lights went out
Lord I didn't know what I was in for
(Caught me by surprise)
Hit me like an 808 from the dirty South

And now all I have
Is an empty flask
'Cause I'm still attached
And I've got to find a way
To get you back
Get you back
Get you back
Get you back
