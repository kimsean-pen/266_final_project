Feet don't fail me now
My mind, it don't speak too loud
And my heart, it won't allow
My body to go
One toke and you keep me yearning

I should give up
But I just keep on loving you
And breaks my faith
But it keeps me sane

I should give up
But I just keep on loving you
If I walk away
It could be my grave

Promises never count
But I need you so I can't walk out
A machine that feeds me vows
Im just another spoke on the wheel
And you keep me turning

I should give up
But I just keep on loving you
And breaks my faith
But it keeps me sane

I should give up
But I just keep on loving you
If I walk away
It could be my grave

If you told me I'm made better by you
I might cry, 'cos i realise
That the better part of me feels its true
So I lie and tell myself it's right when

I should give up
But I just keep on loving you
And breaks my faith
But it keeps me sane

I should give up
But I just keep on loving you
(Keep on loving you)
If I walk away
It could be my grave
(Be my grave)

I should give up
But I just keep on loving you
And breaks my faith
But it keeps me sane

I should give up
But I just keep on loving you
(I just keep on loving you baby)
If I walk away
(I just keep on loving you, yeah)
It could be my grave

I keep on loving you
(Keep on loving you)
