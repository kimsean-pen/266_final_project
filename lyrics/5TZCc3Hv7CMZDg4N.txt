Fire is too hot, no snow is too cold
Youth will never leave me
I'll never grow old
(No, no, no, no)
I feel free as a bird
Flyin' around in the blue
As long as, baby
As long as I've got you
(As long as I've got you)
If happiness was water
I'd never run dry
(Ooh)
If loneliness was a flower
It would wither and die
(Die, die, die, die)
The whole world is our private playground
As long as, baby
As long as I've got you
Something to think about
I remember when
So tired of being hurt
And I didn't want a boyfriend
(But now I have you, baby)
I feel free as a bird
Flying around in the blue
As long as, baby
As long as I've got you
As long as I've got you
As long as I've got you
As long as I've got you
