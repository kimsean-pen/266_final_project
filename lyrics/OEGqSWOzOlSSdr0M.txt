Everything is wonderful
Being here is heavenly
Every single day she sends
Everything is free
I used to be so careless
As if I couldn't care less
Did I have to make this mess
When I was Mary's prayer?
Suddenly the Heavens roared
Suddenly the rain came down
Suddenly was washed away
The Mary that I knew
So when you find somebody you keep
Think of me and celebrate
I made such a big mistake
When I was Mary's prayer
So if I say, save me, save me
Be the light in my eyes
And if I say ten Hail Mary's
Leave a light on in Heaven for me
Blessed is the one who shares
Your power and your beauty, Mary
Blessed is the millionaire
Who shares your wedding-day
So when you find somebody you keep
Think of me and celebrate
I made such a big mistake
When I was Mary's prayer
So if I say, save me, save me
Be the light in my eyes
And if I say ten Hail Mary's
Leave a light on in Heaven for me
Save me, save me
Be the light in my eyes
And if I say ten Hail Mary's
Leave a light on in Heaven for me
If you want the fruit to fall
You have to give the tree a shake
If you shake the tree too hard
The bough is going to break
And if I can't reach the top of the tree
Mary, you can blow me up there
What I wouldn't give to be
When I was Mary's prayer
So if I say, save me, save me
Be the light in my eyes
And if I say ten Hail Mary's
Leave a light on in Heaven
Save me, save me
Be the light in my eyes
And if I say ten Hail Mary's
Leave a light on in Heaven
Save me, save me
Be the light in my eyes
What I wouldn't give to be
When I was Mary's prayer
What I wouldn't give to be
When I was Mary's prayer
What I wouldn't give to be
When I was Mary's prayer
