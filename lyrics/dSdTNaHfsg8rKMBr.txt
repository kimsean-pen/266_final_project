My marrow like layers of brume
Veil-like mist creeping up the meadow

Crescent shadows flood the sky
While the world below waits in fright

Clouds are ready to pour down on me

All the twangling sounds of fear
Swallow the surface

Spectre shadow
Frozen in time and space
Glare of neither night nor day

Will it ever turn to light

Spectre storm
Whirling in time and space
Glare of neither night nor day

In the eye of rashness
The violence fades away
As I scour open space
A deadly calm inside

I'll never know what it means
I'll never know what it means
This deadly calm inside
I'll never know what it means
