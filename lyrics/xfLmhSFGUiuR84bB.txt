There's something that I want to say,
But I feel I don't know how.
And still I just can't hold it one more day,
So I think I'll let it out.

You're on my mind more than I may show
You're in my heart more than you may know
And the last thing that I want,
Is for you to fall apart.
Your future will get clearer,
I want you to remember.

In each tear
There's a lesson, (there's a lesson)
Makes you wiser than before (wiser)
Makes you stronger than you know (stronger)
And each tear (each tear)
Brings you closer to your dreams
No mistake, no heartbreak
Can take away what you're meant to be...

We can't change the things,
That we done, that's in the past.
But fighting won't get us anywhere,
So if you want, here's my hand...

Every night there's one thing I do
I bow my head and I pray for you (pray for you)
And the last thing that I want
Is for you to fall apart
Your future will get clearer
I want you to remember

In each tear
There's a lesson, (there's a lesson)
Makes you wiser than before (wiser)
Makes you stronger than you know (stronger)
And each tear (each tear)
Brings you closer to your dreams
No mistake, no heartbreak
Can take away what you're meant to be

You're much more than a struggle that you go through
You're not defined by your pain, so let it go...
You're not a victim, you're more like a winner
And you're not in defeat, you're more like a queen

In each tear
There's a lesson,
Makes you wiser than before (wiser)
Makes you stronger than you know (stronger than you know)
And each tear (in each tear)
Brings you closer to your dreams
No mistake, no heartbreak
Can take away what you're meant to be

In each tear (each tear)
There's a lesson, (there's a lesson)
Makes you wiser than before (wiser)
Makes you stronger than you know (stronger than you know)
And each tear (Make you so much more)
Brings you closer to your dreams
No mistake, no heartbreak
Can take away what you're meant to be

No no we can't be held down
No no no no I I I can't be held down
You you you can't be held down
We we we can't be held down
Love
It makes you so much stronger (stronger)
It makes you so much wiser
And each tear
Brings you so close to your dreams,
And no mistake, no heartbreak,
Can take away what you're meant to be
