Didn't ask your opinion, whatcha talkin bout?
So quick to jump to conclusions, cause we're hangin out
There ain't no wishes, ain't no fuss
When it's just you and me (you and me)

What makes you think that you can know
What's gonna stick, what's gonna blow
So get em boy

Let them pull at the seams
Don't they know what it means
To be young and in love like that
Who are they to decide
If it's wrong, if it's right
To be young and in love like that
Like that, like that
Like that, like that
To be young and in love

If people offering answers, sounds like breaking it
I can't remember the questions, whatever asked
It's a free road you came down
But you don't bother me (bother me)

One of those days when we're old
I'll stop and say I told you so
So get em boy

Let them pull at the seams
Don't they know what it means
To be young and in love like that
Who are they to decide
If it's wrong, if it's right
To be young and in love like that
Like that, like that
Like that, like that
To be young and in love like that
Like that, like that
Like that, like that
To be young and in love

It don't matter what they say, too late to walk away
'Cause I need him, much too strong
I've waited for so long to feel all the things that I feel
So I gotta get that boy

Let them pull at the seams
Don't they know what it means
To be young and in love like that
Who are they to decide
If it's wrong, if it's right
To be young and in love like that
Like that, like that
Like that, like that
To be young and in love like that
Like that, like that
Like that, like that
To be young and in love
