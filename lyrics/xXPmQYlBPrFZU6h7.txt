It's been at least another year
And still I haven't got the chance to say
Always rolling off the tongue
Never said but nearly sung about a million ways

Every photograph and story
Trickled through the lengthy web of friends
I overthought but understood
Distant looks but looking good
And not the other way

But you, you fail to remember
But you, you fail to remember

Do I still cross your mind? (You)
Your face still distorts the time (You, ooh)

With heat struck afternoons long through
Those idle dreams go back to you
The echo seems somewhat displaced
Every form that's on her face, I'm drifting off to
Motivate flirtation
The rest was made of constellations that I've sought
Was this only in my head?
Just like most things go misread
When overthought

But you, you fail to remember
But you, you fail to remember

Do I still cross your mind? (Ooh)
Your face still distorts the time (You, ooh, you)

Do I still cross your mind? (Ooh)
Your face still distorts the time (You, ooh, you)

Do I still cross your mind? (Ooh)
Your face still distorts the time (You, ooh)
