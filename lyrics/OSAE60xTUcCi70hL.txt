Straighten out your pleat
Demands have been beseiged
Safe passage for the meek
Refusal to accede
Deny the preconceived
For the preordained
We no longer grieve
For nothing is concrete

Laid on the sleet
Laid with the reeds
LAY THE CONCRETE

Continue the deceit
Pull them by their teeth
The excess is contained
Extracted from the maimed
Deny the preconceived
For the preordained
We no longer grieve
For nothing is concrete

Laid on the sleet
Laid with the reeds
LAY THE CONCRETE

Laid on the sleet
Laid with the reeds
LAY THE CONCRETE
