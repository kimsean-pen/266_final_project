We have to sides
Our life/death drive and disappointments
Push, pull off tides
Giving up, giving in
Simple mistakes
Confinement within body
Poor vision
Fake prescription

Automatic nostalgia
That's so cheap
Nothing happening right now means anything (to me)
It will, oh it will
Because life is tunneling deeper all the time
So with each year there's a little less light
