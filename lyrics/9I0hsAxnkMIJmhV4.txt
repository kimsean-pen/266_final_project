Have we wasted our last breath
Can I remind you it's not over yet
And we're still coming up for air
Surprised there isn't any left
Save your tears for another day
We never thought we'd see your face again
Save your tears for another day
We never thought we'd see your face again
Sign your name and stand aside
And try to read between the lines
Untangle all those clever lies
To which you put your name and sign your life
Save your tears for another day
We never thought we'd see your face again
Save your tears for another day
We never thought we'd see your face again
Save your tears for another day
We never thought we'd see your face again
Save your tears for another day
We never thought we'd see your face again
Again
Again
Again
