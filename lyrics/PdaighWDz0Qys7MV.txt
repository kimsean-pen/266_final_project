I got this sudden feeling
You were always wanting out
I never liked your reason
Don't shut the door and leave me now

It was always me I know I know
And suddenly
I can't let go

I got this sudden feeling

I got this sudden feeling
Your head would never leave the clouds
You act like you don't see it
Our love was always fading out

It was always me I know I know
And suddenly
I can't let go

I got this sudden feeling

I know sometimes
We fall apart
I know sometimes
We fall apart

It was always me I know I know
And suddenly
I can't let go

I got the sudden feeling
I got the sudden feeling
I got the sudden feeling
I got the sudden feeling
