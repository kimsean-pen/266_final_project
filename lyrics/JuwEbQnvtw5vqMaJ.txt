Open the seas to my plight
Winds in the gales of desire
Scourge of the port towns in sigh
Cannons lay waste
And there's salt in our veins, giving death is our trade to the end
Skeletal flag, and the fires that blaze seen for miles
Sword to the throat of the innocent
Black is our storm and you'll never escape our attack
The crown and the royals conspire
Sending the men
On a quest with Sir Drake to the cities to be slayed or sacked
No quarter to give, no prisoners will live past the hour
Sword to the throat of the innocent
Letter marque for the crimes done at sea, crowns conspire
The corpse of the bastard is nigh
Brave men will kneel and die
The cowards and women will run
Murder and rape
And there's salt in our veins, giving death is our trade to the end
Skeletal flag, and the fires that blaze seen for miles
Sword to the throat of the innocent
Black is our storm and you'll never escape our attack
Keelhauled and nailed to my mast
I've read the stars and crossed the leagues to bring you death
