Human "being" has lost its meaning when you refuse to fight
If I don't force your hand, it could cost you your life
You're waiting around to die and you're all right with it
You're waiting around to die and I can't stand for it
You can you've got the fire in you, then show me what you've got
You say the future's yours, I say your future is filled with rot
You're waiting around to die, how can you live with it?
Just waiting around to die and I can't fucking stand it
You're waiting around to die, how can you live with it?
Just waiting around to die, is this how we're going to end it?
No
Can't be held accountable for another hopeless soul
The choice ain't up to me, you've got to fight to be free
