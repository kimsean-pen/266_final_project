Hive been fed
Fill my soul
One way in
Fill my soul, fill my soul
I been high
Still can't see
Devastated
Come find

Pleasuring arm
Tempted to bleed
Hollowing
Dares my soul

I been high
Still can't see
Devastated
Come find

Our inventions split their cocoon
And the whir of wings was deafening
Rain down and bring
A gentle time
