Dear, when you smile at me
i hear a melody
it haunted me from the start
something inside of me
started a symphony
zing went the strings of my heart
Whoa now the breath of spring
whoa i heard a robin sing
about a nest... apart
all that you seem to be
end up in harmony
zing went the strings of my heart
I still recall the thrill
i guess i always will
i hope we'll never depart
dear, with your lips to mine
a rhapsody divine
zing went the strings of my heart
zing went the strings of my heart
zing zing zing zing
