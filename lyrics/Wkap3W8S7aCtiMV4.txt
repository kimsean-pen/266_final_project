Then i strangled your neck. Because i love you too much. Then i kissed your red mouth, because i love you to death. Now mother i need you- I need you too much - I need your claws in my neck. Every breath that i breath in, feeds the life that i lack...
Now right here i was born, in the place where you kneeled. In a burning white sand, in the blood that you spilled. Far far in the distance, i hear the howl of the beast. I feel his breath on my face. I feel the edge of his teeth...
And I'll swallow your sorrow, and i'll inhale your fear. And i steal your tommorows, and i'll inject your tears. So please never forgive me, please spit on my name. But i hold on to my memory, and keep me to blame. Please need me to blame, need me to blame.
