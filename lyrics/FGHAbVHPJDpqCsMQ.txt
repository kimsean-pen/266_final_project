So hard to explain
Somehow your name keeps on crawling in my brain
And it's getting so loud
There's no way to drown out

The sound of my mistakes

I wish that I could quit
It's impossible 'cause now you're underneath my skin
I did it to myself now
What did I expect now

How did one more turn to three?
One foot out but I can't leave
It's no use
When it's you

One more time
Swear it's the last time
I'm changing my mind
I try doing what's right but
It's not black and white

Fever in your kiss
It leads me weak I wish that I could get a grip
Worse than any bee sting
Playing on my heartstrings

I can't numb you out

No I can't ignore
When you pop up on my phone
And say you want some more
Who am I fooling?
In the end I'm only human

That's how one more turns to three
It's the last thing we both need
But there's no use
It's me and you

One more time
Swear it's the last time
I'm changing my mind
I try doing what's right but
It's not black and white
It's not black and white
It's not black and white
It's not black and white

One more time
Swear it's the last time
I'm changing my mind
I try doing what's right but
It's not black and white
