You can leave in the mornin'
Without any warnin'
But you'll never get away from my lovin'
You'll never get away from my love

Any T[ime] babe, come over
Put your head on my shoulder
Tell me what you think of my lovin'
Tell me what you think of my love

Now you know I wouldn't bother
With you if any other
Would want to get a taste of my lovin'
Want to get a taste of my love

Well I ain't got much of value
I know I wants to have you
'Cause I can't get enough of your lovin'
I can't get enough of your love

You can leave in the mornin'
Without any warnin'
Yeah you'll never get away from my lovin'
You'll never get away from my love
