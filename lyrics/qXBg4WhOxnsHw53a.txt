If I had my way girl, I'd never leave you for a minute
But things don't always turn out the way we want them to
So while I'm away now, I want you to remember
How much I love you, I love you, I love you

Let this love lift you up
When you're feelin' blue
Wherever I go
I will be loving you

Think of me when you see
Places we once shared
Whatever I do
Someday I'll need you there

Wherever I go
Whatever I do
I'll always come home
I'll come home to you

Even though we both know
You're not in my arms
Wherever I go
You're always in my heart

Just you ask, I'll come back
Though we're miles apart
Whatever I do
I'll come to where you are

Oh wherever I go
Whatever I do
I'll always come home
I'll come home to you

Oh wherever I go
Whatever I do
I'll always come home
I'll come home to you

Don't you worry darlin'
Wherever I go
Whatever I do
I'll always come home
I'll come home to you

Don't you worry baby
Wherever I go
Whatever I do
