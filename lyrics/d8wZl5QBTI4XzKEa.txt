Watch your step around these words cause they're gonna get you
They're gonna get you in the end
I swear it's not a disease it's just a game of pretend
A game of pretend

Why is it me they're after?
Couldn't they pick another one?
Some day I'll spit their laughter
And bite their tongue.

Horrible kids
Would you look what you did
It was your ignorance
That formed a beast with your wit.
Horrible kids, horrible kids, horrible kids
Look what you did!

What makes this target grow
Is it when his feelings show?
Hold a gun to his head and you'll know
You've pushed him down as low as he can

Go! Get away from me
Leave me be
I beg you please
I'm on the floor on bended knee.
Maybe then I'll keep my sanity.

And I can't stand this pain they cause me
This puzzle will solve itself
And maybe I just can't seem to put this together yet.

Horrible kids
Would you look what you did
It was your ignorance
That formed a beast with your wit.

Horrible kids, horrible kids, horrible kids
Look what you did!
Horrible kids, horrible kids, horrible kids
Look what you did.

Picture this he was just a kid
Not knowing where to begin
He wore all the wrong clothes followed all the wrong trends
Persecuted for the things he did.

Picture this he was all alone
Without a friend to call his own so he sat on his bed
With the thought in his head
With wishes that they all were dead.

But then he saw the light
Gained the will to fight
Saw that victory was in sight
But soon they all will see.

Horrible kids
Would you look what you did
It was your ignorance
That formed a beast with your wit.
Horrible kids, would you look what you did
It was your ignorance
That formed a beast with you wit.

Horrible kids, horrible kids, horrible kids
Look what we did!
Horrible kids, horrible kids, horrible kids
Look what we did.
