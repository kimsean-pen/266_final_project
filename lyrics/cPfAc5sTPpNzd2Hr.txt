Love that is born in truth
All the doubt removed
Lover's eyes are blessed
Only sees the best

I can't let go
Off a love that grows
You're my woman, baby love
You know I love you, so

Empty hearts are free
Bring your love to me
Soul chase the moon
Shadows hug the room

Turn off the light
Sneak in bed at night
Darkness shut its eyes
Baby, I open mine to you

I can't let go
Off a love that grows
You know I love you, so
Can't let go
You know I love you, so

I can't let go
Off a love that grows
You're my woman, baby love
You know I love you, so

I love you, so, I
I love you, oh

I can't let go
Off a love that grows
You're my woman, baby love
You know I love you, so

I can't let go
Off a love that grows
You're my woman, baby love
You know I love you, so

I can't let go
Off a love that grows
You're my woman, baby love
You know I love you, so
