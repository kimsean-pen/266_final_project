Yo, the saga begins, beget war
I draw first blood be the first to set it off
My 'cause tap all jaws lay down laws
We takin' what's yours we do jerks rush the doors
Here come the deez tryin' to make breeze
And guns toss in full force
My team'll go at your main source
We're not tourists, hit bosses and take hostage
Your whole setup, from the ground up we lock st
Blood flood your eye, fk up your optics
Switch to killer instincts for ngaz pop st
Yo nga Noyd what's the topic? Nine pound we rocked in
Ninety-six strike back with more hot st
Illuminate my team'll glow like, radiation
With no time for patient, or complication
Let's get it done right, my click airtight
Trapped in a never ending gunfight so ngaz lose stripes
Or lose life, jail ngaz sendin' kites to the street
Over some beef that wasn't fully cooked, finish 'em off? Well done, Meat?, that said twenty-two slug to your head
Travel all the way down to your leg
Aiyyo it's hell on earth, who's next or gonna be first?

The projects is front lines and the enemy is one time

I ain't gotta tell you it's right in front of your eyes
Aiyyo it's hell on earth, who's next or gonna be first?
The projects is front lines and the enemy is one time

I ain't gotta tell you it's right in front of your eyes
We wreck the QBC, nga rep yours it's all love

Milli stacked down, heavenly guarded by hollow tip slug
Then crack down, on wannabe thugs adapt to gat sound
And bow down, slow the fk up, see how my foul now
Articulate, hittin' body parts to start shiftin' st
Never hesitant, it's the crack game unlimited
Summon rasta we can do this, forever infinite
Then reminisce, twenty years later how we was gettin' it
Either with me go against the grain you better hit me
Leggin' me or robbin' me ngaz better body me
'Cause it's a small world and ngaz, talkin' like bitches
Bitches singin' like snitches, pointin' you out in pictures
'Cause she rep the QBC faithfully, playa hatin' me
All that bullst is just makin' me
More the better then concentrate on gettin' chedda
If shorty set you up you better dead her, I told you
Shape and mold you, son, you then I hold you
Like a pimp mind control you double edge blow you
It'll be I like I'm supposed to, the click is coastal
International to local, Bacardi mix physically fix
Hit you with st, that'll leave a loose nga stiff
Probably thick, son I solved 'em
Pulled him in my world then evolved him to chaos
Walk the beat like, around the way cops the average pitstop
QBCity GodFather Part III, Gotti Gambino

And Ty Nitty, Scarface rest in peace

Aiyyo it's hell on earth, who's next or gonna be first
The projects is front lines and the enemy is one time

I ain't gotta tell you it's right in front of your eyes

it's hell on earth, who's next or gonna be first
The projects is front lines and the enemy is one time
I ain't gotta tell you it's right in front of your eyes
Yo, the heavy metal king hold big st, with spare clips
You seein' clips when the mac spit your top got split
Layin' dead with open eyes close his eyelids
Turn off his lights switch to darkness 'cause deep in the abyss
Is street life, blood on my kicks, st on my knife
You's the wild child, kid cold turnin' men into mice
I was born to take power leave my mark on this planet
The Phantom of Crime Rap, ngaz is left stranded
Shut down your operation, closed for business
Leave a foul taste in your mouth, like Guinness
POW ngaz is found MIA
We move like the special forces, green beret
Heavily around my throat, I don't play
st brand new, back in eighty-nine, the same way
The God P walk with a limp see, but simply
To simplify st, no man can go against me
Test me you must be bent G, don't tempt me
I had this full clip for so long, it needs to empty
The reason why it full for so long, cause I don't waste st
You properly hit, blood in your mouth, so you could taste it
Quiet as kept, I lay back and watch the world spin
I hear thugs claimin' that they gonna rob the Mobb
When they see us, I tell you what black, here's the issue
It's a package deal, you rob me, you take this message
Along with that, I ain't your average cat
fk rap, I'm tryin' to make Cream and that's that
Whatever it takes however it gots to go down
Four mikes on stage a motherfkin' four pound
Speakers leakin' out sound and ngaz leakin' on the ground
I could truly care less the God will get his
Regardless blow for blow let's find out who wear hardest
This rap artist used to be a stickup artist
Sometimes I test myself see if I still got it
A live nga stay on point never diss
Regard st or forget the essence, from which I emerged
P is sick, so save that bullst for the burbs
Live up to my word, if I got beef, ngaz comin' in herds
We flush through your click get purged
