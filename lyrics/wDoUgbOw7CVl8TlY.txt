Hannah my darling I will follow you into the sunrise under desert sky
We fly, rise together with our hearts upon our sleeves for all to see
We two will breathe, aqua queen though vast distance between us, heart sails with love
For you, I love you, I love you I do
Love you, I love you, I love you I do
Nakamarra sweet red earth will hold you like the strength you bless to me
True we engage humility, watch me struggle with your words however truthful they may be
We'll see in time, opening our hearts and nurturing our minds to shine
I love you, love you, I love you I do
Love you, I love you, I love you I do
Oh it sets our hearts to fire, sweeps you and I
Honey dont you, know it sets our heart to fire, sweeps you and I
Honey dont you, know we two will pulse love in through this light
Honey dont you, know we two will pulse
I'll always love you, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Love you, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Love you I do
Love you, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Love you, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Love you I do
Hannah my darling I will follow you into the sunrise under desert sky

We fly, rise together with our hearts upon our sleeves for all to see
We two will breathe, aqua queen though vast distance between us, heart sails with love
For you, I love you, I love you I do
Love you, I love you, I love you I do
Oh it sets our hearts to fire, sweeps you and I
Honey dont you, know it sets our heart to fire, sweeps you and I
Honey dont you, know we two will pulse love in through this light
Honey dont you, know we two will pulse
