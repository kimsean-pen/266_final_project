Don't wanna stand still, gotta move ahead
There's nothing left to be done or said
She's gone to work and left a note on the door
Just 'Goodbye', it couldn't say more

Forget your job and we'll stay in bed
Nothing's left but you in my head
So drive this car and we'll run away
Nothing left but a perfect day

But I don't understand it, I thought I always would
And I know that I need it, it always felt so good

No matter what, I'll never let you go
No matter what, I'll never let you go
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Don't wanna stay here, I can't get away
There's nothing left, no more words to say
So I'll stay here with an open door
I miss your taste but I need you more

'Cause I don't understand it, I thought I always would
And I know that I need it, you always taste so good

No matter what, I'll never let you go
No matter what, I'll never let you go

No matter what, I'll never let you go
No matter what, I'll never let you go
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
