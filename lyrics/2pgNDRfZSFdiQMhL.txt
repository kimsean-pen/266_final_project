I've been wasting time
In your lonesome eyes

I've been split in half:
I wanna be a
Perfect match

Pull me up tonight
By my broken teeth
And my lies

Face the fire
The fear
It makes me wild
It makes me wild

Face the fire
The fear
It makes me wild
It makes me wild

I've been having fun:
My eyes are closed
I'm on the run

Hate inside my heart
It washes over
Every thought

I'll always be the one

When I'm dead and gone

There's no one left

I'm the only one
I'm the only one
I'm the only one

I've been wasting time
Oh your begging eyes
In my mind

Help me to become -
The one who got away
Fortunate son

Face the fire
The fear
It makes me wild
It makes me wild

Face the fire
The fear
It makes me wild
It makes me wild

Face the fire
The fear
It makes me wild
It makes me wild

Make me wild
