I still recall every summer night
Like it was yesterday
The time could never end
And my friends were family
Nothing mattered more
Than the loyalty we had
Now I'm a world away from everything we shared

I had something better
Waiting ahead
I try to take control of my heart
I had something better
But I'll tear it down and I'll tape it up by my own design, I fall

Bring back the days
Three story parking lot
The air is never dry
As the city falls asleep
Days bleed into the night
The tables set the stage for a life of memories
But I'm a world away from everything

I had something better
Waiting ahead
I try to take control of my heart
I had something better
But I'll tear it down and I'll tape it up by my own design
I fall apart as time passes by
I fall apart but the memories never die

I still recall every summer night
It seems like yesterday
But I'm still a world away (but I'm still a world away)

I had something better
Waiting ahead
I try to take control of my heart
I had something better
But I'll tear it down and I'll tape it up by my own design, I fall
I had something better (I had something better)
I had something better
And I fall apart as time passes
