I'm in my penthouse half naked
I cooked this meal for you naked
So, where the hell you at?
There's just one shot left of this drink
In this glass, don't make me break it
Wish that you were me
So you could feel this feeling

I never broke one promise
And I know that you're not honest
Now you got me yelling
That's because I'm jealous

(If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine) Ooh, I'm jealous
(If you're keeping your promise,
I'm keeping mine) Ooh, I'm jealous, uhn

Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that i never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and say to myself
Baby girl, you can't survive like this

Take it one step further
Freakum dress out of my closet
Yonce filling out this skirt
I look damn good I aint lost it
And I aint missed a beat
Boy you been hanging out at night
I'm stayin out until tomorrow
Dancin on them tables
Aint got no cares no sarrows

I ran into my ex
Say what's up to his bestest
Now we reminiscing
How we used to flex in texas
Don't be jealous

(If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine) Ooh, I'm jealous
(If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine) I'm jealous

Sometimes i wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I'll never ever do
I take one look in the mirror and say to myself
Baby girl you can't survive like this, no

And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know that I'm being hateful
But that aint nothing
That aint' nothing
I'm just jealous
I'm just human
Don't judge me

(If you're keeping your promise,
I'm keeping mine) Don't judge me, ooh, I'm jealous
(If you're keeping your promise, i'm keeping min)
