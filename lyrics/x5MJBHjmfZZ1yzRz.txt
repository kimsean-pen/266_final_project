Oh la la
Comme si, comme si, comme ca
One day I feel it's love
Next day it's not enough
It goes

Un, deux, trois
Comme si, comme si, comme ca
One day I feel so high
Next day I wanna cry singing

Oh la la, la la la la la la
Je suis fort de toi
Please don't break my heart

Sometimes when you're away
All my life turns grey
I think of you all day
Wish you come back and stay

Sometimes when you're with me
It is real love I see
Or do you play with me?
I need to know what you feel

I need to know what you feel
I need to know what you feel

But then I look in your eyes
And then oh baby you smile
I can't resist you and you turn me upside down
And when I feel your sweet kiss
Oh I know that's what I miss
I get so high, oh I know I never wanna come down

Oh la la
Comme si, comme si, comme ca
One day I feel it's love
Next day it's not enough
It goes

Un, deux, trois
Comme si, comme si, comme ca
One day I feel so high
Next day I wanna cry singing

Oh la la, la la la la la la
Je suis fort de toi
Please don't break my heart

Sometimes when love comes seen
It takes you for a spin
But when it drifts away
You cry all night all day

Sometimes it's yeah yeah yeah
Sometimes it's no no no
That's just the way love goes
I need to know what you feel

I need to know what you feel
I need to know what you feel

But then I look in your eyes
And then oh baby you smile
I can't resist you and you turn me upside down
And when I feel your sweet kiss
Oh I know that's what I miss
I get so high, oh
