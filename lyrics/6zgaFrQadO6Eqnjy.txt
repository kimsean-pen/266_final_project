Consumption is consuming me
The laissez hasn't been fair to me
A party for the sea is like a funeral for the beach
And there's a crooked line I don't want to take the time to straighten
'Cause when you do, you realize it's the whole damn world that's bent

Here's the mission: to go omniscient
To run with scissors and skip the incision
The truth? It's got vision but it's got no heart
Keep shrugging on Atlas, while the market goes dark

Everything goes in waves
Grasshoppers are gonna party while the ants are going to save
Some teams only want to play
If they get to rig the game
Shame

Greed; one of the seven deadly sins
Many gonna enter, few gonna win
Always try to notify the next of kin,
'Cause many gonna enter, few gonna win

Greed; one of the seven deadly sins
Many gonna enter, few gonna win
Always try to notify the next of kin
'Cause many gonna enter, few gonna win

Good news is everybody gets to have an outlet
But bad news is everybody gets to have an outlet
I've been poor and I've been rich
The first one stung but the second one itched

The cash is just the rash
Without the pleasure of the scratch
You know? Until you've had yourself a hurricane
You're gonna fret,
you're gonna fret, you're gonna fret, every raindrop

Greed; one of the seven deadly sins
Many gonna enter, few gonna win
Always try to notify the next of kin
'Cause many gonna enter, few gonna win

Greed; one of the seven deadly sins
Many gonna enter, few gonna win
Always try to notify the next of kin
'Cause many gonna enter, few gonna win

(Greed, greed, greed, greed, greed)

All my Gordon Gekkos and my Bernie Madoffs, I want to see you
(Pop your white collars up! Pop your white collars up!)
Offshore accounts, tax havens, swimming pools, movie stars
(Pop your white collars up! Pop your white collars up!)
Everybody! I want to see you
(Pop your white collars up! Pop your white collars up!)
You know, very rarely is good art born in the board room
(Pop your white collars up! Pop your white collars up!)
You remember that

Greed; one of the seven deadly sins
Many gonna enter, few gonna win
Always try to notify the next of kin
'Cause many gonna enter, few gonna win

Greed; one of the seven deadly sins
Many gonna enter, few gonna win
Always try to notify the next of kin
'Cause many gonna enter, few gonna win
