Just for today
I wanna feel like myself
Don't wanna hide
I don't wanna hurt
In this small town
with you gone far away
And all the stares,
It brings me down

Everyone's gone
I am here on my own
and this small house
feels so empty now
I hit the road
and drive into the hills
But all the tears
It's bring me down

Don't hide
Don't hurt
In a few years you will realise
The truth, the pain, will subside
Don't let the tears bring
you down tonight
I wanna run away, far away
