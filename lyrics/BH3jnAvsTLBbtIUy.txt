Silver in the river, set to my mind
Silver in the river, it flows blind
Silver in the river, I see it in your eyes
Silver eyes

The second night, silver eyes
Don't sympathize, silver eyes
So you're running back backwards
Feel it in my chest
So you're runnin' in the foreground
Say it's for the best
In the wake of the waves
I can hear your breathe
By the flicker of the light
I watched the tied subside

And I look into your silver eyes
And something doesn't seem quite right
And it's only the second night,
It's only the second night,
It's only the second night,
Ooooh

So you're running back backwards
Feel it in my chest
So you're runnin' in the foreground
Say it's for the best

And I look into your silver eyes
And something doesn't seem quite right
And it's only the second night,
It's only the second night,
It's only the second night,
It's only the second night
