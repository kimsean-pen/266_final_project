What's inside, telling you to be that way?
Borderline, another chance to break away
Out of luck, temporarily unkind
Nevermind

All the same, future is a dying game
Are you sure? Evidently self-assured
Televised people always look the same
Realise, future is a dying game

All join in! Invite the world to come on in
And bring your friends who've got a lot to say
Someday soon there'll be nothing left for you
To laugh about
Are we having fun yet?

What's inside, telling you to be that way?
Wasting time, permanently yesterday
Out of luck, temporarily unkind
Nevermind

All join in! Invite the world to come on in
And bring your friends who've got a lot to say
Someday soon there'll be nothing left for you
To laugh about
Are we having fun yet?
