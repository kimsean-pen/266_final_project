I can't blame you
I can't save you
But I will try for you and I
For you and I, I won't find out
All the dirty little things that you've done
But I will try
Ah
I'm coming for you giants and you liars and your chariots of fire
You charmers with your anecdotes have started to show your true colors
Now, I'm staring at the moon

Wondering why the bottom fell out
I've been searching for answers, and there's questions I've found
Open your eyes, and share this burden somehow
You ready to drink, or are you waiting to drown?

I would break you

Before I let you fall into the blind
For you and I
For you and I, I will breathe in
All the truth I can stomach
If it keeps you alive
Ah
We've changed the dreamers and the
preachers and the wise men on the hill
To concrete stepping smilers terrified to lose their power and control
We've been crying for a leader to speak like the old prophets

The blood of the forgotten wasn't
spilled without a purpose, or was it?
And now, I'm staring at the moon

Wondering why the bottom fell out

Been searching for answers, and there's questions I've found
Open your eyes, and share this burden somehow
You ready to drink, or are you waiting to drown?

Yeah, you'll never be whole
Yeah, you'll never be whole
Until you lose control
And think freely
To smash the wall of apathy
Stop your self-importance
And lift the weight off somebody else
Yeah, you'll never be whole
Yeah, you'll never be whole
Until you lose control
And stop drinking
The wine that's been dripping
From lips of the gluttons
And envying their bloody teeth
Yeah, you'll never be whole
Yeah, you'll never be whole
Until you lose control
