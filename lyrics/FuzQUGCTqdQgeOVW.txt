Dark abysmal scheme - a curse beyond death
I revel and fester,
Devouring flesh and bone

Hating of the masses - A blight without cure
I lavishly dismember
Devouring guts and gore - rotten to the core

Voraciously impatient, a relentless need
My growing urge to feed
I am the end - of man
For I am Hell, farewell to the flesh

I am sin incarnate - sin immaculate
Bringer of butchery - the birthplace of disease
Herald of misery

I am become death - portrait of humanity
The birthplace of disease
Behold my tapestry - a deranged fantasy

Devouring guts and gore, a brew I adore
For I am Hell, farewell to the flesh

Nazarene, bow to me
For I am blasphemy
Nazarene, bow to me
The ultimate flattery
Nazarene, bow to me
Nazarene, bleed

A sick joke with cruel intention,
The puppetry to which we're subjected
A giant farce based on false prophets
Deities praying upon the subjected

As I bid farewell to the flesh
The corpses pile up ever so fresh

As I bring desolation,
Slaughtering fields of my enemies
Stricken from light, the burden of life
As I bring desolation,
Slaughtering fields of my enemies
I have lived as a god and shall die as one
Farewell to the flesh

Dark abysmal scheme - a curse beyond death
I revel and fester,

Devouring guts and gore, a brew I adore
For I am Hell, farewell to the flesh
