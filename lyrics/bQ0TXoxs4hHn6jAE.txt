Éléonore the fairest of them all
So young and vulnerable
In January snow a shimmering golden gown

Rise for the Kingdom's cause
Demon's blood in golden gown
Seize the power of the crown
Hatred frozen in our veins

Rise for the kinfolk's laws
She decieived the servile soul
Find her fight her seize the Queen
Pelt her stone her end this fraud

So faithful to her love
Devoted to the crown
A queen of foreign blood but hatred in her soul

Fight for the Kingdom's cause
Blue-blood armed in golden robe
Seize the power of the crown
Empress poison mortal force

Men made of flesh and blood
She deceived our servile soul
Find her fight her seize the Queen
Bring her tothe trail's court

A queen of foreign blood
And hatred in her soul

In her barge upriver in the dark
They seized her from the bridge
Dirt stained red silk damask
In vain a mother in her heart torn apart

In the drk upriver in the barge
They seized her from the bridge
