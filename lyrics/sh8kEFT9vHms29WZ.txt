Where the fuck did you go?
The day you left me for dead again.
But did you ever think I could be different?
You never gave me a chance.

Wake up. (Wake up)
I still feel like I'm sleeping,
Sleeping so heavy in my own thoughts.
They contain (contain) words (words) I once said to her,
So overdramatic, so over-the-top.

And now I can't stop reminiscing
On times that I wish I could just go re-live.
Because a whole year without you my dear,
Completely cut from my life from some stupid fight I caused.

So where the fuck did I go?
That day you left me for good.
I guess I tried to grow stronger
As our love just got weaker.
I still remember the promise
I made for you that day.
"You've got to be more happy in your life"
But things just aren't alright without you.
