Today the sun is cold,
And the wind calls my name
Can feel it in the air
Makes my body shiver
I cry cause I can't be
A big white based and free
Diving from the sky, you took me by surprise

Ticky, ticky, tell me what I want
I'd like you to tell me why

Today the sun is cold,
The wind calls my name
Can feel it in the air
Makes my body shiver
I cry cause I can't be
A big white based and free
Diving from the sky, you took me by surprise

Ticky, ticky, tell me why, ticky, ticky oh
Ticky, ticky, tell me why, ticky, ticky oh
I'd like you to tell me why
Ticky, ticky, tell me why, ticky, ticky oh
Ticky, ticky, tell me why, ticky, ticky oh
I'd like you to tell me why
I'd like you to tell me, tell me why
Ticky, ticky, tell me why, why, why, why, why

Diving from the sky,
Ticky, ticky, tell me why
Diving from the sky

Ticky, ticky, tell me why, ticky, ticky oh
Ticky, ticky, tell me why, ticky, ticky oh
I'd like you to tell me why
Ticky, ticky, tell me why, ticky, ticky oh
Ticky, ticky, tell me why, ticky, ticky oh
I'd like you to tell me why
I'd like you to tell me, tell me why
Ticky, ticky, tell me why,
Diving from the sky,
Ticky, ticky, tell me why, why.
