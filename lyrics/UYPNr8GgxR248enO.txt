Jungle protects the past
Jungle protects the past

Man in white pressed finger tips
Against suntanned bodies
Steaming skins and silver hair
Even better than a medal
Even better than a medal

When in Rome
Electric cavemen
When in Rome
Propeller dying
When in Rome
Silently praying
My honour is my loyalty
Is life more precious than property
Here comes the bride
All dressed in white
Time to think
Can we have a little more light
Palm oil
Surrounded by burnt bodies
Over the phone came hate
Why do the girls always follow the boys from Brazil
Why do the girls always follow the boys from Brazil
Why have I been spared
Vengeance
Why have I been spared if not for vengeance
Vengeance for those wasted years
If we forget the past we're doomed to repeat it
