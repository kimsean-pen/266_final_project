I don't care if your world is ending today
Because I wasn't invited to it anyway
You said I tasted famous so I drew you a heart
But now I'm not an artist, I'm a fucking work of art

I got an F and a C
And I got a K too
And the only thing that's missin'
Is a bitch like U

You wanted perfect
You've got your perfect now
I'm too perfect for someone like you

I was a dandy in your ghetto
With the snow white smile
But you'll never be as perfect whatever you do

What's my name? What's my name?
Ah ah ah ah ah
Hold the S because I am an AINT

What's my name? What's my name?
Ah ah ah ah ah
Hold the S because I am an AINT

Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah

I am a bone-top, a deaths head, on a mop-stick
You infected me, took diamonds, I took all your shit
Your 'sell by date' expired so you had to be sold
I'm a suffer genius and then a sex symbol

You wanted perfect
You've got your perfect now
I'm too perfect for someone like you

I was a dandy in your ghetto
With the snow white smile
But you'll never be as perfect whatever you do

What's my name? What's my name?
Ah ah ah ah ah
Hold the S because I am an AINT

What's my name? What's my name?
Ah ah ah ah ah
Hold the S because I am an AINT

Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah

I got an F and a C
And I got a K too
And the only thing that's missin' is U

I got an F and a C
And I got a K too
And the only thing that's missin'
Is a bitch like U

I got an F and a C
And I got a K too
And the only thing that's missin'
Is a bitch like U

I am the dandy in the ghetto
With a snow white smile
Super ego bitch I've been evil a while
I am the dandy in the ghetto
With a snow white smile
Super ego bitch I've been evil a while
What's my name? What's my name?
Ah ah ah ah a
Hold the S because I am an AINT
What's my name? What's my name?
Ah ah ah ah ah
Hold the S because I am an AINT
What's my name? What's my name?
Ah ah ah ah ah
Hold the S because I am an AINT
What's my name? What's my name?
Ah ah ah ah ah
Hold the S because I am an AINT
