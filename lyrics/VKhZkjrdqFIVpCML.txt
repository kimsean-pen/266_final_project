It's easier to think you're dumb
Like you were
It's easier to think you're no fun
Who would know?
It's easier to think you can't go on

Please keep close to me
I don't want to let you off my arm
But it happened all along and
You don't like you used to be
You don't look like you did on TV

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

And all the while I never won
Up and down
And all the while I put a smile on
Can't turn round
And all the while opened to you no

Please keep close to me
I don't want to let you off my arm
But it happened all along and
You don't like you used to be
You don't look like you did on TV

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
