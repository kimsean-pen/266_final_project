Saw myself fresh out at the moon
And I sold myself so I can be a big star
And I'll be your monkey every night
If it makes you love me, watch me now
Watch me, watch me
Is that the way? I never knew
Is that the way?
Is that the way? I never knew
I was a waste
I'm not a human, I'm just a body
Just a dancing shell here to make you happy
I have no feelings, I have no thoughts
I have to make you love, watch me now
Watch me, watch me
Is that the way? I never knew
Is that the way?
Is that the way? I never knew
I was a waste
Is that the way? I never knew
Is that the way?
Is that the way? I never knew
I was a waste
Is that the way? I never knew
Is that the way?
Is that the way? I never knew
I was a waste
