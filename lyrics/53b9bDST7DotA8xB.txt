I've been feeling you so hard
Dim my mind has left
Mostly i feel good
When i see us through

Love is what we came for
Oh yes, break to lose
I could feel my soul no more
Every spirit all passing through

Oh, what i gotta do for love it's just you know
What i gotta do (to) believe this was love
I can't (ever)? live without

Spicy sauce and angel food
It's too late to eat with you
Yes and no, i asked you out
Let's be clear, i'm not so proud
