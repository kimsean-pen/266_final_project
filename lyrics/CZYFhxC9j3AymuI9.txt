If you want words to live your life by
Walk the graves, walk the graves
It's written on the headstones

If you want words to live your life by
Walk the graves, walk the graves
It's written on the headstones
Time waits for no one

We are living proof of a world gone mad
But this is all we have, we spin in cycles
We drift in the dark our world falling apart
Chance made us brothers, loyal to the last breath I take
Our legacy won't be wasted on me

Side by side through thick and thin in the darkest times
Together we'll be searching for life in all we have left
We won't be servants of time, not alive in regret
Live every moment as if it was your last
Honour the past but never look back
I should count my blessings for all I have

And the fact I ever had the chance made us brothers, loyal to the last breath I take
Our legacy won't be wasted on me
We'll be singing from the fire with smoke in our eyes
Coalition deprived, we are alive at night

if you want words to live your life by
Walk the graves, walk the graves
It's written on the headstones

If you want words to live your life by
Walk the graves, walk the graves
It's written on the headstones
Time waits for no one
Our legacy won't be wasted on me
Chance made us brothers, loyal to the last breath I take
Our legacy won't be wasted on me
