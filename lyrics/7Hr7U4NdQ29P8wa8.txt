When she turned eighteen she went astray
With her brother's dealer, so they say
She had the baby yesterday
Perhaps it's just a rumour
They kept her prisoner growing up
Told her Jesus was enough
She's really into dirty stuff
Perhaps it's just a rumour
And if you asked her she'd say

I'm just tryin' to work out
How to be like myself
I'm just tryin' to work out
These cards I've been dealt

See that girl she's looking great
She used to be quite overweight
She may not be entirely straight
Perhaps it's just a rumour
Always did as she was told
Apparently she's on the dough
Spends it all on alcohol
Perhaps it's just a rumour

I'm just tryin' to work out
How to be like myself
I'm just tryin' to work out
These cards I've been dealt

'Cause she did it, she did it
Her bed is forbidden
He's fitting she isn't
She keeps her face hidden
She told 'em good riddance
Her sister brought with 'em
She wishes she didn't
And now they're all singing

Just tryin' to work out
How to be like myself
I'm just tryin' to work out
These cards I've been dealt

I'm just tryin' to work out
How to be like myself
I'm just tryin' to work out
These cards I've been dealt

She did it, she did it
Her bed is forbidden
He's fitting she isn't
She keeps her face hidden
She told 'em good riddance
Her sister brought with 'em
She wishes she didn't
And now they're all singing

I'm just tryin' to work out
How to be like myself
I'm just tryin' to work out
These cards I've been dealt

Just tryin' to work out
How to be like myself
I'm just tryin to work out
These cards I've been dealt
