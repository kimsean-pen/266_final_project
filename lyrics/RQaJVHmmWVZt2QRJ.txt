Through the cocoon
Tears through me

True oath
To them
To me

Sleeping in
Fall asleep
Fall behind me

Are you captured

I commit, i commit
It gets better whenever you lie to me

I commit, i commit
It gets better whenever you lie to me

Are you gone
Are you gone
Are you gone
Are you gone

Fall in
Fall down
Its nothing
