On the weekend
You'll find your way and lose it again
You know, now I've told you
That your head is much more bent,
With her voice she said

I'd die for you anyday
My life's over anyway
Lets go to the empty park and talk till it's really dark

In the day time we'll think about the sun until it sets
Ooooh Ooooh Ooooh Ooooh
You notice a difference, in the way we comprehend
With her voice she said

I'd die for you anyday
My life's over anyway
Lets go to the empty park and talk till it's really dark

I'll take you to the park
I'll take you to the ocean
I'll kiss you till it's dark
Go through all the motions
I'll take you to the park
I'll take you to the ocean
I'll kiss you till it's dark
Go through all the motions

Wooah Ooooh Ooooh Ooooh (x9)
Do you really want it? (x9)
