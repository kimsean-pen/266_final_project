And all the light, will be, will be
And all the future prophecy
And all the waves, the sea, the sea
And on the road, are you and me

Hmmmmmmmm
Hmmmmmmmm

And all the wings are like a kiss
And all the years are nemesis
And all the moments fall in mist
And all is dust, remember this

Hmmmmmmmm
Hmmmmmmmm
Hmmmmmmmm
Hmmmmmmmm

And all the lights, will be, will be
And all the waves, the sea
And all the waves, the sea, the sea
And all the light, will be

And all the dust will drift away (ooh)
And all the nights and all the days
And all the heavens go their way
And only change is here to stay
Hmmmmmmmm
Hmmmmmmmm
Hmmmmmmmm
Hmmmmmmmm

And all the light, will be, will be
And all the waves, the sea
And all the waves, the sea, the sea
And all the light, will be

And all the stars, without a name
And all the skies, that look the same
And all the clouds, that fade, and then
Then all of this, begins again

Hmmmmmmmm
Hmmmmmmmm
