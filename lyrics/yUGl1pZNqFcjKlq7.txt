Smoke & Mirrors
The Illusion Called The City
Sweat & Tears
Sizzling Neon Gypsy
Fantasy, Hot & Hungry Tease
A Stigma In Every Direction
Kept From Light & Forced To Fight
I Stalk The Night Like A Barracuda

Destiny, What Did You Used To Be
One Mask On The Flashing Totem
Missed A Step And Found Yourself
Down The Hole Of The Inferno

Fantasy, Hot & Hungry Tease
A Stigma In Every Direction
Kept From Light & Forced To Fight
I Stalk The Night Like A Barracuda
So Fresh & Clean, Incandescent Dream
Lipstick, Brandy, & Eye Sheen
What Does It Mean, Rainbowed Gasoline
Sometimes I Really Like It
Kept From Light & Forced To Fight
I'm Secretly Faithful To Pleasure
Hungry Nights In Neon Lights
I Taste A Rainbow Of Day-Glo Flavors

Idolize Burning Paradise
But The Truth Is In Your Complexion
Faces Rife With City Life
A Stigma In Every Direction

So Fresh & Clean, Incandescent Dream
Lipstick, Brandy, & Eye Sheen
What Does It Mean, Rainbowed Gasoline
A Stigma In Every Direction
