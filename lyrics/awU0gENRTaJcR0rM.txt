The mortals fears in transylvanian dreams came true

In the forgotten cemetery
haunting in night for blood
I've been waiting for years
I'm what you shall become
In the Carpathian mountains
Transylvania

Under the stone of doom
Non dead I wake
Tormenting humans in fear
Dwelling for eternity
Eternity...

Into the black castle
Out from my coffin
I seek what I need

From the crypt to the forest
All so old and strange

A place of eternity
Riding on the wolves howls
I'm one with the fog

One more night
Oh majestuous Transylvania
They've fallen under my yoke

Hear; the voices of the high master
As I satisfy my lust
As your blood is now my life
One more is joining my realm

At dawn, I 'll escape the lethal daylight
