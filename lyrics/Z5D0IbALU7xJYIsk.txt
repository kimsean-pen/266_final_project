Kingdom never comes, your will is never done
May sulphur blacken your wicked lungs, breath deeply
I'll drown your earth in brimstone
Spread wide the engulfing abyss wreathed in embers
Desperation means little if I've nothing to bereave
I fearlessly stand in the wrath of majesty
Come the flood of fire, break the skin asunder
Break me free of earthly chains, cast no judgement of virtue
Without guilt or remorse, bring me purity, bring me resolve
Come the flood of fire, break the skin asunder
Dim the light of day, come the flood of fire
Burn the sins away, bring the end of all
Strip me bare of all I love and bring me pain
Know what life means when all is lost
The wind sings a solemn dirge for me alone
Unsung in tongues, forgotten through the ages
There's no salvation to be found in death's embrace, when the embers die
I fade for nothing, burn for no one, burn for no one
Bring the wind that carries me with the snow, onto hallowed ground
Behold the stones that cradle the ashes cold, ashes cold, dead trees thy altar...
