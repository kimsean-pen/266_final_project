My head spins round and round
I can't remember what I did last night
(Did last night)
I can't recall a thing
It must have been over a stupid fight
(A stupid fight)
Oh no what you say
Don't stop anyway
What you say
What what you say
Ah ah don't you dare
Hah Hah I don't care
What you say
What what you say
You will hear me when I come
When I pop my cherry gum
I will never stop pop
Never ever stop pop
You will hear me when I come
When I pop my cherry gum
I will never stop pop
Never ever stop pop
So oh oh oh oh oh
A taste so sweet
I can't get enough
So here we go
Oh oh oh oh oh
A taste so sweet
I can't get enough
I can't resist to show
I think that something is about to blow
(A-about to blow)
If pink will blue on you
You better move, there's nothing you can do
(You can do)
Oh no what you say
Don't stop anyway
What you say
What what you say
Ah Ah don't you dare
Hah hah I don't care
What you say
What what you say
You will hear me when I come
When I pop my cherry gum
I will never stop pop
Never ever stop pop
You will hear me when I come
When I pop my cherry gum
I will never stop pop
Never ever stop pop
So oh oh oh oh oh
A taste so sweet
I can't get enough
So here we go
Oh oh oh oh oh
A taste so sweet
I can't get enough
Ah ah what you say
No no anyway
Go go
Go go
Hah hah what you say
No no anyway
Go go
Go go
You will hear me when I come
When I pop my cherry gum
I will never stop pop
Never ever stop
(What you say)
(What what you say)
(What you say)
(What what you say)
You will hear me when I come
When I pop my cherry gum
I will never stop pop
Never ever stop pop
You will hear me when I come
When I pop my cherry gum
I will never stop pop
Never ever stop pop
So oh oh oh oh oh
A taste so sweet
I can't get enough
So here we go
Oh oh oh oh oh
A taste so sweet I can't get enough
*POP*
