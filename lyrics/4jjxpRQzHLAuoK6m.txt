Hey princess, in a white dress
Chuck Taylors got me obsessed
I wanna see you so when can we hang out

Hey princess, in a contest
You're the queen and you own the rest
Someday we're gonna take the crown

Let's go, let go
Hold on to me, oh, oh
Let's go, I'ma let you know

I'll be the one to storm in the castle
We'll be the two hearts beating faster
Whatever you want, whatever you want, I'm down

I'll be the one that makes you adore me
We'll be the two, to end of story
The one that I want, one that I want I found
It's your kiss, hey princess

Hey princess, be my guest
Chase you around, no regrets
If I catch you, I'll never let you down

Let's go, let go
Hold on to me, oh, oh
Let's go, I'ma let you know

I'll be the one to storm in the castle
We'll be the two hearts beating faster
Whatever you want, whatever you want, I'm down

I'll be the one that makes you adore me
We'll be the two, the two end of story
The one that I want, one that I want, I found
It's your kiss, hey princess

What if all the stars aligned?
Could I ever make you mine?
When the movie ends
We can be the ever after, you and I

I'm just a boy and you're Cinderella
Snow white in blue jeans, I'm gonna tell you
Whatever you want, whatever you want, I'm down
I'll be the one that makes you adore me
We'll be the two, the two end of story
The one that I want, one that I want, I found
I'll be the one to storm in the castle
We'll be the two hearts beating faster
Whatever you want, whatever you want, down
I'll be the one that makes you adore me
We'll be the two, the two end of story
The one that I want, one that I want, I found
It's your kiss, hey princess
