just say what's on your mind

what'cha know about love
you said our love would be
you said you were my girlfriend
some girl you turned out to be
i guess you know about leaving
loving and leaving me
you left me for no reason
but you led me to believe

sometimes your life can crumble
sometimes your soul might make a stumble
but you can't drown in your sorrow
cause you might be found
you might be found tomorrow

what'cha know about living
when you've been treated like a queen
but a queen don't know about giving
i ain't looking to receive

sometimes your life can crumble
sometimes your soul might make a stumble
but you can't drown in your sorrow
cause you might be found
you might be found tomorrow

sometimes your life can crumble
sometimes your soul might make a stumble
but you can't drown in your sorrow
cause you might be found
you might be found tomorrow

i said, you might be found
you might be found tomorrow
well, you might be found
you might be found tomorrow (x3)
