Me and my friend Neil, is just how we feel
no one here's step on our toes.
When will rap together nothing could be better
catchin spots and watchin shows.
Hey, I forgot that you're the best friend that I have ever had
hey, I know now if I'll be gone before a show time.
Me and my friend Neil we go where we feel like
no one here's gonna step on our toes.
I'm on the end of palm street that's where me and Neil meet

Hey, what was that we've been let this seem spot for 5 years
I didn't know then that I'll be around for a long time.
Me and my friend Neil, we go where we feel like
we don't hear that you wanna step on our toes,
when we go out on Fridays, we come back on Saturdays
me and him fading until the sun rose.
Hey, what was that, you're the best friend that I have ever had
I didn't think about it until now but I'll be gone for a small time.
Yeah!
