We dance to grow
We grow to give
We stop to move
We move to live

Someone's meaning a lot to me

We turn and we take
We slip and we slide
We hurt
We break
We pain
We cry

But someone's meaning a lot to me

And I don't want to fight it
I want to know it
I don't want to hide it
I want to love it

Someone's meaning a lot to me
You are meaning a lot to me

I know the void, the void knows me.
It keeps us weak, the void told me
That you are meaning a lot to me.

And I don't want to fight it
I want to know it
I don't want to hide it
I want to love it

Someone's meaning a lot to me
You are meaning a lot to me

You are meaning a lot to me
You are meaning a lot to me
You are meaning a lot to me
You are meaning a lot to me
You are meaning a lot to me
You are meaning a lot to me
You are meaning a lot to me
