I don't need to hear
How you shed yourself of fear
Your words endear
But your intent is clear
I can see right through your chandelier

Through the roof
Haven't hit the ceiling of the room
You reflect the limelight hue
But I remember you before you bloomed

You're through the roof
But you haven't hit the ceiling of the room

I don't need to know
All about your latest whoa
It's thin, just so you know
And I'm already underneath your soul

Through the roof
Haven't hit the ceiling of the room
You reflect the limelight hue
But I remember you before you bloomed

You're crystal clear
Chandelier
You're crystal clear
I can see right through your chandelier

Through the roof
Haven't hit the ceiling of the room
You reflect the limelight hue
But I remember you before you bloomed

You're through the roof
But you haven't hit the ceiling of the room

You're through the roof
But you haven't hit the ceiling of the room
