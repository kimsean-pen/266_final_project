I'm an amnesiac, forgot what it's like, to be happy.
Some kind of maniac,
that'll follow you around when I know you don't want me.
I was so blind, don't ask,
don't care. Open my eyes, now I see, there's...
Something that I've been entitled
to, for too long, too long, too long.
Something that I've been missing, uh-oh-ohhhhh.
Shame on you, but shame on me, too.
I liked it in the dark,
feeling all around 'til I fell and stumbled,
but now I've got a spark, gonna light a fire and watch it crumble.
I wasn't always free,
always in a cuff, no more asleep ... Now I woke up too
Something that I've been entitled
to, for too long, too long, too long.
Something that I've been missing, uh-oh-ohhhhh.
Shame on you, but shame on me too.
Shame on you, but shame on me too.
I've played, in love, and its got,
to end. I was, in love, but I won't, pretend.
That something that I've been entitled to,

Something that I'll never find in you.
Shame on you, but shame on me, too.
