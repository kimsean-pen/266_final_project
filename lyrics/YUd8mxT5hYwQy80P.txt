Freak out and give in
Doesn't matter what you believe in
Stay cool and be somebody's fool this year
'Cause they know who is righteous, what is bold
So I'm told
Who wants honey
As long as there's some money
Who wants that honey?
Hipsters unite, come align for the big fight to rock for you
But beware, all those angels with their wings glued on
'Cause deep down, we are frightened and we're scared
If you don't stare
Who wants, honey?
As long as there's some money
Who wants that honey?
Let me out
Let me out
Let me out
Let me out
Tell me all of your secrets
Cannot help but believe this is true
Tell me all of your secrets
I know, I know, I know
Should have listened when I was told
Who wants that honey?
As long as there is some money
Who wants that honey?
Let me out
Let me out
Let me out
Let me out
