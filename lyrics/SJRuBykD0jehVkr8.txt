Go!

A rush of blood to my head
Leaves me winded and wanting
To feel the weakness in my body
Beaten and crushed like my soul
I walked the streets flirting death, but it never kissed back
I'm so lucky, so cursed, so fucked up
But that's the way that it goes, it's in the ebb and the flow
I wish that I could give you my time
Give you my time

Seems that doomsday has come early this year
The last angel has gone (angel has gone)
I can't remember the last time I cried
The last angel has gone home (angel has gone)

The memories stacking up and they pull at my guts
What do I have to do to end it
The better days hacked away leaving me only pain
This regret is never ending
But in the blink of an eye this life passes you by
I wish that I could give you my time
Give you my time

Seems that doomsday has come early this year
The last angel has gone (angel has gone)
I can't remember the last time I cried (last time I cried)
The last angel has gone home (angel has gone)

I can't remember
I can't remember
I can't remember the last time I cried

Seems that doomsday has come early this year
The last angel has gone (angel has gone)
I can't remember the last time I cried (last time I cried)
The last angel has gone home (angel has gone)
Doomsday has come early this year (angel has gone)
