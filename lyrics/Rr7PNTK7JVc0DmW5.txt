your brand new history

forget, forget, forget, forget

light of four dawns come
light of four dawns come
in the ghostly embrace
make out a face
when the four dawns come

whatever you were

forget, forget, forget, forget

light of four dawns come
light of four dawns come
in the ghostly embrace
make out a face
when the four dawns come

all you ever wanted
all you ever need
your brand new history

no crimes, no memory
