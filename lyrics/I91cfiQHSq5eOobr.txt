Young at heart
Young at heart

Young at heart
Yet what a start
Old before their time
They married young
For love at last
Was their only crime

How come I love them now?
How come I love them more?
Young at heart
You're so young at heart

Young at heart
Yet not a chance
To be a child at all
They told us tales
They told us lies
Don't they know
They shouldn't have told us at all

How come I love them now?
How come I love them more?
When all I wanted to do when I was old
Was to walk out the door

Young at heart
You're so young at heart
Young at heart
You're so young at heart

How come I love them now?
How come I love them more?
How come I love them now?
How come I love them more?
How come I love them now?
How come I love them more?
When all I wanted to do when I was old
Was to walk out the door

Young at heart
You're so young at heart
Young at heart
You're so young at heart
Young at heart
You're so young at heart
