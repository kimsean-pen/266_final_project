This been going for a minute
Cooped up in the dentist office flowing for the tenants
I been doing some stupid shit like going to work
When I could do some lucrative shit like writing a verse
But it's ok we gon make it someday
Whether it's 2028 or sunday
Do these shows for people that they've never heard of me
And they fuck with me but then they see me when they try to cop some sneaks
At footlocker working every damn day
And it's hard to tell people you rap, like ok
Everybody rap, my cousin Joe rap down the street
He rapped over that 0-100 it's pretty sweet
So I don't no what to do
So I stack a bit of paper cop a couple of shoes
It's therapeutic to a brother like me, what it do
I haven't combed my hair in a couple of weeks, maybe 2
Ok, maybe a couple of months, maybe 6
Same dude wearing dad pants, all white kicks
Got the pure money 4s with the silver eyelids
And a bad lil thing she about 5"6'
Actually I ain't got one
But them kicks that just dropped yeah I got them
Yeah that's Ritchie with a T
But please don't forget it like a fat bitch at the beach
Wassup

It's whatever dude, It's whatever dude
I ain't even tripping it's whatever dude
It's whatever dude, It's whatever dude
You can keep on talking it's whatever dude I do this for my people who say "Stepa we believe in ya"
Rather starve to death than consume that shit they feeding ya
Kind of antisocial so not big on social media
I'm just out here doing shows with my team
Snapback to reality work in the AM
I swear it's like waking up from a perfect dream
All I need is a little reefer and a fifth of heen
Shit, I been an alchy since I was a teen
Now I'm damn near 30 fighting demons like constantine
Stay fucking up that's a reoccurring theme
Truthfully, I haven't been doing my best
Story of my life I guess
I think it's time I digress
Shooting for positivity let y'all develop negatives
Call my homies fam they know me better than my relatives
Got squares in my circle but you know they still hella cool
Care less how you feel about me it's whatever dude
