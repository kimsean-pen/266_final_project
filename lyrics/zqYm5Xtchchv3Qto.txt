I met the day
Feeling cheaper than usual
I guess you could say that I'm on sale

So take what you can while you can
Shop now in tent sale
I could snap at any moment and I might feel more expensive, Ohh

I don't owe anything to you; I don't owe anything to you
You don't know me half as well as you think you do
I don't owe anything, anything to you

I met the mirror, with a price tag hanging from my ear
And In that moment I went unfazed
So take what you can while you can less conscience only means more gold
I could snap at any moment and remember that I was not born to be sold

I don't owe anything to you; I don't owe anything to you
You don't know me half as well as you think you do
I don't owe anything, anything to you

Ah...

I don't owe anything to you; I don't owe anything to you
You don't know me half as well as you think you do
I don't owe anything, anything to you

Ah...
