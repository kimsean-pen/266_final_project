Well you told me that I was just not the one
And you left me standing out in the cold
It's been a long time and I'm so much better now
That I'm looking back and seeing it all

And for the first time there's no pain in my life
Though it's a long hard road that I've gone
We had a good thing
And it made me a man and I know

You got me goin'
Pardon me my feelings are showing
I'm only saying what's on my mind

Well I found you or maybe I found myself
And I think we knew it all of the time
We fit together just like a lock and a key
And we opened up each other's minds

I was laughing 'cause there was no room to cry
There was too much growing to do
We had a good time
And it ain't over yet 'cause I know

You got me goin'
Will you pardon me my feelings are showing
I'm only saying what's on my mind

You came from nowhere and you just jumped in my life
And I know it never will be the same
You made me love you and now I'm home once again
No, I never want to leave you no more

'Cause I'm attached to the better half of myself
And there's nowhere else that I'd rather be
You filled an empty
You fixed a bad broken heart and I know

You got me goin'
Pardon me my feelings are showing
I'm only saying what's on my mind

I'm only saying what's on my mind
I'm only saying what's on my mind
I'm only saying what's on my mind
