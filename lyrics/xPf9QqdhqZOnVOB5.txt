magic happens
but only if you are open to the possibility
that what makes the earth go round
is the same excact thing that makes us believe in each other
whatever you might be feeling
at a certain point in your life
it will always carry the potential
for something great happening in the moment immediately after
the fact that we all live our lives under the same sun
can as I see it, in the end, only bring us together
this morning I woke up to the sound of confusion
but last night I was carried, carried, carried away in dreams
most of the time I let the seasons change
and listen only, only, only to the songs that are sung by the city
I'm gonna change, everything will change - all for the better
the travelling sounds - from a million years will bring us together
I'm gonna change, everything will change - all for the better
the travelling sounds - from a million years will bring us together
