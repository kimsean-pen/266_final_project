We can fight our desires
But when we start making fires
We get ever so hot
Whether we like it or not.

They say we can love who we trust
But what is love without lust
Two hearts with accurate devotions
What are feelings without emotions.

I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
I'm hoping you'll understand
Now let go of my hand.

I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
I'm hoping you'll understand
Now let go of my hand.

I hang my hopes out on the line
Will they be ready for you in time
If you leave them out too long
Will they be withered by the sun
Full stops and exclamation marks
My words stumble before I start.

How far can you bend emotion?
Can this bridge cross the ocean?

I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
I'm hoping you'll understand
Now let go of my hand.

Don't let go of my hand.
Now let go of my hand.

Don't let go of my hand.
Now let go of my hand.

Don't let go of my hand.
