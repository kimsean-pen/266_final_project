I don't ever wanna be like them
My life shouldn't be so important
Crying over spilled milk every day
Live fast, die young, no work time for play

And the stars shine bright on the boulevard

Oh, look she's so lucky
Smoking in hotels like nothing
Crying by pools when it's sunny
Oh, how she's so lucky
If I wanna whine I'll whine
(If I wanna whine I'll whine)
If I wanna whine I'll whine
(If I wanna whine I'll whine)

Different colors always grab my mind
When it takes me into overdrive
Pervert central, smelling up my land
Firecracker looking, singing man

And the stars shine bright on the boulevard
Oh, look she's so lucky
Smoking in hotels like nothing
Crying by pools when it's sunny
Oh, how she's so lucky
If I wanna whine I'll whine
(If I wanna whine I'll whine)
If I wanna whine I'll whine
(If I wanna whine I'll whine)

Cut my head on a flower crown
Think I'm going to bed
Wish me well to a wishing well
I think I'm gonna be dead
Cut my head on a flower crown
Think I'm going to bed
Wish me well to a wishing well
I think I'm gonna be dead

Oh, look she's so lucky
Smoking in hotels like nothing
Crying by pools when it's sunny
Oh, how she's so lucky
If I wanna whine I'll whine
(If I wanna whine I'll whine)
If I wanna whine I'll whine
(If I wanna whine I'll whine)

And the stars shine bright on the boulevard
