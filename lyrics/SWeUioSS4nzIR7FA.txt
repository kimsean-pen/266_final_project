It comes on slow but
It leaves much faster
We need something to hold us
During and after

Is it all alright?
Is it all alright?
Is it all alright now?
Is it all alright?

After the beauty
After the sunrise
After the come down
After the big fight
I am asking

Is it all alright? (Even if it isn't)
Is it all alright? (Even if it isn't)
Is it all alright now? (Even if it isn't)
Is it all alright? (Even if it isn't)

It is like a dream, what happened last night
In the morning I am waiting in the long, long line
I felt so connected, I felt so high
I am going to be lonely for a long, long time

And it's all alright (Even if it isn't)
And it's all alright (Even if it isn't)
And it's all alright now (Even if it isn't)
And it's all alright (Even if it isn't)
