I ran to the window
As fast as could be
I thought you were somebody else
I thought you were me

I thought I had lost everythin'
I found you instead
I feel fast asleep in your arms
I woke up in bed

I was waitin' for you
I was sat in the sun
I could picture your face
On the tip of my tongue

Woke up laughing

And I broke into a sweat
And I broke into a run
You were hot in my heels
So I hired a gun

Woke up laughing
Woke up laughing

And you make yourself a fortune out in Hong Kong
You sit at home and wonder whether you were wrong
You take a small vacation just to keep sane
You find on your return, your home is blown away

You meditate, you make haste
You run a risk, you come late
You pay a bill, you lose face
You're not fully unaware

Your star or your fate
If you fall do you break?
You go to war, you make love
You sign out in a box

Woke up laughin'
Woke up laughin'

I ran to the window
As fast as could be
I thought you were somebody else
I thought you were me

I thought I had lost everythin'
And found you instead
I feel fast asleep in your arms
I woke up in bed

You meditate, you make haste
You run a risk, you come late
You pay a bill, you lose face
You're not fully unaware

Your star or your fate
If you fall do you break?
You go to war, you make love
You sign out in a box

You make yourself a fortune out in Hong Kong
You sit at home and wonder whether you were wrong
You take a small vacation just to keep sane
You find on your return, your home is blown away

Woke up laughin'
Woke up laughin'

I was flat on my back
I was takin' a plunge
I was makin' a stand
But my plan was undone

Woke up laughin'

Well I planned an escape
For the middle of June
But I dug too fast
And I fired too soon

Woke up laughin'
Woke up laughin'
Woke up laughin'
Woke up laughin'
Woke up laughin'
Woke up laughin'
