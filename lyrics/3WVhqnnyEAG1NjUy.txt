Just another day in this messed up world, I delete and rewind.
For a moment I take in all the silence that's surrounding us.
Moving on, forgetting about the lives we could be leading.
While the engines move and the lights still flash,
I'm staying deaf and blind.
All within, everything on the outside.
Like a twist of nature's destined path,
We seek forgiveness in the arms of our own consciousness.

I am the one, I am no one.

So I will live to tell of all these nights I drown in this.
Will I ever stop believing there is hope for the footsteps we're leaving.
For elusive reasons we're all born with a hole in our hearts.
For elusive reasons we're all destined to drift apart.

This is the last chance to escape, my ticket to salvation.
I can see the light shine through the door, my only way out of here.
This is the last chance to escape, my ticket to salvation.
I can see the light shine through the door.
This is the moment it has finally come and will take me away.
I move into the light, my only way out of here.

All within, everything on the outside.
Like a twist of nature's destined path,
We seek forgiveness in the arms of our own consciousness.
For elusive reasons, for elusive reasons.

So I will live to tell of all these nights I drown in this.
Will I ever stop believing there is hope for the footsteps we're leaving.
For elusive reasons we're all born with a hole in our hearts.
For elusive reasons we're all destined to drift apart.
