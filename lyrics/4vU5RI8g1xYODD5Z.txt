Stranded at the drive in
Branded a fool
What will they say
Monday at school?

Sandy, can't you see
I'm in misery?
We made a start, now we're apart
There's nothing left for me
Love has flown all alone
I sit and wonder why,
Oh, why you left me, oh Sandy
Oh Sandy, baby, someday

When high school is done
Somehow, someway
Our two worlds will be one
In Heaven forever
And ever we will be
Oh please, say you'll stay

Oh Sandy
Sandy my darlin',
you hurt me real bad
You know it's true

But baby you gotta believe me when I say
I'm helpless without you
Love has flown all alone
I sit I wonder why
Why you left me, oh Sandy?
Sandy, Sandy, why, oh Sandy?
