Once upon a time all humans
Lived in harmony with their gods
Planet earth was full of wonders
And joy was in the air
Centuries went on in peace,
'Till evil got their men one by one...
Planet earth was bound to run out but
The tale's not over yet!

Jupiter and moons show me the way
Following my dream of babylon
Jupiter and moon show me my fate
Will the sun arise?
Jupiter and moons let me escape
From this world of pain... I'll die alone!
Jupiter and moons show me the way
Back to paradise, back to paradise

Panic on the streets, chaos, terror.
"Jupiter, oh God, have mercy on us!"
Finally their prayers were heard and
"The saviors" turned the tied!
Demigods they were: they talked
About another world "upside down"
Ready to embrace all humans! "let's go together!"

Jupiter and moons show me the way
Following my dream of babylon
Jupiter and moon show me my fate
Will the sun arise?
Jupiter and moons let me escape
From this world of pain.I'll die alone!
Jupiter and moons show me the way
Back to paradise, back to paradise

Jupiter and moons, knowledge and wisdom:
The demigods, their sons, came here to guide us
Jupiter and moons, mercy and compassion;
We'll explore another world...
It's time to leave: we can't wait anymore!

Jupiter and moons show me the way
Following my dream of babylon
Jupiter and moon show me my fate
Will the sun arise?
Jupiter and moons let me escape
From this world of pain.I'll die alone!
Jupiter and moons show me the way
Back to paradise, back to paradise!
