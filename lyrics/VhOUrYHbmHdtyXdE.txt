Sky runs out
Innocence runs out

Beggar, the city rejects you
Its half a matter of income, and half a matter of not fitting in
Always the one who gets shot down
Tapping out in the second round when you could have made it by now
But you're always out there fucking around

All in the game
Five hundred to play
Push it from your brain and don't feel bad about it
Caught in the fade
Slide under the weight, the depth, the overwhelming hold

You're barely there
Fog on the mirror
You're barely there
Thumb back the hammer
Defined by your lies, remain still
Stuck between giving up and committing one final crime
Your mother must be proud

Paradise, one way street
If only you were the fool you pretend to be

All in the game, five hundred to play
Stick it in your vein and don't think twice about it
Caught in the fade
Hand over the claim, the debt
The door has closed
You are alone
All in the game, climb under and stay
The only way you leave is if you turn out the light
No one to blame
There's no need to make amends
There's no one left
It's over
