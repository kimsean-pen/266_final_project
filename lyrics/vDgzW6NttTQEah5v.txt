Slow down and lay low
Against the rhythm of the time
I can't change I feel small
With the rhythm and the rules
And I'll say what I want to
Say what i want to say
To them
And I'll do what I want to
Do what I want to do
Today

There must be someone telling a lie

Live low
Or sell out
To the dollar and the dime
It's their tune and their game
They will own you if you play
I don't breath for your money Breath for you
I won't bleed for your money Bleed for you

There must be someone telling a lie to me
