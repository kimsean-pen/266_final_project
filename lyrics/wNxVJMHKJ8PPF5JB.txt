So you say you like the heat
Can't slow down to kick up your feet
Comes a time for letting go
Everything that you don't know

Cool your jets, just take some time
Cool your jets, relax and unwind
Cool your jets, and you'll be fine
Cool your jets, cool your jets

Battles won and battles lost
War has come and war has passed
Worked so hard to get ahead
Lighten up be here instead and...

Cool your jets, just take some time
Cool your jets, relax and unwind
Cool your jets, and you will be fine
Cool your jets, cool your jets

Cool your jets, take some time
Cool your jets, you'll be fine
You worked so hard you forget to pause
And take a moment to enjoy it all
What's the point of pushing ahead?
Wait to sleep when you are dead?
The time is now to take a break
Kick back and take some time to...

Cool your jets, just take some time
Cool your jets, relax and unwind
Cool your jets, leave your troubles behind
Cool your jets, cool your jets

Cool your jets, just take some time
Cool your jets, relax and unwind
Cool your jets, and you will be fine
Cool your jets, cool your jets
