there's no reason
there's no compromise
change in seasons
living the high life

I don't know you
so don't freak on me
I can't control you
you're not my destiny

straight out of line
i can't find a reason
why i should justify my ways
straight out of line

i dont need a reason
you don't need to lie to me
i'll confess this you're my tradgety
i paid you to rest this

as fast as you turned on me

gone for ever
vanished the memories
this face of pleasure
are masked by your misery
straight out of line

I can't find a reason
why i should justify my ways
straight out of line
I don't need a reason
you don't need to lie to me
lie to me
straight out of line
I can't find a reason
why I should justify my ways
straight out of line
I don't need a reason
you don't need to lie to me
lie to me
