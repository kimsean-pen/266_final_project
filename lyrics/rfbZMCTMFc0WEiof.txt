Oh, for all we know
Oh, the world is trying to show us where we first went wrong
And it's a crime if we don't
Be with the one we've needed all along

Round and round
Had ups and downs
No, but I can't be without
My love that I have found
Oh, when it fits
It should stay like this
I can't be without
My love that I have found

Oh, for all that we know
The heart is pumping rhythms that are not our own
Oh, for all (Ahhhhhh)
Oh, you spin me round

Round and round
Had ups and downs
No, but I can't be without
My love that I have found
Oh, when it fits
It should stay like this
I can't be without
My love that I have found

Round and round
Had ups and downs
No, but I can't be without
My love that I have found
Oh, when it fits
It should stay like this
I can't be without
My love that I have found

I can't be, I can't be without my love that I have found
