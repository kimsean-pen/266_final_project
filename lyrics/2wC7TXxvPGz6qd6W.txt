Sadie I love it

Death Valley '69

You're right
You're right
You're right
You're right
You're right [You were right]
I was on the wrong track
We're deep in the valley
How deep in the gulley
And now in the canyon
Way out in the yonder
She started to holler
She started to holler
I didn't wanna
I didn't wanna
I didn't wanna
I didn't wanna
But she started to holler
So I had to hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Deep in the valley
In the trunk of an old car
In the back of a Chevy
I got sand in my mouth [You got sand in yr mouth]
And you got sun in yr eyes [I got sun in my eyes]
Blinded
And you wanted to get there
But I couldn't go faster [I wanted to get there]
And it couldn't go faster [But you couldn't go faster]
So I started to hit it [You couldn't go faster]
So I started to hit it
And I started to hit it [Hit it]
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
