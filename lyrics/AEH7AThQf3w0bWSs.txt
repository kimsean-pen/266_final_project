A thousand men in uniform
Kicked down the doors of my concern
And stormed the kingdom
To take it's worth
Leaving every stone unturned

Fate can pick you up
You know that it can put you down
It can pick you up
And spin your head
Around and round
If you hold us back
You know that we can shout
We brought you into this place
You know we can take you out

You've been in school for 10 years now
80 grand indebted down
Every day's a missile test
Your dancing shoes and torn up dress

2017 we know
Reality's one big sick show
Every day's a crisis fest
Your dancing shoes and torn up dress

Fate can pick you up
You know that it can put you down
It can pick you up
And spin your head
Around and round
If you hold us back
You know that we can shout
We brought you into this place
You know we can take you out

There's a coup in our country
It's happening now
A coup in our city
It's happening downtown
Every tragedy has its sad clown
Every victory has its dark cloud

If you hold us back
You know that we can shout
We brought you into this place
You know we can take you out
If you hold us back
You know that we can shout
We brought you into this place
You know we can take you out
