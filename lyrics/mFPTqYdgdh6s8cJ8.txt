Open up the gates of Zion
Africa we want to go
Africa we want to go

Repatriation is at hand
I and I know where the black man stands
I and I know where the black man stands

To the west coast of Africa
East, north and south
Repatriation is a must
Repatriation is a must

To the west keep not back!
Send my sons from afar
And my daughters from the end of the world
Send my sons from afar
And my daughters from the end of the world

Hallelujah
Please send the father
The Almighty one of creation
Living inna man
The Almighty Redeemer
The word, sound and iwa
Living inna man yeah

Ooh allelujah!
Listen the father
Almighty Bongo Ashanti I and I
Living inna I and I
Mighty, Mighty Redeemer of creation

To the west coast of Africa
East, north and south
Repatriation is a must
Repatriation is a must

To the west keep not back!
Send my sons from afar
And my daughters from the end of the world
Send my sons from afar
And my daughters from the end of the world
