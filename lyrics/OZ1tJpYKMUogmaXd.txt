Tyranny, bigotry
Crimes against humanity
Murder, persecution
Inprisonment, subordination

Enough of genocides
Enough of bloodshed
Break this perpetration
Of history's dark past

Never forget
Never repeat
Never forget
Never repeat

For the ones
Taken by hate
For the dead
Who couldn't be free

Never forget
Never repeat
Never forget
Never repeat

No more segregation
No more civil wars
No more slavery
No more holocaust

Enough of genocides
Enough of bloodshed
Break this perpetration
Of history's dark past

Never forget
Never repeat
Never forget
Never repeat
