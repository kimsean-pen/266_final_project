My homie since knee high
We came up on the south side
Where you had to beat the street lights home
We got into some street fights
But the next day we be right back get it all
Wherever there was me, there was you
And we were like crew
Straight from junior high school

Then you messed it all up
Started pushin' up
Kissed me on the cheek
And I fell in love

Shorty's a little taller now
Into big things, he's a baller now
His heart never changed, I can see he's still down
I can't forget him, no no no no
More than his voice is changing now
All that I see is rearranging now
It just ain't the same catchin' feelings now
I should tell him, yeah

You knew you were the boy next door
Don't wanna be my homeboy no more
Saw something that I never saw before
I think he wants to be my baby
Been thinkin' 'bout him all my life
Now I see him in a whole new light
Something about it feels so right
I think he wants to be my baby, baby

Every night when we get home
Undercover talking on the phone
Here comes my mother
It's way too late
Might get in trouble
My heart can't wait
So much to take
Writing till my hand cramps up

Four pages saying, "I'm in love"
I got a crush, can't get you off my mind
Can you pick me up baby?
I'm sure I'll be fine when I look into your eyes

Shorty's a little taller now
Into big things, he's a baller now
His heart never changed, I can see he's still down
I can't forget him, no no no no
More than his voice is changing now
All that I see is rearranging now
It just ain't the same catchin' feelings now
I should tell him, gotta tell him that I love him

You knew you were the boy next door
Don't wanna be my homeboy no more
Saw something that I never saw before
I think he wants to be my baby
Been thinkin' 'bout him all my life
Now I see him in a whole new light
Something about it feels so right
I think he wants to be my baby, baby

Chocolate covered candy kisses
They keep me reminiscing
All I want is what you're giving
Nothing like your affection
So in love and you're the reason
There's no more lonely season
Make me love you, drive me crazy
Think I wanna be your lady

Chocolate covered candy kisses
They keep me reminiscing
All I want is what you're giving
Nothing like your affection
So in love and you're the reason
There's no more lonely season
Make me love you, drive me crazy
Think I wanna be your baby

Oh we oh, oh oh oh
(Don't wanna be my homeboy no more)
Oh we oh we oh we oh, oh oh oh
Oh we oh we oh we oh, oh oh oh
Oh we oh we oh we oh, oh oh oh
(Why why why why why)
(Now homeboy wants to be my baby, be my baby, be my baby)
Oh we oh, oh oh oh
(He don't wanna be my homeboy no more)
Oh we oh we oh we oh, oh oh oh
Oh we oh we oh we oh, oh oh oh
(No more)
Oh we oh we oh we oh
(Said he)
(Now homeboy wants to be my baby, be my baby, be my baby)
(Wants to be my baby now, now, now, now, now)
