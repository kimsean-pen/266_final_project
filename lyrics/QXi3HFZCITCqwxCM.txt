I don't have to tell you
What this is all about
'Cause, baby, half the fun is
In us figuring it all out

(Ee-ah-ee-ah, ayy)
(Ee-ah-ee-ah, ayy, come on)

So why you gotta ask me what I'm doing now?
'Cause I don't like to question
What I still haven't found (ooh, yeah)

So don't turn off the lights
I don't wanna be in the dark tonight
'Cause I can't read your mind
I need to know if what I'm doing is right

So don't turn off the lights (ee-ah-ee-ah, ayy)
So don't turn off the lights (ee-ah-ee-ah, ayy, come on)

So tell me how we're gonna get there
It's so hard to even try
But if we move together, oh, yeah, yeah
We'll end up on the same side (ooh, yeah, yeah)

So don't turn off the lights
I don't wanna be in the dark tonight
'Cause I can't read your mind
I need to know if what I'm doing is right

So don't turn off the lights (ee-ah-ee-ah, ayy)
So don't turn off the lights (ee-ah-ee-ah, ayy, come on)

If you could know what I'm feeling
Would you run? And where would you go?
If you want to know what I'm thinking
Then just turn on the lights and you'll know

(So don't) So don't turn off the lights
(You don't turn off the lights)
I don't wanna be in the dark tonight (ee-ah-ee-ah, ayy)

'Cause I can't read your mind
(You don't turn off the lights)
I need to know if what I'm doing is right (ee-ah-ee-ah, ayy)

So don't turn off the lights
So don't turn off the lights
(Don't turn off the lights)
I don't wanna be in the dark tonight (ee-ah-ee-ah, ayy)

'Cause I can't read your mind
(Don't turn off the lights)
I need to know if what I'm doing is right (ee-ah-ee-ah, ayy)

So don't turn off the lights
So don't turn off the lights
Don't turn off the lights
Don't turn off the light

Don't turn off the lights
Don't turn off the lights
