X marks the page, you'll see, trapped in a cold white room
I want to know who'll be there when you snuff the wick
I won't reflect the same as you, I want the proof
You'll promise to let them down quick
(Pre-)
I neva wanna see clear

Pull out yo teeth (until) there's nothin' left (at all)
'mmediately, I feel relief from draggin' this vessel around

Exit the stage, you keep sleepin' in a cold white room
I want to know who'll be there when you snuff the wick
Just shut yo mouth!
(Bridge)
& if it takes foreva to be sure
I want to know I'll wait it out (if it works)
I've seen yo letter with a fingerprint, I want to know, I want to know

I'm playin' dead (until) there's nothin' left (at all)
'mmediately, I feel relief from draggin' this vessel around
