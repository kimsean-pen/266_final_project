Let's play a game of Russian Roulette
I'll load the gun, you place the bets
Tell me who will make it out alive
Let's play a game of Russian Roulette
I'll load the gun, you place the bets
Tell me who will make it out alive

Over and over and over again
We play the same old games
Cards kept close to our chest
That way the secret's kept
So wear your poker face
Here's to the fool, here's to the thief
Fiction is bitter and you got a taste

My alligator blood is starting to show
I know that you know that, I know that you know
Can't call a bluff with a dead man's hand
My alligator blood is starting to show
I know that you know that, I know that you know
Can't call a bluff with a dead man's hand

Cut me up and wear my skin
Show me how to live
Tear me down, clean me up
Now spill my fucking guts
Just help me find a way
Just help me find a way
Just help me find a way
Just help me find a way

My alligator blood is starting to show
I know that you know that I know that you know
Can't call a bluff with a dead man's hand
My alligator blood is starting to show
I know that you know that, I know that you know
Can't call a bluff with a dead man's hand

Put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my brains
Put a gun to my head and paint the walls
Put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my brains
Put a gun to my head and paint the walls

Now you know, now you know, now you know
Now you know you can go, you can give up trying
Should've just called it quits, should've just called it quits
Leave before it's too late
Now you know you can go, you can give up trying
Should've just called it quits, should've just called it quits
Leave before it's too late

Let's play a game of Russian Roulette
I'll load the gun, you place the bets
Tell me who will make it out alive
Let's play a game of Russian Roulette
I'll load the gun, you place the bets
Tell me who will make it out alive

Yeah, yeah
So put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my fucking brain, oh
Put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my brains
Put a gun to my head and paint the fucking walls
