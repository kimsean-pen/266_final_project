When lifting the mask from a local clown
feeling down like him.
Seeing the light in a station bar and travelling far in sin.
Sailing downstairs to the Northern line
watching the shine of the shoes.
Hearing the trials of the people there
who's to care if they lose.

Take a look you might see me on the ground,
for I am the parasite of this town.

Dancing a jig in a church with chimes
a sign of the times today.
Hearing no bell from a steeple tall
people all in dismay.
Falling so far on a silver spoon
making the moon for fun.
Changing a robe for a size to small
people all get hung.

Take a look you might see me coming through,
for I am the parasite who travels two by two.

Lifting the mask from a local clown
feeling down again.
Seeing the light in a station bar
and travelling far in sin.
Sailing downstairs to the Northern line
watching the shine of the shoes.
Hearing the trials of the people there
who's to care if they lose.

Take a look you might see me on the ground,
for I am the parasite of this town.
Take a look you might see me in the dirt,
for I am the parasite who hangs from your skirt.
