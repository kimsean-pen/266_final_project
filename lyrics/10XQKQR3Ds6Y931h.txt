This is the second night straight that I've stayed inside.
I should be getting ready but I'm watching Always Sunny.
Declined your invite, isn't the first time, and I'm asking myself.
Subtract or add up?
Fall back or catch up?
This is the seventh night straight that I've stayed inside.
I should be getting ready but I'm watching Mr.
Meaty.
Ignored your invite, but it's the last time that I'm asking myself.
Shedding my layers cause I finally need to leave.
This three month curse plagues everything that I used to be.
