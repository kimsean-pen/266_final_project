Come on, let's do this the right way
'Cause it's over, it's over
And things will never be the same
I tried so hard for years working out my flaws
And now it's over, it's over
I'll think of you when the curtain calls
And now your friends are enemies

You just run, run, run
You just run this to the ground
I'll send this out to you
In hopes that you may drown
You just run, run, run
You've broken what you love
I'll drag this out to you
I'm the rehab, you're the drugs

You've got nothing to say
'Cause it's over, it's over
And things will never be the same
I know that the failure will be a knife
'Cause it's over, it's over
I won't hesitate to twist it right
And now your friends are enemies

You just run, run, run
You just run this to the ground
I'll send this out to you
In hopes that you may drown
You just run, run, run
You've broken what you love

I'll drag this out to you
I'm the rehab, you're the drugs

Drown, drown, I'm filling up your lungs
Drown, drown, I'm the rehab, you're the drugs
I'm the rehab, you're the drugs

Wait, wait, I'll wait for you to fall
You're time is running out
Wait, wait, I'll wait for you to stall
For now you scream and shout
And now your friends are enemies
You just run, run, run
You just run this to the ground

I'll send this out to you
In hopes that you may drown
You just run, run, run
You've broken what you love
I'll drag this out to you
I'm the rehab, you're the drugs
Drown, drown, I'm filling up your lungs
Drown, drown, I'm the rehab, you're the drugs
I'm the rehab, you're the drugs
