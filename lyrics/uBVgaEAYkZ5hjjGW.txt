Everyone has their own battles to fight
Even the darkest places can't hide the light
Life goes on when part of you dies
We're all alone and wondering, wondering why

We're all alone and wondering, wondering who'll save us
We're all alone and wondering, wondering who'll save us

We're all singing the same song
I need a good word
We're all singing the same song
Someone to come along the way, we're too busy running wild

You stopped to help
Yeah
You took me in
Now listen to my voice

I wanna sit and hear you out
I wanna understand your pain
I want your pain
Everyone has their own battles to fight
To win, invite each other in, invite each other in
We'll hear you out
Invite each other in, invite each other in
Come join us now

We're all singing the same song
I need a good word
We're all singing the same song
Someone to come along

Everyone has their own battles to fight
Even the darkest places can't hide the light
Life goes on when part of you dies
We're not alone and wondering, seek and you will find

We're not alone and wondering, wondering who'll save us
We're not alone and wondering, wondering who'll save us
Save us
Save us
