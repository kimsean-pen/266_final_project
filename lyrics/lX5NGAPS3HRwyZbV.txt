Just cause it's slow doesn't mean it's sad
Just cause it's wrong doesn't mean it isn't right
Just cause it hurts don't mean it's bad, no
Just come over, come over tonight

Just cause we're fighting
Just cause you're crying
Just cause the stars in the sky, they aren't shining
Just cause I told you that it was over
that doesn't mean I don't need you by my side
No it doesn't mean goodbye
No it doesn't mean goodbye

Just cause I watched you drive away
Doesn't mean I'm not still waiting by the door
Just cause you never hit the brakes
It don't mean you don't love me, don't love me anymore

Just cause we're fighting
Just cause you're crying
Just cause the stars in the sky, they aren't shining
Just cause I told you that it was over
That doesn't mean I don't need you by my side
No it doesn't mean goodbye
No it doesn't mean goodbye

I hope you know that I'm not letting go
I will leave the light on

Just cause we're fighting
Just cause you're crying
Just cause the stars in the sky, they aren't shining
Just cause I told you that it was over
That doesn't mean I don't need you by my side
No it doesn't mean goodbye
No it doesn't mean goodbye
It doesn't mean goodbye
