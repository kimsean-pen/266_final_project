(Bowie, Lennon, Alomar)

Fame, makes a man take things over
Fame, lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame, puts you there, where things are hollow
Fame.

Fame, hurts your brain, just a flame
A funny tin to dip you inside
Fame.

Fame, what you like is in the Limo
Fame, what you get is no tomorrow
Fame, what you need you have to borrow
Fame.

Fame, the dirty swine, it's just his line
He's only trying to drive you to crime. (crime)
Fame.

Is it any wonder
I'll reject you first
Is it any wonder
You're too cool to prove

Fame
A ticket for you, a ticket for me
I've gotta get to Witchitta
Fame.

Fame (Rpt x23)
What's your name?
What a game.
What a shame. What a shame.
