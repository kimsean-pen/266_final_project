Lord don't let me go down, will my soul be turned?
Don't wanna me leave the ground till I'm done reaping
Lord you let me down, but I will still reach in
Don't wanna spit me out, I might as well be eaten

Little thing gone wild
Little thing gone wild
Little thing gone wild
Little thing's gone wild

Lord don't hold me down while I'm still creeping
I wanna shake the ground 'til I am done reaping
Lord do you hear me loud? Unto my soul speaketh
Oh won't you let me out
You got the wrong creature

Little thing gone wild
Little thing gone wild
Little thing gone wild
Little thing's gone wild

Won't you let me love
Won't you let me love
I wanna feel your love
I wanna teach you love
Won't you let me love
Won't you let me love
I wanna flee your love
I want your creature love

Won't you let me love
Won't you let me love
I wanna hit your love
I'll be your easter love
Won't you let me love
Won't you let me love
I wanna kill your love
I want your creature love

Little thing gone wild
Little thing gone wild
Little thing gone wild
Little thing gone wild
Little thing's gone wild
Little thing gone wild

I wanna feel your love
I wanna teach you love

I wanna feel your love
I wanna teach you love

Won't you let me love
Won't you let me love
I wanna feel your love
I want your creature love
