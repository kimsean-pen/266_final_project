If your girlfriend knew
'Bout me and you
'Bout what we do (what we do)
Tell me what would she do?
Yeah if you told the truth
And said the word
Someone like her
Just isn't right for you

I'm a little secret nobody's supposed to know
You want to keep this on the hush, keep this on the low
I'm the reason she's wondering why you're never home
Why you're never home (never, never)

But imagine if she knew you were -ing me
And acting irresponsibly
While she's home learning recipes
You've been in my bed constantly
Neither you or your story's straight
It's such a shame
For a second put yourself in my place

If your girlfriend knew
'Bout me and you
'Bout what we do (what we do)
Tell me what would she do?
Yeah if you told the truth
And said the word
Someone like her
Just isn't right for you

Cause you're g-g-g-controversial-g
Wish you would come out
Only see you when it's dark out
Every time "Hey can I come now"
It's too late
I've never been to your house
That's why you always come round
Just saying "I'm scared she'll find out"

'Cause if she knew that you wear my jeans
Say my name when you fall asleep
It's your fifth anniversary
You've been at my eye constantly
Neither you or your story's straight
It's such a shame
For a second put yourself in my place

If your girlfriend knew
'Bout me and you
'Bout what we do (what we do)
Tell me what would she do?
Yeah if you told the truth
And said the word
Someone like her
Just isn't right for you

If your [*bleep*] knew
'Bout me and you
'Bout what we do
Tell me what would she do? (tell me, what would she do baby?)
Yeah if you told the truth
And said the word
Someone like her
Just isn't right for you

What would she do
If your girlfriend knew?
If your girlfriend knew?

What would she do
If your girlfriend knew?
If your girlfriend knew?

Cause we're more than friends with benefits
Getting but wild an intimate
Yeah if I'm being honest
If you were honest
This could be more than innocent
'Cause I got what you need and what you want
But I still masquerading your front, it's all kinda fake
It's all about house, she took my wife and gets played

Now I'm not saying I didn't play a part
But I've been chill
I've been real from the jump from the start
You say you will tell her
But it's gonna break her heart
You should have thought about that before you entered your part
Swearing up and down you love her to the moon and the stars
How can you be saying all that when she don't know who you are
Neither you or your story's straight
It's such a shame
For a second put yourself in my place

If your girlfriend knew
'Bout me and you
'Bout what we do (What we do)
Tell me what would she do?
Yeah if you told the truth
And said the word
Someone like her
Just isn't right for you

If your girlfriend knew
'Bout me and you
