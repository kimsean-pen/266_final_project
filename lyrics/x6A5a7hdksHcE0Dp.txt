I drove into a children's book and now I'm stuck
How could this happen to me, I guess it's just dumb luck
I sink into a lucid dream and it came to me
The islands bulged into cold blue night in a place that I couldn't be
Some dumb luck

I'm going to an empty nest on reality TV
A town that's leading its simple lives, it's a shame that they can't see
Some dumb luck
