I -
May be dead honey
But I was left with my eyes
And underneath sugar
Well I've been sunk by your lies
And my heart baby
Is cold and blue
We're two of a kind lately
Both me and you
It's our time sweet baby
To break on through

It's the year to hated
So glad that we made it
Cuz all the kids in the street
Whisper sounds that sweep
The stars under their feet
Well it's the year to be hated

One, two, ready go
It's our time X7
To be hated
Alright
To be hated
Uh huh

Come on kids
Its our time X7
To be hated
Alright
Well it's the year to be hated
So glad that we made it
Cuz all the kids in the street
Whisper sounds that sweep
The stars under their feet
Well it's the year to be hated
Alright yeah
It's the year to be hated
Uh huh
It's the year to be hated
Alright
Well it's the year to be hated
