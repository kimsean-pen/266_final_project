When things are not what they were meant to be
It's been a long time
Maybe the wrong line
I wish that I could just stay incomplete
We live a strange life
We are in vain

The hours run together while I'm falling apart
What's the only thing stopping me from calling you up?
The hours run together while I'm falling apart
What's the only thing stopping me from calling you up?
I don't know
Caught in the wrong place
Leaving with no trace

Bottle it up and learn to live again
Am I taking it slow or just fast enough?
Not looking back when there's a reason to move on
Some things you can't erase
We all need space

The hours run together while I'm falling apart
What's the only thing stopping me from calling you up?
The hours run together while I'm falling apart
What's the only thing stopping me from calling you up?
I don't know
Caught in the wrong place
Leaving with no trace

Collide with the water
Fear of drowning deeper
Blurry vision
See your outline leaving

Caught in the wrong place
Leaving with no trace
