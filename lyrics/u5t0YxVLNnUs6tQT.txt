The sound of A is in the air
The sound of A is everywhere
With the sound of a gun
And you run
Yeah, yeah, yeah

The sound of A is all around
The sound of A is underground
It will creep into your bone
When you're alone
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Meaningless noise is everybody's toys
Meaningless noise is everybody's toys
Meaningless noise is everybody's toys

The sound of A will keep you down
With that cruel, peculiar sound
It will shoot into your brain
And remain
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Meaningless noise is everybody's toys
Meaningless noise is everybody's toys
Meaningless noise is everybody's toys

The sound of A
The sound of A
The sound of A
