All fired up

Hand on my heart, I'm down on my knees
I'm asking you nicely
I'll take the blame, I'll take a bullet
Would you take one for me?
Bonnie and Clyde, ride 'til we die
Do it so carelessly
But open my mind, you start the fire
Watch it burn out and leave

If you know what It's like to be reckless
You and I, we could fight
Us against the world
'Round my waist, on your neck
Like I'm legless
In the past, loveless
I've changed

All fired up and frustrated
Lost our minds and our patience
Stay with me, I've done some changing
I'm waiting, I'm made for you baby
You can count on me

Washed all my sins
You perfectly fit the sins in my darkest dreams
All from my past is moving too fast
Love me eternally
Gun to my head, I'm already dead
If you think I would speak
My life at stake, no mythical break
For me and my baby

'Cause we know what It's like to be reckless
You and I, we still fight
Us against the world

'Round my waist, on your neck
Like I'm legless
In the past, lovele-e-ess

All fired up and frustrated
Lost our minds and our patience
Stay with me, I've done some changing
I'm waiting, I'm made for you baby
You still can-

All fired up and frustrated
Lost our minds and our patience
Stay with me, I've done some changing
I'm waiting, I'm made for you baby
You can count on me

I'm a slave to your game
I like it this way
A figure in darkness is calling my name
But I'm not the same, so baby I change
I like it this way

All fired up and frustrated
Lost our minds and our patience
Stay with me, I've done some changing
I'm waiting, I'm made for you baby

All fired up and frustrated
Lost our minds and our patience
Stay with me, I've done some changing
I'm waiting, I'm made for you baby
You can count on me
You can count on me
You can count on me
