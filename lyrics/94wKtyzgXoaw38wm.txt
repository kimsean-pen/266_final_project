I'm freakin out, I can see roses inside of your house
they weren't from me, probably her boyfriend or family or something

I'm freaking out, I'm freaking out
outside of your house

I feel so old when I get sober

I'm smoking for two, I can see roses inside of you too
and if he comes out he'll meet the unfriendly end of a shotgun

I'm freaking out, I'm freaking out
outside of your house
I feel so old when I get sober
when I get sober
