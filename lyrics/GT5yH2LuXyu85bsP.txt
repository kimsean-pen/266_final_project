The boys are back
The boys are back
The boys are back
And they're looking for trouble
The boys are back
The boys are back
The boys are back
And they're looking for trouble
The boys are back
The boys are back
The boys are back
And they're looking for trouble
The boys are back
The boys are back
The boys are back
And they're looking for trouble

Speeding down the highway on 93
I'm missing my home and it's killing me
Down the ramp past the jail I'm feeling alright
Buy roses for my ladies from a bum at the light
It's time to get ready for that song and dance
Let's go my friend, it's time to take a chance
We're back in town, we're gonna get it done
You've got nowhere to hide, you've got nowhere to run

It's been a long time comin'
It's been a long time comin'

The boys are back
The boys are back
The boys are back
And they're looking for trouble
The boys are back
The boys are back
The boys are back
And they're looking for trouble

If that old familiar city could talk and hear
You'd be just another nobody, you'd disappear
Your days are numbered, we're back around
We're coming for you and you're going down

It's been a long time comin'
It's been a long time comin'

The boys are back
The boys are back
The boys are back
And they're looking for trouble
The boys are back
The boys are back
The boys are back
And they're looking for trouble

And we're comin' for you
And we're comin' for you

The boys are back
The boys are back
The boys are back
And they're looking for trouble
The boys are back
The boys are back
The boys are back
And they're looking for trouble
The boys are back
The boys are back
The boys are back
And they're looking for trouble
The boys are back
The boys are back
The boys are back
And they're looking for trouble
...from you!
