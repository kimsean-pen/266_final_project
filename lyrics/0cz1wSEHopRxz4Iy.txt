Much greater than science fiction
Is this thang about my new affliction
Waves of pain are sweeping through me
yet tell me who would ever believe me
Rather than believe it's all your leavin'
That caused me to suffer all this grievin'
I blame it on something that can't be explained
I said that I've got a new kind of pain
I've got headache in my heart
heartache in my head

Each and every single day
Money is spent in some sort of way
Forget all the doctors being absolutely certain
For months for me they can't find what's hurting
When the pills that the pain brings on
It's got nothin' to do with the fact that you're gone
You ain't the reason why I don't sleep at night
It's only because I'm trying to fight this
Headache in my heart
then I got a heartache in my head
