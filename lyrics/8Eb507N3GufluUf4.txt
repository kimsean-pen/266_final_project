Rain drops trees rise
Valley sink and seas defied
It's only a matter of time

Temperatures rise
Mountains speak
Skies fall flat tired
It's only a matter of time

With the rays
Cutting air
I give way
Call us trade

Rain drops fill my eyes
In the sea I lose my mind
I'm only a matter of time

When we collide
Mountains speak
Skies fall flat tired
We're only a matter of time

With rays
Cutting air
I give way
Call us trade

With rays
Cutting air
I give way
Call us trade

Rain drops trees rise
Valley sink and seas defied
It's only a matter of time

Rain drops fill my eyes
In the sea I lose my mind
I'm only a matter of time
