The nerves are sending
shimmering signals
all through my fingers
the veins support
blood that gushes
pulsively towards

The triumph of a heart - that gives all: that gives all
The triumph of a heart - that gives all: that gives all

The stubborn trunks
of these legs of mine
serve as pathways
for my favourite fuel
heading upwards towards
my kidneys

The triumph of a heart - that gives all: that gives all
The triumph of a heart - that gives all: that gives all

Smooth
soft, red
velvety lungs
are pushing a network
of oxygen joyfully
through a nose
through a mouth
but all enjoys
all enjoys

The triumph of a heart - that gives all: that gives all
The triumph of a heart - that gives all: that gives all
The triumph of a heart - that gives all: that gives all
The triumph of a heart - that gives all: that gives all
