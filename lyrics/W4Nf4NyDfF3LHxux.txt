Sitting here watching you go
For all I know, this could be it
It's been a while since you have kissed me like you mean it

Been working out, you smell so good
It's not for me
I don't mean to push you but you say that you don't feel it

Love me or leave me
Oh, quit me or keep me
Whatever it is you're feeling I just need to know

Love me or leave me
Grip me or free me
I know that you're out of love so say it isn't so
Or please just let me go
Or please just let me go

Minutes turn hours and I keep waiting
Starting at the door
I don't wanna lose you but I can't hold on forever

All these love affairs where no one cares enough for me
So give me your everything or give me nothing ever

Love me or leave me
Oh, quit me or keep me
Whatever it is you're feeling I just need to know

Love me or leave me
Oh, grip me or free me
I know that you're out of love so say it isn't so
Or please just let me go

It kills me every time
You can't say it back
I pretend I'm fine
But I'm about to crack

Bleeding dry your faith
I just miss you so
Pull me closer now
Or please just let me go

Love me or leave me
Oh, quit me or keep me
Whatever it is you're feeling I just need to know

Love me or leave me
Grip me or free me
I know that you're out of love so say it isn't so
Or please just let me go
Or please just let me go
Or please just let me go
