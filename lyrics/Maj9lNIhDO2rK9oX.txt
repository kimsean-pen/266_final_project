You wanted to feel what it's like in these chains
Could it be worse than the ones in your brain
TV has nothing on what can be fixed
I make a fist, it hurts my wrist
Don't be afraid you've got nothing to hide
Even when something is hiding inside
Something about it is driving me sane
Something about it is driving me--
Something about it is driving me--
Don't be afraid you've got nothing to hide
Even when something is hiding inside
Something about it is driving me sane
Something about it is driving me--
Something about it is driving me--
Don't be afraid you've got nothing to hide
Even when something is hiding inside
Something about it is driving me sane
Something about it is driving me--
