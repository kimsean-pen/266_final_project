She is something like an angel
So innocent and free
Well protected from the danger
She's daddy's little queen
She's got a body like a model
And she ain't afraid to use it
Cause she wanna be a superstar
She'll do anything to prove it
What would your daddy say if he saw you acting like that
What would your brother say if he saw you drop it like that
What would your granny say if she saw you freak it like that
Well I'm guessing
I'm guessing
I'm guessing
She get it from her mama
I say she get it from her mama
Got her education paid for
Ain't no worries 'bout the lease
Plenty money in the savings
She's got everything she needs
When the lights go down low
Little beauty touch the beast
Steady looking for the limelight (steady looking for the limelight)
She's begging on your knees, please, please
What would your daddy say if he saw you acting like that?
What would your brother say if he saw you drop it like that?
What would your granny say if she saw your freak it like that?
Well, I'm guessing
I'm guessing
I'm guessing
She get it from her mama
I say she get it from her mama (mama, mama, mama, oh whao)
And oh, she came with the fortune but she wants the fame
And she'll do whatever it will take for you to remember her name
What would your daddy say if he saw you acting like that?
What would your brother say if he saw you drop it like that?
What would your granny say if she saw you freak it like that?
Well, I'm guessing
I'm guessing
I'm guessing
She get it from her mama (oh, that's right)
I say she get it from her mama
So shake what your mama gave you
Don't worry about the haters (no, no)
She get it from her mama
I say she get it from her mama
End
