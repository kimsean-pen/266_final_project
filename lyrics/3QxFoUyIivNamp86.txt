When the dark and day meet in the image of stars
ls where we're gonna find out who we are
When the dark and day meet in the image of stars
ls where we're gonna find out who we are
Night is an illusion at this time of day
The smudges of figures and mistakes we've made
Captures the moment just caught in time
Where dark and day meet in the image of the stars
lt's the slip of time in the perfect light
When the sun cascades into the night
lt's a moment of distraction
When we become alive
We're running, night running
Straighter than an arrow
Taken by a chance from a bow
We're running, night running
Faster than our shadows
Going where we wanna go
We run tight, our lungs grasp the air
That gives us life takes us by the hand
And says it's all right
Hidden from the glance of day
Caught lies
Hidden in the eyes of surprise
Hidden from the life of night
Caught up in people's dreams
Feet pounding to the rhythm
Feet pounding to the rhythm
lt's the slip of time in the perfect light
When the sun cascades into the night
lt's that moment of distraction
When we become alive
We're running, night running
Straighter than an arrow
Taken by a chance from a bow
We're running, night running
Faster than our shadows
Going where we wanna go
When the dark and day meet in the image of stars
ls where we're gonna find out who we are
When the dark and day meet in the image of stars
ls where we're gonna find out who we are
When the dark and day meet in the image of stars
ls where we're gonna find out who we are
When the dark and day meet in the image of stars
ls where we're gonna find out who we are
When the dark and day meet in the image of stars
ls where we're gonna find out who we are
When the dark and day meet in the image of stars
ls where we're gonna find out who we are
We're running, night running
Straighter than an arrow
Taken by a chance from a bow
We're running, night running
Faster than our shadows
Going where we wanna go
We wanna go, we wanna go
We wanna go, we wanna go
We wanna go, we wanna go
We wanna go, we wanna go
When the dark and day meet in the image of stars
ls where we're gonna find out who we are
When the dark and day meet in the image of stars
ls where we're gonna find out who we are
