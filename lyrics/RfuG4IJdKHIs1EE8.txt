We drain our existence like we would quench a fire
Until all dread and wonder vanish from our sight

Our soul is filled with ever emotional pain
We tempered our heart so it never ends

Give up on joy
Eden is forever lost
There will be nothing left when we are six feet under
Hope will destroy
A heaven that's forever lost
There will be nothing left so we must all surrender

To suffer loss and never recover our fire
Our broken bonds and wounds that lionize our lives

Our soul is filled with ever emotional pain
We tempered our heart so it never ends

Give up on joy
Eden is forever lost
There will be nothing left when we are six feet under
Hope will destroy
A heaven that's forever lost
There will be nothing left so we must all surrender

We know the sure way to pick distrust over confidence
Should we find the crux of life we would still vilify

Give up on joy
Eden is forever lost
There will be nothing left when we are six feet under
Hope will destroy
A heaven that's forever lost
There will be nothing left so we must all surrender

Give up on joy
Eden is forever lost
There will be nothing left when we are six feet under
Hope will destroy
A heaven that's forever lost
There will be nothing left so we must all surrender
