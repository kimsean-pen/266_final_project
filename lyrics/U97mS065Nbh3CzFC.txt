One day
I know
We'll find
A place of hope

Just hold on to me
Just hold on to me

Walk tight
One line
You're wanted
This time

There's no-one to blame
Just hold on to me

And I'm right on time
And the birds keep singing
And you're right on line
And the bells keep ringing
And the battle is won
And the planes keep winging
And I'm right on time
One day there'll be a place for us
And the girl keeps singing

I walk
I wait
With folded hands
And lonely
I stumble
I stumble

With you
I wait
To be born
Again
With love comes the day
Just hold on to me

And I'm right on time
And the birds keep singing
And you're right on line
One day there'll be a place for us
And the bells keep ringing
And the battle is won
And the planes keep winging
And I'm right on time
One day there'll be a place for us
And the girl keeps singing

Now is
The time
To follow through
To read the signs

Now the
Message is sent
Let's bring it to its final end

And I'm right on time
And the birds keep singing
And you're right on line
One day there'll be a place for us
And the bells keep ringing
And the battle is won
And the planes keep winging
And I'm right on time
One day there'll be a place for us
And the girl keeps singing

And I'm right on time
And the birds keep singing
And you're right on line
One day there'll be a place for us
And the bells keep ringing
And the battle is won
And the planes keep winging
And I'm right on time
One day there'll be a place for us
And the girl keeps singing

One
Day
I
One day there'll be a place for us
Know
There'll be
A place
Called
One day there'll be a place for us
