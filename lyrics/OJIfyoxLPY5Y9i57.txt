Qele, Qele Lyrics

Yes im hay hoghits eka berem
Hove sareri, luyse arevi

You wanna be with me,
You think and dream of me
Come qele, move qele.
Instead of watching me
You should be reaching me,
Come qele, move qele.

Qe-qe-qe-qe-le!

Qele, qele! Qele, qele! Qele, qele! Qe-le
Time is here tonight,
You should make it right,
To end our fight just hold me tight!
Hold me tight!
Hold me tight! Qele!

You wanna be with me,
You thinking dream of me
Come qele, move qele.
Instead of watching me
You should be reaching me,
Come qele, move qele.

Qele, qele! Qele, qele! Qele, qele! Qe-le
Time is here tonight,
You should make it right,
To end our fight just hold me tight!
