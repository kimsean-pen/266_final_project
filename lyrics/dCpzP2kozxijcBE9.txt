I was born by the river in a little old tent
Oh just like this river I've been running ever since

It's been a long long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come
Oh yes it is
On my!

It's been too hard living
And I'm afraid to die
Cause I don't know what's up there
Beyond the clouds

It's been a long long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come
Oh yes it is
Oh my

There's a time I would go to my brother
I asked my brother "will you help me please?"
He turned me down and then I ask my dear mother

I said "Mother! I'm down on my knees"

It's been a time that I thought
Lord this couldn't last for very long
But somehow I thought I was still able to try to carry on
It's been a long long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come
Oh yes it is

Just like I said, I went to my little bitty brother
I asked my brother "Brother help me please?"
He turned me down and then I go to my little mother
I said "Mother! I'm down on my knees"

But there was a time that I thought
Lord this couldn't last for very long
But somehow I thought I was still able to try to carry on
It's been a long long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come
Oh yes it will
