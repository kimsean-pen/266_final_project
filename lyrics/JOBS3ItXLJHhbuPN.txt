Emily, Emily

Emily, can't you write a happy song?
Get your ass to number one
You could try a little harder

Emily, you could be a millionaire
But you're so full of hot hair
Gonna end up like your father

Emily, you can't leave your life to chance
Get a boy and learn to dance
Be a girl like any other

Emily, are you stuck up? Are you gay?
If you are, well that's okay
'Cause it doesn't even matter, Emily

Emily, it's your life and you can't live it twice
One day you'll understand, Emily, take my hand
Emily, I love you and I know you do too
You never make no sense screaming at me in French

Pourquoi tu gâche ta vie?
Pourquoi tu gâche ta vie?
Shut up, listen to me, dance with me, Emily

Pourquoi tu gâche ta vie
Pourquoi tu gâche ta vie
Shut up, listen to me, dance with me, Emily

Emily, you got so much in your life
Me, I got no one's advice
Don't you know you got it easy

Emily, what you smoking, what's that stench?
Show you screaming out in French?
Did you really think you had me?

Emily, that's enough, do as you're told
Acting like you're eight years old
I give up, it's not worth trying

Emily, one day I will end up dead
That's the only thing I've said
That will ever get her smiling, Emily

Emily, it's your life and you can't live it twice
One day you'll understand, Emily, take my hand
Emily, I love you and I know you do too
You never make no sense screaming at me in French

Pourquoi tu gâche ta vie
Pourquoi tu gâche ta vie
Shut up, listen to me, dance with me, Emily

Pourquoi tu gâche ta vie
Pourquoi tu gâche ta vie
Shut up, listen to me, dance with me, Emily

Emily, live your life in a balloon
Lock yourself up in your room
So the world can never reach ya

Emily, am I speaking Japanese?
Got me falling on my knees
Got me praying to Saint Peter

Emily, see the price I have to pay
I would give my life away
If I knew that I could reach ya

Emily, why do you make this hard to me?
It's not the way it's meant to be
I don't never wanna hate ya

Emily dance, Emily dance, dance, dance
Emily dance, Emily dance, dance, dance
Emily dance, Emily dance, dance, dance
Emily dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, Emily dance

Emily, it's your life and you can't live it twice
One day you'll understand, Emily, take my hand
Emily, I love you and I know you do too
You never make no sense screaming at me in French

Pourquoi tu gâche ta vie
Pourquoi tu gâche ta vie
Shut up, listen to me, dance with me, Emily

Pourquoi tu gâche ta vie
Pourquoi tu gâche ta vie
Shut up, listen to me, dance with me, Emily

Emily dance!
