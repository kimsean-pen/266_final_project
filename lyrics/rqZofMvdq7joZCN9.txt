I can't trust anyone, no anything these days
If you are who you say you are then show me your face
Came out of the ocean like you came out of a dream
Your voice it sounds familiar but you are not what you seem

All words of comfort can not take away my doubt
I decided if it kills me I'll find out what you're about
I can't trust anyone, no anything these days

But I know what you want and why
Of all the strangers you're the strangest that I see
I'm not afraid to die
I can't trust anyone, no anything these days

You are not the one you say you are
You are not the one you say you are

I can't trust anyone, no anything these days
If you are who you say you are then show me your face
No one else will say you are not what you claim to be
Well I've kept???? watch and I don't like what I see

Can't escape the feeling that you give me in the night
I'll sleep with one eye open, and I'm not afraid to fight
I can't trust anyone, no anything these days

But I know what you want and why
Of all the strangers you're the strangest that I see
I'm not afraid to die

I can't trust anyone, no anything these days
Know what you want and why
Of all the strangers your the strangest that I see
I'm not afraid to die

I can't trust anyone no anything these days

You are not the one you say you are
You are not the one you say you are

You are not the one you say you are
You are not the one you say you are

Now that I've seen your face I'm haunted by the letters of your name
Now that I've seen your face I'm haunted by the letters of your name
Now that I've seen your face I'm haunted by the letters of your name
Now that I've seen your face I'm haunted by the letters of your name
