Last night I said these words to my girl
I know you never even try, girl
C'mon (C'mon)
C'mon (C'mon)
C'mon (C'mon)
C'mon (C'mon)
Please Please Me, Oh Yeah!, like I please you

You don't need me to show the way, love
Why do I always have to say "love"
C'mon (C'mon)
C'mon (C'mon)
C'mon (C'mon)
C'mon (C'mon)
Please Please Me, Oh Yeah!, like I please you

I don't wanna sound complaining,
but you know there's always rain in my heart
(In my heart)
I do all the pleasing with you, it's so hard to reason
With you, oh yeah
Why do you make me blue

Last night I said these words to my girl
I know you never even try, girl
C'mon (C'mon)
C'mon (C'mon)
C'mon (C'mon)
C'mon (C'mon)
Please Please Me, oh yeah, like I please you
(Me) Oh yeah, like I please you
(Me) Oh yeah, like I please you
