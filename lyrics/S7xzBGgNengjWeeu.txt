Gwendolyn I wonder what you'd've called them
I think a name you might choose is Nobody's Blues
You see when you are just a kid
They think you won't remember what they did
they think you won't remember... But you did
Then you learned how to say \"Everything you love
Tries to get away
Everything you love finally does
\"Its finally looking good up there our skyline
See how if fits right in there with heaven
The constellations and Comiskey's lights
Two old friends in the night
Who always knew they would if they could
Meet one last time in the old neighborhood
Hey wait a minute things ain't looking that good
Its getting quiet and the light's getting dim
This ain't like no place I've ever been
What kind of trouble am I in?
Oh Gwen, here they come again
It's nobody's Blues
Here they come again
