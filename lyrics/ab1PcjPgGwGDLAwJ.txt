Jumping like a dog on Prozac
And fishing with dynamite
I thought that I was in the green
But it turns red every time

You drive me crazier that a wingless bee
You drive me crazier than I want to be
Put your best dress on, better make it black
I'm going out but I'm not coming back

Bite by a lighting bug
Now there's tire marks on the street
I think I quite like this tune
But couldn't you find a bigger beat

You drive me crazier that a wingless bee
You drive me crazier than I want to be
Put your best dress on, better make it black
I'm going out but I'm not coming back
I'm not coming back

I don't where i fit anymore
I snapped the key when I tried to lock the door
The canyons are up in flames
And England mispelled my name
I don't know where I fit anymore

You drive me crazier that a wingless bee
You drive me crazier than I want to be
Put your best dress on, better make it black
I'm going out but I'm not coming back
I'm not coming back

You drive me crazier that a wingless bee
You drive me crazier than I want to be
Put your best dress on, better make it black
I'm going out but I'm not coming back
I'm not coming back
