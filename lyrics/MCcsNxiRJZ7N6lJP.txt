Do you feel like you're falling?
You've taken this step
In front of you, is further from the truth
And you fall apart in front of me again

AGAIN!

Denial isn't the way to forgiveness
You always swore that I was wrong!

Not again...
No taste for the crow you feed me
Not again...
It's not a matter of if I care
Not again...
What an intricate web you're weaving
Again and again

So you tried not to follow
While the clock fails to sleep
So here we are, back where it began
And toe to toe I stand in front of you again

AGAIN!

Denial isn't the way to forgiveness
You always swore that I was wrong!

Not again...
No taste for the crow you feed me
Not again...
It's not a matter of if I care
Not again...
What an intricate web you're weaving
Again and again

(Solo)

Not again...
No taste for the crow you feed me
Not again...
It's not a matter of if I care
Not again...
What an intricate web you're weaving
Again and again
AGAIN!
AGAIN!
