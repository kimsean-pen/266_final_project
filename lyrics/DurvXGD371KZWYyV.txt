There's a king upon the throne
He's the king there all alone
He seems troubled and real sad
Just when thought
That he was glad
To be the ruler of the earth
Could it be, it wasn't worth
More than nothing?

From the day that he was born
In his side there was a thorn
He just couldn't find the key
To be happy and be free
He felt forced to
Wear the crown
Slowly it will drag him down
Into nothing

One more drink and
You are learning how to fly
Everything just perfect
Once you reach the sky
Pop another pill,
Don't wanna leave your dream
Forget about the days of
When you swam upstream
And don't you care
Too much 'bout you feel inside
It is probably nothing

I never told you 'bout my dream
How I saw us as a team
We would free the universe
With a chorus and a verse
We were gonna
Make a change
But like how every dream is strange
It's also nothing

What was goin' through your mind
What kind of truth did you find
What did you see from the top
That would finally make you stop
Did it give peace to your soul
Like you reached your final goal
Or just nothing?

One more drink and
You are learning how to fly
Everything just perfect
Once you reach the sky
Pop another pill,
Don't wanna leave your dream
Forget about the days of
When you swam upstream
And don't you care too
Much 'bout what you feel inside
It is probably nothing

On and on, on the road,
Never-ending
Keep a smile up,
Make sure you're pretending
It's been a long
While since you ate the pain

On and on, you're no fish
In the water
But you're slowly on
Your way to the slaughter
Before you know,
Everything's too late

One more drink and
You are learning how to fly
Everything just perfect
Once you reach the sky
Pop another pill,
Don't wanna leave your dream
Forget about the days of
When you swam upstream

And as I hear your song
Play on the radio
A certain sadness in
Me always starts to grow
Will I ever understand
The reason why
The melodies make
Me both wanna smile and cry

And all the things
You make me feel inside
Are anything but nothing
