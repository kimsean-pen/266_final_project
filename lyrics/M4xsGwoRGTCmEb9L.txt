Have you ever heard that love is a metaphor?
A metaphor for the taste of the bottom
The fall to the floor
I fall to the floor

I remember me and you
I remember what you did
I remember being numb
I remember feeling sick

For the taste of the bottom, the fall to the floor
Have you ever heard love is a metaphor for the way you failed me?
And now I'm failing you
(I want you to listen very, very carefully)

Like the serpents tongue
Like the storm that shakes me
Like the hand that beats me
Until I'm black and blue

Like the autumn chill
Like the love that failed me
Let the earth remove me
Black and blue
Black and blue

Have you ever heard that death is a metaphor?
A metaphor for, "What if I'm not good enough?
What if I'm not strong enough?
What if I'm not kind enough for what happens next, for what happens then?"

Like the serpents tongue
Like the storm that shakes me
Like the hand that beats me
Until I'm black and blue

Like the autumn chill
Like the love that failed me
Let the earth remove me
Black and blue
Black and blue

Like the serpents tongue (Like the serpents tongue)
Like the storm that shakes me (Like the storm that shakes me)
Like the hand that beats me
The hand that beats me black and blue

Like the autumn chill (Like the autumn chill)
Like the love
Lo-ove, lo-ove
Lo-o-ove

Black and blue
