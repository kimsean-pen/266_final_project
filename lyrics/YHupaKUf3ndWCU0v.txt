I've been down hearted, baby
Ever since the day we met
I said I've been down hearted baby
Ever since the day we met
Our love is nothing but the blues, woman
Baby, how blue can you get?

You're evil when I'm with you
And you're jealous when we're apart
Yeah, I said "You're evil"
So evil
When I'm with you, baby
And you're jealous when we're apart
How blue can you get baby
The answer is right here in my heart

I gave you a brand new Ford
But you said: "I want a Ca-dill-ac"
I bought you a ten dollar dinner
You said: "Thanks for the snack"
I let you live in my pent house
You said: "It was just a shack"
I gave seven children
And now you wanna give them back

I said I've been down hearted baby
Ever since the day we met
I said: Our love is nothing but the blues
Baby, how blue
Can you get?
