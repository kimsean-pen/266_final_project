It's all your fault
I feel amazing
You make me feel like a real fucking Starfire

I'm super dizzy
I might be flying
I wanna crawl under my covers and just stay there

I know it's weird
To say you changed me
But things have been really hard for me lately

I don't need anything
Just when you talk to me
I can't believe anyone would ever be that nice to me

But would it be alright
Would it be ok
Would you be my joyful thought today

Would it be alright
Would it be ok
Would you be my joyful thought today

Your favourite colour
How did you get here
Please be my friend although I'm just a huge orange mess

I'm fucking melting
Maybe sweating
I fucking love it when you treat me like a princess

You rock my world
You're so powerful
It really really makes me feel like I'm dreaming
I'm like water
I'm like whatever
It's too embarrassing to say how I'm feeling

But would it be alright
Would it be ok
Would you be my joyful thought today

Would it be alright
Would it be ok
Would you be my joyful thought today

I always feel so weird
I always feel so alien in my skin
It feels surreal
It feels so strange
To not be afraid to let you in
