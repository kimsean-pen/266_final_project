I am alone, so don't speak
I find war, and I find peace
I find no heat, no love in me

And I am low and unwell
This is love, this is hell
This sweet plague that follows me

And my body's weak
Feel my heart giving up on me
I'm worried it might just be
And my body's weak
Feel my lungs giving up on me
I'm worried it might just be
something my soul needs x2

And I see a war on the screen
And it is is cruel and unclean
But I still worry more about you

And I am rude and unkind
Have no thought, and have no time
Have no eyes, so no point of view

And my body's weak
I feel my heart giving up on me
I'm worried it might just be
My body's weak
feel my lungs giving up on me
I'm worried it might just be
something my soul needs
something my soul needs
something my soul needs

And I am more than this frame
I feel hurt and I feel shame
I just wish you would feel the same

And I am more than these bones
I feel love, I feel alone
I just wish you would come home

My body's weak
I feel my heart giving up on me
I'm worried it might just be
My body's weak
Feel my lungs giving up on me
I'm worried it might just be
something my soul needs
something my soul needs
something my soul needs
is you, lying next to me.
and it's you, lying next to me.
