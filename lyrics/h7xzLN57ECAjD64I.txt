You got to know, that she won't love you back
That she won't love you back like I can (like I can)
She don't understand, your body like I can
All she does is hold you back (okay)

Girl we are not the same
She don't wanna get involved like me
She don't wanna accept the faults
She'll never take the fall
All of the sudden you're making a change
Can't you tell that she's running a game?
You should know these players gone play, play (Uh-huh)

You got to know, that she won't love you back, love you back
(Won't love you, won't love you)
You got to know, that she won't love you back like I can
(Like I can, like I can)
(Won't love you, won't love you)

You got to know that I won't love you back
That I won't love you back, 'cause I can't
(Won't love you, won't love you)
You don't understand my body like she can
All you do is holding me back (holding me back)

I'm so over getting all of these fools that don't value my time
I'm so over getting all of these losers that don't nurture my mind
I get tiered of the lies
I can see through your eyes (yeah)
You can say, you can say what you want
But I still don't want you

Hey, I say hey
Baby, don't want your loving
I got me something
I say hey
I don't even want your money
I got my own thing
I said bae
I'ma be fine without you
Don't you worry
Don't you worry no more, no more

You got to know that I won't love you back, love you back
(Won't love you, won't love you)
You got to know that I won't love you back, 'cause I can't
('Cause I can't)

You got to know, that she won't love you back, love you back
You got to know, that she won't love you back, like I can
