Driving in my car,
Smoking my cigar,
The only time I'm happy's when I play my guitar.

Sailing in my yacht,
What a lot I got,
Happiness is something that just cannot be bought.

I've been in and I'm out,
I've been up and down,
I don't want to go until I've been all around.

What's it all about,
Anyone in doubt,
I don't want to go until I've found it all out.
