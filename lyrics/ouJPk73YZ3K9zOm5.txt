Inside, inside your head you're wasting away
Away right in front of my eyes
You're scared, so weary and worn the fuck out
The addictions made you so sick
So sick and filthy

Poison
Your burden is life
It's made you weak and shake in the knees

Your burden is life
It's made you weak and shake in the knees

Inside, inside your head you're wasting away
Away right in front of my eyes

So get lifted
Dependant on this artificial feeling

Poison
It's made you weak and shake in the knees
This is not your reality
This is not your reality
This is not your reality
This is not you

It's made you weak and shake in the knees

This is not your reality
This is not your reality

This is not your reality
This is not your reality

This is not
This is not you
This is not your reality
This is not
This is not you
This is not you reality.
