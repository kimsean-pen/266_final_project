I told you so
It's all that I know
In love with one, no conditions
And you think that it's gross
So I hold you close
It's all that I know
But if I should ask you'd act
Like you've grown up

Bunny what you talking about
You're always clocking out
Oh honey what you walking out for
I'm so awfully down
When he's around you

I only hope he's making
'Cause my hoe brings home the bacon
She bites with strife
And breaks the skin, oh
And I only hope he's listening
'Cause my hoe brings home the business
She writes with knives
And breaks the skin
In print

I told you so and so
It's all that I know
But if I should leave you'd make believe
That roof is still a home
So I hope you know
It's only natural
But if I should stray you'd play
Like you're whole

Oh Bunny what you talking about
You're always clocking out(you always clocking out)
Oh honey what you walking out for
I'm so awfully down
When he's around you, yeah oh

I only hope he's making
'Cause my hoe brings home the bacon
She bites with strife
And breaks the skin, oh
And I only hope he's listening
'Cause my hoe brings home the business
She writes with knives
And breaks the skin
In print

Fill me up(repeat till the end)
And kill me softly like a true romance
Fill me up, weary love
And kill me softly like a true romance
Yea fill me up
And kill me softly like a true romance
Yea twenty one
We're in love
Yea we're in love
We're in love
