Nowadays, headache, cold shoulder
Getting colder, guess I'm growing older
I'ma loner, lie and say I love her
You don't come over, when you're sober

Drugs are longer now, I never leave the house
Don't look at me for help, I hate to watch you drown
Still tried my best, no doubt, like fuck you talking bout?
