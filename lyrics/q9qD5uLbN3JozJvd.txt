Nothing and nothing I see
Nothing and nothing I hear
When the seasons change
When the children play
In these clouded days
The doubts will stay
Right by my side
In flood and tide
Dust soaks my eyes
My love is denied
The sun and the moon and the stars
If someone could tell who you are
But the seasons fled
And the Blackbirds dead
All the doubts will stay
Right by my side
In flood and tide
Dust soaks my eyes
My love is denied
