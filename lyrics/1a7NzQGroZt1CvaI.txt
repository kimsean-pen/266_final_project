This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what, I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention
I kissed a boy and I liked it
The taste of his cherry chapstick
I kissed a boy just to try it
I hope my girlfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a boy and I liked it
I liked it
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what, good boys do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey
I kissed a boy and I liked it
The taste of his cherry chapstick
I kissed a boy just to try it
I hope my girlfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a boy and I liked it
I liked it
I kissed a boy and I liked it
I kissed a boy just to try it
I hope my girlfriend don't mind it
I kissed a boy and I liked it
The taste of his cherry chapstick
I kissed a boy just to try it
I hope my girlfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a boy and I liked it
I liked it
