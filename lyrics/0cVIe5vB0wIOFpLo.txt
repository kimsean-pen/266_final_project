wild in the woods of love
we harm those whom we adore
and contrary to all good intentions
we suffocate them in an alarming embrace

listen child try to understand
all is not what it appears to be in the world at hand
here dreams are bought and sold for a price
the truth a burden to keep for the rest of your life

these paths that we have chosen
can only lead to fear and despair
so we learn from and experience the corporeal
all is hidden in hidden meanings
all can be learned from within
we are all brothers and sisters in spirit
