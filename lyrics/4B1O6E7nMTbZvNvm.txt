Your white hot lies electrify me

Dark side, bright light both look right to me
Wrong right, feels like maybe that's what I need
Your type not polite but talk that shit I need
Cold eyes, run lines, in one touch I believe

I don't wanna but I need your love
It ain't really gotta mean that much
All I want is just to feel your touch
You liar!

Your white hot lies electrify me
I might just like the way they feel in me, in me
Make me high on a low and I can't let go
But I'm never really satisfied
Your white hot lies electrify me

So lie to me

We try time and time to make this us a thing
I'm out of line called twice, baby you're out of reach
Your type, not polite, but talk that shit I need
Cold eyes, run lines, in one touch I believe

I don't wanna but I need your love
It ain't really gotta mean that much
All I want is just to feel your touch
You liar!

Your white hot lies electrify me
I might just like the way they feel in me, in me
Make me high on a low and I can't let go
But I'm never really satisfied
Your white hot lies electrify me

So lie to me
Yeah, just lie to me
Electrify me (so lie to me)
Electrify me (so lie to me)

Your white hot lies electrify me (hey baby, baby)
I might just like the way they feel
in me (so don't hold back electrify me)
Make me high on a low and I can't let go
But I'm never really satisfied
Your white hot lies electrify me

So lie to me...
Don't stop electrify me...

Your white hot lies electrify me
I might just like the way they feel in me, in me
