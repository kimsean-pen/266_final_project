Now you see me
Getting better
I'm right here on display
And i'll make it
A bit heavier
By going all the way

Did you find it
All much easier
So stoop to where i was?
With your power
And your knowledge
To leave me here

Alone
Alone.I'm all alone

Alone
Alone.I'm all alone

Now is the time
For being humble
By holding you down on your knees
I suspect you'll stay there and crumble
Rather so then to be alone

Alone
Alone.I'm all alone

Alone
Alone.I'm all alone

Do you believe your heart
Trying it all around to find
Your way
Back inside?

I will be there
For you to care
And you'll find
Peace of
Your mind

Alone
Alone.I'm all
