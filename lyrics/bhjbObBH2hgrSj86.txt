I'm just an aging drummer boy and in the wars I used to play
And I've called the tune to many a torching session
Now they say I am a war criminal and I'm fading away
Father please hear my confession

I have legalized robbery, called it belief
I have run with the money, I have hid like a thief
Rewritten history with my armies of my crooks
Invented memories, I did burn all the books

And I can still hear his laughter and I can still hear his song
The man's too big, the man's too strong

Well I have tried to be meek and I have tried to be mild
But I spat like a woman and I sulked like a child
I have lived behind walls, that have made me alone
Striven for peace, which I never have known

And I can still hear his laughter and I can still hear his song
The man's too big, the man's too strong

Well the sun rose on the courtyard and they all did hear him say
You always was a judas but I got you anyway
You may have got your silver but I swear upon my life
Your sister gave me diamonds and I gave them to your wife

Oh father please help me for I have done wrong
The man's too big, the man's too strong
