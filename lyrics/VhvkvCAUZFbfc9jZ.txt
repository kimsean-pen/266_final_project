Who are you? What do you follow me for?
You've shared my dreams.
For Years that is real
What you've left behind I know you can't find.
Leave me alone
This path is my own
I come alone
I come alone in peace my dear
But you open the door
For me to seek more
Now I've come here to find what's mind
Stay (You'll see we share the pain right here)
The heat is here to stay,
it burns our way (I've come to guide us out of here)
Stay (You'll see we share the pain right here)
The heat is here to stay, it burns our way
Why you're here
It's hard to see
I think what you need is something from me
But there's nowhere to run under the ardent sun
You need me like I need you
Stay
The heat is here to stay, it burns our way
Stay
The heat is here to stay, it burns our way
And I feel alive with you
How strange and new for me
For years
I kept inside the darkness
I know too well but now there's light
Stay
The heat is here to stay, it burns our way
Stay
The heat is here to stay, it burns our way
Stay
The heat is here to stay, it burns our way
