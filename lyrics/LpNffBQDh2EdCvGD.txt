Whoa, whoa
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
Whoa, whoa
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo

She works for the weekend
Mixtape of her favorite bands
Turning up the radio
Lost in the stereo, sound

She's trouble in a tank top
Pretty little time bomb
Blowin' up
Take you down
Living in the radio
Lost in stereo, sound

She's dancing alone
I'm ready to go but she's so
(Lost in stereo, lost in stereo)
She's outta control, so beautiful
(Lost in stereo, lost in stereo)
And I've been waiting
For so long
But she'll never know
I'm losing hope
'Cause she's so
(Lost in stereo, lost in stereo)
Whoa, whoa
(Lost in stereo, lost in stereo)

Shake down on a Saturday
Sit back gotta catch my breath
'Cause every time I see her
Know she's gonna take it back somehow
Tattoos and a switchblade attitude
Snakebite heart with a bubblegum smile
Sex and stereo
Don't turn the radio down

She's dancing alone
I'm ready go
But she's so
(Lost in stereo, lost in stereo)
She's out of control
So beautiful
(Lost in stereo, Lost in stereo)

And I've been
Waiting
For so long
But she'll never know
I'm losing hope
'Cause she's so
(Lost in stereo, lost in stereo)
And I'm just like cellophane
'Cause she sees right through me
I know she's glitter and gold
And that's just the price I pay
When I don't even know her name
She's slipping away

She works for the weekend
Mixtape of her favorite bands
Tearing up the radio
Lost in the stereo, sound

She's dancing alone
I'm ready go
She's so
(Lost in stereo, lost in stereo)
She's out of control
So beautiful
(Lost in stereo, lost in stereo)
And I've been waiting
For so long
But she'll never know
I'm losing hope
'Cause she's so
(Lost in stereo, lost in stereo)
She's dancing alone
I'm ready go
She's so
(Lost in stereo, lost in stereo)
She's out of control
So beautiful
(Lost in stereo, lost in stereo)
And I've been waiting
For so long
But she'll never know
I'm losing hope
'Cause she's so
(Lost in stereo, lost in stereo)
