I know you're trying to kill me
I know you're trying to kill me
'Cause you're chasing me around town
Until I turn around
Yeah, you're chasing me around town
Until I turn around

I cannot take anymore
Do you want me to skip town
Do you want me to come 'round

I know you're trying to kiss me
I know you're really trying to kill me
'Cause you're driving me around town
In your car
You drive it off a bridge and crash it to the ground
You're following me 'round town until I turn around
