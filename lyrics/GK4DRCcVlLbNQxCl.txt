I'm on a tightrope
You've got your reasons
When did it get so hard to breathe
Hide in the spotlight
I'm feeling so tired
Your hands are burned from holding me
And maybe you and I will fall in time
Eventually
Maybe we'll both die trying
But I can't bring myself to leave
'Cause I've looked

And I ain't seen nothing like you
The way you light up every room tonight so easily
And I have moved mountains babe just to stumble into your good grace
And I, I still can't compete

You're on a tightrope
I've got my reasons
How did we get so tangled?
You cannot stay straight
I've bend as you break
We're so messed up, but I know
That you and I will fall in time
Eventually
Or maybe we'll both die trying

'Cause I ain't seen nothing like you
The way you light up every room tonight so easily
And I have moved mountains babe just to fall into your good grace
And I, I still can't compete

Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh

You and I will fall in time
Eventually
Or maybe we'll both die trying
'Cause I ain't seen nothing like you
The way you light up every room tonight so easily
And I have moved mountains babe just to fall into your good grace
And I, I still can't compete
