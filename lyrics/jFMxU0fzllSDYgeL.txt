can you track it back to me
I'm secretly in other minds
never thought you'd suffer once
you're better with a complex life
or living in another zone
with battle cries across this room
no wonder how you spend your nights
when you have got so much to lose

it's tearing us down
pulling at your hair and imagine me wearing somebody else
while staring at the roof or ground
it's scaring you now
Cause I can keep my head from thinking those things you kept to yourself
that feeling at our lives in doubt

another time to trouble this
another chance to drown these thoughts
its difficult discovering
the problems that surround yourself
but no one could've guessed as much
l'm better when l'm by your side
and i don't want to to tum it off
the image that is in your eyes

it's tearing us down
pulling at your hair and imagine me wearing somebody else
while staring at the roof or ground
it's scaring you now
Cause I can keep my head from thinking those things you kept to yourself
that feeling of our lives in doubt

it's tearing us down
pulling at your hair and imagine me wearing somebody else
while staring at the roof or ground
it's scaring you now
Cause I can keep my head from thinking those things you kept to yourself
that feeling of our lives in doubt
