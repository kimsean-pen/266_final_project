I put your records on
To see if you would sing my name
I put your records on
To see if you might feel the same
It was a tragedy about the whole wide world
You took the saddest part
And gave it to another girl

It's funny how it all works out in the end
Though it was the same from start to fin
But it's never too late to begin

So I put your records on
To see if I would hear my name
I put your records on
And wonder if you do the same
It'd be a tragedy for anyone that was your girl
Because the saddest part is
You want the love of all the world

It's funny how it all works out in the end
Though it was a shame from start to fin
But it's never too late to begin

It's funny how it all works out in the end
Though it was the same as it's always been
But it's never too late to begin

So I put your records on
I put your records on
I put your records on
I put your records on
Your records on
I put your records on
