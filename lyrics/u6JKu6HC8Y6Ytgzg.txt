Am I out of touch? Am I out of my place?
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for an empty space
Oh I'm wishin' you're here, but I'm wishin' you're gone
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up, oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again

In the mean time, we let it go
At the road sign we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away
Cause you've always got to change your mind
Cause you've always got to change your mind
Cause you've always got to change your mind
Oh love, can you hear me?

I'm sorry for everything, no, everything I've done
From the second that I was born and since I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved
Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved

Am I out of luck? Am I waiting to break?
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for a way to escape
Oh I'm wishin' I had what I'm takin' for granted
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up, oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again

In the mean time, we let it go
At the road sign we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away
Cause you've always got to change your mind
Cause you've always got to change your mind
Cause you've always got to change your mind
Oh love, can you hear me?

I'm sorry for everything, no, everything I've done
From the second that I was born and since I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved
Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved
