The party's over
I never thought you'd stay
The love of laughter
My truth's no longer sane
The party's over
Much older than you'd say
THIS FRIEND OF NO-ONE
TIME, CREASES ON YOUR FACE

Take a look at the kids
I've been losing track
This crime of being uncertain
Of your love
Is all I'm guilty of

The party's over
I never thought you'd stay
A style of reason
This life of masquerade

Take a look at the kids
I've been losing track
This crime of being uncertain
Of your love
Is all I'm guilty of

Take this punishment away Lord
Name the crime I'm guilty of
Too much hope I've seen as virtue
Name the crime I'm guilty of
