More thought is less than said
War fought inside my head
Hard times and violent times
Closed eyes and still framed minds

Cause all thoughts hate modern words
It's not just the truth that hurts
Scars heal, but never stray
Well I see another day
Another day

I'm starting to see my oceans were lakes
(I'm starting to see my)
I'm starting to see my oceans were lakes
(I'm starting to see my)

Before and aftermath
Lost cause down countless paths
Lose grip and handlebars
The dull glow of lesser stars

I fall short with every mile
With fist fights and single file
If all this just washed away
Would I see a brand new day?
A brand new day

I'm starting to see my oceans were lakes
(I'm starting to see my)
I'm starting to see my oceans were lakes
(I'm starting to see my)

I'm starting to see my oceans were lakes
I'm starting to see my oceans were lakes
I'm starting to see my oceans were lakes
I'm starting to see my oceans were lakes
