We been waiting on the sun rising
In the color of a cool lightning
We're not alone
We been looking for the right climate
But will we ever see the horizon?
There's something wrong

Now only in a wicked way we'll give this ritual
The way, the way, the way
Way we come alive
Oh tell me did we lose our way hooked on this ritual
The way, the way, the way
Way we come alive

Are we ever gonna see blinded?
In the echo of a cool silence
Out in the clouds
Are we looking for a gold lining?
In the shadow of a blood sky line
We will be found

Now only in a wicked way we'll give this ritual
The way, the way, the way
Way we come alive
Oh tell me did we lose our way hooked on this ritual
The way, the way, the way
Way we come alive
The way, the way, the way, the way
Way we come alive

It's a crooked vacation
In the super unknown
It's a coded equation
(It's a coded equation)
Are we losing my patience?
Are we better off alone?
Coloring the wrong places
Now that I'm awake I can't leave

Now only in a wicked way we'll give this ritual
The way, the way, the way
Way we come alive
Oh tell me did we lose our way hooked on this ritual
The way, the way, the way
Way we come alive
Now only in a wicked way we'll give this ritual
The way, the way, the way
Way we-
Way we come alive
Way we come alive
Way we come alive
