I
Have wondered about you
Where will you be
When this is through?

If all
If all goes as planned
Will you redeem
My life again?
My life again

Fire the fields the weed is sown
Water down your empty soul
Wake the sea of silent hope
Water down your empty soul

Fight your foes you're not alone
Holy war is on the phone
Asking to please stay on hold
The bleeding loss of blood runs cold

And I need you to recover
Because I can't make it on my own
And I need you to recover
Because I can't make it on my own

I
Have wondered about you
Where will you be
When this is through?

If all
If all goes as planned
Will you redeem
My life again?

And I need you to recover
Because I can't make it on my own
And I need you to recover
Because I can't make it on my own
I need you to recover
Because I can't make it on my own
I need you to recover
Because I can't make it on my own
On my own
On my own
On my own
