How do i feel for thee?
You smile brings disease
Cause we're young

Fell in from the stars
When your skin is shed
And a pile of your heads

Now then, I'll look so smart
Stove burns on my hands
Show them to my friends

Make you participate
Eyes roll back around

Limbs fall to the ground
Season to procreate
I'm suppose to interfere

The first to interfere
Are culled before the deer
When they wander into the cage

Stuff their arms and thighs
Then they roll their cardboard eyes
Their skin will never age

Stove burns on my hands
Show them to my friends
Make you participate
Eyes roll back around
Limbs fall to the ground
Season to procreate
Stove burns on my hands
Show them to my friends
Make you participate
Eyes roll back around
Limbs fall to the ground
Season to procreate
Stove burns on my hands
Show them to my friends
Make you participate
Eyes roll back around
Season to procreate
Limbs fall to the ground
Show them to my friends
Make you participate
