You can't right click on a face You can't be the winner of the human
race You can't do everything in this place But don't die curious You
can't be the healer of every soul You can't be the Queen all on your
own You can't beat the nighttime with a glow But don't die curious
You can't count every single grain of sand You can't save a heart by
holding a hand You can't make everyone understand But don't die
curious [?] I did not say, I found a way To hesitate, to deviate Oh,
we just die curious You can't be a runner with a broken toe You can't
paint a painting like Van Gogh You
can't pronounce everything right, you know?
But don't die curious You can't move a mountain in a beat You can't
find the truth of everyone you meet You can't kiss a stranger in the
street But don't die curious [?] I did not say,
I found a way To hesitate, to deviate Oh,
we just die curious You can't change a mind without a fight Waiting
for the hope of a morning light You can't find love on your own
tonight [?] did not do, ignore the clues I ran from you,
I found the blues Oh, we just die [?] I did not say,
I found a way To hesitate, to deviate Oh, we just die curious
