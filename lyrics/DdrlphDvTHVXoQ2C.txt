You
You
See
I don't know where I'm going
I see a light
I'd fix it all if I could this time
Stretched out before me
I can only see
See the light
Burning out
See the love
As it goes
And it wars you out
Could you have been
All that you wanted to
Carry me, carry me home
I don't know where I'm going
If you see the way
I could hold you through the night and day
Stretched out before me
I can only see
See the light
Burning out
See the love
As it goes
And it wars you out
Could you have been
All that you wanted to
Carry me, carry me home
