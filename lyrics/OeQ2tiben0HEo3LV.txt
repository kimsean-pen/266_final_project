We walk the plank, off the chain, we spank the track
We crawl the floor, shake the dust, we strike the match
We watch the clock, tick the tock, until the ceiling broke
We rule the game, play to win, we get the joke
We don't let your moves get in the way
Sidestep all your normal everyday
Straitjacket life, we rip it off, let yourself be free
Wake up the night, you be the boss, now come follow me

One, two, three, one, two, three, uh
One, two, three, air punch!
One, two, three, one, two, three, uh
One, two, three, fist pump!

Oh, oh, oh, Jupiter
Oh, oh, oh, Jupiter
Jupiter

We spot the bait, tame the horse, we risk the lot
We call the bluff, scan the sky, we keep it hot (ow!)
We read the signs, change the course, we eat the map
We underscore, we override, we got your back
We don't let those fools get in the way
Yeah, we might do the thing but it's our choice to make
Straitjacket life, we rip it off, let yourself be free
Wake up the night, you be the boss, now come follow me

One, two, three, one, two, three, uh
One, two, three, air punch!
One, two, three, one, two, three, uh
One, two, three, fist pump!

Oh, oh, oh, Jupiter
Oh, oh, oh, Jupiter
Oh, oh, oh, Jupiter
Oh, oh, oh, Jupiter
Jupiter

We're takin' off at hyper speed, can't hold us back
We're takin' off at hyper speed, can't hold us back
We're takin' off at hyper speed, can't hold us back
We're takin' off at hyper speed, can't hold us back
Back, back, back, back, back

Oh, oh, oh, Jupiter
Oh, oh, oh, Jupiter
Oh, oh, oh, Jupiter
Oh, oh, oh, Jupiter
