Must have been a mistake
While you make things hard for me
I wouldn't hurt you at all if I didn't have to
Give in it's our first fight
But now that I see this side
I want you more than I did before this night

I know you, hope I do now
The communications down
I know you, hope I do now
Close to close to closer

Temptations, they crumble by your side
Say you wouldn't hurt me at all
Can't be sure that you mean it
If it's worth holding on to
We can't stay in between it

I know you, hope I do now
The communications down
I know you, hope I do now
Come closer

Comfort to us all
Insured against a fall
From normal life
Afraid to be at it alone
To shoulder, I wonder is it safe for now

This can't go either way
It could work out between us, or never again
Make it clean, how realistic we mean to
I know you
I know you now, I know you
