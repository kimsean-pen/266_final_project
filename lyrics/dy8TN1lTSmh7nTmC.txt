It's a perfect day for a fight,
running after me in the pouring rain,
screaming baby you were right,
I need you, I need you.

Calling my name is a twisted game,
cause it wears me down till I love you more.
Waking up to us making up, makes it better than before.
Oooh, wind me up tight, convertible nights with you.
Oooh, I'll give you romance, a hundred last chances too.
Sometimes you make it impossible but, I wanna go and get lost with you.
My love, I want you to give me all of you.

Get to know me in your backseat,
drive me crazy, then you drive me home.
The only place I wanna be is with you,
is with you.
Trying my luck when I woke you up,
throwing all your clothes out the second floor.
Waking up to us making up, makes it better than before.
Oooh, wind me up tight, convertible nights with you.
Oooh, I'll give you romance, a hundred last chances too.
Sometimes you make it impossible but, I wanna go and get lost with you,
My love, I want you to give me all of you.
