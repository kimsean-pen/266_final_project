Heaven On Earth
We Need It Now
I'm Sick Of All Of This
Hanging Around
Sick Of Sorrow
Sick Of The Pain
And Sick Of Hearing Again And Again
That There's Gonna Be
Peace On Earth
Where I Grew Up
There Weren't Many Trees
Where There Was We'd Tear Them Down
And Use Them On Our Enemies
They Say That What You Mock
Will Surely Overtake You
And You Become A Monster
So The Monster Will Not Break You

It's Already Gone Too Far
Who Said That If You Go In Hard

You Won't Get Hurt?

Jesus Could You Take The Time
To Throw A Drowning Man A Line?
Peace On Earth
Tell The Ones Who Hear No Sound
Whose Sons Are Living In The Ground
Peace On Earth
No Whos Or Whys
No One Cries Like A Mother Cries
For Peace On Earth
She Never Got To Say Goodbye
To See The Colour In His Eyes

Now He's In The Dirt
Peace On Earth

They're Reading Names Out Over The Radio

All The Folks The Rest Of Us Won't Get To Know
Se√°n And Julia Gareth Ann And Breda
Their Lives Are Bigger Than Any Big Idea

Jesus Can You Take The Time
To Throw A Drowning Man A Line?

Peace On Earth
To Tell The Ones Who Hear No Sound
Whose Sons Are Living In The Ground
Peace On Earth

Jesus This Song You Wrote
The Words Are Sticking In My Throat

Peace On Earth
Hear It Every Christmas Time
But Hope And History Won't Rhyme
So What's It Worth?
This Peace On Earth
Peace On Earth
Peace On Earth
Peace On Earth
