He left me in a day
He left me in a strange way
I knew he couldn't stay
But he left me, in a day

And as he lay down on his hospital bed
I play him a love song
the harmonica lies calmly in his hands
But he wont be playing for long
But I know all his songs

He left me in a day
He left me in a strange way
I knew he couldn't stay
But he left me, in just a day

And as he lay down on his hospital bed
I play him a love song
the harmonica lies calmly in his hands
But he wont be playing for long
But I know all his songs
