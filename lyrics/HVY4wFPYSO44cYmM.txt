A short man from Texas
A man of the wild
Thrown into combat,
Where bodies lie piled
Hides his emotions,
His blood is running cold
Just like his victories,
His story unfolds

Bright, a white light,
If there'd be,
Any glory in war
Let it rest,
On men like him

Dead men will never come back

Crosses grow on Anzio
Where no soldier sleeps
And where hell is six feet deep
That death does wait
There's no debate
So charge and attack
Going to hell and back

A man of the 15th
A man of Can Do
Friends fall around him
And yet he came through
Let them fall face down
If they must die
Making it easier
To say goodbye

Bright, a white light,
If there'd be,
Any glory in war
Let it rest,
On men like him

Who went to hell and came back

Crosses grow on Anzio
Where no soldier sleeps
And where hell is six feet deep
That death does wait
There's no debate
So charge and attack
Going to hell and back

Oh gather 'round me
And listen while I speak
Of a war where hell is six feet deep
And all along the shore
Where cannons still roar
They're haunting my dreams
They're still there when I sleep

He saw crosses grow on Anzio
Where no soldier sleeps
And where hell is six feet deep
That death does wait
There's no debate
He charged and attack
He went to hell and back
