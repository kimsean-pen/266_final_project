I've given up on giving up slowly
I'm blending in so You won't even know me
Apart from this whole world that shares my fate
This one last bullet You mention is my one last shot at redemption
Because I know to live you must give your life away

And I've been housing all this doubt and insecurity
And I've been locked inside that house
All the while you hold the key
And I've been dying to get out and that might be the death of me
And even though, there's no way in knowing where to go, promise I'm going because

Ooh, I gotta get outta here
I'm stuck inside this rut that I fell into by mistake
Ooh, I gotta get outta here
And I'm begging You, I'm begging You, I'm begging You to be my escape

I'm giving up on doing this alone now
Cause I've failed and I'm ready to be shown how
You've told me the way and I'm trying to get there
And this life sentence that I'm serving
I admit that I'm every bit deserving
But the beauty of grace is that it makes life not fair

'Cause I've been housing all this doubt and insecurity
And I've been locked inside that house
All the while You hold the key
And I've been dying to get out and that might be the death of me
And even though, there's no way in knowing where to go, promise I'm going because

I gotta get out of here
'Cause I'm afraid that this complacency is something I can't shake
Yeah I gotta get out of here
And I'm begging You, I'm begging You, I'm begging You to be my escape

I am a hostage to my own humanity
Self detained and forced to live in this mess I've made
And all I'm asking is for You to do what You can with me
But I can't ask You to give what You already gave

'Cause I've been housing all this doubt and insecurity
And I've been locked inside that house
All the while you hold the key
And I've been dying to get out and that might be the death of me
And even though, there's no way in knowing where to go, I promise I'm going because

Ooh, I gotta get outta here
I'm stuck inside this rut that I fell into by mistake
Ooh, I gotta get outta here
And I'm begging You, I'm begging You, I'm begging You to be my escape

I fought You for so long
I should have let you win
Oh, how we regret those things we do
And all I was trying to do was save my own skin
But so were You

So were You
