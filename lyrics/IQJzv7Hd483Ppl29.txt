WESPN ESPN
They don't like my rap style
Now they want features
I turned all my doubters, into my believers
Arguing my damn ma
Flyin' with my teachers
Skip my game for the fashion show
One of my best decisions
Backwood addiction (I got it)
I got a backwood addiction
THC, thats facts non fiction
Or is the shit fiction?
But remember in school I ain't pay attention (in school I ain't pay attention)

I watched W-E-S-E-S-E-S-ESPN
W-E-S-E-S we fuck with him
W-E-S-E-S we don't need top ten
W-E-S-E-S we fuck with him
W-E-S-E-S

Goin' through a damn phase (goin' thru)
Goin' through my damn chains
Goin' through my dam passport (my passport)
I been goin' through these damn pages
Smokin on?
Hoes sniffing on powder (sniffing)
The money bring the power
The money bring you problems so
You niggas can't stop, don't call
Please don't call, don't call Sheck Wes no more
Cause I ain't picking' up my motherfucking phone
Do not disturb put it on phone
I ain't picking up calls no more
Please do not call my phone if you ain't talking about the motherfuckin' dope
Do not disturb put it on my phone
I ain't picking up calls no more
Please do not call my phone if you ain't talking about the motherfuckin' dope

I watched W-E-S-E-S-E-S-ESPN
W-E-S-E-S we fuck with him
W-E-S-E-S we don't need top ten
W-E-S-E-S we fuck with him
W-E-S-E-S

They just wanna turn shit
They don't like the sad music
Sheck Wes in a sad state
You ain't ever had to do shit huh?
You ain't ever had to go through shit huh?
You ain't ever have to go and shoot shit huh?
You ain't never had to go and shoot shit huh?
You ain't ever have to go and shoot shit huh?

That's why do not disturb, put it on the phone
I ain't pickin up the calls no more

Do not disturb
