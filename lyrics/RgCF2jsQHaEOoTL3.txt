Can you come on
out of the cold
How do we make it out alive

Get a weapon
Lockin the door
Stayin awake to stay alive

Kill the fallen
Knife in the back
Plan of attack
A beady eye

As you follow
Head out the pack
Flood out the rat
And stab em' dry

Got ya' come on
Goin in deep
Falling asleep
an open door

Get the ballast
Crawl up the coast
Pull on the neck
And cut the cord

Can you hold it
Get me a rope
Combing the lake of fire god

Like a bullet
Follow the smoke
Head of the snake
and cut it off

Ghosts heroing front lines
On a lonely cove
And they left behind
A bit if sorrow

You didn't need to count me out
When the final push is a little weight on your neck sometimes

You didn't need to count me out
When your feeling low here's a little hand from above because your on my mind

You kinda got it
Further a cause
Broaden the reach

a little pain
Like a comet burn up and die
Hear a pin drop a mile away

Like a disease
move with a tease
Glide of the feet
an atom bomb

As your dieing
both of your knees
Will fall to the street
You'll carry on
