Tender is the night lying by your side
Tender is the touch of someone that you love too much

Tender is the day the demons go away
Lord I need to find someone who can heal my mind

Come on, come on, come on
Get through it

Come on, come on, come on
Love's the greatest thing

Come on, come on, come on
Get through it

Come on, come on, come on
Love's the greatest thing

That we have
I'm waiting for that feeling

Waiting for that feeling
Waiting for that feeling to come

Oh my baby, oh my baby, oh why, oh my

Oh my baby, oh my baby, oh why, oh my

Tender is the ghost the ghost I love the most

Hiding from the sun waiting for the night to come

Tender is my heart I'm screwing up my life

Lord I need to find someone who can heal my mind

Come on, come on, come on
Get through it

Come on, come on, come on

Love's the greatest thing

Come on, come on, come on
Get through it
Come on, come on, come on
Love's the greatest thing
That we have
I'm waiting for that feeling
Waiting for that feeling
Waiting for that feeling to come
Oh my baby, oh my baby, oh why, oh my
Oh my baby, oh my baby, oh why, oh my
Come on, come on, come on
Get through it
Come on, come on, come on
Love's the greatest thing
Come on, come on, come on
Get through it
Come on, come on, come on
Love's the greatest thing
That we have
I'm waiting for that feeling
Waiting for that feeling
Waiting for that feeling to come
Oh my baby, oh my baby, oh why, oh my
Oh my baby, oh my baby, oh why, oh my
