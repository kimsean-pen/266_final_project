The rebel inside, a mind of my own
I haven't felt right since the moment that I gave up
I challenged my limits, I'm feeling I'm becoming limitless
I take it all in and inhale

I'm wide awake
Open my eyes and the sky's so blue
All of a sudden I know that I treasure my life
I find myself wide awake like you

The struggle within now I understand
Freedom begins when you get out of the cage you built
It looks like I'm crazy but I'm not the only one
To believe in myself, believe in myself
I won't becoming undone

'Cause I feel like I'm wide awake
Open my eyes and the sky's so blue
All of a sudden I know that I treasure my life
I find myself wide awake like you

I'm wide awake
Open my eyes and the sky's so blue
All of a sudden I know that I treasure my life
All of a sudden I know that I treasure my life
Like you
