Is this something on your mind?
What do you try to hide?
I can't seem, no, I can't seem
To get a hold on you

Sitting on the bench
You will think we are just friends
'Cause there's no lies
There's no lies that's with us two

What more can I give?
What more can I say?
'Cause I can't make you love me anyway

Oh, maybe I'm not the one
Oh, maybe I'm too young
But for reasons why I can't deny
I'm a fool for you, fool for you

Who are you talking to?
Is she in love with you?
I can see and I can feel
You're thinking of her again

Lying by your side
You would turn to its eyes
Oh, where is the sense?
Where is the sense in living with pretense?

What more can I give?
What more can I say?
I can't make you love me anyway

Oh, maybe I'm not the one
Oh, maybe I'm too young
But for reasons why I can't deny
I'm a fool for you, fool for you, fool for you

Oh, maybe I'm not the one
Oh, maybe I'm too young
But for reasons why I can't deny
I'm a fool for you, fool for you
I'm a fool for you, yeah, I'm a fool for you

I'm a fool for you
I'm a fool for you
I'm a fool for you
