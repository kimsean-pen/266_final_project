All my people in the crowd gran a partner take it down.

It's me against the music... (uh-uh...)
It's just me... (and me...)
Yeah... (c'mon...) oh.

(Hey Britney...?)
Are you ready...?
(Uh-uh... are you...?) uh.

And no one cares... it's whippin' my hair, it's pullin' my waist...
To hell with stares... the sweat is drippin' all over my face.

And no one's there...
I'm the only one dancin' up in this place... (it's just me...)
Tonight I'm here...
feel the beat of the drum, gotta get with that bass.

I'm up against the speaker, tryin' to take on the music,
it's like a competition,
me against the beat I wanna get in a zone... I wanna get in a zone.

If you really wanna battle,
saddle up and get your rhythm trying to hit it,
chic-a-taa in a minute I'm a take a you
on... I'm a take a you on... (hey-hey-hey!).

All my people on the floor, let me see you dance... (let me see ya...)
All my people wanting more, let me see you dance... (I wanna see ya).

All my people round and round,
let me see you dance... (let me see ya...)
All my people in the crowd, let me see you dance... (I wanna see ya).

So how would you like a friendly competition let's take on
the song... let's take on the song, let's take on the song.

It's you and me baby,
we're the music time to party all night
long... all night long... (oh, yeah, let's go!).

We're almost there... I'm feeling it bad and I can't explain...
My soul is bare... my hips are moving at a rapid pace.

Baby, feel it burn...
from the tip of my toes, runnin' through my veins...
And now's your turn... let me see what you got, don't hesitate.

I'm up against the speaker, tryin' to take on the music,
it's like a competition,
me against the beat I wanna get in a zone... I wanna get in a zone.

If you really wanna battle,
saddle up and get your rhythm trying to hit it,
chic-a-taa in a minute I'm a take a you
