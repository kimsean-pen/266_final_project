Give me my badge and gun
Give me the road that I may run
Give me that peaceful, wandering-free I used to know.

I've wait all I can, but I'm just not a patient man
Man, I've been hiding here for 7 months or so.

Hand me down my coat and hat, and grab the winter one at that
You never know how long I'll be away.

Give me my badge and gun
Give me the songs that I once sung
Give me those jet black, kick-back, lay down nights alone (those lay down nights alone)

This house is safe and warm
But I was made to chase the storm
Taking the whole world on with big ol' empty arms.

Tell my friends I tried my best
That one day I just up and left
They probably saw it coming anyway(what can I say)
Hey, hey. (ooo's)

The lock is on the cellar door
I can't remember what it's for
I ain't been down those stairs in oh so long
So, so long.

Give me my badge and gun
Give me the road that I must run
Give me that peaceful, wandering-free I used to know
A copy of your key is hanging where it used to be
Good as you've always been to me
The life I need to lead
Is somewhere out there calling over those hills
