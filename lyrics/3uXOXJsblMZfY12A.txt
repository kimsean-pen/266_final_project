Dead dreams in Hawaii
Penned dreams
can set your mind free
Beach palm
drop dead inside me
Black whole
nowhere to find me

And the stars are in the sky
And we wonder where we lack
Wash away in paradise
We're so gone, we're so

We're so gone
EVERYBODY, EVERYBODY
EVERYBODY, EVERYBODY

Fresh meat
In my new condo
Next drinks
In El Dorado
Go hard
Hood rich casino
Pack your
Misled libido

And the stars are in the sky
And we wonder where we lack
Watch your way in paradise
We're so gone, we're so

We're so gone
EVERYBODY, EVERYBODY
EVERYBODY, EVERYBODY

And the stars are in the sky
And we wonder where we lack
Watch your way in paradise
We're so gone, we're so

We're so gone
EVERYBODY, EVERYBODY
EVERYBODY, EVERYBODY
