I'll chalk another loss up after this
The things that you kept safe can't be replaced
And to think about the locks you've grown to break
Frustrating when the chains just stay in place

You always let your guard down
And you complain when they storm your shelter

You always say the wrong things
And get upset until you run from cover

You always say the wrong things
Until you run from cover

You make it so hard to leave
When you're playing with me
I hate how you threw away everything
Tattered leaves falling from a tree
I think I've had enough

Think back
Backtrack to the time we spent
Another wasted day on our apartment steps
I wrote you into my memories
Etched your name in my back to make it hard for me

Think back
Backtrack to the time we spent
Another wasted day on our apartment steps
I think I've had enough

I wish we never met
Now I'm just thinking of you

I'm just thinking on the times we had
A crooked path
We made some plans
And I don't know how the time has passed
We split apart and didn't look back

I'm just thinking on the times we had
A crooked path
We made some plans
And I don't know how the time has passed
We split apart and didn't look back

I wrote you into my memories
Etched your name in my back to make it hard for me
I couldn't give up as easy as you
As soon as I feel in love
You just fell out of tune
Is it so hard to say that I miss you?

You make it so hard to leave
When you're playing with me
I hate how you threw away everything
Tattered leaves falling from a tree
I think I've had enough

Think back
Backtrack to the time we spent
Another wasted day on our apartment steps
I wrote you into my memories
Etched your name in my back to make it hard for me
