Burn baby burn
She's a witch, she's a witch and I'm a heretic
So, learn baby learn
She's a witch, she's a witch and I'm a heretic so, learn

Oh, Abigail how could you do this to us?
You were a product of lust (product of lust)
And now this rope on my neck stopped all the blood to my head
So, now Salem please save me (Salem please save me)

Wish upon the stars, but they won't save you tonight
God has forsaken thee to hell, we're going to hang from the sky
Feel the weight of the stones crush hard on your chest
Confess, confess before you run short of breath
Confess, confess here for your sins

Burn baby burn
She's a witch, she's a witch and I'm a heretic so, learn
Oh, Abigail how could you do this to us?

Oh, Abigail how could you do this to us?
You were a product of lust (product of lust)
And now this rope on my neck stopped all the blood to my head
So, now Salem please save me (Salem please save me)

"It's not on a ship we'll meet again Abigail
But, in hell..."
I'll see you when we both meet in hell
I say God is dead!
How could you?
When we both meet in hell
