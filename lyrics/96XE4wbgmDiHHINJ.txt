Keep it up keep it up
Don't get lazy on me
Alright
LA follow me follow me
Yeah!
This is ours
We made it with our everything
Something real
As real as it could ever be
You gave me all of yourself
I gave you all of me
Now set it free from yourself for everyone to see

I'm not afraid to let it out
Gonna show you how I feel
I'm not afraid to let it out
Who cares if you don't like it
If you don't like it

Go ahead
You know just what you wanna do
Don't deny
You feel it 'cause I feel it too
Take a look all around
You feel it in the air
From the sky to the ground
I feel it everywhere

I'm not afraid to let it out
Gonna show you how I feel
I'm not afraid to let it out
Who cares if you don't like it

I'm not afraid to let it out
Gonna show you how I feel
I'm not afraid to let it out
To let it out

Who cares if you don't like it
If you don't like it
If you don't like it
Who cares if you don't like it
Who cares if you don't like it
Who cares if you don't like it
Who cares if you don't like it

This is ours
We made it with our everything
Something real
As real as it could ever be
You gave me all of yourself
I gave you all of me
Now set it free from yourself for everyone to see

I'm not afraid to let it out
Gonna show you how I feel
I'm not afraid to let it out
Who cares if you don't like it

I'm not afraid to let it out
Gonna show you how I feel
I'm not afraid to let it out
To let it out
To let it out
Who cares if you don't like it
If you don't like it
If you don't like it
