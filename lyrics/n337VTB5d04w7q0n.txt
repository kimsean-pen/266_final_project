Go!

You could think that I'm a freak
When I'm talking to myself
But it's like I was to weak to be someone else

You can tell that I'm a creep
When I'm singing all alone
But it's like I couldn't see straight
On my own

When I fall it start again
When I fell like I'm just dead
When I go, it comes again
And now I see, see

In my head
there's something that saves me all the time
In myself
It appears when I'm breaking down

Like whisper in my head coming from I don't know where
Like whisper in my head, when I've got something to share
Like a whisper in my head

When I'm unable to speak
It's coming from somebody else
Now I know it is just stronger than myself

That's the way I have to live
Not to fall down every night
In the end I'm not alone
And that's my light

When I fall it start again
When I fell like I'm just dead
When I go, it comes again
And now I see, see

My Head
There's something that saves me all the time
In myself
It appears when I'm breaking down
Like whisper in my head coming from I don't know where
Like whisper in my head, when I've got something to share

You could think that I'm a freak
When I'm talking to myself
But it's like I was too weak to be someone else

You could think that I'm a creep
When I'm singing all alone
But it's like I couldn't see straight
On my own

My Head
There's something that saves me all the time
In myself
It appears when I'm breaking down

Like a whisper in my head
Coming from I don't know where
Like a whisper in my head
When I've got something to share
