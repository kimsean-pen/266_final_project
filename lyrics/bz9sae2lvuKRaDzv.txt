笑い声 失敗恐れ 後ろ振り向けず
そっと着けた 仮面
何もかもを 否定してたんじゃ 求めるものは
そう 見え隠れして 届かなくなる

Believe in yourself
Keep the faith no matter what happens
Whatever trial you might face, don't give up
掲げた拳 強く握りしめ
Get your ass up

There is no correct answer
It's not written anywhere
You can't find it on your TV
Just stare into the darkness

カンジョウ的 シンジョウ
もがき 絡みつく 鎖が
I know, I know it, I can do whatever I want

Raise your flag！
Don't put limitations on yourself

Let's go！！
Make a move！！ Woh oh oh

Believe in yourself
Keep the faith no matter what happens
Whatever trial you might face, don't give up
差し出すその手を そっと掴んだなら
So take your time

I wanna dance with you
Just get crazy to this beat
Let's drink all through the night
Everybody dance with us
Don't be late

Get up now, get up now, Woh oh oh
Hey you guys, make some noise
Are you ready？ Make some noise
1 2 3 Get up now, get up now, Woh oh oh
