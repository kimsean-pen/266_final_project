I rise up from Muspelheim
My fury is sublime
The sword I bring burns violently
With wild and lethal flames
I march against the Asagods
To bring the end of time
I am pure and endless pain
And Surtur is my name

See me rise, the mighty Surt
Destroyer of the universe
Bringer of flames and endless hurt
Scorcher of men and earth

See me rise, the mighty Surt
Destroyer of the universe
Bringer of flames and endless hurt
Scorcher of men and

Swordless Frej with horn in hand
Rises to his final stand
He doesn't stand a single chance
I'll split his living corpse in half
And yet he stabbed me in the eye
He drove the horn in deep
The overwhelming, raging pain
Is driving me insane!

The waves of flames that
I've unleashed will eat us all alive
The rage that burns within my hearth
Is uncontrolled and wild
And now everything shall die!

Massive waves consume us all the ocean is released
Our dying world quakes underneath
And sinks into the sea
And now nothing will survive!

Extinction waits for everyone
For gods and men alike
When all are gone of the old world
A new one will arise

See me rise, the mighty Surt
Destroyer of the universe
Bringer of flames and endless hurt
Scorcher of men and earth

See me rise, the mighty Surt
Destroyer of the universe
Bringer of flames and endless hurt
Scorcher of men and earth

See me die, the mighty Surt
Destroyer of the universe
Drowning in waves that floods the earth
The beginning, of a new rebirth

See me die, the mighty Surt
Destroyer of the universe
Drowning in waves that floods the earth
The beginning, of a new rebirth
