Ch-ch-ch-churchill
Got his lucky number
Tomorrow there's another
Could be me, could be you

No silver spoon
Sticky teeth they rot too soon
You've got to have the best tunes
(Laaaa la laa)
Or that's it
You've blown it

All we want is to be happy
In our homes like happy families
Be the man on the beach with the world at his feet
Yes, it could be you
Oh oh oh

Doo doo doo doo duh hoo
Doo doo doo doo duh hoo

The likely lads (likely lads)
Are picking up the uglies
Yesterday they were just puppies
(Ahhh-ah-ah)
Beery slurs
Now life's a blur
Tele addicts
You should see them at it
Getting in a panic
Will we be there?
Trafalgar square?

All we want is to be happy
In our homes like happy families
Be the man on the beach with the world at his feet
Yes, it could be you

Could be me
Could be you (could be you)
Could be me (could be you)
Could be you (could be you)
Could be me (could be you)
Could be you (could be you)
Could be me! (could be you)
Could be you! (could be you)
Could be me! (could be you)
Could be you! (could be you)
Should be me! (could be you)
Should be me! (could be)

Well don't worry (don't worry)
'f it's not your lucky number
'Cause tomorrow there's another
Could be you, could be me

All we want is to be happy
In our homes like happy families
Be the man on the beach with the world at his feet
Yes, it could be you
Oh oh oh

Doo doo doo doo duh hoo

Doo doo doo doo duh hoo

Doo doo doo doo duh hoo

Doo doo doo doo duh hoo
Ah
