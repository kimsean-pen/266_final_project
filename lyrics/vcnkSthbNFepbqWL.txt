And you're rushing headlong, you've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong, out of control
And you think you're so strong, but there ain't no stopping
And there's nothin' you can do about it
Nothin' you can do
No, there's nothin' you can do about it
No, there's nothin' you can, nothin' you can
Nothin' you can do about it

And you're rushing headlong, you've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong, out of control
And you think you're so strong, but there ain't no stopping
No, there's nothin' you can do about it

Yeah!

Hey, he used to be a man with a stick in his hand
Hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do
She used to be a woman with a hot dog stand
Hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do
Now you've got soup in the laundry bag
Now you've got strings, you're gonna lose your rag
You're gettin' in a fight, then it ain't so groovy
When you're screaming in the night
Let me out of this cheap 'B' movie

Headlong, down the highway and you're rushing
Headlong, out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping and you can't stop rockin'
And there's nothin' you can, nothin' you can
Nothin' you can do about it

When a red hot man meets a white hot lady
Hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do (ho)
Soon the fire starts a raging gets you more than half crazy
Hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do
Oh, now they start freaking everyway you turn
You can't start walking 'cos your feet got burned
It ain't no time to figure wrong from right
'Cause reason's out the window, better hold on tight

You're rushing headlong
Headlong, out of control (Yeah)
You think you're (So strong)
There ain't no stopping and there's nothin' you, nothin' you
Nothin' you can do about it at all

Yeah, yeah
Alright, go!

And you're rushing headlong, down the highway
And you're rushing headlong, out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping
There's nothin', nothin', nothin' you can do about it, yeah

Headlong
(Rushing, rushing)
(Rushing, rushing, rushing, rushing)

Headlong
Headlong

Headlong
Gnoldaeh, gnoldaeh, gnoldaeh, gnoldaeh
