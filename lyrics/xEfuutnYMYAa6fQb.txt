Gravitated towards a taste
For foreign films and modern plays
But that machine could only
Bend to squares five to six times
Before your fingers came unwired...

Weights down so that you could move forwards

Pinch to snub that restless nerve
And knock the wind from one last urge
With two fingers and a rock glass,
Time passed and that was that
Quite a slip (a loosened grasp)

Weights down so that you could move forwards

... what a way to cut lengthwise...
