This time tomorrow we will be free
Looking down on earth
While travelling great speed
Gravity holds us to our seat like glue
From such darkness we'll hold pretty true

You set it alight with your fingertips
As the ice forms around your lips
Try to breathe in

We won't be found
We're headed some place to no one'ss ever been
Let us be guided only be the laster beam
We'll push through clouds
To a million miles of open sea
And on that day I will shout
Look at us now, look at us now

You set it alight with your fingertips
As the ice forms around your lips
Try to breathe in

I'll place this galaxy around your neck
As a souvenir not to forget

This time tomorrow we will be free
Looking down on earth
While travelling great speed
Gravity holds us to our seat like glue
From such darkness we'll hold pretty true
