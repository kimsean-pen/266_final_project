Grey light, new day, leaks through the window
An old soul song comes on the alarm clock radio
We walk the forty blocks to the middle
Of the place we heard that everything would be
And there were barricades to keep us off the street
But the crowd kept pushing forward
'til they swallowed the police

Yeah, they went wild
Yeah, they went wild
Yeah, they went wild
Yeah, they went wild

We left before the dust had time to settle
And all the broken glass swept off the avenue
And on the way home held your camera like a bible
Just wishing so bad that it held some kind of truth
And I stood nervous next to you in the dark room
You dropped the paper in the water
And it all begins to bloom

Yeah, they go wild
Yeah, they go wild
Yeah, they go wild
Yeah, they go wild

And just when I get so lonesome I can't speak
I see some flowers on a hill side
Like a wall of new TV's

Yeah, they go wild
Yeah, they go wild
Yeah, they go wild
Yeah, they go wild
Yeah, they go wild
Yeah, they go wild
Yeah, they go wild
Yeah, they go wild
