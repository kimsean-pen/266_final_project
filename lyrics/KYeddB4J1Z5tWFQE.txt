All the photographs were peeling
And colors turned to gray, he stayed
in his room with memories for days, he faced
an undertow of futures laid to waste, embraced
by the loss of one what he could not replace

There's no reason that she passed
and there is no god with a plan, it's sad
and his loneliness is proof, it's sad
he could only love you, it's sad

The door swings to a passing fable
a fate we may delay, we say
holding on, delivered in our own brace
eleven nights he laid in bed
hoping that dreams will bring her back, it's sad
and his loneliness is proof, it's sad
he could only love you, it's sad

Holding his last breath, believing
he'll make his way
but she's not forgotten
he's haunted
he's searching for escape
If just one wish could bring her back, it's send
and his loneliness is proof, it's sad
he will always love you, it's sad
