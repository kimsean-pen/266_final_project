I gotta make a phone call to my best friends
I gotta let them know that I'm leaving
Everything behind me and politely
I don't wanna hurt their feelings
Oh no, no no

I'll need to come back and I wanna explain
Why I had to leave them sleeping?
The answer's in the air, but I really don't care
'Cos I couldn't really keep on breathing the smoke

And every time, when I painted my room
Like a fool, I hid my feelings
And every time, when I painted my room
I thought about leaving

You roll like a stone girl, you should not stop
And I don't wanna step on your feet
And you do what you do to stay on top
And I don't wanna make you feel incomplete

And every time, when I painted my room
Like a fool, I hid my feelings
And every time, when I painted my room
I thought about leaving

At the end of the day
Don't know what to say
At the end of the day
I'll be flying away
(Flying away)

And every time, when I painted my room
Like a fool, I hid my feelings
And every time, when I painted my room
I thought about leaving, thought about leaving

And every time, when I painted my room
Like a fool, I hid my feelings
And every time, when I painted my room
No, I thought about leaving
(Thought about leaving)
Now that I'm leaving
