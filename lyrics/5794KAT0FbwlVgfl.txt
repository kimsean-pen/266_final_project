I get so caught up in me
That I don't realise what I'm missin'
All of my priorities
Never put you in my plans

Every time we got closer, I pushed you away
Pulled you right back just to give you the pain
If I was your sinner, then you were my saint
Guilty of breaking your heart

I lie here awake, thinking of all the games I played
I let you wait, hundreds of promises that I
(I never made,) I fell forever in a day
('Till you walked away,) because of the words I didn't say

There is no me without you
And you don't realise what you're missin'
This time I'm on something different
Let me show you why, for real

Every time we get close, I won't push you away
Pull you right back just to give you the pain
I won't be a sinner, but you'll be my saint
Guilty of giving my all

I lie here awake, thinking of all the games I played
I let you wait, hundreds of promises that I
(I never made,) I fell forever in a day
('Till you walked away,) because of the words I didn't...

Every time we get close, I won't push you away
Pull you right back just to give you the pain
If I was a sinner, then you are my saint
Guilty of breaking your heart

I-I lie here awake, thinking of all the games I played
I let you wait, hundreds of promises that I
(I never made,) I fell forever in a day
('Till you walked away,) because of the words I didn't

See, I can't live without you, I hope you forgive it
A world without you is a world without living
I can't live without you, I hope you forgive it
A world without you is a world without living
I can't live without you, I hope you forgive it
A world without you is a world without living
I can't live without you, I hope you forgive it
A world without you...
