The Sun beats down
Crushing me below its bounding weight
Save me now
Everything is lost inside the storm

I, burn from the inside out
I, look from the inside out

I've come undone, beneath the sun
I'm not the same
When all is lost, at any cost
Don't fade away

The sky falls down
Cutting out the headstones made of sand
Save me now
Lead me from the temptations of man

I, burn from the inside out
I, look from the inside out

I've come undone, beneath the sun
I'm not the same
When all is lost, at any cost
Don't fade away

I'm burning inside
There's no place left to hide
The world I once knew
Has been turned to ashes
(Turn and run forever) I'm burning inside
(We never) There's no place left to hide
(On and on the world must burn)
(And as the ashes we return to dust)

I've come undone, beneath the sun
I'm not the same
When all is lost, at any cost
Don't fade away
