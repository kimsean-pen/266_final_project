The sun is gone, now it's dark in the city
Human shapes are following me
It's not safe to be walking alone
But I am fearless and unreachable
A forest, the middle of the night
It got cold in the blink of an eye
It is insane to be here on my own
But I am calm and invincible

The only danger I fear
Is hidden inside of me
I might be strong but I lose my grip
When it tries to destroy me

The only danger I fear
Is hidden inside of me
I might be strong but I lost my grip
Trying to destroy it

The night is young, I am sleeping alone
There are footsteps coming down the hall
I'm being watched, I'm being hunted
But I am bold, and I'm not afraid
A basement, it's too dark to see
There may be spiders crawling around me
I'm being trapped, I'm being tortured,
But I am brave and unbeatable

The only danger I fear
Is hidden inside of me
I might be strong but I lose my grip
When it tries to destroy me

The only danger I fear
Is hidden inside of me
I might be strong but I lost my grip
Trying to destroy it

The only danger I fear
Is hidden inside of me
I might be strong but I lose my grip
When it tries to destroy me

The only danger I fear
Is hidden inside of me
I might be strong but I lost my grip
Trying to destroy it
