Blue, blue morning in a satellite town
On the radio they're talking about
A civil war and a missing child
I've got my coffee and I'm running out

I dial your number and I let it ring
There's just no answer to anything
I woke up hollow as an apple core
I've got so much purpose, I don't know what for

I've got a 21st century heartbeat
It's a dying voice, it still haunts me
21st century heartbeat holding on

Blue, grey morning in a satellite town
I've got my head securely in the cloud
I'm not myself and I don't know what's changed
It's so familiar but it's all so strange

I've got a 21st century heartbeat
It's a dying voice, it still haunts me
21st century heartbeat holding on

Oh I see a figure in the mirror
That I just don't recognize
Oh I know I was sleeping while believing
There was life on the other side
There's a melody fading while I'm waiting
But I daren't open up my eyes, my eyes

I've got a 21st century heartbeat
It's a dying voice, it still haunts me
21st century heartbeat holding on

21st century heartbeat
I can't help it, it all haunts me
21st century heartbeat holding on
