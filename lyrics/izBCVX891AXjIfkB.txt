He's a wild horse, I'll ride him good
Tame the motherfucker
He's a wild one, of course he will
Fall into me like a baby

He's a lost soul, I feel his void
Save the motherfucker
He's a lost one, of course he will
Melt through my hands like butter
Ooh, ooh

I got mummy eyes, I got mummy arms
And I'm on my heart
He falls asleep on my chest and
He comes all over my prey

What do I do with someone like you
He looks so good when he don't know what to do
I can't help but wrap my legs around him
I can't help it
I've been carrying men way too long, babe
