It was a close call,
Sitting in the back of the room with the boy ...get on
But they didn't know,
Close in on my black eye
I feel safe at times
Certain emblems
Tell me it's time

Serpents in my mind, looking for your crimes
Everything changes
I don't want mine to this time

You enjoy sucking on dreams,
So I will fall asleep With someone other than you
I had a thought, you would take me seriously,
And listen on

Serpents in my mind,
I am searching for your crimes
Everything changes
In time
You'll stay frozen in time
Collagen girls
Controling minds
You hold the mirror well
To everybody else

Serpents in my mind
Trying to forgive your crimes
Everyone changes, in time
I hope he changes this time
