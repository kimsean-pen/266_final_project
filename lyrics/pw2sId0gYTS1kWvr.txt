Spilled our hearts our souls until it forced us to swim but all the water pass
Was sinking fast
Gave our all until the saw was digging in
I watch it bleed
I let it be

Made me have to throw the looking glass
You You
Made it cold and made my summer pass
You You

The moon the dust the dreams the rust are shattered now
I let them pass
I let them dance
Stolen time the crooked line is pointing up
Were stars away blazing

Made me have to throw the looking glass
You You
Made it cold and made my summer pass
You You
