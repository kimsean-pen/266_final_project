I'm not irrational
I'm just no longer in the daydream
Of the delusion that
Once was held between us

Lately I'm in between
Being steady or a headcase
What's become of us now
Hanging our hearts in disgrace

What did I do
To make you so cruel
I've got this ache inside my heart
I know that it's you
What should I do now that
I know that we're doomed
I loved you most
Now you're a ghost
I walk right through

Oh remember when you said
That I was sick inside the head
I'm just halfway there
My common sense hanging by a thread
I'm bad on the outside
But a coward at heart
The taste of salt in my mouth
My voice is silent but my thoughts are loud

What did I do
To make you so cruel
I've got this ache inside my heart
I know that it's you
What should I do now that
I know that we're doomed
I loved you most
Now you're a ghost
I walk right through
