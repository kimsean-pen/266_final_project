Lies - and you fill their souls
With all oppressions of this world
And all the glory you receive
So, what makes you supreme?
Lies - and your crown is falling
I offer fantasy
And you, Creator
Blind with envy

So let the children come to me
Their mother loves me, so shall they
Woman, bleeding, ate my gifts
Man was close behind
Just like a snake, I'm slithering
Through my world divine
And like the cat I'm stalking
I'll take your soul
And you'll be like me
In emptiness

Bow to me faithfully
Bow to me splendidly
