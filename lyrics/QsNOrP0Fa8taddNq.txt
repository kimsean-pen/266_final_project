Sunrise blinded by the morning light
Already dreaming of tonight
-night, -night, -night, -night, -night, -night

And I know that it won't be long
Oh, we can't hide
From a love that burns this strong

But it's just you and me
And we chase our shadows
We're waiting for, just waiting for
The sun to go down
But until it does
We'll chase our shadows
And when the night comes
We will run from nothing, my love

But it's just you and me
And we chase our shadows
We're waiting for, just waiting for
The sun to go down
But until it does
We'll chase our shadows
And when the night comes
We will run from nothing, my love

Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my...

Night time
And I am back in your arms
Where all my dreams are brought to life
Life, life, life, life, life, life

And I know that it won't be long
Oh, we can't hide
From a love that burns this strong

But it's just you and me
And we chase our shadows
We're waiting for, just waiting for
The sun to go down
But until it does
We'll chase our shadows
And when the night comes
We will run from nothing, my love

But it's just you and me
And we chase our shadows
We're waiting for, just waiting for
The sun to go down
But until it does
We'll chase our shadows
And when the night comes
We will run from nothing, my love

Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
