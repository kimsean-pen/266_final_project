I awoke to a complex chemistry
So, I went to a neuro-surgeon inquisitively to see what she could see
But she only knows what she's taught
So I turned to a tree to see what he thought

And he asked, "When does three equal one plus one?"
The answer is birth â€“ life's creation
Then suddenly flames rushed past
Green turned to black, and life turned to ash

Because I believe in everything, I'm convinced of nothing
United we ran, divided we crawl
It just takes a common enemy to make a friend
Marry hope and fear, invent a color

And so, it's gone as quickly as it came
Raging tides galloped forth to extinguish the flames
And, thus, was born a cloud above
But all else was gone, and one plus one equaled one

Because I believe in everything, I'm convinced of nothing
United we ran, divided we crawl
It just takes a common enemy to make a friend
In harmony with gravity, always bring everything down

Tear out your mother-tongue
Chlorpromazine incursion

Flesh is food and bone is stone
A grey matter case for inner demons microphones
Fields of shells that lurk in murky waters
A bed of nails for less traumatic slumber

Logic's taught but brains are sweet
We've served ours up for the demons to feed
Project loathsome apathy redefines reality

Paranoid self-victimization in a cage of skin rage
And intimidating lack of control
Bring a once bright life to stone and ice
The rights of the voiceless will be revealed
