The day will come when we sacrifice
Lay your self down
Face the throne with starry eyes
When fear is king
and despair is a tyrant
Will you rise?
Say you will

Never fear for your life
We are drawn out, we are drawn out
Never fear for your life
We are drawn out by the light

Don't you hear the truth
as it whispers to you?
Our trust has been abused
decide if you need their fright
What do you want?

They come for our life
when we sleep
Gripping fear
Come into the light
Shining through the violence
a shattering glare
draws me in
Come out of the night.
