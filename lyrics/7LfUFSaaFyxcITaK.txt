Well, I see 'em every night in tight blue jeans
In the pages of a Blueboy magazine

Hey, hey I've been thinking of a new sensation
I'm picking up good vibrations
Oop, she bop, she bop
Do I wanna go out with a lion's roar?

Yeah, I wanna go south and get me some more

Hey, they say that a stitch in time saves nine
They say I better stop or I'll go blind
Oop, she bop, she bop
She bop, he bop, we bop

I bop, you bop, they bop

Be bop, be bop, a lu bop
I hope He will understand
She bop, he bop, we bop
I bop, you bop, they bop

Be bop, be bop, a lu she bop
Ohhh, she do, she bop
Hey, hey they say I better get a chaperone (Ha ha ha)
Because I can't stop messin' with the danger zone

Hey, hey I won't worry and I won't fret
Ain't no law against it yet
Oop, she bop, she bop
She bop, he bop, we bop

I bop, you bop, they bop

Be bop, be bop, a lu bop
I hope He will understand
She bop, he bop, we bop
I bop, you bop, they bop

Be bop, be bop, a lu she bop
Ohhh, she do, she bop, she bop
She bop, he bop, we bop
I bop, you bop, they bop
Be bop, be bop, a lu bop
I hope He will understand
She bop, he bop, we bop
I bop, you bop, they bop
Be bop, be bop, a lu she bop
Ohhh, she did it, she bop
Ohhh, she did it, she bop
