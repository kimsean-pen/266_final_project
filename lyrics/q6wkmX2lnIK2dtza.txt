He comes up and
He comes and he will
He comes to show me love

He comes for me here
He comes and he kills
But all is in the name of love

On golden hills
On sleeping pills
I beg to learn the way above

Show me love less than
Show me love less than
Show me love less than
Show me love

He came in here
He showed me his will
He did until the day was done

He came to me
He came here to kill
He said I was the only one

On my night meds
On my deathbed
I begged for him to be above

Show me love less than
Show me love less than
Show me love less, love less, love less

Don't you say everything is alright
So far behind your eyes
I see every lie
In dreams I die, in dreams I die, in dreams I die
I dream of golden places
Our shining faces
Our endless waste
And your boundless taste

Show me love less then
Show me love less than
Show me love less than
Show me when

Show me when
These arms are open
Show me when
Those arms are open

Show me love less than
Show me love less than
Show me love less than
Show me love
