Theres a fire in the house
and we're burning all the wood
that we cut from a tree
that fell into the yard
in the middle of the winter
and we wanna be a little bit warmer
than we were last year.

If I go on too long
would you meet me in the middle
and I really wanna feel it
and if you could ever even return my calls,
it'd be a little bit better than the typical weather.
