My circuits have blown
I know it's self imposed
And all I have shared
And all I have loved
Is all I'll ever own

But something has changed
I feel so alive
My life just blew up
I'd give it all up
I'll depressurise

Aahh
Ten thousand miles left on the road
Aahh
Five hundred hours until I am home
I need something human
Human, human, human

Let's face all our fears
Come out of the shade
Let's burn all the money
Absolve all the lies
And wake up unscathed

The big picture's gone
Replaced with visions of you
Now life can begin
I've cleansed all my sins
I'm about to break through

Aahh
Five thousand miles left on the road
Aahh
Two hundred hours until I am home

I need something human
Human, human, human
And I need the touch
And something human, human

Aahh
Less than a mile left on the road
Aahh
I will be crawling through your door

I need something human
Human, human, human
And I need your love
And something human, human.
