I ain't saying more than you've been told
Got high on information bought and sold
I need a window where I won't get fooled again

So you wonder where the world has gone
A sad heart feeling on a setting sun
Get in line with the rest for your daily bread

Crossed hearts and immoral lies
Genuflecting all the ones you despise
Three Bulleits in the morning sun
Dust clouds gonna cover everyone

I said hey hey
Come on come on

I paid silver at the wailing wall
Received no answer but I heard you calling
There ain't never be a right when it's all so wrong

Crossed hearts and immoral lies
Genuflecting all the ones you despise
Three Bulleits in the morning sun
Dust clouds gonna cover everyone

I said hey hey
Come on come on

If it's all you know then it's all you get
Pretty vacant when I'm watching
Now a heavy soul need a time to dance
Pretty sacred when I'm searching

Crossed hearts and immoral lies
Genuflecting all the ones you despise
Three Bulleits in the morning sun
Dust clouds gonna cover everyone

I said hey hey
Come on come on

If it's all you know then it's all you get
Pretty vacant when I'm watching
Now a heavy soul need a time to dance
Pretty sacred when I'm searching
