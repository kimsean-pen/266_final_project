We are bored, we are married, we are young
On the edge of the city, the edge of Ambrosia
Rolls upon, rolls upon, rolls upon the tongue

A certain party, a certain cul-de-sac
A certain outcome, a certain piece of me
Car keys, choose your keys, car keys, choose your keys

Outside alone crossing a perfect lawn
Ah, could it be you? Could it be you?
Could it be you or could it be, this is what freedom is?
We are brief encounters, we all lose our keys

We all choose our partners, we all choose our keys
Car keys, choose your keys, car keys, choose your keys
Pull back, pull back into the drive

Rigid in the matrimonial superking bed
Pretend to sleep, pretend to sleep, come on pretend
Yeah, let's pretend, yeah, let's pretend, yeah
We are brief encounters, we all lose our keys
We all choose our partners, we all choose our keys
Car keys, choose your keys, car keys, choose your keys
Car keys, choose your keys, car keys, choose your keys
Car keys, choose your keys, car keys, choose your keys
