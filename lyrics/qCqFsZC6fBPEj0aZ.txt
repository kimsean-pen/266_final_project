I get romantic when my blood turns into alcohol
Killer, killer
Our love's a natural disaster, it's an act of God
Killer, killer

Killer, killer, killer, killer
Killer, killer, killer

I just want you to stay naked all day
Show me why you'll be mine
Wanting more late
I say, ooh, baby, kill 'em, ooh, ooh, baby, kill 'em
Killer, killer

When I'm watching you get ready for work
I pretend it's a striptease in reverse
I say, ooh, baby, kill 'em, ooh, ooh, baby, kill 'em
Killer, killer

I got addicted to your kiss
It was a gateway drug
Killer, killer
My heart's in critical condition
When we're making love
Killer, killer

Killer, killer, killer, killer
Killer, killer, killer

I just want you to stay naked all day
Show me why you'll be mine
Wanting more late
I say, ooh, baby, kill 'em, ooh, ooh, baby, kill 'em
Killer, killer

When I'm watching you get ready for work
I pretend it's a striptease in reverse
I say, ooh, baby, kill 'em, ooh, ooh, baby, kill 'em
Killer, killer

We ain't sleepin' all night
We ain't sleepin' all night, no
We ain't sleepin' all night
Killer, killer, killer

Killer, killer, killer, killer
Killer, killer, killer
