I don't need you like you think I do, I just want you here tonight
I know it might sound crazy, but my head it just don't feel right
I miss your bones buried beneath my sheets, my voice shakes when I try to speak
Your name is stitched into my teeth and every time I talk, I feel you there

Every night the floorboards creak outside my bedroom door
Eighteen months of losing sleep because your ghost has been pacing in the hall
I know they say time heals all wounds, but when will it heal mine?
'Cause I'm sick of waiting for you to bring me back my peace of mind

I still miss you, like the moon misses the warm kiss of the sun
When the earth dances between them and steals away it's love
I asked how long you'd be gone and you said, as long as it takes
And I was always so impatient with our love, but I swore I'd wait

I'm tired of living in the fear that one day you'll come back
And after all these years
I won't be able to look you in the face and say "I've let you go"
'Cause yours is the only love I've ever known

I'm tired of living in the fear that one day you'll come back
And after all these years
I won't be able to look you in the face and say "I've let you go"
'Cause yours is the only love I've ever known

'Cause yours is the only love I've ever known
'Cause yours is the only love I've ever known
