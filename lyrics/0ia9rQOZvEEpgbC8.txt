There's a girl that wants to start
Been thinking about having a couple of kids
Comb a brush around their heads in the morning
To be needed, simply and be needing
Her name is Karen
Been on the road for so long
She wants to live in a place that has a number in a name
Find lovers and anchor before the courage is gone

She really loves him, Prescilla
She really loves him, Prescilla
She really loves him, I tell you
She really loves him, Prescilla
She really loves him, Prescilla
She really loves him, I tell you

To live life outside of the world
To break the cross that bears her name
She's not your queen anymore, queen of the highway
Needs something better than learning away

She really loves him, Prescilla
She really loves him, Prescilla
She really loves him, I tell you
She really loves him, Prescilla
She really loves him, Prescilla
She really loves him, I tell you

Gone away
Queen of the Highway
Gone away
Hide away
Queen of the Highway
Gone away
