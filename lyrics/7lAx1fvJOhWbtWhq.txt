We've been spinning, a thread of possibilities
My first sister knows, how to make this web grow
Oh, and the second one, when the time has come
She will cut the thread

Then we're back at the place, where it once begun
It must have been a lonely one

We've been weeping, while we were weaving, oh
And we're dreaming of a future for ourselves, oh
We've been spinning, biting and gnawing, oh
While we're dreaming it again and again, and again

Past present, the future lost, we're Seeking
The rapture, we have been so focused on our cage
We're bound in our places, bound in our ways so
No one ever told us we could run away

We've been weeping, while we were weaving, oh
And we're dreaming of a future for ourselves, oh
We've been spinning, biting and gnawing, oh
While we're dreaming it again and again and again

Dust in our mouths there's mud in our veins and
Time is but a lie as long as we remain here
Bound in our ways, we're bound in our places
No one ever told us it would be this way

Cut our bindings, clawed out promises, oh
Feed our freedom, we're running from wolves
Cut our bindings, clawed out promises, oh
Feed our freedom, we're running from wolves

Cut our bindings, clawed out promises, oh
Feed our freedom, we're running from wolves
Cut our bindings, clawed out promises, oh
Feed our freedom, we're running from wolves

Cut our bindings, clawed out promises, oh
Feed our freedom, we're running from wolves
Cut our bindings, clawed out promises, oh
Feed our freedom, we're running from wolves
