It's 2 am, in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
Cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back
Wish I never had hung up the phone like I did
I wish you would know that I never forget you as long as I'm living
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good, I wish you would

It's 2 am, in my room
Headlights pass, the window pane, I think of you
We were a crooked love, in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
Then it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never had hung up the phone like I did
I wish you would know that I never forget you as long as I'm living
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good, I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
I wish you know that I miss too much to be mad anymore
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good, I wish you would

You always knew how push my buttons
You gave me everything and nothing
This mad mad love makes you come running
Stand back where you stood

I Wish You Would

2am here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We were a crooked love
In a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never had hung up the phone like I did
I wish you would know that I never forget you as long as I'm living
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good, I wish you would

I wish you would come back
Wish I never had hung up the phone like I did
I wish you would know that I never forget you as long as I'm living
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good, I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
I wish you know that I miss too much to be mad anymore
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good, I wish you would

You always knew how push my buttons
You gave me everything and nothing
This mad mad love makes you come running
Stand back where you stood

I Wish You Would
