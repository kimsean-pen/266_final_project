Look at me, look at me
Trying to get a hug out of sleeping in your t-shirt
He's not you, she's not me
And every time we see each other
We wish we had said something first
I think we both should've said

Hey, I know we had our ups and downs
Smiles and frowns but you're not all bad
And I don't think I'm better than you
I know sometimes I act like I do
I count to 10 and give up at 2

I count to 10 and give up at 2
Look at you, look at you
Trying to make it look like nothing ever happened
It's not new, it's just me
And every time you say that
You bring me to my limits again

Instead we both should've said
Hey, I know we had our ups and downs
Smiles and frowns but you're not all bad
And I don't think I'm better than you
I know sometimes I act like I do

I count to 10 and give up at 2
I count to 10 and give up at 2
So much that we could've said
So much that we never said

Too proud and angry instead
So much that we never said
Hey, I know we had our ups and downs
Smiles and frowns but you're not all bad
And I don't think I'm better than you
I know sometimes I act like I do
I count to 10 and give up at 2
I count to 10 and give up at 2
