Look at the pretty girl, Rocking the summer dress.
Look at the boy with the working tan, stealing another kiss.
Look at the way they're laughing
All happy and in love.
So wrapped up in each other, Can't see the rest of us.

Don't you just hate those people?
Don't they make you wanna scream?
Listen to em' baby talkin'. Oh ain't that sweet.?
It can really cut right through ya, the way they carry on.
Don't you just hate those people, when you're alone.

When your heart is broken, you feel like the only one.
There's a million others, holding hands. Where do they all come from?
Every coffee table, Every movie, every car
They want the whole wide world to know
How in love they are!

Don't you just hate those people?
Don't they make you wanna scream?
Listen to em' baby talkin'. Oh ain't that sweet.?
It can really cut right through ya, the way they carry on.
Don't you just hate those people, when you're alone.

Someday I'll fall back in love, and i'll be one of them!
Missing you's and Love you too's, but until then.

Don't you just hate those people?
Don't they make you wanna scream?
Listen to em' baby talkin'. Oh ain't that sweet.?
It can really cut right through ya, the way they carry on.
Don't you just hate those people, I mean really really hate those people!
Don't you just hate those people, when you're alone.

Oh when you're alone.
