a tearin' after me

but still you did not flee
i was too weak i couldn't move
held by growth of a tree

i did not die jus' badly broken
an' in time my healin' it will come yeah
by the words that he has spoken
i fell upon that rock

who is it now that loves you
straight in the front door
an' crooked out the back yeah
what is it now you're a slave to
on your knees out in your shack

i fell upon that rock yeah
he's beyond the shadow
of your doubt an' mine
he's no man's opinion
he is truth divine
