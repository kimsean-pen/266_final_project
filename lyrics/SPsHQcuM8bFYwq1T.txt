Cycle down in the belly of the ocean
Why'd he ever notice it as sucking up?
Rise up and soundly state
That everything else in this world can be broken

When the scalding flow closes the distance
Up from the thermal vent seeping out
Your tiny vengeful life might pass through my mind
But I blink and it's over

It's coming
Wait for it
We're done here
No contest
All of a sudden
Your body and soul
Will call on a grave
You've been avoiding

This city
Your culture
Your modern
Day suffering
Is over
So what if
I love it
I can't help it
That's all

Several times in the glimpse of our intentions
I turned the stone and found a brand new light
I can form no more words as I cannot dare see no drama washing me over

Will someone measure this moron now?
I'm back again in this one light town
I cut the tie and I don't have to rely on nothing, n-no more

It's coming
Wait for it
We're done here
No contest
All of a sudden
Your body and soul
Will call on a grave
You've been avoiding

This city
Your culture
Your modern
Day suffering
Is over
So what if
I love it
I can't help it
That's all
