"Ladies and gentlemen, lions, tigers and bears
Giraffes, sea urchins, alligators and all that shit
I am Jazze Phenzel Burgandy Obama Luther King Jr. Jackson 5 the First
And I'd like to introduce to you Block Hemzell, AKA BLOCKHAMPTON!
Oh, boy—ladies and gentlemen!"

My hands up, I let go, my mouth is gettin' cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is gettin' cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

32 hundred on the jacket like Magic Johnson
Got a couple chains off Slauson
Silhouette lookin' like Charlie's Angels
I loose up with a drip of sangria
Wipe that, smirk life ain't that serious
Love when you're double bunned up, like Leia
Make me wanna check my blood pressure
Am I bein' too obvious?
I got a crush, it's nothing else
I swear, it's nothing else
Wake up, feelin' like Adriana Lima
Wavin' my feet, yo, right up out the Beamer
Do my dance like, "Ooh, la, la!"
When she strut like, "Oh my God!"
Make me sweat like exercise
Double up, milkshake and fries

I heard a call from the mountain top: "Joba!"
So I put my cloak on and I walked
Coined a peasant in the grasslands with a wand
Cast my spells with some peasants, now we roam
We left our shanties in the village with nowhere to go
Just a group of outcasts with the gift of hope
Well, now we're eatin' grapes, and the finest cheese
Achievin' wisdom from the wizards we were tryin' to be
Now other people from my village want to come with me
The thing with magic is you cannot have it if you don't believe
You did not believe, they did not believe
You can't tell me things, this was all foreseen, you're not one with me
I bought a horse with the shillings that you took and then gave back to me
I met the queen that you praise so much, she's into me
I bought a castle in the Shire with the moat and the catapult
I keep it clean with my medieval flow

My hands up, I let go, my mouth is gettin' cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is gettin' cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Martin had a dream for a nigga like me, to show up like this
Why you gotta hate? Lookin' at my pace
With your face screwed; hope it get stuck like this
Never even cared to appear or adhere my career
Trust me, you don't gotta touch my shit
Pullin' every card out the cuff, no bluff is enough to discuss
I won't be the one to rush that shift, couldn't crush my gift
Even if I'm in a thousand pieces, listenin' to menaces that pledge allegiance
To my every weakness, why they spreadin' secrets?
Called my dreams facetious, bet they can't believe this
Or they act like the world shoulda knew about me
All I know is they wanted to move without me
How they used to doubt me, but you can't renounce me
Like la, la, la, la

Ain't no pressure, oh, no
We ain't got no money, no lie
I ain't gonna rush it, no lie
Straight to the fire, right till you move on
We ain't got no money, no lie
I ain't gonna rush it, no lie
Ain't no pressure, oh, no
We ain't got no money, no lie
I ain't gonna rush it, no lie
Straight to the fire, right till you move on
We ain't got no money, no lie
I ain't gonna rush it, no lie (Whoop!)

My hands up, I let go, my mouth is gettin' cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is gettin' cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la, la, la, la
