Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room you know you made my eyes burn
It was like, James Dean, for sure
You're so fresh to death and sick as cancer

You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
But you fit me better than my favourite sweater and I know
That love is mean, and love hurts
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh baby!

I will love you till the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears?

Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, oh baby
Say you'll remember, oh baby, ooh
I will love you till the end of time

Big dreams, gangsta
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like, no please, stay here
We don't need no money, we can make it all work

But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waitin', anticipatin' and pacin'
But he was chasing (uh oh) paper (uh oh)
Caught up in the game, that was the last I heard

I will love you till the end of time
I would wait a milion years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears?

Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, oh baby
Say you'll remember, oh baby, ooh
I will love you till the end of time

You went out every night
And baby that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did
I'd be by your side

'Cause Ima ride or die
Whether you fail or fly
Well, shit, at least you tried
But when you walked out that door

A piece of me died
I told you I wanted more
That's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before

We were dancin' all night
Then they took you away
Stole you out of my life
You just need to remember...

I will love you till the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears?

Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, oh baby
Say you'll remember, oh baby, ooh
I will love you till the end of time
