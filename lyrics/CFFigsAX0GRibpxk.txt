Been sick for a while
Take pills to catch my grip
What is my desire
I choke cuz air is too thick
I'm thin like a cage
Not long before I break
Sick like a dog
Take shots to kill the switch

Something's got to give
Something's got to give
Something's got to give
Something's got to give

This guilt is a problem
You're the ghost of my problem
This hate is a problem
You're the ghost of my problem
This [?] is a problem
You're the ghost of my problem
This head is a problem
You're the ghost of my problem

Something's got to give
Something's got to give
Something's got to give
Something's got to give
Something's got to give
Something's got to give
Something's got to give
Something's got to give

This knife like a father
Hunt you down, turn you off to be stronger
This knife like a father
Hunt you down, turn you off to be stronger
This knife like a father
Hunt you down, turn you off to be stronger
This knife like a father
Hunt you down, turn you off to be stronger

This knife like a father
Hunt you down, turn you off to be stronger
This knife like a father
Hunt you down, turn you off to be stronger
