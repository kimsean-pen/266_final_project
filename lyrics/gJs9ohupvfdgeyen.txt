She was too good to me
how can I get along now.
So close she stood to me
everything seems so wrong now.

She would have brought me the sun
making me smile
that was her fun.

When I was mean to her
she never said go away now.
I was a king to her
who's gonna make me gay now?
It's only natural
I'm so blue.
She was too good to be true.
