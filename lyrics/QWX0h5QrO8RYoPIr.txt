Engraved in stone, we've been dethroned
No longer the kings and queens
We've become outgrown
As I roam through eternity I let go of control

Another day, another night, pass me by
My uncertainty always comes to light
I build my walls up to leave out the rest
Always coming out on the other side with even less

We are what takes our time, so take all of mine
We have become outgrown

I thought I'd live a thousand lives before I'd ever feel this way
The night can't last forever
And we're running out of days
This feeling is here to stay, tear me away

I build my walls up to leave out the rest
Always coming out on the other side with even less
In my rise, I will not falter
In my rise, I will never stop

Constantly pushing myself beyond unrest, the only constant becomes a mess
A question can never be the answer
Celestial floods, with every step
I would lose everything, to see you live on

I thought I'd live a thousand lives before I'd ever feel this way
The night can't last forever
And we're running out of days
This feeling is here to stay, tear me away

I'll burn so bright, forget about the night
I'll burn so bright, remember me when I am gone

Celestial floods, with every step

The luster loses its shine
I'll never lose mine, I'll never lose mine
