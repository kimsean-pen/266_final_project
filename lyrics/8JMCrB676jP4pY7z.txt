Hurt so bad
You don't come around here anymore
Worse than that
Nothing's really helping, I've been thinking
'Bout drinking again

It's alright
If you finally stop caring
Just don't go and tell someone that does
Cause even though I know there's hope in
Every morning song
I have to find that melody alone

Her name became
The flame unto the fire
A magpie on a wire, one of those
Dead unto the high
Shamelessly alive unto the low

It's alright
If you finally stop caring
Just don't go and tell someone that does

Cause even though I know there's hope in
Every morning song
I have to find that melody alone

We can go ahead
If no one notices
What's the point of it?
I have to ask

How you learn to see
Hope eternally
When you're sure to be
Oh, leaving last

Hurt so bad
More than I expected that it would
Worse than that
It seems to be lasting just a little
Longer than it should

It's alright
If you finally stop caring
Just don't go and tell someone that does
Cause even though I know there's hope in

Every morning song
I have to find that melody alone
(I have to find that melody alone)
I have to find that melody alone

(I have to find that melody alone)
I have to find that melody alone
(I have to find that melody alone)
I have to find that melody alone

(I have to find that melody alone)
I have to sing
The melody alone
