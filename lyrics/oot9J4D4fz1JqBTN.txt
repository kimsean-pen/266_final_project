"How'd it die?"
We broke its neck
We raised it to the power of ten
Gurre-Lieder
They cheered my name
No punches thrown
Their joy
My shame

Nobody wanted to be
"Vienna II"
Someone had to be
"How'd it die?"
We broke its neck
We raised it to the power of ten
Gurre-Lieder
They cheered my name
No punches thrown
Their joy
My shame

Nobody wanted to be
"Vienna II"
Someone had to be
Nobody wanted to be
"Vienna II"
Someone had to be
"Vienna II"
So I let it be
"Vienna II"
Let it be me
