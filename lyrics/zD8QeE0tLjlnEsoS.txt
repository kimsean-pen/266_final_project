End me
I seek beyond the limits of fate
Fate veins,
veins.
Fate veins,
veins.
I am long gone from paradise
Getting everywhere but nowhere
I need to dig two graves
Carve one stone the air to share
Fear is the tongue of human
Freedom becomes my sin
I seek beyond the limits of fate
I am my own anxiety
Our thoughts turned out twisted minds
Find a way to get along
Get away to find amongst
I am long gone from paradise
Getting everywhere but nowhere
Gaps and cracks I couldn't see
In the wild endless ocean ahead of me
I'd let the sun breathe me in shelter my true fear
Burnt enslaves in my own frame
I'm bursting out of my seams
I seek
Be...
Beyond...
The

The Limits of
Fate
veins
I am my own anxiety
Our thoughts turned out
twisted minds
Find a way to get along
Get away to find amongst
Find a way to get along
Get away to find amongst
Hollow earth
The core i seek
The end of me
How could there be nobody
to help me at the end of me?
