Whoa yeah!

1, 2, 3, 40 and the thrill of the bright sweet night is a question of you.
Tryin' to be kickin' ass to help me out
After all you know I never wanna go

Before I go high, I'm very down
The only bottle left to drink, again and again

You know I can't go the other way without being trashed lost and strungout
Why do I slice them out?
When together try something, drug you question me
Whats to coming out?

Before I go high, I'm very down
The only bottle left to drink, again and again

Come on!

Maybe I set my tracks to my life
What the fk have I done to you
And the trashed people askin' my head until I sweat
Now tell me what the fk to do!

One day I gettin to the point where I aint gonna do
Nothing but try to be strungout on you
You let me drown way deep down below
For the fleeting past to let go
Went to the end to raise like a battering ram
Lookin' at my own reflection
Forever I saw him kissin' you goodbye
To kill my soul addiction

Before I walk I need the ground
You know me poor, I never return
Up yours and next you tell me "fking whore"
The only bottle left to drink, before I go!
One day I gettin to the point where I aint gonna do
Nothing but try to be strungout on you
You let me drown way deep down below
For the fleeting past to let go
Went to the end to raise like a battering ram
Lookin' at my own reflection
Forever I saw him kissin' you goodbye
To kill my soul addiction
