Judge give me life this mornin'
Down on Parchman farm
Judge give me life this mornin'
Down on Parchman farm
I wouldn't hate it so bad
But I left my wife in mourn

Oh, goodbye wife
All you have done gone
Oh, goodbye wife
All you have done gone
But I hope some day
You will hear my lonesome song

Oh, listen you men
I don't mean no harm
Oh, listen you men
I don't mean no harm
If you wanna do good
You better stay off old Parchman farm

We got to work in the mornin'
Just at dawn of day
We got to work in the mornin'
Just at dawn of day
Just at the settin' of the sun
That's when the work is done

I'm down on Parchman farm
I sho' wanna go back home
I'm down on Parchman farm
But I sho' wanna go back home
But I hope some day
I will overcome
