You said you,
You dont want me,
And I said I,
Dont mind at all,
I just want you to go 'cause I don't need to know,
If it looks like it'll work out for me
I, I will be on my way
I don't want to go
If you are gonna to stay
I'm standing outside of your house, it's pretty dark out,
Today there's light,
It's pretty cold though,
I just need you right here to hold me at your side,
If this life don't work out for me,
I, I will be on my way,
I don't want to go,
If you are going to stay,
Ooooohhhh
Ooooohhhh
Ooooohhhh
