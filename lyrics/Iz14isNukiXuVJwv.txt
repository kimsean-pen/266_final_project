One way for playing it true
One heart for doing it through
Who cares what, who
Let's go out wondering

We'll spend the whole day through
Doing how we wanna do
I as I and you as you
How any other?

When the morning gets back in your eye

How about we break all the rules
About the play it cool
Pull the thread till we've emptied the spool
From all this livin'

When the morning gets back in your eye
