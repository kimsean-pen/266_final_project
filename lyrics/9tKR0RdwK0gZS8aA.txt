Okay
Let's go

I am like obsessed, I'm drowning in your eyes
It feels like I've been blessed
Cuz you're like paradise
And when we're both undressed
I'm almost paralyzed, paralyzed, paralyzed...
I need you, you're the best
With us there is no stress
No need for other guys with you the time flies
You got a place to rest and that's between my thighs
I press against your chest and then I realize

If I look dope when I make music, maybe my music will sound like dope
If I'm also on dope when I make music, maybe my music will sound like dope
If I look dope when I make music, maybe my music will sound like dope
If I'm also on dope when I make music, maybe my music will sound like dope

I'll never feel alone even when I'm stressed and stoned
You're the best I've ever known
We are in the same zone
You're like a cannonball
You're above em' all
You'll be the one I call when I'm 'bout to fall

If I look dope when I make music, maybe my music will sound like dope
If I'm also on dope when I make music, maybe my music will sound like dope
If I look dope when I make music, maybe my music will sound like dope
If I'm also on dope when I make music, maybe my music will sound like dope

You're so sweet, you're my lil cupcake
You're so bad make me sweat fuck sake
You're so sweet always make me blush
You're so bad givin me the best rush

You're so sweet, you're my lil cupcake
You're so bad make me sweat fuck sake
You're so sweet always make me blush
You're so bad givin me the best rush

If I look dope when I make music, maybe my music will sound like dope
If I'm also on dope when I make music, maybe my music will sound like dope
If I look dope when I make music, maybe my music will sound like dope
If I'm also on dope when I make music, maybe my music will sound like dope

I wanna be high like all the time
Yes, yes wanna be high like all the time
Yes, yes wanna be high like all the time
Yes, yes wanna be high like all the time
Yes, yes wanna be high like all the time
