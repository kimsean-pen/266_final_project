Yeah, ooh baby

Like a damsel in distress, I'm stressin' you
My castle became a dungeon
'Cause I'm longin' for you
(Longin' for you babe)

Feelin' strong for you
You're my knight in shining armour
See your face in a silver moon
Oh, all over the lagoon

And it feels like, dragon days
And the fire's hot
Like the desert needs water
I need you a lot

Dragon days
I need to be saved
I'm missin' you
(And the days drag on and on)

Desperate for you baby
Do you know what that means?
(It means I feel like)
I feel like an addict must feel when he fiends

In an act of desperation
I get lost in my dreams
'Cause like a lady in waiting, I'm waitin' for ya
(Like a)
Like a prisoner tied over alligator waters

Waiting for my
Prince of paradise to come
And to take me away, from these
(Tock tick)

Dragon days
And the fire's hot
Like the desert needs water
I need you a lot
(So bad baby)

Dragon days
I need to be saved
I'm missin' you
(And the days drag on and on)
Don't you wanna play?

(D R A G O N days)
(Got me D R A G G I N)
'Cause I want you babe
And I need you baby
(Say)

Dragon days
And the fire's hot
Like the desert needs water
I need you a lot
(I need a lot, I need you so bad)

Dragon days
I need to be saved
I'm missin' you
(And the days drag on and on and on and on and)
Dragon days
And the fire's hot
Like the desert needs water
I need you a lot
(I need a lot, I need you so bad)
Dragon days
I need to be saved
I'm missin' you
(And the days drag on and on)
Drag on, drag on, yeah
