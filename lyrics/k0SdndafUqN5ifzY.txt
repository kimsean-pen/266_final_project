i can barely remember my past
everything seems to disappear so fast
but i recall being jealous and alone
gazing at the dreams going by

i started my life when you knocked on the door
found something inside i didn't dare to ignore
now i do believe in flowers on the moon
i'll swim beside the golden tide

you
crashed by the gate
captured my fate
salvation
my eyes couldn't see
i hardly breathed
i was diving so deep

salvation
i'm down in the study holding on to my luck
will you still love me when i call you up?
i gave you my body, the power over me

come on, bring out the best in me
you crashed by the gate
captured my fate
salvation
my eyes couldn't see
i hardly breathed
my heart was asleep

salvation
some will get broken
others will get lucky like me meeting you

don't pass me by
you crashed by the gate
captured my fate
salvation
my eyes couldn't see
i hardly breathed
i was down on my knees

salvation
some will get broken
others will get lucky like me meeting you
don't pass me by
don't pass me by
i found salvation, oh yea
you bring me salvation
i found salvation
