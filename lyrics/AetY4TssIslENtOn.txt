I've been roaming around
Always looking down at all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can't reach
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

Someone like you and all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers undercover of the street
I know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

Someone like you whoaa ow whoaa ow
Someone like you whoaa ow whoaa ow

Off in the night while you live it up
I'm off to sleep
Waging wars to shake the poet and the beat

I hope it's gonna make you notice
I hope it's gonna make you notice

Someone like me ohh whooaa oh
Someone like me oooh whoaaa whoow

I'm ready
I'm ready
I'm ready now
I'm ready
I'm ready
I'm ready now
whooa oh Someone like me oooh whoaaa whoow
I've been roaming around up
Looking down at all I see
