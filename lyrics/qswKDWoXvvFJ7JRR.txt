It's not exactly what I like
Calling home a sofa bed
Lying wide awake at night
'Cause I'm hooked on what you said

When you hold me I'm slowly being mesmerised
Am I mesmerised?
Lying wide awake at night
Seeing pictures in my head

With you I leave the lights on
Ooh a different point of view
Yeah, love, I'ma leave the lights on
I'm shining when I'm with you
I'm shining when I'm with you
Ooh, you, I'm shining when I'm with you

You're my gold
You're my diamonds
I feel alive
When you look in my eyes
Oh, I come to life

You're my gold
You're my diamonds
I feel alive
When you look in my eyes
Oh, I come to life

Ooh hoo
With you I leave the lights on
Ooh, a different point of view
Yeah, love, I'ma leave the lights on
I'm shining when I'm with you
I'm shining when I'm with you
Ooh, you, I'm shining when I'm with you

Shining when I'm with you
