When I was a young boy
My mama said to me
"There's only one girl in the world for you
And she probably lives in Tahiti."

I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world just to find her

Or maybe she's in the Bahamas
Where the Caribean Sea is blue
Weeping in the tropical moonlit night
Because nobody's talking about you

I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
To find out where they hide her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world just to find her

Why am I hanging around in the rain right here
Trying to pick up a girl
Why are my eyes
Filling up with these lonely tears
When there's girls all over the world

Is she lying on a tropical beach somewhere
Underneath a tropical sun
Pining a way in a heat wave there
Hoping that I won't be long
I should be lying on that sun swept beach with her
Caressing her warm, brown skin
And then in a year or maybe not quite
We'll be sharing the same next of kin

I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world just to find her.
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
To find out where they hide her

I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
To find out where they hide her

Yeah!
Whole wide world
Whole wide world
