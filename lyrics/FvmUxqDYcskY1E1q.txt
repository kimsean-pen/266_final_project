You know I can be found
Sitting home all alone
If you can't come around
At least please telephone
Don't be cruel
To a heart that's true

Baby, if I made you mad
For somethin' I might have said
Please, let's forget my past
The future looks bright ahead
Don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby it's just you I'm thinkin' of

Don't stop thinkin' of me
Don't make me feel this way
Come on over here and love me
You know what I want you to say
Don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
Why should we be apart?
I really love you baby, cross my heart

Lets walk up to the preacher
And let us say I do
Then you'll know you'll have me
And I'll know that I'll have you
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby it's just you I'm thinkin' of

Don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
Don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby it's just you I'm thinkin' of
