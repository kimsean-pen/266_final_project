I never really had a problem because of leaving
But everything reminds me of her this evening
So if I seem a little out of it, sorry
But why should I lie, everything reminds me of her

The spin of the earth impaled a silhouette of the sun on the steeple
And I gotta hear the same sermon all the time now from you people
Why are you staring into outer space crying?
Just because you came across it and lost it

Everything reminds me of her
Everything reminds me of her
Everything reminds me of her
