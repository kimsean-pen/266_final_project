The faces all around me
They don't smile, they just crack
Waiting for our ship to come
But our ship's not coming back
We do our time like pennies in a jar
But what are we saving for?
What are we saving for?

There's a smell of stale fear
And it's reeking from our skins
The drinking never stops
Because the drinks absolve our sins
We sit and grow our roots into the floor
But what are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for?

So give me something to believe
'Cause I am living just to breathe
And I need something more
To keep on breathing for
So give me something to believe

Something's always coming
You can hear it in the ground
It swells into the air
With the rising, rising sound
And never comes but shakes the boards
And rattles all the doors
What are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for?

So give me something to believe
'Cause I am living just to breathe
And I need something more
To keep on breathing for
So give me something to believe

I am hiding from some beast
But the beast was always here
Watching without eyes
Because the beast is just my fear
That I am just nothing
Thar that's just what I've become
What am I waiting for?
It's already done
Oh

So give me something to believe
'Cause I am living just to breathe
And I need something more
To keep on breathing for
So give me something to believe

And I need something more
To keep on breathing for
So give me something to believe
