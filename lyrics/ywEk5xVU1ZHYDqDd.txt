Every time we say goodbye
I die a little
Every time we say goodbye
I wonder why a little

Why the Gods above me
Who must be in the know
Think so little of me
They allow you to go

When you're near
There's such an air of spring about it
I can hear a lark
Somewhere waiting to sing about it

There's no love song finer
But how strange
The change from major to minor
Every time we say goodbye

When you're near
There's such an air of spring about it
I can hear a lark
Somewhere waiting to sing about it

There's no love song finer
But how strange
The change from major to minor
Every time we say goodbye
