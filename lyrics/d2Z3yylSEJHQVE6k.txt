We don't mind if you take a photograph
If you take a photograph
We don't care that we'll never be like you
That we'll never be like you
Love is so old, ever know for sure, know for sure
I know you, you'll be coming back for more
You'll be coming back for more

We can fight anything that we can use
All I do is just for you
Sometimes it feels like I've been trapped for years
All I ever feel is fear
Tell me why do they keep me in this place
In this place
Please don't trap us don't matter what you say
I know that you're not amazed
Soon I'll be gone
Soon I'll be gone
Soon I'll be gone
Soon I'll be gone

We don't mind if you take a photograph

If you take a photograph
Now we care that we'll never be like you
That we'll never be like you
Love is so old, all we ever knew for sure, knew for sure
I know you, won't coming back for more
Won't be coming back for more
Soon I'll be gone
Soon I'll be gone
Soon I'll be gone
Soon I'll be gone
And you're not around the cone
Love is so old, all we ever knew for sure, knew for sure.
