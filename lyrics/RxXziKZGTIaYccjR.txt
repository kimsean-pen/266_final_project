A fading paper sheet
Once plain white and unmeaningly

Love left a printed trace
Of something that may never be alive again

Hell, hell
Hell to the heavens

It fills my mind with heat
I raise my hands against these shutting gates

Opening clouds above me
My raging wrath resounds into the heavens
Walls within walls won't hold my mortal eyes from you

Hecate, Sacred, Goddess
Hell to the heavens
Betrayers, Sorcerer, Godless
Hell to the heavens
Wounds within wounds won't hold my mortal eyes from you

Hecate, Sacred, Goddess
Hell to the heavens
Betrayers, Sorcerer, Godless
Hell to the heavens
Lies within lies won't hold my mortal tongue from speaking verity

Hell, hell
Hell to the heavens

It fills my wits with blaze
These holy men arriving in my cold cell

Opening sky above me
I wage a war for life beyond the heavens

Hate within hate won't hold my mortal eyes from you
Hecate, Sacred, Goddess
Hell to the heavens
Betrayers, Sorcerer, Godless
Hell to the heavens
Wounds within wounds won't hold my mortal eyes from you

Hecate, Sacred, Goddess
Hell to the heavens
Betrayers, Sorcerer, Godless
Hell to the heavens
Lies within lies won't hold my mortal tongue from speaking verity

Hell, hell
Hell to the heavens

There's been no crime
My words plain and unmeaningly
I am innocent I swear I am
And so I long of going back to be

Hecate, Sacred, Goddess
Hell to the heavens
Betrayers, Sorcerer, Godless
Hell to the heavens
Wounds within wounds won't hold my mortal eyes from you

Hecate, Sacred, Goddess
Hell to the heavens
Betrayers, Sorcerer, Godless
Hell to the heavens
Lies within lies won't hold my mortal tongue from speaking verity

Hell, hell, hell
Hell to the heavens
