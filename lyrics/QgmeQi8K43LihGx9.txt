Here they come
Here come the bastards
I heard it from a confidant
Who heard it from a confidant
They're definitely on their way
There's one with this idea
Something about a hammer head shark
Nose hairs and flatus
Best keep your distance because
Here they come
Here come the bastards
Bury your head deep in the sand
Anonymity is a virtue
In this day and age
Amazing hand dexterity
Flagrant misuse of security
Better run, run, run, run, run, run run run run, run
Here they come
Here they come
Here they come
Here they come
Here they come
Here they come
Here they come
Here they come
Here they come
Here they come
Here they come
Here they come
Here they come
Here they come
Here they come
Here they come
Here they come
Here they come
Here they come
Here they come
Here they come
Here they come
Here they come
Here they comeeeee
