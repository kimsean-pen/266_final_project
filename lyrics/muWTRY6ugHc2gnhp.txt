Now this is who we are
I am no one's, I am no one's hero
I am no one

For we are not the giant men
That some may think
You are faithful when we are not
So I'd like to tell this story
The way it is meant to be

Without the burden that's in our hearts
None of us would have ever found You
You are faithful when we are not
You began a work that only You can complete

Now this is who we are
I'll never know the answers and I'll always wonder why
Now this is who we are
I'll never know the answers and I'll always wonder why

Why we are given grace we'll never deserve
And a second chance that we will never earn
For there is nothing
I can do to save myself
For there is nothing I can do

Now this is who we are
I'll never know the answers and I'll always wonder why
Now this is who we are
I'll never know the answers and I'll always wonder why
And I'll always, and I'll always wonder why

Now this is who we are
I'll never know the answers and I'll always wonder why
You have let me start again
I'd rather be called weak than die thinking I was strong
