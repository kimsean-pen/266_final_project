Just try and give me one good reason
Why I should care at all right now
I've grown weary from your treasons
I think I'm gonna take my bow
I think it is a great injustice
The way that you've been treating me
All this time it has been so clear
But I've been far to blind to see

That this is killing me
And we can't make it
No matter how hard we try
Here I set with face in hands
I've wanted this for so long
And it's all over now
I think it's time that I said goodbye

It's now quite obvious that we're doomed
How I'm bleeding from this heart wound
You better hope that you don't need me
I'm finally setting myself free

This is killing me
And we can't make it
No matter how hard we try
Here I set with face in hands
I've wanted this for so long
And it's all over now
I think it's time that I said goodbye

I can't keep holding on
To something that's not there
Reaching into the dark
And finding just thin air
You always try to save it
Just as I say goodbye
You'll try to save it
But not this time, not this time

This is killing me
And we can't make it
No matter how hard we try
Here I set with face in hands
I've wanted this for so long
And it's all over now
I think it's time that I said goodbye

This is killing me
And we can't make it
No matter how hard we try
Here I set with face in hands
I've wanted this for so long
And it's all over now
I think it's time that I said goodbye
