I'm done I'm done with thinking over over
It gets me going going under cover

It's like I'm loving anxiety
Keep making it my priority

I'm stuck on things I don't I don't remember
I go from striker to being defender

I gotta kill the anxiety
I'm gonna make it priority

I'm gonna fix up all them dramas
But Imma drink them til tomorrow
Ah no no no
Ah no no no

I just wanna drink up no drama just drink up
Drink up no drama just drink
Drink up no drama just drink
Here we go again

Drink up no drama just drink up
Drink up no drama just drink
Drink up no drama just drink

I say im cool but I got my doubts
I've got a talent of freakin out

I take a piece of your gravity
To level up my insanity

We say we forgive and don't forget
Whooo
We give the answers then question it
Whooo

We gotta hold on to gravity
Hey yeah yeah yeah
And mix it up with insanity
Hey yeah yeah yeah

I'm gonna fix up all them dramas
But Imma drink them til tomorrow
Ah no no no
Ah no no no

I'm gonna fix up all them dramas
But Imma drink them til tomorrow
Ah no no no
Ah no no no

I just wanna drink up no drama just drink up
Drink up no drama just drink
Drink up no drama just drink
Here we go again

Drink up no drama just drink up
Drink up no drama just drink
Drink up no drama just drink

I'm done I'm done with thinking over over
It gets me going going under cover

It's like I'm loving anxiety
Keep making it my priority whooooah

I'm gonna fix up all them dramas
But Imma drink them til tomorrow

I just wanna drink up no drama just drink up
Drink up no drama just drink

Drink up no drama just drink
Here we go again

Drink up no drama just drink up
Drink up no drama just drink
Drink up no drama just drink
