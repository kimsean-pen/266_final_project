Can I talk to you, baby
When I was a little girl
I didn't have a father
And that's why I'm leaning on you
When I was a baby
I didn't get a hug from daddy
That's why I need a hug from you
Oh, it's not easy and
And I thank you for putting up with me
When you don't have a daddy's love

To say that you...
To say that I'm your little girl
(Are his little girl) Oh why didn't you love me
(And give you the love) I need love yeah yeah yeah
(You really deserve) And I believe I deserve it, and that's why

That's why I need, the father in you
(I need the father in you, baby)
That's why I need (Please don't hurt me please)
The father in you
That's why I need (Oh that's why)
The father in you (Really need you)
That's why I need (Please be true)
The father in you

Oh, things got bad, to the point
Where mommy couldn't hold us down
And that's when it hurt me so much

To see her, to see her cry
Oh don't cry, momma don't cry momma
Each and every night
We're gonna be alright that's what I used to say
I said that some day
That I would try to take his place
But it was too hard
It was so hard tryna to be a man and a woman
And that's why I need the father in you

That's why I need, (oh I needed)
The father in you, (I put my trust on you)
That's why I need, (Please don't let me down)
The father in you
That's why I need
The father in you (I need the father in you)
That's why I need (Hold my hand)
The father in you

Because we never had one at home
No no no as a little girl
So I understand, why daddy couldn't be there
'Cause it's so obvious nobody taught him how to be a father to me
Oh and I'm not sayin' this
To reminisce on the past
I'm just saying this to make you understand, that I needed a father
And this is my problem
This is why I couldn't keep no one
This is why I couldn't stay alone
I was so scared alone
Every woman needs a man
And I don't think she understands
That she really needs a father
The father in you, my brother
She really needed the father
The father in you
When your wife is speaking fellas
Pay attention, yeah, don't ignore her
No, no, no I really need the father in you
