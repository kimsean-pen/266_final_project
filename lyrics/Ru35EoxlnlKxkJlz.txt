No bright lights, no big city
Went to my head
And so I won't stick around in this town
No, I'm getting out instead
'Cause I can't find a thing and get it done
Raise my heart and ring my ears
So I won't stick around in this town
That's true
'Cause I won't and I can't
And I don't understand
You become what you hate
Or you hate what you become?
Got me a ticket and I won't be long
'Cause I can't go on and I gotta get gone
Got me a ticket and I won't be long
'Cause I can't go on and I gotta get gone away
So I make my way through the quagmire
Rumors glorifying me
You were as, as the detox in this city
So if I may be excused
'Cause I won't and I can't
And I don't understand
You become what you hate
Or you hate what you become?
Got me a ticket and I won't be long
'Cause I can't go on and I gotta get gone
Got me a ticket and I won't be long
'Cause I can't go on and I gotta get gone
Got me a ticket and I won't be long
'Cause I can't go on and I gotta get gone
Got me a ticket and I won't be long
'Cause I can't go on and I gotta get gone away
Well, I won't be around for the good times
Won't be around for the bad
And I won't stick around in this town
No I'm getting out instead, yeah, yeah, yeah
And I won't and I can't
And I live 'cause I can
And I won't be back again
Well, I got me a ticket and I won't be long
'Cause I can't go on and I gotta get gone
Got me a ticket and I won't be long
'Cause I can't go on and I gotta get gone
Got me a ticket and I won't be long
'Cause I can't go on and I gotta get gone
Got me a ticket and I won't be long
'Cause I can't go on and I gotta get gone away
And I gotta get gone away
'Cause I gotta get gone away
Gotta get gone away
