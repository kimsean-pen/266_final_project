Into the sky
Into the sun
Opening out
Opening up
Into the rise
Into your eyes
Open your mouth
Spit out the sky

And I
Am running
Into
The fire
Into
The fire

The sign closes
The fire here
On
On

Changing wings
Sleeting alive
Open your heart
Scatter the sky

Open your mouth
Spit out the sky

Into the sky
Into the sun
Open your mouth
Spit out the sky

And I
Am running
Into
The fire

And I
Am running
Into
The fire
Into
The fire

Into the sky
Into the sun
