In the veins of of the ultraviolet light
The phosphor is starting a fire
Shooting up in the iodine
It's turning on
Rupture the wall around my heart
I feel so lost
I've been shaking
You can't save me
Forget what the doctor said
Every bird in mid-flight
Is calling out your name
Before it hits the window
And sings the rapture
Without a second opinion
The chemicals saturate to counteract the code
Through the double helix we are twisting
Too scared to let this go
Someone call the head nurse
She's coming to the capitol
To wrap us up and throw us in the dirt
With a dream that's turning off
We are coming to the Capitol
The distance between us will rupture
In our hearts the disease won't touch us
...Love...
Now it's too late to turn this off
Alone is all we are
Even when we feel this close
It's just a lie we believe
These are the words that escape from our lungs
Rupture the wall I've built around my heart
I've been shaking
You can't save me
I'm turning off
We can't find a way
Out of this moment
We're lost in a dark hallway
