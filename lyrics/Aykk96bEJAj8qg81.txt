Guilt is a snake we beat with a rake
Grow in our kitchens in the pies we bake
Feed it to us to squirm in our bellies
Twisting our guts, melt our spine to jelly

Stay, hey don't wanna go now, I'll stay

Drove the children from their chores
Handcrafted housewives into whores
Fear of the beast is calling it near
Creating what we're hating, only fear that is here

Stay, stay, don't wanna go now, I'll stay

Come into our home, won't you stay?
Well, I know the steak is cold but it's wrapped in plastic
Come into our home, won't you stay?
But it's wrapped in plastic

I'm only as deep as the self that I dig
But I'm only as sick as the stick in the pig
Thin and so white, thin and so wide
Daddy tells the daughter, "Mommy sleepin' at night"

Wash all your sin, take off your skin
The righteous father wears the yellowest grin
Don't wanna go now

Stay, hey, don't wanna go now, I'll stay

Come into our home, won't you stay?
Well, I know the steak is cold but it's wrapped in
Come into our home, won't you stay?
Well, I know the steak is cold, I know it's wrapped in plastic

Come into our home, won't you stay?
Well, I know the steak is cold but it's wrapped in
Come into our home, won't you stay?
But it's wrapped in plastic
