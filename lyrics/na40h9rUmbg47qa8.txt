pull me through
call my name
I'm feeling blue
and now you tell me what to do
maybe there's something wrong
maybe I don't blame you
if I had a reason to a reason to feel like I do
I wouldn't need any help from you
this is my apology for losing sight of what you mean
for losing sides of me
everybody sheds but I'm feeling so lean
I don't know why I can't handle it I've tried
so say I'm feeling safe someone take my place
because I am not forgiving enough to stay insane
only the fall is mine
and I'm finding it more than fine
I'm unstable
pull me through
call my name
I'm feeling blue
and now you tell me what to
