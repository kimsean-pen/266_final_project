Come on my love and show it to me
Never as close and there's nowhere I'd be
Be by your side say true love
Oh true love, just that no one can see
If we both get caught then we'll run forever
Come on my love take cover with me
We can be gone and there's no one we need
Over the day say who knows
Well who else knows
Yet there's no one we need
If we both get caught then we'll run forever
If we both go down we go down together
If we both get caught then we'll run forever
If we both go down we go down together
Just as soon
Just a force like you
Just as soon
Just a force passing through
Just as soon as a little blood that's missed
Just as soon as a kiss
Wait for me just like that
Wait for me just like that
Wait for me like that
Wait for me like that
If we both get caught then we'll run forever
If we both go down we go down together
If we both run now then we'll run forever
If we both go down we go down together
