Hey momma, it's me your oldest son
Not the one who still believes that one day you won't be on the run
And I, I won't take too much time from you
I just wanted to tell you I'm alive and doing fine
So how are you
Hey momma, it's me your oldest son
You kissed me on the head and left me out for dead when I was only one
I won't take up too much time
I just wanted to tell you I'm alive and doing fine I'm not looking for your money,
or even a hug
I've never known your love
Never known your love
And I don't want your love
I don't need your love
Cause I'm doing fine here, the best that I can
I stand on my own,
I stand alone, and I stand like a man
Maybe you just, you just didn't care, but that's okay
There's always tomorrow, always some other day Yeah I've never known your love
And I don't want your love
I don't need your love
I don't want your love
