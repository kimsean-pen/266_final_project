I've called off the search
I know exactly where you are
I'll give you the time
if you at least call

I've called off the search
I know exactly where you are
I feel like a child
who is running in circles,
screaming his head off

I want to smash things
I want a coffee
I want to punch myself repeatedly
Let's watch a movie,
expend no energy
and just be
Can we just be

I want to smash things
I want a coffee
Can we just be
Can we just be
decompressing
Will you let me

I'm not so upset now
Deep into this picture
Distorted surroundings
with alternate endings

Reality's bending
I feel stuck between
what's real and what's not
Different words and different thoughts

Live in daydreams
I choose fiction
I feel exhausted
I feel exhausted

Get away
from this big screen I'd get away
Get away
from this bright screen I'd get away
from this big scene
from this bright screen

I want to smash things
I want a coffee
Can I just be
Can I just be
I want to smash things

Walk around deceivingly
Can I just be

Get away
from this big screen
Get away
from this big scene
