So far, I've not really stayed in touch

Well, you knew as much
It's no surprise that today
I'll get up around two
From a lack of anything to do
And I might as well just grin and bear it

Because it's not worth the trouble of an argument
And you've not really stayed in touch

Well, I knew as much
It's no surprise that today
I get up around two
With nothing to do
Except get a touch of flu
And I might as well just grin and bear it

Because it's not worth the trouble of an argument
And in any case I'd rather wear it
It's like a badhead in the morning
I know

And I might as well grin and bear it

Because it's not worth the trouble of an argument
And in any case I'd rather wear it
It's like a badhead in the morning
And I might as well grin and bear it
Because it's not worth the trouble of an argument
And in any case I'd rather wear it
It's like a badhead in the morning
I know
