I lost my way on streets that I paved

When I was deep in the blue
You were gone the whole time
You fall behind and I say goodbye
When you drive to drink
I numbed my mind

Gone are the times

When we sipped on good wine
For the taste, yeah
Now you and I
We just drink what we find
Getting wasted, mmm

Mmm
Your memory near

Laced with the pain
I needed love but it's never the same
For I wanted more
You wanted
More than me
When the bottle is gone
In that silence I'll find
That life isn't nothing but chasin' the time
For I wanted more

You wanted
More than me
Oh baby, since you lied

I've had restless nights
Heard you got a brand new me
Guess you doin' fine
While you're getting through
All the things that you do
Staying vacant

I drink what I find
Cause my angels on high
Staying wasted mmm
Your memory near

Laced with the pain
I needed love but it's never the same
For I wanted more
You wanted
More than me
When the bottle is gone

In the darkness I'll find
That life isn't nothing but chasin' the time
For I wanted more
You wanted
More than me

The smoke got cleared
When the days turned months and the months turned years
For the anger to fade
When you took a step back
Realization came
You weren't looking at me
You were looking instead
Somewhere over my head
The smoke got cleared
When the days turned months and the months turned years
For the anger to fade
When you took a step back
Realization came
You weren't looking at me
You were looking instead
Somewhere over my head
Somewhere over my head
The smoke got cleared
When the days turned months and the months turned years
For the anger to fade
When you took a step back
Realization came
You weren't looking at me
You were looking instead
Somewhere over my head
The smoke got cleared
When the days turned months and the months turned years
For the anger to fade
When you took a step back
Realization came
You weren't looking at me
You were looking instead
Somewhere over my head
Somewhere over my head
Somewhere over my head
