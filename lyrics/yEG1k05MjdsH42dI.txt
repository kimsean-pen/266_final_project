The boy whith a TIGER
The boy whith the girl
The boy is gentle

In forest
The tiger was starving
And go to eat him
When he have a idea
Tu put the girl for the animal

The tiger was clever
And to raise she for
your his cage

she live in the cage
for ten years

and there the animal
don't let the girl leave

When the boy go
to the cage
and take the girl

She cry and cry
with a dangerous to return
a life
Whith a strange peoples
