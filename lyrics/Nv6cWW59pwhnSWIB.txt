When the love is too low and you want it back
Put the lights on
With rose in a hand, doubt in the heart
Put the lights on
My wheels on a tow and i go alone
Put the lights on
You should know without you i'm gone

Put the lights on
This is my home
Place, where i own
Memories of you, dear
Haunting your eyes
Closed in desquise
I'm mesmorised
In the memories of you, dear

I saw moon is a human invader
Put the lights on
And it power grew wider
Put the lights on
So we both must be a little wiser
Put the lights on
To doing something to quite her

Put the lights on
This is my home
Place, where i own
Memories of you, dear
Haunting your eyes
Closed in desquise
I'm mesmorised
In the memories of you, dear

Put the lights on
This is my home
Place, where i own
Memories of you, dear
Haunting your eyes
Closed in desquise
I'm mesmorised
In the memories of you, dear
