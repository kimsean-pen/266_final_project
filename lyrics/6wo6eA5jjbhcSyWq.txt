On the street again
The pure weight of gold
Hits the southern land all alone
Friends with thoughts that frame
Our river of gold
In the flash, I start
Fix my building home

On my feet again
The blue weight of coal
Stares at thoughts of plagues all alone

Their seedless taste
Of courage and place

Open hands go on your way
Open hands go on your way
Standing beneath it
The dusk is forgiveness
Open hands go on your way

Their seedless taste
Of courage and place

Open hands goon your way
Open hands go on your way
Standing beneath it
Our tusk
Open hands go on your way
