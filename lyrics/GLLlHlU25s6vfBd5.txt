I'm keeping you in mind
For the rest of years, for the rest of years

In your watery eyes I'm gonna rest all day
In your watery eyes I'm gonna rest all day
In your watery eyes I'm gonna rest some day
In your watery eyes

Tell the saint I'm gonna be a little late
Drawing lines around the river for the rest of years
All in time, but you fade away from
All in time, but you fade away from me

They can't see what I can see
Turned away from me
I can turn everything around
I can turn everything around

They can't see what I can see
Turned away from me
I can turn everything around
I can turn everything around

I heard you in my sleep
For the rest of years, for the rest of years

So lonely, I'm trying to hear you
So lonely, I'm trying to hear you
So lonely, I'm trying to hear you
So lonely, I'm

All in time, but you fade away from
All in time, but you fade away from me love

They can't see what I can see
Turned away from me
I can turn everything around
I can turn everything around

They can't see what I can see
Turned away from me
I can turn everything around
I can turn everything around

They can't see what I can see
Turned away from me
I can turn everything around
I can turn everything around

All in time, but you fade away from
All in time, but you fade away from
All in time, but you fade away from me love
