CARDIGANS
Miscellaneous
Never recoverHow I always memorize
every single misery
and I seem to glorify
everything inside of me
and the hero never dies
if the lover hides
between the sheets
there' no escape
cause you can't sleep
and then you'll see
your just like me...
That's what you called waste of time
I'll be waiting down the line
that's what you called waste of time
waiting for your valentine
that's what you called waste of time
I know where you hero hides
that's why you don't sleep tonight
that's what I call life
with a hero in the past
you hang on to history
such a lost will always last
