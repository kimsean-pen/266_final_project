Slave away it's just another day
It's just another day without meaning
Blue to Gray another bill to pay
Until you die under a glass ceiling
Gas prices rise
You numb your feelings
Monetized and Bipolerized by the drugs big Pharma's dealing

Staring awake at the ceiling
You promised never to forgive
Tearing apart at the seems baby,
You Better Learn to Fucking Live
Because this Life Doesn't Give A Shit

Run the track
and fucking play it back
and ask yourself where you stopped believing?
Look inside you can no longer hide
The discontentment that you've been feeling
There's so much more
This life can hold
If you ignored the fucking broken record
of a Dream you've bought and sold

Staring awake at the ceiling
You promised never to forgive
Tearing apart at the seems baby but
You better learn to fucking live

Staring awake at the ceiling
You promised never to forgive
Tearing apart at the seems baby but
You better learn to fucking live

Staring awake at the ceiling
You promised never to forgive
Tearing apart at the seems baby but
You better learn to fucking live

You better learn to fucking live
You better learn to fucking live (Live, live, live)
You better learn to fucking live (Live, live, live)
Because this world don't give a shit
