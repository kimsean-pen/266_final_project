Begin again,

I've been watching your kindness keep
a lonely company
look at the fire and think of me
I've been watching your creep
around my wandering feet
trying for years to flee

My moon o my moon
not even into
another eternity
will you stop your lovely orbiting
I had held it a world away
until my body 'gan to say

I need not one thing more
o wrap the ground around
your gentle winding mind
o guard the pounding sound
breathe in your fairy air
o wrap the ground around
give back a hungrier stare
o guard the pounding sound

You'll be the moon I'll be the earth
And when we burst
start over o darling
begin again
begin again
begin again

You'll be the moon I'll be the earth
And when we burst
start over o darling
begin again
begin again
begin again

Begin again
begin again
begin again

Begin again
begin again
begin again

My moon o my moon
not even into
another eternity
will you stop your lovely orbiting
I had held it a world away
until my body 'gan to say

I need not one thing more
o wrap the ground around
your gentle winding mind
o guard the pounding sound
breathe in your fairy air
o wrap the ground around
give back a hungrier stare
o guard the pounding sound

You'll be the moon I'll be the earth
And when we burst
start over o darling
begin again
begin again
begin again

You'll be the moon I'll be the earth
And when we burst
start over o darling
begin again
begin again
begin again

Begin again
begin again
begin again

Begin again
begin again
begin again

You'll be the moon I'll be the earth
And when we burst
start over o darling
begin again
begin again
begin again

You'll be the moon I'll be the earth
And when we burst
start over o darling
begin again
begin again
begin again
