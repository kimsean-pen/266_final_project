We been runnin' away from
Somethin' we both know
We've long run out of things to say
And I think I better go

So don't be gettin' excited
Oh, when you hear that slammin' door
'Cause there'll be one less set of footsteps
On your floor in the mornin'

And we've been hidin' from somethin'
That should have never gone this far
But after all it's what we've done
Makes us what we are

And you been talkin' in silence
Well, if it's silence you adore
Oh, baby, one less set of footsteps
On your floor in the mornin'

Well, baby
One less set of footsteps on your floor
It's one less man to walk in
One less pair of jeans on your door
One less voice a-talkin'

But tomorrow's a dream away
Today has turned to dust
Your silver tongue has turned to clay
And your golden rule to rust

If that's the way that you want it
Oh, that's the way I want it more
Well, they'll be one less set of footsteps
On your floor in the mornin'

Well, there'll be
One less set of footsteps on your floor
One less man to walk in
One less pair of jeans on your door
One less voice a-talkin'

But tomorrow's a dream away
And today has turned to dust
Your silver tongue has turned to clay
And your golden rule to rust

If that's the way that you want it
Oh, that's the way I want it more
'Cause baby, one less set of footsteps
On your floor in the mornin'
Oh, baby, one less set of footsteps
On your floor in the mornin'
