First you look so strong
Then you fade away.
The sun will blind my eyes
I love you anyway.
Thirsty for your smile
I watch you for a while.
You are a vapour trail
In a deep blue sky.

Tremble with a sigh
Glitter in your eye.
You seem to come and go
I never seem to know.
And all my time
is yours as much as mine.
We never have enough
Time to show our love.
