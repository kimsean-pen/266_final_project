I've fallen, through dark days.
I've screamed out for help, but there's no one there.
I've been trying, to see through the
The clouds, but my sun is nearly dead.

Wherever it takes me.
Whatever it does to me.
I will need to find a way to live with this in me.

Wherever it takes me.
Whatever that comes for me.
I will have the strength to fight it,
but I'll always remember where I've been.

I'm falling faster.
I'm falling harder.
I'm moving backwards.
And there's no-one to fall back on to now.

It's the way I've been feeling.
It's the way I've been fighting.
It's the way I've been dying.
And there's only the darkness within me.

I've never seen what's out there, what's out there.
So how can I be so affected?

I am what I am, a strange face.
And I cannot change what I am.
I am where I am, in a changed place.
And I cannot change who I am.

Who I am.
Who I am.
Who I am inside of me.
I'm in the darkness now.

I'm falling faster.
I'm falling harder.
I'm moving backwards.
And there's no-one to fall back on to now.

It's the way I've been feeling.
It's the way I've been fighting.
It's the way I've been dying.
And there's only the darkness within me.

Explain, everything that's right and
what's wrong with our falling earth.
Is it me who mistreats me or is it earth coming against me.

Explain, everything that's right and
what's wrong with our falling earth.
Is it me who can't explain or is it earth falling from me.

I can't not explain what I've been feeling.
But I can see in the dark, that's where I've been.
I can't not accept to live through this.
And I can't see you walk the same road as I.
I can't let it harvest more victims.
I can't not allow it to feed on our lives.

The bright lights are cleaving the sea.
We'll walk now.
