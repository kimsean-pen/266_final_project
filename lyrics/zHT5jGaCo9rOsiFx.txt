Anytime I need to see your face
I just close my eyes and I am taken to a place
Where your crystal mind and magenta feelings take up shelter
In the base of my spine, sweet like a chica cherry cola

I don't need to try to explain
I just hold on tight and if it happens again
I might move so slightly to the arms and the lips and the face
Of the human cannonball that I need to, I want to

Come stand a little bit closer
Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you when I get to you

Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But ooh, I'd die to find out
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But ooh, I'd die to find out

I'm the kind of person who endorses a deep commitment
Getting comfy, getting perfect is what I live for
But a look and then a smell perfume, it's like I'm down on the floor
And I don't know what I'm in for

Conversation has a time and place
In the interaction of a lover and a mate
But the time of talkin' using symbols, using words
Can be likened to a deep sea diver who is swimming with a raincoat

Come stand a little bit closer
Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you when I get to you

Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But ooh, I'd die to find out
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But ooh, I'd die to find out

Ooh, sha-ee-ya
Ooh, sha-ee-ya

Anytime I need to see your face
I just close my eyes and I am taken to a place
Where your crystal mind and magenta feelings take up shelter
In the base of my spine, sweet like a chica cherry cola

I don't need to try to explain
I just hold on tight and if it happens again
I might move so slightly to the arms and the lips and the face
Of the human cannonball that I need to, I want to

Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But ooh, I'd die to find out
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But ooh, I'd die to find out

So can we find out?
Do it!

(Find out)

(Find out)

Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But ooh, I'd die to find out
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But ooh, I'd die to find out

Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But ooh, I'd die to find out
(I'd die to find out!)
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
(So can we find out?)
But ooh, I'd die to find out
