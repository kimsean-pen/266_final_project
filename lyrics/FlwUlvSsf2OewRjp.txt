Tiger eyelashes, summer wine
Goosebump soup and Honey Pie
Piggy in the middle
I'm the baddy's daddy
About to make my golden move
Apocalyptic lipstick campaign
Four horsemen in a one-horse race
The dance she does to "Shadowplay"
Appeals to an ancient impulse

Ghost riders in the Rat and Parrot
Croc-skin collar on a diamond dog
Dirtbag ballet by the bins down the alley
As I walk through the chalet
Of the shadow of death

(Everything that you've come to expect)
I guess the coastal air gets a girl to reflect
(Everything that you've come to expect)
I just can't get the thought
Of you and him out of my head
(Everything that you've come to expect)
Everything that you've come to expect

Hotel room, Holy Bible
Hotel room, free love revival
Baby, it's a never-ending spiral
Looks a little bit like Paris

Ghost riders in the Rat and Parrot
Croc-skin collar on a diamond dog
Dirtbag ballet by the bins down the alley
As I walk through the
Chalet of the shadow of death

(Everything that you've come to expect)
I guess the coastal air gets a girl to reflect
(Everything that you've come to expect)
I just can't get the thought
Of you and him out of my head
(Everything that you've come to expect)
Everything that I've tried to forget
(Everything that you've come to expect)
Everything that I live to regret
(Everything that you've come to expect)
Everything that you've come to expect
