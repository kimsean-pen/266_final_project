Ooh wee, ooh wee
Ooh wee, ooh wee
Ooh wee, ooh wee
Ooh wee, ooh wee
Ooh wee, ooh wee
Ooh wee, ooh wee

Take this seriously
Like Pac all eyes on me
That's right you are intrigued
I'm that chick you like
You know this what it be
I'm like the lottery
Hot Bentley with the keys
Take me for a ride

I in the sky let's fly high
Boy I got you caught up inside of my haze

And you're gonna be gone for days

I'm like that ooowee
You're fiendin' to blaze up
And taste me
Got flavor like ice cream,
Cause I'm that chick you like
And you know you need this man
And you know I got this man
Gonna be your everything
I'm that chick you like
La da da ooowee
I'm that chick you like

La da da ooowee
I'm that chick you like

I do'z it naturally
Hypnotize like Biggie
But you ain't havin' dreams
I'm that chick you like
Nah you ain't seeing things
Or hallucinating
I brings that levity
Take me for a ride

I in the sky let's fly high
Boy I got you caught up inside of my haze
And you're gonna be gone for days

I'm like that ooowee
You're fiendin to blaze up
And taste me
Got flavor like ice cream,
Cause I'm that chick you like
And you know you need this man
And you know I got this man
Gonna be your everything
I'm that chick you like

La da da ooowee
I'm that chick you like
La da da ooowee
I'm that chick you like

Boy just relax
And unwind
Pull me in and
Breathe, once you do
There ain't no rules It's up to you

Ain't no rules It's time
Just keep on kissin' me
Hold on and baby we
Can party all night through the night
All right

I'm like that ooowee
You're fiendin' to blaze up
And taste me
Got flavor like ice cream
Cause I'm that chick you like
And you know you need this man
And you know I got this man

Gonna be your everything
I'm dat chick you like
La da da ooowee
I'm that chick you like

I'm like that uptown haze
Them real thugs blaze
La da da ooowee
We'll touch the sky
Cause I'm that chick you like

Uh huh...
