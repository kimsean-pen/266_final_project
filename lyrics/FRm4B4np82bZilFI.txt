Once I lost it
It took hold of me
Once again
Lost and left to see

What was there
Wouldn't let me be
Spoiled with misery
Spoiled with energy

Let me be that one
Who will rise and return from sleep?
Give me strength to run
Become one with the remedy

No regrets, no compromise
Story will be told
Won't reject the cure this time
Let this river flow
Let this river flow
Let this river flow

As the river
Meets the sea
That's when the ghost
Becomes my belief

Will it wash up?
Serve in need?
Bring the harvest
Without greed

Bring the harvest without greed
Bring the harvest, let me feel
One for the core, one for the mind
One by one, make me run

Let me be that one
Who will rise and return from sleep
Give me strength to run
Become one with the remedy

No regrets, no compromise
Story will be told
Won't reject the cure this time
Let this river flow
Let this river flow

I will rise up, I will rise up
I will rise up once again
I will rise up, I will rise up
I will rise up once again

I will rise, I will rise again
I will rise, I will rise again

So clear to me yesterday
So clear once for all
It was there almost watching me
Became one with the fall

What if the best of me
Will say that I won't recall?
If those empty witnesses
Won't say nothing at all

No regrets, no compromise
Story will be told
Won't reject the cure this time
Let this river flow
Let this river flow
Let this river flow
