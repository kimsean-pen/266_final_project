You don't care about nothing
so you don't care about love
If you want me to come back
you'd better change
You'd better give up talking 'bout money
begin thinking of love
If you want me to come back
you'd better change

You'd better change for the better
It costs more than dollars and cents
Take it from me
there's got to be
an end to this decadence
this decadence

You don't care about people
so you don't care about pain
If you want me to come back
you'd better change

You'd better change for the better
Start using some common sense
Take it from me
there's got to be
an end to this decadence

For decadence is fatal
it's the beginning of the end
In self-defence
I cannot recommend
this decadence

You don't care about real life
You're too distant and strange
If you want me to come back
you'd better change for the better
It may be rather intense
Stop this caprice
You've got to cease
this fin-de-si'cle pretence

For decadence is fatal
It's the beginning of the end
In consequence
I cannot recommend
this decadence
