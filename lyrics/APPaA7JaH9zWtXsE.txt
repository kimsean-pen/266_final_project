Take me, I know you want to
It's no secret, not anymore

Make me, into your perfect
I know you wanna change a thing or two,
That's ok

Your words they hurt, tearing right through me
Why do I need you to save me, oh
I gotta work on me

Maybe it's your affection, or your deep disconnection
I gotta work on me
(work on me)

I gotta work on me

Yeah you know, you're my weakness
I can't help it, not with you

I wonder, how does that make sense?
I know you got a lot up your sleeve and I,
Don't want a clue

Your words they hurt, tearing right through me
Why do I need you to save me, oh
I gotta work on me

Maybe it's your affection, or your deep disconnection
I gotta work on me
(work on me)

I gotta work on me

I gotta go, I gotta go, oh
Flat out of energy
I wanna be free
I gotta work on me

Don't wanna know, don't wanna know, oh
Flat out of energy
I wanna be free
Gotta work on...

Gotta work on me
