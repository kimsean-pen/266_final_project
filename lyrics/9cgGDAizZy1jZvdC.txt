I don't care about your money or your fancy cars
Some people call me Bonnie, I can shoot you like a star
Sweet like honey, sticky like gum
Chew you like a cannibal, red, redrum
Chew you like a cannibal, red, redrum
Chew you like a cannibal, red, redrum
Chew you like a cannibal, red, redrum

Chew you like a cannibal, red, redrum

If you be the apple, then I leave you hollow
Where I go you follow, so you better act right
My love is bitter sweet, but I can show you heaven
But first get on your knees, close your eyes and count to seven
I don't care if you a peasant or a king
If you're with me then you're everything

You're too smart for all that drama
Can't fix my heart with all your commas
You drive so fast don't care about my mama
As if we're gonna make it
And I'm too good for all your bullshit
But you got something that I don't quit
So let's pretend like we're too perfect
As if we're gonna make it
(As if we're gonna make it)
(As if we're gonna make it)

You're too smart for all that drama
Can't fix my heart with all your commas
You drive so fast don't care about my mama
As if we're gonna make it
And I'm too good for all your bullshit
But you got something that I don't quit
So let's pretend like we're too perfect
As if we're gonna make it

As if we're gonna make it
As if we're gonna make it
