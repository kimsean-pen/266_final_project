Suzanne and I
Never will we be apart
Suzanne and I
Never will we be apart

But we hold, hold, hold it down
Oh we hold, hold, hold it down

'Cause the night calls me
When the wind leads behind the world
When the wind leads behind the world

But we hold, hold it down
Oh we hold, hold, hold it down
'Cause the night calls for

Suzanne and I
Suzanne and I
Suzanne and I
Suzanne and I
We will rise

We hold, hold, hold it down
But we hold, hold, hold it down
But we hold, hold, hold it down
'Cause I never, ever, ever, ever be alone

Suzanne and I
Suzanne and I
Suzanne and I
Suzanne and I
We will rise
