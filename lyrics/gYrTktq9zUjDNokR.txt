Only - RY X
Coming for the cold
Buried under the heat
Lay you on the floor
Heavy like the forcement on earth
Coming like a rose
Tell me like a beast
Hold me on the floor
Heavy like the forcement on earth
I was a ghost
Hand to inflate
Kneeling
There of the heart
God wondered too
Feeling
I was only falling in love
I was only falling in love
I was only falling in love
Coming for the cold
Buried under the heat
Lay you on the floor
Heavy like the forcement on earth
Coming like a rose
Tell me like a beast
Hold you to the the floor
Heavy like the forcement on earth
I was a ghost
Hand to inflate
Bleeding
There of a heart
God wondered too
Feeling
I was only falling in love
I was only faliing in love
I was only falling in love
I was only falling in love
I was only falling in love
Coming for the cold
Buried under the heat
Lay you on the floor
I was only falling in love
Coming like a rose
Tell me like a best
Hold you to the floor
I was only falling in love
I was only falling in love
I was only falling in love
