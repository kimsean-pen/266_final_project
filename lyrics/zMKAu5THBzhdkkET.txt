And I know
Times like this, you just take it slow
Fall asleep in the pillows
She got my heart in a choke hold

And there she goes
Heart that pounds like a stereo
You take me 'round and 'round, like the merry go
But one more ride, baby, here we go
Yeah, yeah, oh no, oh no

And I know
Times like this, you just take it slow
Fall asleep in the pillows
She got my heart in a choke hold

And there she goes
Heart that pounds like a stereo
You take me 'round and 'round, like the merry go
But one more ride, baby, here we go
