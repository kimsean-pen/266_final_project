Tonight's the night
Open your door and I'll come inside
Don't be afraid, it will be alright
I will change your whole life tonight
and you're so beautiful
too beautiful for this dead-end world
I'm taking you to a better place
oh, far away from this stupid race, oh

Come with me
for ever
and ever
please come with me
for ever
No, don't let me down
oh, don't make me cry
Lie in my arms
and be mine tonight
Do it

Oh, did I tell you
there was no need to be afraid?
Oh, you've got such a beautiful body
Oh, you'll make such a beautiful body
I smoke these yellow-lit cul-de-sacs at night
You hear my foot-step on your bedroom stair
and I will take the first one in every house in town
I'll take your sisters and I'll lay them down
I'll lay them down
Tonight

Mother (mother)
Father (father)
Brother (brother)
Take them all

Make you mine
I want your body

Mother (mother)
Father (father)
Brother (brother)
The wind (the wind)
Streets (streets)
Those girls (girls)
I walked into town (town) (town).
