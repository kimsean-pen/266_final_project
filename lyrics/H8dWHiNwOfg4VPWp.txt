Shifting channels
A corroded smile
Sleepless murderer in the hallway
This change of seasons is final

Useless climate, staring at me
Yearning, yearning to be free
The unpredictable sense of a short road
An epidemic that comprehends

Vindictive presence, conceived by me
The ultimate empathy
The melting hand controls me
Evidently he will kill me

A splendid parasite
In the wounded gesture of incompetence
Swore to intoxicate the monster
A spellbinder underneath the sky

Useless climate, staring at me
Yearning, yearning to be free
The unpredictable sense of a short road
An epidemic that comprehends
