Underneath the cold November sky
I'll wait, for you
As the pages of my life roll by
I'll wait, for you
I'm so desperate just to see your face
Meet me in this broken place

Hold me now
I need to feel you
Show me how
To make it new again
There's no one I can run to
And nothing I could ever do
I'm nowhere if I'm here
Without you

Even if you take it all away
I'll wait, for you
Even when the light begins to fade
I'll wait, for you
I'm so desperate calling out your name
Meet me in this broken place

Hold me now
I need to feel you
Show me how
To make it new again
There's no one I can run to
And nothing I could ever do
I'm nowhere if I'm here...

I'm tired, of running
And wrestling with these angels
I lay down
My life and I surrender

Hold me now
I need to feel you
Show me how
To make it new again
There's no one I can run to
And nothing I could ever do

Hold me now
I need to feel You
Show me how
To make it new again
There's no one I can run to
And nothing I could ever do
I'm nowhere if I'm here
Without you
