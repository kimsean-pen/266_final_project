What am I talking about
Got to much to say, got too
Much to shout
Should I write it in capital letters
You can figure it out
Why make a nolse if you're deaf
To my words
You think it's a ploy and I'm testing your hurt
How can I show you the truth if
You turn away when I'm bruised
Someone cut the line of
Communication
Someone cut the line
Someone cut the line
No other explanation

I can't get in, I can't get round
I can't get over how you're
Shutting me out
(Shutting me out
Shutting me out)
If I'm to blame then help me
Understand
You can't complain when you're shutting me out
(Shutting me out
Shutting me out)

Is it serious to say or serious
To sing
I notice that whenever the
Melody rings
You take a sentiment and pop it
In the bin and start jamming
Your subliminal took note of all
The things you don't
Your inteliggence is oblivious to
So musc, so much so, you close
So tight that

I can't get in, I can't get round
I can't get over how you're
Shutting me out
(Shutting me out
Shutting me out)
If I'm to blame then help me
Understand
You can't complain when you're shutting me out
(Shutting me out
Shutting me out)

How do you propose that we go
Forward, backward, left or right
And know how to continue on
This path at all, why can't you
See I'm in love with you
Can you step out of your cubby
Hole and hold me tight, speak
Your mind, as we roll on through
Life it'll be alright if you're by
My side
Let go and try let me in so I
Can sit by your side for the rest
Of our lives, get that broken
Line and tie, tie it up tight and
Mend it
Someone cut the line, someone
Cut the line, someone went and
Cut our line
We gotta mend it

I can't get in, I can't get round
I can't get over how you're
Shutting me out
Shutting me out
Shutting me out
If I'm to blame then help me
Understand
You can't complain when you're shutting me out

What am I supposed to do
With that?
Where are we gonna go
With that?
Nowhere
Nowhere good

What am I supposed to do
With that?
Where are we gonna go babe, if
You won't talk me love?
