Rain keeps coming down
On our unhappy town
Grey, its bleak parade
Little drops of heaven's shade
Rain keeps coming down
On children in their paper crowns
Daylight torn away
Litter for the night to raid

Feeling low
My eyes long to glow
My limbs turn numb
And I know the day is won

Give me some of what I need and
Give me more to take away
Sunshine for my sweet relief and
Honey, through these bitter days

Rain keeps coming down
Beating colour to the ground
Teeth spat from wicked mouths
Shrieking up above the clouds
Rain rain all around
Oh, you know it gets me down
I cannot leave my home
Leave the TV, leave the phone

Breathing slow
My heart only knows
The rain falls deep
Drumming down, down on me

Give me some of what I need and
Give me more to take away
Sunshine for my sweet relief and
Honey, through these bitter days

Give me some of what I need and
Give me more to take away
Sunshine for my sweet relief and
Honey, through these bitter days

Give me some of what I need and
Give me more to take away
Sunshine for my sweet relief and
Honey, through these bitter days
