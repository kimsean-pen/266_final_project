I'll play the part of my favorite play
I feel the art in all these ways
Nobody loves a hidden face
So let it just fade away
Kill this part that stays away

Hunting down that face, oh that face
Those subtle rewards
Strike gently chords, mmm

It's coming down for me this way
I'll be calm for you and fearless
It's coming from a heated place
A place that means it's something
It's coming down for me this way
I'll be calm for you and fearless

Follow that line that lead us that way
'Cause there's beauty in not knowing fate
Let's not cave into this fear
'Cause we wanna be right here
Hold that part that we just made
Mmmm, let your voice go
Just put your feet up on that pillow
Let your blood know
Let your blood go
Just hold your breath
Just hold my waist
Just hold my waist
Just hold my waist

It's coming down for me this way
I'll be calm for you and fearless
It's coming from a heated place
A place that means it's something
It's coming down for me this way
I'll be calm for you and fearless
It's coming down for me this way
I'll be calm for you and fearless
It's coming from a heated place
A place that means it's something
