Love is like a potion
It's a chemical
So lead me to the water
Like an animal

But you
You could never hold me
I could never hold you down
And I can't get enough

My heart is a firestorm
And all that I needed was your flame
And now that you've gone out of the door
Tell me who-ooh-ooh could love you more
My heart is a firestorm
And all that I needed was your flame
And now that you've gone out of the door
Tell me who-ooh-ooh could love you more

Tell me who could love you, who
Who could love you
Who could love you
Tell me who-ooh-ooh could love you more

Love is like a river
Let me drift away
Skin on skin
Don't wake me up again

'Cos you
You could never hold me
I could never hold you down
And I can't get enough

My heart is a firestorm
And all that I needed was your flame
And now that you've gone out of the door
Tell me who-ooh-ooh could love you more
My heart is a firestorm
And all that I needed was your flame
And now that you've gone out of the door
Tell me who-ooh-ooh could love you more

Tell me who could love you, who
Who could love you
Who could love you
Who could love you

My heart is a firestorm (firestorm)
And all that I needed was your flame
And now that you've gone out of the door
Tell me who-ooh-ooh could love you more
Tell me who could love you (who could love you baby)
Who could love you
Who could love you
Tell me who-ooh-ooh could love you more
(Ooh baby)
Tell me who-ooh-ooh could love you more
