How long has this been going on?
I found you in the bathtub
With your clothing on
Oh, so what?
Your mother did a number
So I get gloves of rubber
To clean up the spill
Yeah

Young lover, begging you please to wake up
Young lover, I wish that I was your drug
Young lover, I miss the taste of your tongue
Young lover, I wish your love was enough, enough

You say you got no room to talk, babe
You're boozin' on a midday
And I don't see no cake
Oh, but these pills
I can't even pronounce them
Your thousand watts of light dim
Then you're gone again
Yeah

Young lover, begging you please to wake up
Young lover, I wish that I was your drug
Young lover, I miss the taste of your tongue
Young lover, I wish your love was enough, enough, enough

We were in Paris, the Eiffel was shining
All that I wanted was lyin' on tilin'
I heard the robins and thought they were sirens
Wake up, young lover, I thought you were dyin'

Young lover
Young lover
Young lover
Young lover
Young lover
Young lover
Young lover
Young lover
Young lover
Young lover
Young lover
