I ain't saying it ain't beautiful, but he used to be
Who is this right here? She don't look like me
I was sleeping with the demon every night in my bedroom
I guess you are who you keep a reflection of me
That I don't wanna be, no

Oops, look what you made me do
I'm crazy just like you, I'm tainted just like you
Table set for two, look what you made me prove
I'm crazy just like you, I'm tainted just like you
Just like you, just like you

I don't know if you remember what you did to me (uh)
'Cause I can't forget, I see it in my dreams
I've been living in the nightmare, all the shit you put me through
Yeah, tried to break me to pieces
A beast in my life that I don't really need, no

Oops, look what you made me do
I'm crazy just like you, I'm tainted just like you
Table set for two, look what you made me prove
I'm crazy just like you, I'm tainted just like you
Just like you, ooh ooh ooh

Gone girl, I don't ever wanna go back
Thought it was forever, you should know that
Haunted 'til I finally figure out your game, ay
Take a picture in your mind, that's a throwback
Done twisting it up my life, you should roll that
Don't be trippin' on my shadow as I walk away, ay ay

Oops, look what you made me do
I'm crazy just like you, I'm tainted just like you
Table set for two, look what you made me prove
I'm crazy just like you, I'm tainted just like you
Just like you, just like you, ooh ooh ooh ooh

Ra ra ra ra
Da da da da, ra ra, ra ra, ra ra, ra ra
Da da da da da da da
Da da da da ra da da pam
Ra pa pa ra pa pa pa
Pa pa pa pa pa pa pa
Pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh oh, way way off
Belly of the beast, now let's have a feast
Pa ra pa pa
Pa ra pa pa
Pa pa pa pa pa pa pa
