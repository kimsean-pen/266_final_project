Good morning
I love this town man! (Yeah)
Sunshine, 365, everyday
Who's on this track?
Aye, E3, let's go!

I la la la la la love LA
Cause the west coast is the best coast baby
I la la la la la love LA
And these are the girls that I love the most!
When the sun goes down we'll be getting so high we'll be chilling on the
Beach in the summertime
I la la la la la love LA
Wake up to California!

Wake up the sun's about to blow so we turn the record up like ohh
No stress the cowboy's of the West and the women are the best you know
6 floors hop up off the floor pinstripes on the door like ohh
So let's ride the Mulholland drive cause we run the night you know

Stars lined in on Hollywood & Vine sunglasses at night you know we're so fly
Not lying some days we're Kobe Bryant like Blake when we're flying, like birds in
the sky
All in I'm Kayne you're Kim paparazzi movin' in like oh

Outrageous, young wild and famous three hours to vegas
I la la la la la love LA
Cause the west coast is the best coast baby
La la la la la love LA
And these are the girls that I love the most!
When the sun goes down we'll be getting so high we'll be chilling on the
Beach in the summertime
I la la la la la love LA

Wake up to California!
Break's pump we hit the 101 but the traffic ain't nothing like ooh
Come play where it never rains, in-n-out for days like ooh
Mad cholos never riding solo, wanna get taquitos? 10 bucks for valet?!

That's Cali, OC to the valley, let me hear you shout it like ooh
Shoutout if you're with me on the west side,
Holla if you're with me on the east side,

Holla if you're feeling me worldwide, holla if you love LA
I la la la la la love LA
Cause the west coast is the best coast baby
I la la la la la love LA
And these are the girls that I love the most!
When the sun goes down we'll be getting so high we'll be chilling on the
Beach in the summertime
I la la la la la love LA

Wake up to California!

Uh heey, Long beach, Newport, Huntington beach, Venice beach, Santa Monica, Malibu,

Hollywood.
Can we go to California?
I la la la la la love LA
Cause the west coast is the best coast baby
I la la la la la love LA
And these are the girls that I love the most!
When the sun goes down we'll be getting so high we'll be chilling on the
Beach in the summertime
I la la la la la love LA
Wake up to California!
