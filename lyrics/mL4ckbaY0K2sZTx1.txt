Come bathe in
Come witness
The nameless light

No prayers required
You just reach for it

In a sleight of the hand
I find it

Or in Bj√∂rk

Come bathe in
Come witness
The nameless light

And even if time
Reveals the trick

You still look for the signs
You see them all

A grand design
Or hundreds of little slips?

A glowing mind
Or beguiling showmanship?
