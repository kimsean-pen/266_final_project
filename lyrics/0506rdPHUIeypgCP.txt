You've got those bedroom eyes
You've got those bedroom eyes

Slippin' slowly, you're so salty
The way your skin glows in the light
Spin me round and pressed up against you
Oh, this temptation, I won't fight

Heat rushes up to my face
I wanna do it again

Love the way your body feels
Your shape's a sweet reveal
We're staying up tonight
'Cause you've got those bedroom eyes
Love the way your body feels
When we touch, it's so surreal
We're staying up tonight
'Cause you've got those bedroom eyes

You've got those bedroom eyes
'Cause you've got those bedroom eyes
You've got those bedroom eyes
You've got those bedroom eyes

Don't talk to me, baby, hold me (Just hold me)
Oh, I'm like honey in your arms
Just go slowly, you're pressed into me
Don't you know that's my beating heart?

Heat rushes up to my face
I wanna do it again

Love the way your body feels
Your shape's a sweet reveal
We're staying up tonight
'Cause you've got those bedroom eyes
Love the way your body feels
When we touch it's so surreal
We're staying up tonight
'Cause you've got those bedroom eyes

You've got those bedroom eyes
'Cause you've got those bedroom eyes
You've got those bedroom eyes
You've got those bedroom eyes

Heat rushes up to my face
(You've got those bedroom eyes)
I wanna do it again
(You've got those bedroom eyes)
Heat rushes up to my face
(You've got those bedroom eyes)
I wanna do it again

Love the way your body feels
Your shape's a sweet reveal
We're staying up tonight
'Cause you've got those bedroom eyes
Love the way your body feels
When we touch it's so surreal
We're staying up tonight
'Cause you've got those bedroom eyes

You've got those bedroom eyes
'Cause you've got those bedroom eyes
You've got those bedroom eyes
You've got those bedroom eyes
