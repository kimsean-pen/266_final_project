Scab in the shape of my face
A version of me falling tree

Scab in the shape of my heart
You could build a model
Of one that loved so free

Bandages on me
I'm wounded in love
Bandages I need to cut off the blood

Scabs on the skin of my knees
You're making me crawl
Back into the womb

Bandages on me
I'm wounded in love
Bandages I need to cut off the blood

Tied to that pain gripping my soul
It's starting to rain and I'm losing
Losing control
