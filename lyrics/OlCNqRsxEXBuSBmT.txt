I'm passed out on the floor
I wish you would
Stop the room from spinning round
Your eyes are burning and there's noting I can do about it

You'll never be the same x 2

Wet blanket

I'm waiting in the dark
Can't hold it in
Please, please give me what I need
My patience is wearing thin

You'll never be the same x 2
Wet blanket
