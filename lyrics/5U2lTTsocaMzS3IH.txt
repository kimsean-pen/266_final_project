I left you alone by the roadside
I should have noticed it was all pride
That kept me from seeing you're a lost soul
Sinking deeper
Maybe the darkness took a hold of me
Maybe I'm just scared of reality
To tell you the truth I've never felt so lost
I'm getting weaker
Slipping deeper

And I never said I'd be the one
So I'm letting you go
Yeah I'm letting you go
And I never said I'm holding on
So I'm letting you go
'Cause it's better to know
Lately this is nothing more
Than a ritual between me and you
'Cause I never said I'm holding on
So I'm letting you go
Yeah I'm letting you go

We spoke about mostly the life in our heads
But all I can see was your bed
And somehow it left me feeling alone
But it's not just my fault
You keep pulling me in
When you know that I'm easy involved
And my head's fucked, like a drunk
I fall hard at your feet
And it's hard to believe
I believe every word that you wrote

And I never said I'd be the one
So I'm letting you go, yeah I'm letting you go
And I never said I'm holding on
So I'm letting you go, 'cause it's better to know
Lately this is nothing more than a ritual between me and you
'Cause I never said I'm holding on
So I'm letting you go

And I said something stupid like
Fill my veins with poison
I'm so tired of all the noise
'Cause if I go I'll go out now with silent grace and poise
'Cause I'm always broke
And I'm almost broken

And I never said I'd be the one
So I'm letting you go, yeah I'm letting you go
And I never said I'm holding on
So I'm letting you go
'Cause it's better to know
Lately this is nothing more
Than a ritual between me and you
'Cause I never said I'm holding on
So I'm letting you go
