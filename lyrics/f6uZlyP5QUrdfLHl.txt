Visions from the altar
Ripping through your soul
Seeing through the master's eyes
Young flesh the goal

Brutal rampage
Destroy the house of Christ
Obey your master
Another victim violently dies
Head torn off
A trophy raised to the sky

Bloody priest
Dies in pain
Stomach chewed open
Lying on the grave

As you bathe in the piss
Your master rains upon your face
Hear the calling from the abyss
Pagan destroyer crushes your face

Final reward
Bestowed upon you
Look into his eyes
As your head is removed
