Friends tell me I am crazy
That I'm wasting time with you
you'll never be mine
Just be good to me
just be good to me

Huh just be good to green
All I need is a woman to be good to me
I'm an easy man, I'm easily pleased
and you provide me with everything that I need,
Look, you know I make ends off crime
so hold on to yours, we're spending mine
Though you try, I'll never let you by
But if I was broke, would you still be spending time? Yes
And I believe you would
Don't think P's too f@#ked to treat you good
I'll walk street with you, Yes; talk deep with you, Yes
Even slip and spend all week with you, and I'm off
You wish I'd put an end to the torment,
Stop, but one thing it's not ever, is boring
What would you rather me be like,
I ain't ever gonna change, are you ever going to realize?

(People always talk about)
Look, anekatips people are always going to talk, babes
(reputation)
I'm not even going to lie, sh! t,
it ain't like you to know what mine is
(I don't care what you do to them just be good to me)
I'll try, I'll try, I'll try

Look, babes, you know who I am,
But as crooked as I am, I'll be as good as I can
I can try and try, but we'll settle that
my angel face is disguise for the devil inside
You're good to me, I ain't good to girls me
I'm a bad boy something every good girl kill me?
Honesty can avoid all your tantrums
but I'm a naughty boy and I always have been
What, and I ain't changing anytime soon,
I can't have you with me whenever I move
Whatever I do, I come back to you,
See, the good attracts me and the crook attracts you Whatever
What, we all got our ways, remember us talking
of course it was game
But it's all gonna change, now she got me cutting off links
like I'm trying to shorten my chain

(People always talk about)
Look, people are always going to talk, babes
(reputation)
I ain't even going to lie, shit, it ain't like you to know what mine is
(I don't care what you do to them, just be good to me)
I'll try, I'll try, I'll try

Friends are always telling me
You're a user
Professor Green
Not me, anekatips not ever
Ain't no other man going to treat you better
Lily Allen
I don't care what you do to them, just be good to me
Professor Green
I'll try, I'll try, I'll try

I'll be good to you, you'll be good to me
We can be together, be together (just be good to me)
I'll be good to you, you'll be good to me
We can be together, be together (just be good to me)
Why you always gotta listen to your friend
why you always listenin' to them
Why you always gotta listen to your friend
I don't care what you do to them, just be good to me
