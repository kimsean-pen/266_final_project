Did you ever fall in love
At the right time or place
Does it always have to move
At its own kinda pace

When you're driving on cruise control
Coming up a bumpy ride
And your heart is back in shape
Then it hits you with no chance to hide

But don't you miss out on the way
Don't find a reason to say

Coulda Woulda Shoulda
But I didn't do that
(You gotta) Give it a shot
Dare to believe
And don't say you...
Coulda Woulda Shoulda
(But I didn't do that)
Just throw in everything you've got
Coz in love there's no holding back

Don't tell me that you played it safe
Coz you're afraid to hurt your neck
On that rollercoaster trip
Never knowing what you'd get

Do you wanna be cynical
On a date with destiny
Giving up the greatest rush
Who knows what it turns out to be

Don't you miss out on the way
Don't find a reason to say

Coulda Woulda Shoulda
(But I didn't do that)
(you gotta) give it a shot
Dare to believe
And don't say you...
Coulda Woulda Shoulda
(but I didn't do that)
Just throw in everything you've got
Coz in love there's no holding back

Ooohh

It's meant to be
But don't think about it
Let love run free
Coz you're on your way

Follow your heart where it's calling on you
Don't you say...

But I didn't do that
I didn't do that baby
Gotta believe it...
Coulda Woulda Shoulda
Oh!, but I didn't do that
You gotta give it a shot
Dare to believe
And don't say you...
Coulda Woulda Shoulda
But I didn't do that
Just throw in everything you've got
Coz in love there's no holding back
Didn't do that
Coulda Woulda Shoulda
Just throw in everything you've got
Coz in love there's no holding back.
