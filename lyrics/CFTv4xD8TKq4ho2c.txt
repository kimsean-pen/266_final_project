Joey...
Baby...
Don't get crazy
Detours, fences...
I get defensive...

I know you've heard it all before
So I don't say it anymore
I just stand by and let you
Fight your secret war

And though I used to wonder why
I used to cry till I was dry
Still sometimes I get a strange pain inside
Oh Joey if you're hurting so am I

Joey...
Honey...
I've got the money

All is forgiven.
Listen... listen...

But if I seem to be confused
I didn't mean to be with you.
And when you said I scared you
Well, I guess you scared me too
But we got lucky once before
And I don't want to close the door
And if you're somewhere out there
Passed out on the floor...

Oh...
Joey, I'm not angry anymore

And if I seem to be confused
I didn't mean to be with you.
And when you said I scared you
Well I guess you scared me too...

But if it's love you're looking for
Then I can give a little more
And if you're somewhere drunk and
Passed out on the floor...

Oh...
Joey, I'm not angry anymore
Angry anymore, angry anymore
