You're on my "middle of the night" mind
It sure ain't the first time
I've been loving you all my life
You know it's going to be a long night

Ain't no sleeping when your heart breaks
I've been lying here wide awake
It don't tell you how hard it can ache
Just lying in the moonlight with my mistakes

You're on my "middle of the night" mind
And, baby, I don't want to cry
I've done enough of that to last me a lifetime
But I've been missing that light in your eyes, oh

How could I have known?
And I can feel the lonely in my bones, oh, oh, oh

You're on my "middle of the night" mind
I've been staring at the black sky
For some reason those stars don't shine
The same way since we said goodbye, bye

Caravan moving on the train tracks
I can hear it rolling past
Maybe this one's bringing you back
Sometimes I can tell myself that, oh

Truth be be told I know somewhere in my soul
You won't come home, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

You're on my "middle of the night" mind
Ain't gonna be the last time
I'll be loving you all my life
It's going to be another long night
