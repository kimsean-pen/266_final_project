Will this feeling ever leave?
You promised you'd stay
Said it's too late
Oh yeah, and I explained
No, this feeling never will leave
Stuck in my brain
Inside all day
Is life okay?
Now this feeling ever leave?
And why would I wait
For things to change
They stay the same
So strange

So strange
To feel this way

Never faded
Fading again
Faded
I'm fading again
Faded
Faded away
You're fading
You're fading again

Someday
Why not always
No, this feeling never leaves
Inside all day
In your own way
Is life okay?
And every time you see me you say
"Jimmy it's okay to feel this way, I know it's so strange"
Strange

So strange
To feel this way

Never faded
Faded again
Faded
I'm fading again
Faded
Fading away
You're fading
You're fading again
So strange
To be this way
So strange
Are you fading?
Fade away
You're fading
Fading again
So strange
To be this way
So strange
To be this way
