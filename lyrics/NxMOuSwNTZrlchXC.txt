One last moment
The days were closing in
The rays of light
Was filtering in

Was no more secrets
No words could tell
The pace of time
Was gathering

And you saved yourself for me
And you lead me to the sense of discovery

Waiting for a moment that you think won't come
Belief is navigation but you must go on
The heart is like the tender one that cannot see
Inside this world's discovery

From the desert to the ocean we'll be following the sun
Put your hand on me now it's just begun
The heart is like the tender one that cannot see
Inside these walls just you and me

So put your hand on me

One last moment
The ways were loathing in
The ray of light
Was filtering in

And you placed your hands on me

Waiting for a moment that you think won't come
Belief is navigation but you must go on
The heart is like the tender one that cannot see
Inside this world's discovery

From the desert to the ocean we'll be following the sun
Put your hand on me now it's just begun
The heart is like the tender one that cannot see
Inside these walls just you and me

So put your hand on me
So wild, see
That rage will dissolve
Like the wind endlessly

Put your life cast away your soul
When you lead me to the sense of discovery

So narrow, see
That the rage will dissolve
Life will remain
Endlessly

Inside this world's discovery

Waiting for a moment that you think won't come
Belief is navigation but you must go on
The heart is like the tender one that cannot see
Inside these walls just you and me

From the desert to the ocean we'll be following the sun
Put your hand on me now it's just begun
The heart is like the tender one that cannot see
Inside this world's discovery

Waiting for a moment that you think won't come
Belief is navigation but you must go on
The heart is like the tender one that cannot see
(Put your hand on me)
From the desert to the ocean we'll be following the sun
Put your hand on me now it's just begun
The heart is like the tender one that cannot see
(Put your hand on me)
Waiting for a moment that you think won't come
Belief is navigation but you must go on
The heart is like the tender one that cannot see
