So Later that year, the bodies came home,
To Dover wrapped in flags and lined up in rows,
With no one to see and no one to know,
They had to keep morale from getting low:

And the voice inside my head just repeating,
"This is not the way we were told that it was going to be:
This is not the way we were told that it was going to be:"

(And we know who's to blame)
(And we know who's to blame)
(And we know who's to blame)
We did the math, it wasn't worth it after all,
We did the math, it wasn't worth it after all, (And we know who's to blame)
We did the math, it wasn't worth it after all,
We did the math, it wasn't worth it after all, (And we know who's to blame)
