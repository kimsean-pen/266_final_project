I was calling
For the last time
We've been here before
They found the pictures in the snow
I can tell your eyes
Looked beneath the blue
I walk underneath the trees
For the first time

For the last time
We've been here before
Found the pictures in the snow
Found the pictures in the snow
I walk underneath the trees

For the first time
