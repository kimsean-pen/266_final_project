Excuse me
If I bore you
When I talk about the things I like to do
Excuse me
If I'm not like them
I'd always liked to think there's something else out there

For us, the world is a gift
A spin is a day
A turn is a year
And if the day give us rain
Let's stare at the falling drops

In the air that I breathe when we wonder outside
Touch of sunlight when the woods getting dark
Slow down the pace of the clocks in our heads
So we can keep shaping the clouds

Excuse me
Is what you told me
When I didn't listen what you had to say
Maybe I am just like them
Forgetting you could also choose a way

Your view land they'd mind
Are two colour filters blazing my sky
Alone but together we'll share
The touch, the taste, the smell

Oh, the air that I breathe when we're wonder outside
Touch of sunlight when the words getting dark
Slow down the pace of the clocks in our heads
So we can keep shaping the clouds

Excuse me
Is what you told me
When I didn't listen what you had to say
Maybe I am just like them
Forgetting you could also choose a way

Your view land they'd mind
Are two colour filters blazing my sky
Alone but together we'll share
The touch, the taste, the smell

Oh, the air that I breathe when we're wonder outside
Touch of sunlight when the words getting dark
Slow down the pace of the clocks in our heads
So we can keep shaping the clouds
