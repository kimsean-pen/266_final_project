I don't really want no weed (Hell yeah)
I don't really want no friends (Hell yeah)
I don't really need no whip (Hell yeah)
I don't really want no ends (Hell yeah)

I don't really want no bitch (Hell yeah)
I don't really want no top (Hell yeah)
I don't really want no hope (Paah)
I don't really want no hoe (Hell yeah)
I don't really want no life (Hell yeah)
I don't even really wanna die (Hell yeah)
I don't really wanna do shit, bitch
World got me down and I wanna just quit (Hell yeah)
I don't wanna play no shows (Hell yeah)
I don't wanna make no clothes (Hell yeah)
I don't wanna write you a verse (Bitch, yeah)
I don't wanna talk no more

I don't really want no weed (Hell yeah)
I don't really want no friends (Hell yeah)
I don't really need no whip (Hell yeah)
I don't really want no ends (Hell yeah)

This world is a school
No one expects to stay in school forever

Sever the limbs off my torso and burn what remains
Shouts out to Coheed
I would not be alive if I gave in to one of the times that I wanted to be 6 feet deep beneath all of our feet
I've given up on giving up I found a reason to be in hopes you will deify me
I'm sick of writing I would rather be in Andromeda that way it would take a billion years for you to find me

Candle wax burns on her back in the shape of a pentacle
