I am temperamental
Like a heart without a home
I am sentimental
But you dont know me at all

I have expectations
I wanna be the one you call
And I want a conversation
But you dont know me at all

Hold on tight
I am
Im a revolution
Close your eyes
I am, I am
I'll blow your mind
I am
Im a revolution
Why do i have to explain
Who I am again and again
I am

I know what you're thinkin
I can tell what you're waitin for
But I think that you're pretendin
But you dont fool me at all

If you knew me at all
You'd take my picture
And you'd hang it on your wall

Hold on tight
I am
Im a revolution
Close your eyes
I am, I am
I'll blow your mind
I am
Im a revolution
Why do i have to explain
Who i am again and again
I am

I didnt know that you've been wanting me
Oh how's a girl supposed to know
Just when you think that it's all tragedy
Dont worry baby I'll go slow

Hold on tight
I am
I'm a revolution
Close your eyes
I am, I am
I'll blow your mind
I am
Im a revolution
Why do I have to explain
(Why do i have to explain)
Who I am again and again

Hold on tight
I am
Im a revolution
Close your eyes
I am, I am
I'll blow your mind
I am
Im a revolution
Why do I have to explain
Who i am again and again
I am
