It's really hard
I can't cry in your arms cause you're not here
It's not your fault and if it was I wouldn't care
My heart is bigger than the distance in between us
I know it cause I feel it beating

So strong it'll knock you down
So strong, So strong

Over here
Can't count the miles away from where I wanna be
Bet your skin is warm and that you're smiling
Yeah, that's what I always loved the most about you
You're so strong, come and knock me down

Baby, if I'm half the man I say I am
If I'm a woman with no fear just like I claim I am
Then I believe in what you say, there's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is you.

I'll get in my car
Driving faster than I ever did before
Head out west until I finally reached the shore
Then I'll swim out to wherever you are
And we'll ride the undercurrent down to the floor

Making friends with all the unfamiliar creatures,
Push your back on the unnecessary pressure,
Come up for air just so you know we wont drown
You're so strong
The world can't keep us down, hey!

Baby if I'm half the man I say I am
If I'm a woman with no fear just like I claim I am
Then I believe in what you say, there's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is you.

So do you love me?
All you gotta do is say yes
Now do you love me?
And I won't ever second guess
Now do you love me?
All you gotta do is say yes
Now do you love me?
Then you already proved it.

Baby, if I'm half the man I say I am
If I'm a woman with no fear just like I claim I am
Then I believe in what you say, there's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is

Baby if I'm half the man I say I am
If I'm a woman with no fear just like I claim I am
Then I believe in what you say, there's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is you.
