She was there just sitting at the table
Thinking now that things won't be the same
And would you like to go with me
And she answer no to me
But I guess I learned my lesson

Much too soon
I never thought she'd leave me here forever
But who knows just what the future brings
And would you like to go with me
And she answered no to me
But I guess I learned my lesson

Much too soon
Take away this never ending sorrow
Take this lonely feeling from my soul
If only I knew what things bring tomorrow
She'd be sitting here beside me

And my heart would fill with gold
I hope to make a change now for the better
Never letting fate control my soul
And hoping that my prayers will see
The day that you'll come back to me
But I guess I learned my lesson
Much too soon
ohooo
Yes, I guess I learned my lesson
Much too soon
