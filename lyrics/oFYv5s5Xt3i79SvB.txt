I won't compromise
I won't live a life
On my knees
You
Think
I am nothing
I am nothing
You've
Got
Something coming
Something coming
Because

I hear God's Whisper
Calling my name
It's in the wind
I am the savior
(Sing It Again!)
Savior
Savior
(I can't hear you!)
Savior
Savior

We are
Indigos
(Savior, Savior)
Living
Lives we chose
(Savior, Savior)
Show you're brave
Those will fade
(Savior, Savior)
On a mission
Led by intuition
You should listen
Because

I hear God's Whisper
Calling my name
It's in the wind
I am the savior
I hear God's Whisper
Calling my name
It's in the wind
I am the savior

WE ARE THE SAVIORS!

I hear God's Whisper
Calling my name

WE ARE THE SAVIORS!

It's in the wind
I am the savior

WE ARE THE SAVIORS!

I hear God's Whisper
Calling my name

WE ARE THE SAVIORS!

It's in the wind
I am the savior

WE ARE THE SAVIORS

SAVIOR
SAVIOR
SAVIOR
SAVIOR
SAVIOR
