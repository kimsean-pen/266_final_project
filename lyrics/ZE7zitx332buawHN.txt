Two little notes in the universe
A melody no one's ever heard
We light a fire and we let it burn
In a place we call planet Earth
Your boneless tongue will heal
My aching heart and soul
Two little notes in the universe
Keep on breathing, keep on 'til it hurts

Bleed until you learn to love

We are bodies, we are flesh and lungs
We are soldiers in a war that can't be won
That can't be won
We are bo-, we are bo-
We are bodies, we are bodies
We are alive

(Oh oh, oh oh)
(Oh oh, oh oh)
We are alive
(Oh oh, oh oh)
(Oh oh, oh oh)

My heart's beating like it's full of rage
My ribs feel like a metal cage
Kill the demons and we'll run away
This is our time, it's our great escape
Bleed until you learn to love

We are bodies, we are flesh and lungs
We are soldiers in a war that can't be won
That can't be won
We are bo-, we are bo-
We are bodies, we are bodies
We are alive

(Oh oh, oh oh)
(Oh oh, oh oh)
Alive
(Oh oh, oh oh)
(Oh oh, oh oh)

(Oh oh, oh oh)
(Oh oh, oh oh)

We are bodies, we are flesh and lungs
We are soldiers in a war that can't be won
That can't be won
We are bo-, we are bo-
We are bodies, we are bodies
We are alive

(Oh oh, oh oh)
(Oh oh, oh oh)
Alive
(Oh oh, oh oh)
(Oh oh, oh oh)
