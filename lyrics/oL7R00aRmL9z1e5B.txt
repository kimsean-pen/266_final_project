Well we don't need no one to tell us what to do
Oh yes we're on our own and there's nothing you can do
So we don't need no one like you
To tell us what to do

We don't refer to the past when we're showing what we've done
Our generation gap means the war is never won
The past is in your head
The future's in our hands

'Cause I'm a brat
And I know everything
And I talk back
'Cause I'm not listening
To anything you say

And if you count to three (one two three)
You'll see there's no emergency
You'll see I'm not the enemy
Just a prisoner of society

Well we don't need no one to tell us what to do
Oh yes we're on our own and there's nothing you can do
So we don't need no one like you
To tell us what to do

'Cause I'm a brat
And I know everything
And I talk back
'Cause I'm not listening
To anything you say

And if you count to three (one two three)
You'll see there's no emergency
You'll see I'm not the enemy
Just a prisoner of society

Well we don't need no one to tell us what to do
Oh yes we're on our own and there's nothing you can do

To tell us what to do

We don't refer to the past when we're showing what we've done
Our generation gap means the war is never won
So we don't need no one like you
To tell us what to do

Cos I'm a brat
And I know everything
And I talk back
Cos I'm not listening
To anything you say

And if you count to three
You'll see there's no emergency
You'll see I'm not the enemy
Just a prisoner of society society society society
