Should we believe that human beings, are just material things?
Destined to grasp with a little bit of happiness?
But without a purpose do we do mean what we are good for?
Do our philosophies make sense when we truly test them?

I'm more than just a ghost in the machine
Not just a hollow vessel aimlessly sailing

Can we battle a crisis of the conscience alone?
Life is a guilt trip, it was a built into system that we went with
We can't seem to escape it
So we worship our idols and expect them to save us

I'm more than just a ghost in the machine
Not just a hollow vessel aimlessly sailing
It's not easy to believe what our eyes can see
But I am more than just a ghost in the machine

I cannot be explained, no
I am no coincidence
Take me apart and put me back together again
I cannot be explained, no
I am no coincidence
Take me apart and put me back together again

I'm more than just a ghost in the machine
Not just a hollow vessel aimlessly sailing
It's not easy to believe what our eyes can see
But I am more than just a ghost in the machine
