I remember suffering with every single word they said
I could always feel them, I could always feel them
And even when I ran away, the voices in my head, they stayed
I could always hear them, I could always hear them

Alone inside
I wish that I could die

All this hate will burn your life down
All the pain, you cause your own suffering
Tell me when you look in the mirror and talk to yourself, do you even see at all?
All this hate, you chose to throw your life away, do you even see at all?

All your little shameful looks were buried in my heart like hooks
I didn't wanna be here, you told me I was evil
And when I finally ran away, just trying to escape that pain
I wanted to believe I belonged somewhere on my own

All this hate will burn your life down
All the pain, you cause your own suffering
Tell me when you look in the mirror and talk to yourself, do you even see at all?
All this hate, you chose to throw your life away, do you even see at all?

Alone inside
I wish that I could die
Alone inside
I wish that I could die
Alone inside
Alone inside

All this hate will burn your life down
All the pain, you cause your own suffering
Tell me when you look in the mirror and talk to yourself, do you even see at all?
All this hate, you chose to throw your life away, do you even see at all?
