Dry your eyes, boy
There's no need to be sad
Forget about yesterday and the bad times that you've had
You've loved and lost, and now you're feeling so blue
But can't you see it's me who really loves you

With the love I've got you'll forget about her
And find it easy
To live without her

It's only springtime,
Ooh, you're too young to say you're through with love
It's only springtime,
and I'll be different boy
I promise you
I swear to you

Once more you tell me
About her new friend
You say your heart's
Been broken again
How many times
Have you looked into my eyes
Don't you realise we're two of a kind

With the love I've got you'll forget about her
And find it easy
To live without her

It's only springtime
Hey, you're too young to say you're through with love
It's only springtime
And I'll be different
I'll be different
I swear to you

I've been watching
All your love affairs
Three years now
Don't you think I care
How many times
Have you looked into my eyes
Don't you realise we're two of a kind

It's only springtime
You're too young to say you're through, love
It's only springtime
And I'll be different,
I'll be different, boy, yeah

It's only springtime,
You're too young to say you're through, love
Through with love

It's only springtime
I promise you
I swear you
Ooh, I promise you
It's only springtime
Ooh, ooh...
It's only springtime...
