time is always now here forever,

time is always now gone never,
his son a lesson born of a peasant,
here, now, forever,
now, forever,

run run run away, to a land far away,
maria ran with passion not seen in women,
i've been poisoned by god,
i will never marry, 'till i'm ready,
mommy i love you.
honey it's 8 o'clock,
honey! it's 8 o'clock
honey! it's 8 o'clock! it's 8 o clock
