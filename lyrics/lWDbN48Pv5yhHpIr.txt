Pretty tough, pretty tough

If I was so innocent, would I be your prisoner?
If I was so innocent, would I be your prisoner?
If I was so in, if I was so in
If I was so in, if I was so innocent
So you relax
and turn your back
But you know nothing, nothing
You know nothing, nothing
So you relax
and turn your back
But you know nothing, nothing
You know nothing, nothing

If I was so innocent, would I be your prisoner?
If I was so innocent, would I be your prisoner?
If I was so in, if I was so in
If I was so in, if I was so innocent
Hear my voice, a little???
It's my choice, don't under estimate
Love destroys and complicates
and it won't to place, and it won't to place
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

You think I'm pretty, oh?
Well I can be pretty tough, pretty tough
Push me a little low, I can get a little rough, a little rough!

If I was so innocent, would I be your prisoner?
If I was so innocent, would I be your prisoner?
If I was so in, if I was so in
If I was so in, if I was so innocent

If I was so innocent, would I be your prisoner?
If I was so innocent, would I be your prisoner?
If I was so in, if I was so in
If I was so in, if I was so innocent

You think I'm pretty, oh?
Well I can be pretty tough, pretty tough
Push me a little low, I can get a little rough, a little rough
