Jeremy bender was a man of leisure
Took his pleasure in the evening sun
Laid him down in a bed of roses
Finally decided to become a nun

Talk with the sister, spoke in a whisper
Threatened to fist her if she didn't come clean
Jumped on the mother just like a brother
Asked one another if the other is a queen

Diggin' the sister she was a mister
Shouldn't have kissed her, but he couldn't say no
Wanted to leave her couldn't believe her
So he picked up his suit-case and decided to go
