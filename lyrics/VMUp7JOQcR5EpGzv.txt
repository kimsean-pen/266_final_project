Always, so clear.
That you could not stay, here.
You could not see what we saw,
at night.Time wont, wait for
either of us.
We dont belong.
Never, better.
We both know,
it's good that you're gone

A harsh confession,
divergent obsession.
It came as no surprise,
our ears, your eyes
A short reality,
displayed for all to see.
Enough for far too long.
We both know,
it's good that you're goneTime wont, wait for
either of us.
We dont belong.
Never, better.
We both know,
it's good that you're gone
