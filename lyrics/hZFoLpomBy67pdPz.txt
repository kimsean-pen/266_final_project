Take a look at me, what do you see?
You think you know the pain in my life
You think you know the pain in my eyes
How could you know you're not in this life without you?

(Release this man, release this man)
I'll fight through all of my troubles
Because I wanted more, I needed more
You'll never know what this life feels like

So how long it's been since we've been friends?
I thought I've been this time in my life
(Time in my life)
It's changing my life
(Changing my life)
So let's sacrifice without

(Release this man)
I'll fight through all of my troubles
Because I wanted more, I needed more
You'll never know what this life feels like

I leave behind all my struggles
Because I wanted more, I needed more
You'll never know what this life feels like
You'll never know what this life feels like

Yeah
Please, let go of me
Let go of me
Let go of me
Let go of me
Let go of me
Let go of me

I'll fight through all of my troubles
Because I wanted more, I needed more
You'll never know what this life feels like

I leave behind all my struggles
Because I wanted more, I needed more
You'll never know what this life feels like
You'll never know what this life feels like
You'll never know what this life feels like

So mythical, I'm missing those
The size of those who's in my heart
The size of those of who's in my heart
The stars reside without you
