Free -- that's all that she can bleed
That's why'll she'll never stay
White -- bare naked in the night
An' lookin' for some play
Just another girl that wants to rule the world
At any time or place
And when she gets into your head
You know she's there to stay

You want it
She's got it
Molly's chamber gonna change your mind
She's got your -- your pistol!
Molly's chamber gonna change your mind
Molly's chamber gonna change your mind

Slow -- she's burnin' in your soul
With whispers in your ear
It's okay, I'll give it anyway
Just get me out of here
You'll plead -- you'll get down on your knees
For just another taste
And when ya think she's let ya in
That's when she fades away

You want it
She's got it
Molly's chamber gonna change your mind
She's got your -- your pistol!
Molly's chamber gonna change your mind
Molly's chamber gonna change your mind

You want it
Well she's got it
Molly's chamber gonna change your mind
She's got your -- your pistol!
Molly's chamber gonna change your mind
You want it
Well she's got it
Molly's chamber gonna change your mind
She's got your -- your pistol!
