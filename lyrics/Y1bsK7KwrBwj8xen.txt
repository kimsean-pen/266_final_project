Wanna control myself
but I can't let it go
and I wanna control myself
but it's all that I know

Change your mind
change your heart
change your life
change the start of this
in mind, in mind
oo

Wanna control myself
but I can't let it go
and I wanna control myself
but it's all that I know

I am not taken
but you wanna get me again
I feel my heart in my chest
It's like I'm being put the test
I am lost, taken
I just gotta have you again
Cos I'm gonna fight til the death
Oh and I'm being pushed to the end

Don't be mad at me no
But I let you fool me again
Its so much more than emotion
Its so much more than a threat

Wanna control myself
but I can't let it go
and I wanna control myself
but its all that I know
know know know.

I hear the sirens
I hear the sirens
I hear the sirens
coming back for more
I hear the sirens
I hear the sirens
I hear the sirens
it's the final call
I hear the sirens
I hear the sirens
I hear the sirens
coming back for more
