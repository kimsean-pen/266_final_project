I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart
In my heart I have but one desire
And that one is you no other will do

I've lost all ambition for wordly acclaim
I just want to be the one you love
And with your admission that you feel the same
I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of believe me
I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart

I've lost all ambition for wordly acclaim
I just want to be the one you'd love
And with your admission that you feel the same
I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of believe me
I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart
