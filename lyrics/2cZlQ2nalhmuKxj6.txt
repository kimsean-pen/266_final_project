When we got to Boston
There was a TV in the room
You were glowing purple, green, red, black and blue
And the light in the night slammed the door

When we went downtown
All the babies laughed, clapped at our jokes
And when the doctor called it off
You ran straight through the snow
Shut your eyes to see, but you didn't see me

Down in the dark halls
We knew that the stark walls said it all
And for the first time
I found the lines to a childhood memory:
"We have the choice to breathe and it's gonna be me"

And you may think you lost it
Take away, yes you may think you lost it
Don't even wonder anymore
Erase your mind, turn 'round and slowly walk away
Slam the door

And you may think you lost it
Take away, yes you may think you lost it
Don't even wonder anymore
Erase your mind, turn 'round and slowly walk away
Slam the door
