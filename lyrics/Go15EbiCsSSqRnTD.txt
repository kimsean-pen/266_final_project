So close but I still cannot hear it
Something exciting is gonna happen
Don't wanna share, don't wanna show
I want to be the only one to know

Grow on me, what's in there hiding?
I will fall through the wall of silence

Take off to a place I've never seen
I'll find it from my helicopter
Away from who I used to be
I'll get there in my helicopter

Don't worry now, don't make a promise
You know I won't ever be careless
I won't forget, won't change my mind
I won't kill anything I leave behind

Let me grow, there is no more hiding
Go, go, go, through the wall of silence

Take off to a place I've never seen
I'll find it from my helicopter
Away from who I used to be
I'll get there in my helicopter

Take off to a place I've never seen
I'll find it from my helicopter
Away from who I used to be
I'll get there in my helicopter

Take off to a place I've never seen
I'll find it from my helicopter
Away from who I used to be
I'll get there in my helicopter
