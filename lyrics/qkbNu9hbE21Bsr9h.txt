Bred to feel an unfamiliar touch
Lust begins and ends with both of us
Keep me close, drag me down
In the wake of shallow waves you leave

Fill the void like fingers in my mouth
Spread slowly like a plague I've invited into me
Emotions cast like stones skipped across empty lakes
And selfishly I sink

Cure your rust from within
No desire lives past dawn
Nocturnal by default
Speak softly
Drive a nail through both of my lips if you must
We whisper as a metaphor for trust

Absence of affection
Not worth the cancer I have caused
Sever the ties to keep from stringing this along
Keep me close
Suspended just out of arms reach
No vacant pair of wings were ever fit to hold me
Keep me close
In the wake of shallow waves you leave
The water left me filthy
But somehow you're completely clean

Cure your rust from within
No desire lives past dawn
Nocturnal by default
Speak softly
Drive a nail through both of my lips if you must
We whisper as a metaphor for trust

Selfishly I sink
No vacant pair of wings were ever fit to hold me
Drag me down
Selfishly I sink
