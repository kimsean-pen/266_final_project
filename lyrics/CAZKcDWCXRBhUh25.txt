Do you know what's in the North?
Have you seen at least one tree?
Do you know what's in the South?
Have you felt an ocean breeze?

I am, and you are
On an Island
I am, and you are
On an Island
On a Bering Island

Do you know what's in the East?
Have you seen the cliffs?
Do you know what's in the West?
Have you heard the high winds?

I am, and you are
On an Island
On a Bering Island
I am, and you are
On an Island
I am, and you are
On an Island
I am, and you are
On an Island
On a Bering Island
