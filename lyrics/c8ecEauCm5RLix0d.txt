Hello, are you lonely, like I am?
Slowly thinking like I am?
And now you're calling on the fact that I wanna say
Everything is fine, everything's okay
Can you hear me?
Slowly round and round we go
But there's never time
Never understanding why we walk the line
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me...
I ask cause nobody's home...
Can you hear me?
Outside and I'm all alone
So come around and we can talk through all that's wrong
And you can pretend that you knew it all along
Calling on the fact that I wanna say
Everything is fine, everything's okay
Can you hear me?
Slowly... round and round we go
But there's never time
Never understanding why we walk the line
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me...
Can you hear me?
I ask cause nobody's home
Can you hear me?
Outside and I'm all alone
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
