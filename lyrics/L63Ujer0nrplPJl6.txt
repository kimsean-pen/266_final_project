I know, know what can I expect, you're just a man, just a man
But even, but even a man should understand his woman, so

I don't want you back, I don't want you back here with me
I don't wanna get back, no no, get back to what we used to be
I just wanna be free, free to be what I wanna be
I just wanna be me, I just wanna be me and only me

This girl, I say this girl had so many things she couldn't say to you
Couldn't tell you
This girl had so many things she had to hide from you
Couldn't show you, so

I don't want you back, I don't want you back here with me
I don't wanna get back, get back, get back to what we used to be
I just wanna be free, free to be what I wanna be
