I don't know just what I'll do
Every time you walk into the room
Oh, my head is spinning around
And I can't see clearly right now

I'm wasted, I'm so wasted on you
I'm wasted, I'm so wasted on you

I don't know if I'll survive
In this magical land behind your eyes
And there's all these funny little men
They're all asking me to dance and sing

I'm wasted, I'm so wasted on you
I'm wasted, I'm so wasted on you

Red and yellow, pink and green
Purple and orange and blue
Are all of the colors I see, my love
Every time I see you

I'm wasted, I'm so wasted on you
I'm wasted, I'm so wasted on you
I'm wasted, I'm so wasted on you
I'm wasted, I'm so wasted on you
