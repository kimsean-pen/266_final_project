It's gonna be another lonely night
One more and I'm gonna die
Wired out waiting for the sign
Cause you're a risk and I'm borderline
All I know is I've been sitting with this fire and it burns inside
Man if you want me to walk your line then dont stop at 8 no lets take it
To the 9's
I know that we should lay out and love
Because man I really need it
To the 9's
I may be full but It's not enough
Come and show me how to feel it
It's gonna be another lonely night
One more and I'm gonna die
Wired out waiting for the sign
Cause you're a risk and I'm borderline
All or nothing
You know that's how I play the game and I'm ready now
Man if you want me, come cross the line and
Slide up to 8 then lets take it
To the 9's
I know that we should lay out and love
Because man I really need it
To the 9's
I may be full but It's not enough
Come and show me how to feel it
It's gonna be another lonely night
One more and I'm gonna die
Wired out waiting for the sign
Cause you're a risk and I'm borderline
It's gonna be another lonely night
One more and I'm gonna die
Wired out waiting for the sign
Cause you're a risk and I'm borderline
Ye I'm borderline
Can you feel it now?
And I'm borderline
And I'm borderline
And I'm borderline
It's gonna be another lonely night
One more and I'm gonna die
Wired out waiting for the sign
Cause you're a risk and I'm borderline
Ye I'm borderline
Can you feel it now?
