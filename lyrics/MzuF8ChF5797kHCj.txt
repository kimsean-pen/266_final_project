Every time I hear this groove, it makes me want to move.
Must be the feeling it brings to you that makes you feel what to do.
I know I can't keep still for I don't mind to hold you within.
When it comes, I start to yell, the next down on the floor.

Green lights start to flash, telling me it's time to go.
Sirens start to sound, that means for me to get on down.
It's time to move, time to get loose, anywhere you are.
It's time to groove, me and you out there on the floor.

There's no way to keep on grooving, no matter how you try.
And around, you feel that pain, I wouldn't tell you no lie.
Mister DJ, let the music play, play it all night long.
There's something, the rhythm of the beat that makes me carry on.

Green lights start to flash, telling me it's time to go.
Sirens start to sound, that means for me to get on down.
It's time to move, time to get loose, anywhere you are.
It's time to groove, me and you out there on the floor.

Feeyy it's time to let out the flow control, feeyy it's time to boogie.
Feeyy it's time to let out the flow control, feeyy it's time to boogie.
Time to moooooooooove, time to groooooooooove.

Green lights start to flash, telling me it's time to go.
Sirens start to sound, that means for me to get on down.
It's time to move, time to get loose, anywhere you are.
It's time to groove, me and you out there on the floor.

Feeyy it's time to let out the flow control, feeyy it's time to boogie.
Feeyy it's time to let out the flow control, feeyy it's time to boogie.
Feeyy it's time to let out the flow control, feeyy it's time to boogie.
Feeyy it's time to let out the flow control, feeyy it's time to boogie.

Time to break it all down, do it all around.
Time to break it all down, do it all around.
Time to break it all down, do it all around.
Time to break it all down, do it all around.
Time to moooooooooove, time to groooooooooove.

It's time to move, it's time to groove.
It's time to move, it's time to groove.
It's time to move, time to get loose, everybody on the floor oh oh.
It's time to go some more oh oh. Come on, get on down. Come ooooon!

Time to break it all down, do it all around.
Time to break it all down, do it all around.
Time to break it all down, do it all around
