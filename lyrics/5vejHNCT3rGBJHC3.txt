Good is good and bad is bad
But you don't know which one you have
She put your books out on the sidewalk
Now they're blowin' round
But they don't help you when you're down

Loves on your list of things to do
To bring your good luck back to you
If you think everything's unfair
Would you care if you're the last one standing there

And every time you hear the rolling thunder
You turn and run before the lightening strikes
And does it ever make you stop and wonder
If all your good times have passed you by

I don't hold no mystery
But I can show you how to turn the key
'Cause all I know is where I started
I was so downhearted
And that's not where you want to be

And every time you hear the rolling thunder
You turn and run before the lightening strikes
If you could find a rock to crawl right under
And let your good times pass you by

When the day is gone and the world is sleeping
And the moon is on its way to shine
All your friends are gone
You've got a soul worth keeping
You feel you don't belong but you don't know why

And every time you hear the rolling thunder
You turn and run before the lightening strikes
And does it ever make you stop and wonder
If all your good times have passed you by

Every time you hear the rolling thunder
And you turn and run before the lightening strikes
Does it ever make you stop and wonder
And let your good times pass you by
When the day is gone and the world is sleeping
And the moon is on its way to shine
All your friends are gone
You've got a soul worth keeping
You feel you don't belong neither do i
