Finally, it's you and me
Two bad girls on a movie screen
Ain't that sweet humanity
Your love becomes your enemy
Here it goes, the primal scream
A prayer that my teeth will make you bleed
They say it's just biology
That the devil in you is the devil in me

All, it's all love to me
Ah, be my villain
All, all the pain that would breed
It's all, it's all love to me

Now we see the holy war
When true love leads to lethal force
Ain't it just the perfect twist
Your blood becomes your nemesis
What do you do when you wan to destroy
The only one who gives you joy
I want to hit her where it hurts
And maybe it's my curse
For better or for worse
I hope I die first

All, it's all love to me
Ah, be my villain
All, all the ruin that we leave
It's all, it's all love to me

The devil in you is the devil in me
A prayer that my teeth will make you bleed

All, it's all love to me
Ah, be my villain
All, all the havoc we wreak
It's all, it's all love to me

(And maybe it's my curse
I wanna hit her where it hurts
And maybe it's my curse
I wanna hit her where it hurts
And maybe it's my curse
I wanna hit her where it hurts)
Won't you be my
Won't you be my villain
Won't you be my
Won't you be my villain
(And maybe it's my curse
I wanna hit her where it hurts)

All, it's all love to me
Ah, be my villain
All, all the havoc that we wreak
It's all, it's all love to me
