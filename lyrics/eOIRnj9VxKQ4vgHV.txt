Everyday I see you
My hands were made for you
And you always give me stress me free point of view
Pick you up after school

(Mr. Magic)
Take a token
(Mr. Magic)
Of my love
(Mr. Magic)
I see you through the smoke

Without you I'm misery
Blue without my green
All the songs sound better when you're next to me
Hey, 'cuz you come naturally

(Mr. Magic)
Take a token
(Mr. Magic)
Of my love, love, love
(Mr. Magic)
I see you through the smoke

Laying on my bed
I reach up over for you
And you so fresh you even make the standards new
Burn the tip to get you through

(Mr. Magic)
Take a token
(Mr. Magic)
Of my love
Mr. Magic, I see you through the smoke

Mr. Magic
Mr. Magic
Mr. Magic

Waiting for the smoke to clear
I'm waiting for the smoke to clear
