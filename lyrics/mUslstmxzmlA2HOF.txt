Why didn't I say anything until now?
So much is said without a sound
Water so calm and once so pure, undisturbed
Standing for so long the color turns
Their work is so hard, their work is so hard

We never felt the sticky thread
The spider webs
Their balance in the garden
Their work is so hard, their work is so hard
