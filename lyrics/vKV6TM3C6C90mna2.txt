Hey if you really wanna fight with me
Then drop the act and take accountability.
Atone your wrongs and keep them near
Don't wave your love for foolish fears.

Attention! Threatening me
Now I've given up apology
When stressing is no way to be
No measure on how hard I could fall

Oh why do we do all the things we do
That serve only to harm I left her feeling used
The other person we had we lost in the crash.
I take a map to choose.

Hey if you really wanna fight with me
Then drop the act to take accountability.
Atone your wrongs and keep them near.
Don't wave your love for foolish fears.

Someone who's certain
Certain you're falling
It's in the beating of another breed
It's in the pulse of the apology
If you cut the tension in the monologue
And bet no hope - give up
It means let it be
If you want to be asleep just hold my hand.
Believe.

But if you really wanna fight with me
Then drop the act to take accountability
Atone your wrongs and keep them near.
Don't wave your love for foolish fears.

Don't know what you're really scared of I can tell
The circles that you're running in your mind
All well remove me from your sights or scare your heart to feeling mine

For Where You're At!
You need to be yourself

Where am I!

A good face
A good place
I was safe

Hey if you really wanna fight with me
Then drop the act to take accountability.
Atone your wrongs and keep them near
Don't wave your love for foolish fears.

Don't know what you're really scared of I can tell
The circles that you're running in your mind
All well remove me from your sights or scare your heart to feeling mine.

Someone who's certain
Certain you're falling.

Someone who's certain
Certain you're falling.
