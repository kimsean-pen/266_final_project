come on down, down to the river
come on down i want to feel you shiver
dark on the edges, golden on top
floatin down the river
yr so hot
oh oh oh oh oh ooh
(repeat)

come on down, down to the river
come on down i want to feel you shiver
the sight of death is sure to deliver,
come on down i want to hear you quiver
oh oh ooh
corpses' drapery
rusting, sliding, sliding,
sliding
endless
