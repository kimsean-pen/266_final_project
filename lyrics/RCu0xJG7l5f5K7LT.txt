In your touch I feel I lose all my control
Like a ghost
That keeps on whispering let go
We could be dreaming
That's what they said

All I know is
You're keeping me up all night
Shut the door
And keep me up all night

We could be flying
We're face to face
Heaven can wait
This is such a lovely place
Gravity, I see the world beneath my feet
Silently
The stars are sailing next to me

All I know is
You're keeping me up
All night
Shut the door
And keep me up all night

We could be flying
We're face to face
Heaven can wait
This is such a lovely place
(Shut the door)

As I touch the sky
It all dawns on me now
Like a rush of blood straight through my head
Just like Juliet said
Once Romeo is dead
We can fly so high
So far away

All I know is
You're keeping me up
All night
Shut the door
And keep me up all night

We could be flying
We're face to face
Heaven can wait
This is such a lovely place

We could be flying
We're face to face
Heaven can wait
This is such a lovely place
