I remember getting fucked up on the long nights
I remember how we made up after long fights
I remember when we stayed up till the daylight
I remember when you told me you were all mine

Let the past be the past
'Cause I know nothing lasts
Yeah we had what we had
But I'm moving on

I hope you know
That it wasn't easy
Letting go
Of the life I knew
I just had to get it out
Move to the city
Didn't feel right
Taking you with me
Hope you know
That it wasn't easy
Letting go

I tell myself that I don't need you, that I'm okay
Tell myself I'm on my own now, go my own way
I see your pictures of your new life, you look happy
Tell myself moving on should be easy

Let the past be the past
'Cause I know nothing lasts
Yeah we had what we had
But I'm moving on

I hope you know
That it wasn't easy
Letting go
Of the life I knew
I just had to get it out
Move to the city
Didn't feel right
Taking you with me
Hope you know
That it wasn't easy
Letting go

激しくぶつかり合う恋
優しくて深い愛
その二つを持ち合わすも
若すぎた僕ら

I remember when we stayed up till the daylight
I remember when you told me you were all mine

I hope you know
That it wasn't easy
Letting go
Of the life I knew
I just had to get it out
Move to the city
Didn't feel right
Taking you with me
Hope you know
That it wasn't easy
Letting go

Letting go
Letting go
Letting go
