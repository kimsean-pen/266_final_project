Thought you could learn from the past
By letting love slip through your grasp
Furious 'cause you're hit, falling behind a hidden trap
Sweet seduction coming through ike a tight noose
Hanging me high above your reach (of your reach)
Coming through, like I'm let loose
Runnin' through your reverie

(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
You can never get enough of a good thing
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Watch me move like I'm up on a big screen
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Deep thrills running through you like lightning
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Riding over me violently
You can never get enough of a good thing

Trace the curves of your lips,
Lick 'em like you've had a taste (don't bite your tongue)
Follow the curves of my hips,
'Cause you're the kind that craves a chase (don't bite your tongue)
No handle or a grip,
Lead you, don't fall or trip
You can stop yourself from slipping
I start to move while your mind's still wandering
Before you know it, I, oh, I keep running

Do you, do you, do you?

Running, running, running
I'm on fire
Running, running, running
Desire
Running, running, running
Higher

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
You can never get enough of a good thing
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Watch me move like I'm up on a big screen
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Deep thrills running through you like lightning
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Riding over me violently
You can never get enough of a good thing

You can never get enough of a good thing
