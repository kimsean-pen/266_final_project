Well I've heard that the devil's walking around
I sold my soul way down in the dirt
But stole it back and forever in debt
And for a moment I don't even care
Until I felt his breath at my neck
And maybe even you can feel it too
He's on a strike and looking at you

Holding onto his words, but baby
I saw an angel become the devil
Still they look pretty good hand in hand
Well baby, I don't need any of them
Heaven nor hell

Well, I've heard that the morning star of a prince
Was invoked on a Monday on earth
I found his business card in the mud
And for a moment I don't even care
Until I felt his blood at my neck
And maybe even you can feel it too
He's on a strike and looking at you

Holding onto his words, but baby
I saw an angel become the devil
Still they look pretty good hand in hand
Well baby, I don't need any of them
Heaven nor hell

Evil came down on earth
And it beholds more than you love
More than you love
Heaven don't fall on earth

What you behold is no longer a word
No longer a word
Well I've heard that the devil is walking around
I sold my soul way down in the dirt
But stole it back and forever in debt
And for a moment I don't even care
Until I felt his blood at my neck

And maybe even you can feel it too
He's on a strike and looking at you
Holding onto his words but baby
I saw an angel become the devil
Still they look pretty good hand in hand
But baby, I don't need any of them
Heaven nor hell
