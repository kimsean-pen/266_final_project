When the night is young in the land I'm from
The seasons ghost away
The starts at night obscured by light
Can still lead me though this

Don't know where I want to be
But I'm glad that you're with me
And all I know is it'd be easy to leave

And in my mind I can't see the street
Where you and I will live
You still can't see the stars at night
But were not primitive

Don't know where I want to be
Oh but I'm glad that you're with me
And all I know is it'd be easy to leave
