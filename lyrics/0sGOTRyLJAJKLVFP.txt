Got a red eye on
Got a red eye on
I got a red eye on
Gonna bring it on, like a war machine

When it hits you like a wave
You're not gonna feel the pain
So stand and face the rain, like a war machine

You gotta give me a hey,
You gotta give me a hey,
You wanna play this game
You can face the pain, like a war machine

Comin' through like
We're comin' through like
Hey, comin' through like, like a war machine

Comin' like a machine
Fasten the hatchet door 'cause we ain't gonna run no more
Like a machine
This time I won't let go, either step up or hit the floor
Comin' like a machine
And we might rock the party, Oh! But we ain't gonna hurt nobody
Like a machine
Step up and hear the roar, look up and see the machine soar

You can see it rise, but you'll never hear it fall
But you can see its eyes, when it starts to rise like a war machine
When it hits you like a wave, you're not gonna feel the pain
So stand and face the rain, like a war machine

You gotta give me a hey,
You gotta give me a hey,
You wanna play this game
You can face the pain, like a war machine

Comin' through like
We're comin' through like
Hey, comin' through like, like a war machine

Comin' like a machine
Fasten the hatchet door 'cause we ain't gonna run no more
Like a machine
This time I won't let go, either step up, or hit the floor
Comin' like a machine
And we might rock the party, Oh! But we ain't gonna hurt nobody
Like a machine
Step up and hear the roar, look up and see the machine soar

This armor that I'm in,
can fight the feelings that I've been, I've been, feeling
Because now the time has come,
to walk the line and come undone, I will, oh, I will

And I am not afraid
Of the power you contain
And I am not ashamed
'Cause the truth defeats the pain

Comin' like a machine
Fasten the hatchet door, 'cause we ain't gonna run no more
Like a machine
This time I won't let go, either step up, or hit the floor
And we might rock the party, Oh! But we ain't gonna hurt nobody
Step up and hear the roar, look up and see the machine soar
