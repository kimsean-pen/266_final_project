I've said it all, got it all the way
She wants it all, can we all pretend she said it first?
All in All, I don't understand
She came around, all the other times she didn't say
I call my friends, tell them all i see
It's not enough, don't forget to say say say say
I ask you now all the breaks
Did you all give in?
Time and time you come for me
Let's whine it down, my baby,
I'll make it right
I'm critical, this is the place to be
Time and time you come for me
Let's whine it down, my baby,
I'll make it right
I'm critical, this is the place to be

Don't hold back, come around
Tell the friends come from heist
Where'd you go all alone?
Tearing down these other door

Now we're at our home,
Bone to the???
Oh, like one of these
Couldn't tell it any other way
If there's something wrong with the way I play
Tell me I'm out of luck
Time and time you come for me
Let's whine it down, my baby,
I'll make it right
I'm critical, this is the place to be
Time and time you come for me
Let's whine it down, my baby,
I'll make it right
I'm critical, this is the place to be
