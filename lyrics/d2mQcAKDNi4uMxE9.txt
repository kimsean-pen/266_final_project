Long before the arrival of men
Giants and monsters were decimated
Pale lightning and annihilating winds
Tabbing viciously the punished land
Pure revolt of early devastations
Bring the fourth element into motion
Electrify the cradle of creation

The reaper rides the electric storm
The maelstrom calls the phenomenon
Skies entangled into blackened smoke
As a flash of discharge whips the globe

In a blast of electric monumental extermination
Pulverized universe, non-sacred condemnation
Fire under mortal rain of decimation
Shock waves of conducting electric pain

In a blast of a shocking powerful elimination
Sentence the fallen creatures of primal creation
Fire under mortal rain of decimation
Shock waves of conducting electric pain

Electrified, power surge of fire
Ignite the monumental pyre
Electrified, fatal discharge
Through silent screams, incinerations rise

In a blast of electric monumental extermination
Pulverized universe, non-sacred condemnation
Fire under mortal rain of decimation
Shock waves of conducting electric pain

Then the winds of progression have blown
In the hearts of men evil wisdom
Discovered secrets of warfare redemption
Nuclear infliction for relentless progression
