I felt the grass on my chest in the open field
And I knew there was nothing left for me to feel
Airplanes above cross the sky under a haze
In the morning time we didn't think about our days

The wind was blowing through our hair as we lied down
And we could feel under our backs that the earth was round
Lazy today, lazy tonight and later on
All we had to do was nothing at all, under the sun
