When we first met
Your hair was long and brown
You hadn't yet cut it all off
And now it's long once again, oh
Oh, it's long once again

As I kept track
Of every haircut that we ever had
I could, I could see how long it had been, oh
Oh, how long it had been

And this thought made it clearer
I ought to be near her

All I see is where our days repeat
And our love goes on as our hair grows long

Oh, Chelsea Lynn
I watched your hair grow from the root to tip
I know, I know I have always known
And I always will know

Oh, oh that I could have
A single direction until I am dead
I'll go, I'll go as I always have gone
And, and I always will go, oh, oh

This thought made it clearer
I ought to be near her

All I see is where our days repeat
And our love goes on as our hair grows long

As our hair grows long
As our hair grows long
