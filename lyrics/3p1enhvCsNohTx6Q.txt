Does anybody want to take me on
Does anybody want to hear the thing I have to say
I fear today
Does anybody want to see me cry
If I'm the only one I'd rather die

Thoughtless baby
Thoughtless baby
Thoughtless baby

Does anybody want to open up and see what's vile
Does anybody want to walk along the sea
Sometimes its like its said
Sometimes its throw away

Thoughtless baby
Thoughtless baby
Thoughtless baby

Does anybody want to take me on
Does anybody want to see me die
When he cry's throws away

Thoughtless baby
Thoughtless baby

Does anybody want to see me cry
If I'm the only one I'd rather die

Thoughtless baby
I'd rather die

Does anybody want to take me on
Does anybody want to take me on
Does anybody want to take me on
Does anybody want to take me on
