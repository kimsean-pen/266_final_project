Now we're floating like two feathers
In the sunlight and the dust of California
And you no longer have to carry me
We are exactly where I wanted us to be

No more hesitation
Nothing will ever divide us again
No more energy wasted
On the temper of our time
Just the truth and the sublime

So thank you
You need to know
That you dragged me out
Of a mile deep hollow
And I love you
You brought me home
'Cause you dragged me out
Of a mile deep hollow

We threw our past in the Atlantic
And those eleven days remain in our tool kit
We took our chances with the desert life
Even though we got lost along the way in our own minds

We took all the blows
Searching for purity
We put an end to all
The beating up ourselves
And the walking on eggshells

So thank you
You need to know
That you dragged me out
Of a mile deep hollow
And I love you
You brought me home
'Cause you dragged me out
Of a mile deep hollow

So thank you
You need to know
That you dragged me out
Of a mile deep hollow
And I love you
You brought me home
'Cause you dragged me out
Of a mile deep hollow

Thank you
I love you
Thank you
