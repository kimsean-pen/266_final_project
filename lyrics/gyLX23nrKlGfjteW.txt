They say heaven is a place where
Our pain is washed away
With no room for all the torment
Of choices that we've made
I'm a broken man saved by grace
Tossed alone inside this maze
And I am just a question
To the answer you convey

You've been all the way to broken
Lost your sense of where to go
You're love is still the answer
More than hate will ever know
It's not too late to be rescued
Not too late to let it go
Remember pain is just an anger
You never had control of

You give us life and meaning
You give us hope, so

If I can be honest
How come I always break my promises to you
If I'm not afraid why am I so scared to move
I'm barely breathing
And if I can be honest
How come I always end up so far away from you
You made me a promise
And I'll always hold it true

I believe heaven is a place where
We'll walk the streets to go
She's seen nothing but the concrete
Yeah the world has left her cold
She's been beaten, bruised, and broken
She's felt pain instead of love
Inside she was an angel
But she never knew she was

You've been all the way to broken
Lost your sense of where to go
You're love is still the answer
More than hate will ever know
It's not too late to be rescued
Not too late to let it go
Remember pain is just an anger
You never had control of

You give us life and meaning
You give us hope, so

If I can be honest
How come I always break my promises to you
If I'm not afraid why am I so scared to move
I'm barely breathing
And if I can be honest
How come I always end up so far away from you
You made me a promise
And I'll always hold it true
(Always hold it true)

If I can be honest
How come I always break my promises to you
If I'm not afraid why am I so scared to move
I'm barely breathing
And if I can be honest
How come I always end up so far away from you
You made me a promise
And I'll always hold it true
(Always hold it true)
