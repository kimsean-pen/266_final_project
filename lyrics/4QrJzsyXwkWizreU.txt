My problem isn't that I miss you
'Cause, I don't
My problem isn't that I kissed you
Woah, oh

I figured out
That you're nothing that I thought you're about
You're just caught in a place
It's what time will erase in my heart

You're my type of guy I guess?
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High
For the rest of my life
But people change
Thank God I did

Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you now
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you

Your problem's not for lack of trying
'Cause, you do
It's just that you're at your best when you're lying
Woah, oh

Now you're standing here
Saying things you think I wanted to hear
But you got it all wrong
I've already moved on, my dear

You're my type of guy I guess?
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High
For the rest of my life
But people change
Thank God I did

Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you now
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you

(A ba, ba, ba, a ba, ba, ba, a ba, ba, ba)
(A ba, ba, ba, a ba, ba, ba, a ba, ba, ba)

When you're standing near me
I don't see so clearly
The feelings are still palpable
But when I take two steps away
It sheds some light on my day
Yeah, you can't go back
It's all in the past
Guess you gotta laugh at it

You're my type of guy I guess?
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High
For the rest of my life
But people change
Thank God I did

And if there's some confusion
Let me tell you, you're just dillusional
Get a clue
'Cause, people change
Thank God I did
Thank God I did

(A ba, ba, ba, a ba, ba, ba)
Thank God I did
(A ba, ba, ba, a ba, ba, ba, a ba, ba, ba)

Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you now
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you
Doesn't mean I like you
Just because I liked you back then (a ba, ba, ba)
It doesn't mean I like you now

(Rock and roll)
(Rock it)
