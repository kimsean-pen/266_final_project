I found my way to the garden, but I couldn't see
The cliff edge in front of me
No cloud can catch me now

It brings me closer to God
But keeps the dirt in the wound, and now the beast has teeth
I've got my hand on my heart
I thought that I knew the way, but I've been torn apart

Now I know there's a holy grail
But it's beyond the pale
Why must we always fly so close to the sun?
The silhouettes have fallen one by one
Cause we forget that the sun sets
And we're not long for this world
No cloud can catch me now

I found my way to the garden, but I couldn't see
The cliff edge in front of me

The Devil's recruits whisper in my ear
"Go tighten that noose", but it's clear
I've gotta follow the thread
Instead, I'll dream of the end, and I will raise the dead
We're all refusing to feel
And yet we're dying to heal
But there is only now
And there's no easy way out

I found my way to the garden, but I couldn't see
The cliff edge in front of me

Now I know there's a holy grail
But it's beyond the pale
Why must we always fly so close to the sun?
The silhouettes have fallen one by one
Cause we forget that the sun sets
And we're not long for this world
No cloud can catch me now

I see no silver linings
When the days are so dark
So hold a flame to these words
Enough pressure will create a diamond, oh
I see no silver linings
When the days are so dark
So hold a flame to these words
Enough pressure will create a diamond
Enough pressure will create a diamond
