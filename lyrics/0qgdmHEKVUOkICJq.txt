This is no complaint
You either retreat to the rear
Where you watch still in fear
Cut off from choice
Or you voice your anger
Outside defenseless behind the fence

Braving the fumes
The noble one resumes the fight
Though still in flight
And you nourish little patches of ground
And put no fences around
To gather things towards you

And if only for me, please, hold your fire
And hide your fires at night
And if only for me, please
Sink your crowns now
And drown your bells inside of me

So gather around - around
Look inside - to be found
So gather around - around
Look inside - to be found

Now keep the rage and lose the rest
Hold on and give it your best shot
And do it now
Your hesitant songs, your fearful songs
Will not put them to the test anyhow

And if only for me, please, hold your fire
And hide your fires at night
And if only for me, please
Sink your crowns now
And drown your bells inside of me

So gather around - around
Look inside - to be found
So gather around - around
Look inside - to be found

Oh, I never thought I'd see it
But you belong to me
Like the shame to the retreat
Oh, I never thought I'd see it
But you fill yourself indeed
With what you destroy in me

So gather around - around
Look inside - to be found

D'abord - il y avait la colere - Et puis
Il y avait notre promesse - De ne pas perdre le feu
De vivre debout - et en movement
