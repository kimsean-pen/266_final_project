There she goes again
The girl I'm in love with
It's cool we're just friends
We walk the halls at school
We know it's casual
It's cool we're just...

I don't wanna lead you on
No
The truth is I've grown fond
Yeah

Everyone knows it's meant to be
Falling in love, just you and me
'Til the end of time
'Til I'm on her mind
It'll happen
I've been making lots of plans
Like a picket fence and a rose garden
I'll just keep on dreaming
But it's cool cause we're just friends

Small talk on IM
Just one word sentences
It's cool we're just friends
And if I had my way
We would talk and talk all day
Yeah

Everyone knows it's meant to be
Falling in love, just you and me
'Til the end of time
'Til I'm on her mind
It'll happen
I've been making lots of plans
Like a picket fence and a rose garden
I'll just keep on dreaming
But it's cool cause we're just friends

Thinking about how
We're gonna say our vows
It's cool we're just friends
As she walks down the aisle
I see all my friends smile
Cause now we're more than friends

Everyone knows it's meant to be
Falling in love, just you and me
'Til the end of time
'Til I'm on her mind
It'll happen
We've been making lots of plans
Like a picket fence and a rose garden
I'll just keep on dreaming
Keep on thinking
Of when we used to be just friends

La la la la
La la la la
La la la la
When we used to be just friends
(when we used to be)
La la la la
La la la la (yeah)
La la la la (yeah)
When we used to be just friends
