Oh, here it comes
That funny feelin' again
Winding me up inside
Every time we touch

Hey, I don't know
And tell me where to begin
'Cause I never ever
Felt so much

And I can't recall any love at all
Oh, baby this blows 'em all away

It's got what it takes
So, tell me why can't this be love
Straight from my heart
Oh, tell me why can't this be love

I tell myself
Hey, only fools rush in
Only time will tell
We stand the test of time

All I know
You've got to run to win
And I'll be damned if I'll get
Hung up on the line

Now I can't recall any love at all
Oh, baby this blows 'em all away

It's got what it takes
So, tell me why can't this be love
You are straight from my heart
Oh, tell me why can't this be love

It's got what it takes
So, tell me why can't this be love
Straight from my heart
Oh, tell me why can't this be love

Baby, why can't this be love
Got to know why can't this be love
I wanna know can't this be love
