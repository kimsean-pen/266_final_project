Rose and wine and
Skin and cigarette
Locks fall down your neck
I saw you right be
Fore your eyes caught mine
Better than the rest

And I can feel it coming back again
I got a feeling coming back again

And you got me on the ropes
Yeah, you got me on the ropes again

I got the feeling coming back again, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, I can feel it coming back again, oh oh oh oh oh oh

Callous hands and
Grimace hides a smile
Faith so close in time
I'm enough for talking
I'm turned and pushed aside
Fearless creatures fight

And I can feel it coming back again
I got a feeling coming back again

And now you got me on the ropes
Yeah, you got me on the ropes again

I got the feeling coming back again, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, I can feel it coming back again, oh oh oh oh oh oh
I can feel it coming back again, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, I can feel it coming back, oh oh oh oh oh oh
I can feel it coming back again, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, I can feel it coming back again, oh oh oh oh oh oh
I got the feeling coming back, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, I can feel it coming back again, oh oh oh oh oh oh
