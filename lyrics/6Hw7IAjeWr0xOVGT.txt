Oh, darling, I know you're taken
Something 'bout this just don't feel right
Every time one of us tries to leave here
Oh, the other one holds on tight, oh, oh

Baby, tonight, there's so much
Love in between us but you say
You gotta get home
Stay here with me
I won't tell a soul
You tell me someone's waiting for ya
That you can't do this anymore
But you kiss me again
So go ahead and draw the blinds and lock all the doors

Baby, tonight, there's so much
Love in between us but you say
You gotta get home
Stay here with me
I won't tell a soul
Oh, if you want me like I want you
I won't judge you, this could be our little secret (secret)
Our secret (secret)
So tell me if you're ready
Cause if no one knows then it ain't really cheating
Oh, darling, I know you're taken
Something 'bout this just don't feel right
Every time one of us
Tries to justify the situation, we just hold on tighter, oh, oh

Baby, tonight, there's so much
Love in between us but you say
You gotta get home
Stay here with me
I won't tell a soul
