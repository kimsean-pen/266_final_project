I remember when you stole my heart
Then you handed me the map
To where you buried it
So I could run and get it back, back, back, back

I wanna know how you're doin'
But I don't really want to ask
In case you're happier now
And I don't think that I could handle that, handle that

There used to be a time
When you were my only thought, but I
There used to be a time
Now I barely think of you at all

Sometimes I miss your touch and the
Whispers that made me blush, but I
I guess I don't miss love if that's what I felt with you
So far from what we knew, but I
Did what I had to do, now I
I hate the colour blue 'cause that's what I felt with you

I remember when the lights went out
And the love I knew was gone
And when you buried it
I tried so hard to get it back, back, back, back

I wanna know how you're doing
But I still don't want to ask
I know her name
And I don't think I could handle knowing more than that, more than that

There used to be a time
When you were my only thought, but I
I used to call you mine
Now I don't think of you at all

Sometimes I miss your touch and the
Whispers that made me blush, but I
I guess I don't miss love if that's what I felt with you
So far from what we knew, but I
Did what I had to do, now I
I hate the colour blue 'cause that's what I felt with you

I thought our love was so strong
Your voice was my favourite song
But with a blink of an eye
My favourite colour was all a lie
Don't recognise what I see
Your lips now strangers to me
What do you want me to say?
I guess I've said it all anyway

Sometimes I miss your touch and the
Whispers that made me blush but I
I guess I don't miss love if that's what I felt with you
So far from what we knew, but
I did what I had to do, now
I can't stand the colour blue, 'cause

Sometimes I miss your touch and the
Whispers that made me blush, but I
I guess I don't miss love if that's what I felt with you
So far from what we knew, but I
Did what I had to do, now I
I hate the colour blue 'cause that's what I felt with you

That's what I felt with you and I
That's what I felt with you and I
That's what I felt with you and I
That's what I felt with you and I
That's what I felt with you and I
That's what I felt with you and I
