I'm sick with worry just knowing
When you step outside you won't be safe now
I'm sick with worry just knowing
When you step outside you won't be safe

Near the entrance you call me
Cause today might be the day
I know
Everyone wants to see a show
Everyone wants to see a show

I'm sick with worry just knowing
When you step outside you won't be safe now
I'm sick with worry just knowing
When you step outside you won't be safe

They'll drop you dry if you let them
Don't give it all up to the grave
I know
Everyone wants to see a show
Everyone wants to see a show

I'm sick with worry just knowing
When you step outside you won't be safe now
I'm sick with worry just knowing
When you step outside you won't be safe
I'm sick with worry just knowing
When you step outside you won't be safe now
I'm sick with worry just knowing
When you step outside you won't be safe

Near the entrance you call me
Cause today might be the day
I know
