Make a fist
You don't have to be this
You don't have to do this now
Silver shine
Fly me to the ocean
Take me to the future now
Make a fist
You don't have to be this
You don't have do this now

Is this the future
This is the future

Make a wish
Watch me disappear
And see me turn into a hound
Bloody fangs
Growing from your gums
And bleeding on the ground around
I relate to things I hate
Don't know why

Is this the future
This is the future
