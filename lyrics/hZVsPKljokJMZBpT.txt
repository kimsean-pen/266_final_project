Now I know
I've been too long pretending
There's no comfort here
Just a hurt that's never ending
You were never too much for me, never too much
Always so free
These eyes seen the deepest sea
You were never too much for me, never too much
Always so free
Is there nothing that I can say or do
To build that bridge to you?
These bitter days
I count the change to starlight
I kill the time
There's always more cold night
You were never too much for me, never too much
Always so free
Is there nothing that I can say or do
To build that bridge to you?
(Is there nothing that I can say?)
You were never too much for me, never too much
Always so free
Is there nothing that I can say or do
To build that bridge to you?
(Is there nothing that I can say?)
(Is there nothing that I can say?)
You were never too much for me, never too much
Always so free
Is there nothing that I can say or do
To build that bridge to you?
(Is there nothing that I can say?)
You were never too much for me, never too much
Always so free
Is there nothing that I can say or do
To build that bridge to you?
