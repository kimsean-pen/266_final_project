I smell that whore
Bring me back
Bring me a brick
Take my bottle and break it

Pour it all out
I pushed you too far
Self absorb that pity I want to

I just want to knock you off your horse
I just feel it, everything's fine
Spit on yourself, you're so beautiful

Crack and chip off like the sun won't shine down
Take your medicine like a champ while that sting can last a million years
Self absorb that utopia so bad, I just feel it.
