Life is still spinning,
Your end my beginning,
And everything I hoped for has been strangely set aside.
Reason for living,
My mind is forgiving.
And destiny is proving to be absent from my life.
I know it, I feel it,
I know when you're sleeping,
I know the things you're dreaming,
And I know you will never give up and die...
Conscious fulfilling,
The darkness revealing all,
Thoughts and insecurities are shining like the sun...

Eyes are deceiving,
Your mind will stop breathing,
And all that you are made of will now rightly become mine.

You know it,
You feel it,
I know when you're sleeping,
I know the things you're dreaming,
I love it when you're weeping,
Even death can't stop this feeling
And I know you will never give up and die

Father, why have you forsaken me,
My life is gone.
Father, you know how long it's taken me,
I live again!

I know when you're sleeping,
I know the things you're dreaming.
I know when you're sleeping,
I know the things you're dreaming.
I love it when you're weeping
Even death can't stop this feeling.

I know when you're sleeping,
I know the things you're dreaming.
I love when you're weeping,
Even death can't stop this feeling.
And I know you will never give up
No, you will never give up,
You will never give up and... die.
