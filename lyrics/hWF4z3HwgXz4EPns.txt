Cede to wash the knife
and thy lust wants my hash life
Hell won't tolerate hymns

You once seemed to love
the tumbling of infarction
the oddments of destruction
the effort to stay:
a blackmail
decay

Life lays in your heart like in a coffin
Stop faking suffering like a child
Bonds of silk and vows of lead weight
in rotten milk - this was your feast plate

Now all your veins burst
all fears and wrongs
Hell won't tolerate hymns

You once seemed to love
the tumbling of infarction
the oddments of destruction
the effort to stay:
a blackmail
decay

Life lays in your heart like in a coffin
Stop faking suffering like a child
Bonds of silk and vows of lead weight
in rotten milk - this was your feast plate
