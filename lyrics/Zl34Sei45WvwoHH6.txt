A garden grew between us in the love we lived without
Remaining faithful to the flood
Our tears have purpose in a drought
Tread lightly so footprints can't disturb the bed we've made
With restlessness reserved for both the bodies it contains

Aim your sharpest arrow at the center of my chest
A memorial to signify the sense of helplessness
We dare not mourn our past lives, our loss will be reborn
Because I couldn't love who you were
But you're not you anymore

Sew your skeleton to mine, I'm no good on my own
Stitch yourself to either side of me so I will never be alone
We mend our past mistakes as a symbol that we've grown
So we no longer place our weight on top of broken bones

Mark an end to aimless roaming with a double-sided knife
If we develop eyes for others
May we both be stripped of sight

Liken our divide to partitions in the earth
Wrapped in walls of vines, growing out of common ground
A garden grew between us
Our tears have purpose in a drought

Sew your skeleton to mine, I'm no good on my own
Stitch yourself to either side of me so I will never be alone
We mend our past mistakes as a symbol that we've grown
So we no longer place our weight on top of broken bones

Mark an end to aimless roaming with a double-sided knife
Taking steps towards each other
We could end both our lives...
And that'd be fine

Aim your sharpest arrow at the center of my chest
A memorial to signify the sense of helplessness
We dare not mourn our past lives, but our loss will be reborn
I couldn't love who you were
But you're not you anymore
