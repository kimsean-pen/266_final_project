I said hey everybody
Come and listen
I've got some things I've got to tell you today
Come and listen
Think what you're missing
If you get carried away

You'll never live forever
But now that you're here
We've got to live together
Together and free

I said hey, all of the people
They got to be equal
Because it ain't so cool to step on a friend
Get together, get together
Before we get to the end

I said hey, come and listen
Brothers and sisters
You know you can't go back the way that you came
Don't be a deceiver
Where does it leave you?
That's not the name of the game

You'll never live forever
But now that you're here
We've got to live together
Together and free

You'll never live forever
But now that you're here
We've got to live together
Together and free
