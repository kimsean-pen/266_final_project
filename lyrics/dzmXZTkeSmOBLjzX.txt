Move through the city, I'm in a new whip (Skrt!)
We boolin' in here (Bitch, bitch)
(Yeah, yeah)

Move through the city, I'm in a new whip
Interior red, we boolin' in here
I smoke on the pound, I smoke out the zip
Bitch, I'm smokin' on cookie, drink lean like it's milk
This Glock holdin' 30, I bought a new clip
She tryna' talk, I'm tryna' hit
Hoe, shut the fuck up, and suck on this dick
I just went shopping, I bought some more shit

He talkin' tough, he get hit in the lip with stick
Kn-knock him right off of his shit, b-bitch
Thirty-five hundred I spent on this fit
About 55 'k on my wrist
Ball like Kobe, or DeMar DeRozen
When I pull a lil' bitch, I don't miss
Off-White, Goyard, Supreme, I be rockin' this shit 'cause I'm rich
All white, like they Air Force Ones,
and they lookin' so nice with the fit
