You wait 'til later
'til later tonight
You wait 'til later, 'til later
'til later tonight

That boy never cast a look in your direction
never tried to hook for your affection
dresses like the mod of your invention, tall and proud
He is the head boy of a school of thought
that plays in your intentions, night and day

And you wait 'til later
'til later tonight
You wait 'til later, 'til later
'til later tonight
'cause tonight always comes
