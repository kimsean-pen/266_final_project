Drawn In By A Bite - Invoking Witch
Hand Carved For The Favourite Son
Unhinged, A Devilment Fires
No Blame, Just Insane
Buried In Nameless Graves

Drowned And Hung
Ordeal Is Done
Only The Dead Survive

Unravel The Dead
Leaving Endless Truth Beyond The Grave

We're Broken
All Infection
A Creature Of Deception
Beyond The Gates
Inviting A Solitary Fear Inside

Drawn In By A Bite - Invoking Witch
Hand Carved For The Favourite Son
Unhinged, A Devilment Fires
Remains Crushed, Decayed
Burning In Shameless Pain

Ingest Your Spirit
I Feel We're So Connected
Pain
Reject Your Wishes
Your Broken Mind In Sickness

Here In The Chapel Of Blood
The Tired Burden Undone
Consuming Fever Decays
Exhuming Tender Spirits
My Hunger Knows No Limits
My Dark Salvation, Your Plague
