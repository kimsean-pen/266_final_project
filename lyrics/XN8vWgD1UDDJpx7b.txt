I woke up
On a wave that crashes
When will the tide return

And if you leave
With only ashes
Can't rebuild what has been burned

And down the road
With all the seeds grown
And benefit of view

We throw away
The things we want most
Depending on our mood

I don't know where you are
I don't know where I'm going
But I can't be that far
From where your heart is flowing

Just like fireflies
Briefly held, meant to be let go
Somewhere in the night
The words you spoke will always light

An echo in my mind
A last goodbye, one breath within our
Ever shifting lives
Spare your cries there will be no reply

I can't know where to start
If you don't let down your guard
A distance much too far
Cause we are...

Just like fireflies
A mirror to the stars that drift out
Somewhere in the night
The words you spoke will always light

An echo in my mind
A last goodbye, one breath within our
Ever shifting lives
The vast divided skies we're meant to fly
