When all of the heavy hearts
Are broke in their backs
And all of the die-hard valentines
Are calling me back

You can find me at the restaurant
You can find me at the pool
You can find me in the mistletoe
Playing it cool
Singing
Just unplug with me
What's the rush, I wanna know
Just unplug with me

I don't wanna love you
I don't want your hand
But we can watch TV in the morning
Drinking coffee in my bed
I don't wanna love you
I don't have no plans, no
You can stay over if you want to
Stay over if you can

And all of the golden beds
Are tight as a noose
And all of the Volvo's thunder past
Remind me of you

Not gonna find me at counselling
Not gonna find me at the school
I'll be waiting in the mistletoe
Playing it cool
Singing
Just unplug with me
What's the rush, I wanna know
Just unplug with me

I don't wanna love you
I don't want your hand
But we can watch TV in the morning
Drinking coffee in my bed
I don't wanna love you
I don't have no plans, no
You can stay over if you want to
Stay over if you can

Oh, stay over if you want to
Stay over if you can
Oh, stay over if you want to
Stay over if you can

Come be my companion (be my companion)
Come be my friend (be my friend)
Wanna let some steam off (wanna let some steam off)
You know where I am (you know where I am)
Come be my companion (you know where I am)
Come be my friend (you know)
If you need a companion
You know where I am

I don't wanna love you
I don't want your hand
But we can watch TV in the morning
Drinking coffee in my bed
I don't wanna love you (don't wanna love you)
I don't have no plans, no (don't have no plans)
You can stay over if you want to (over if you want to)
Stay over if you can (stay over if you can)

I don't wanna love you (I don't wanna love you)
I don't want your hand (I don't wanna win your hand)
But we can watch TV in the morning
(we be watching the TV in the morning)
Drinking coffee in my bed (you will never wanna get out of my bed)
I don't have no plans (I just want you here tonight)
So, you can stay over if you want to
Stay over if you can (stay over if you can)

Over if you can
Over if you can
Over if you can
Stay over if you can
