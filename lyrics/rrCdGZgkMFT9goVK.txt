Don't keep it all in your head
What we had was off
It's best that we forget
And overlook it all

But even now when they fall into place
I think about you then

I know I'd forget
If I was Alone
Make sure I can mix, love, and hold on

Now I'm surrounded
By my old things
Thought I had moved on
Tried to make ends meat
But picked up a new beat
And so I lay out

But even now when they fall into place
I think about 'em then

I know I'd forget
If I was alone
Make sure I can mix, love, and hold on
Make sure I can mix, love, and hold on
Make sure I can mix, love, and hold on

Don't forget X
