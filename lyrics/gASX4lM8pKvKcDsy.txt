You never listen to me
I know I'm better off alone
Everybody knows it's true
Yeah we all see through you

No it won't be hard to do
Throw away my stuff from you
Oooh
and I'll wait for her to come

She won't break my heart cause
I know she'll be from Australia
She's so beautiful
She's my dream girl

La la la (la la) la la
She's my dream girl
You were the one I thought I needed
I'm better off alone

Everybody knows it's true
They know all your secrets
The only thing you knew was true
I just walked out of your life

How does it feel?
So I'll wait for her to come
She won't break my heart cause
I know she'll be from Australia

She is so beautiful
She's my dream girl
La la la (la la) la la
She's my dream girl

And she will be there to love and to care
I know there's no need to worry
The girl of my dreams
The one that will be

There to hold me when I'm down
Till she's around
I'll just wait
For her to come

She won't break my heart cause
I know she'll be from Australia
She is so beautiful
She's my dream girl

La la la (la la) la la
She's my dream girl
Oh yeah
So I'll wait (So I'll wait) for her (for her) to come(to come)
She won't break my heart (She won't break my heart cuz I know she'll be)
from Australia
She is so beautiful
She's my dream girl
La la la (la la) la la
She's my dream girl
Dream girl
