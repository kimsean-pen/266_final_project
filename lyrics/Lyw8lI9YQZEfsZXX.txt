Strange visions dreams my mind,
When I'm walking through the night,
Each time I see the visage of the moon,
Dead cities amongst the sands,
Under the black abyss of seas,
Does madness seize my soul?

The elder race,
From beyond the stars,
Eternal watchers,
Of sphere of no return,
Seven seals,
Of seven mighty gates,
Abominations,
That come true within me.

Here's the key by which I can summon the forgotten world,
Unnatural desire of the knowledge of the gods,
Lust eating up the brain wherein there isn't fear yet,

I break the sleep of spectral friends,
Tear open the unseen, ghostly screen,
I make free for all ways for demons now,
And ruin the tombs of sacred souls...

An epileptic trance is entering my body,
to break all control rule of this mind
A boiling brain addicted to madness,
In which every night is like a horror dream.

Shudder in the dark breath,
Old evil blowing icily from the dark,
Wrapped in a shroud of mystery,
Faint voices from beyond the spaces,

Sample a dark universe,
domain of the strange aces,
With the angry gods,
Best forgotten and left undiscovered.

You know, of course,
I'll be back from the dead,
Blessing the blackness in glory,
Of billions of years,
On collapsed stars,
In rituals of the ancient race!
