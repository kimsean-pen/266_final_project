Slipping on the damn floor
I want more than what I'm used to get
talking 'bout a theory
but I'm falling out of plans again
Running through doorframes
hundred miles straight ahead
caught the king of empire
I want you to push up my ass
I climb up high
To see
but I cannot lie
again
Unpack my illusions
it's a vow, can't go back
Replace my resloutions
I want you to put on your mask
You
I want you
You
I want you
I climb up high
to see
but I cannot lie
again
