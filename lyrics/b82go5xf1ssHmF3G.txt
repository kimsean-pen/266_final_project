You could never be a face in the crowd
So you're travelin' on, travelin' on out
Well you know I'd never say it out loud
But I'll be travelin' on, travelin' with you

Hey I'm too weak it's too much to follow
The past so strong
But now I don't think too much of the time
I'll just try to keep up

Ooh ooh...
I can't believe what's happening now
Ooh ooh...
I can't believe what's happening now

If you notice that I'm falling behind
I'm taking my time taking it all in
So call me when you get where you get where you're going
I'll keep travelin' on, travelin' to you

Hey don't be too hard on yourself
I'll be okay
Cause we won't leave this place any worse
And when we came

Ooh ooh...
I can't believe what's happening now
Ooh ooh...
I can't believe what's happening now

I love the way it's happening now
