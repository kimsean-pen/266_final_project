You bit your lip
And on the tip of your tongue was your view
He hadn't dealt with how you felt in ways that suited you

Got paper cuts
From the love letters you never gave him
Could not meet
Your newfound needs
For misbehaving

Why?
Why would you say sorry?
Oh, why would you?
Why would you say

You said there was a nagging lack
Of smiles when dancing on your back
Tenderness a plenty
But that wasn't what you craved

There's holes in hearts
Desire starts to make demands
And, dear boy, you'd be a fool to make your plans with her

Why would you say sorry?
Oh, why would you?
Why would you say sorry?
Oh, why would you say sorry?
Oh, why would you?

When it's just one of many bullets you will bite
While waiting for a ray of light
Waiting for a ray of light
Waiting for a ray of light

Got paper cuts
From the love letters you never gave him
Could not meet
Your newfound needs
For misbehaving

Why?
Why would you say sorry?
Oh, why would you?
Why would you say sorry?
Oh, why would you say sorry?
Oh, why would you?

(Why would you) Why would you say sorry?
(Why would you) Why would you say sorry?
(Why would you) Why would you say sorry?
(Why would you) Why would you say sorry?

(Why would you)
(Why would you)
(Why would you)
(Why would you)
