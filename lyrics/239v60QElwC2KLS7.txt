It's the last time that I ask why
I'm overlooked and I'm passed by
You can't grasp my shit, that's fine
Can't see the truth through glass eyes
You're half-blind; in fact, I'm
On my way to the back nine
I'm coming out swinging, a man on a mission
And breaking new ground like a land mine
Can't stop my ambitions, can't stop my commitment
My very existence is winning the game
Every minute I'm given I'm thinking
Of living it different, you live it the same
A vivid display, what are you thinking?
I'm building a vision, you're digging a grave
I'm in a position to have an opinion
Don't need your permission to give it away
Give it a rest, this is the end
You cannot prevent what you're fighting against
We live in this shit, we didn't pretend
We're the percentage you'll never forget
Look at the math, look at what's left
You can't represent what you couldn't accept
Since the beginning, I knew you were ignorant
That is the difference you can't understand
What would you do with nothing to lose
Nothing to live for but something to prove?
You don't have a clue, you got it confused
You couldn't walk 20 steps in our shoes
Every minute you're ducking from view
Can't run from the truth that's coming for you
We are the many and you are the few

We are the future, we are the future
We're the future and we have just begun
We are the truth, the chosen ones
We are the new, the past is gone
We are the future and we have just begun
We are the future

It's a new day and a new way
The future brings a new game
A view change, a crusade
It's a journey to the new age
So you may want to take
This time to pack a suitcase
We're coming, you're going 'cause we are the chosen
Yeah, this is our moment, you're too late
That's it, I have spoken, I told you it's hopeless
You thought I was joking, but when did I laugh?
The smile you noticed was me overflowing
From joy and emotion from ending the past
Sending it back, like something was open
Like something was broken, it went in the trash
Day One is over, The Future's approaching
The embers are glowing, we're spreading the ash
We're flipping the script, spinning this shit
You've been evicted, six-six and a kick
You're finished, that's it, a swing and a miss
You're dead in the wind 'cause your wings have been clipped
We're giving it lift, you're wishing you did
You're stuck in the middle and sinking again
You are the end, we are where it begins

We are the future, we are the future
We're the future and we have just begun
We are the truth, the chosen ones
We are the new, the past is gone
We are the future and we have just begun

Time has come, ready or not, it's waiting for no one
Time has come, ready or not, we are the chosen
Time has come, ready or not, it's waiting for no one
Time has come, ready or not

We are the future, we are the future
We're the future and we have just begun
We are the truth, the chosen ones
We are the new, the past is gone
We are the future and we have just begun
We are the future
