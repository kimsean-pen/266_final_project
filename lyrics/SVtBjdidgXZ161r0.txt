The girl who cried "Love, won't you come and play with me?"
You can be Cassandra, underneath the sword of Damocles
We'll tear this baby apart wise like Solomon
run, come shatter me now
Shatter me with hope
Crawl, come breathe me in, bleed out all sorrow
Scream me a dream, untouched by shadows
Baby, shatter me now, shatter me now
Shatter me with hope

She'll be the witness to the repose of Evelyn
Push the needle into
To the canticles of ecstasy
Turn to page forty three
And you'll know how I feel

Run, come shatter me now, shatter me with hope
Crawl come breathe me in, bleed out all sorrow
Scream me a dream, untouched by shadows
Baby, shatter me now, shatter me now
shatter me with hope

Swear on your heart's grave I'm wrong
and love like your life's depending on it
cause it is!

We'll tear this baby apart, wise like Solomon
Turn to page forty three, and you'll know how I feel

Run, come shatter me now, shatter me with hope
Crawl, come breathe me in
Bleed out all sorrow
Scream me a dream, untouched by shadows
Baby, shatter me now, shatter me now
shatter me with hope
Shatter me now, shatter me now, shatter me now
oh, you oh
Shatter me now shatter me now shatter me now
oh, you oh
Scream me a dream
(Shatter me now shatter me now shatter me now)
Scream me a dream
(Shatter me now, shatter me now, shatter me now)
