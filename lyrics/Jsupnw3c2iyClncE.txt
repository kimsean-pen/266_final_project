You let the wind take us down.
You let the storm come wipe us out
I saw the fog snuff you out
I saw the ocean come take you under

I have my boot stuck in your mouth
I have you screaming for your last breath, yeah
I shoved them up deep inside

You take the high road down
I take the ground below you
You take the high road down
I take the ground below

You are the one who nobody likes
You are the plague that was brought here by rats
I like to hunt you, let's fight
Watching you fade out and never come back

You take the high road down
I take the ground below you
You take the high road down
I take the ground below

You take the high road down
I take the ground below you
You take the high road down
I take the ground below
