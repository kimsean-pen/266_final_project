I tried to run and run but paranoia waits for me
My clock is counting down and time won't give it back to me
The iron fist of danger
Always smiling never sleeps
The hand of doom resides inside my own worst enemy

Oh, I drag you like a ball and chain
Oh, it's calling my name

I'm a magnet, I attract it
Everywhere I go you know trouble follows
I'm just a magnet for pain
I'm a magnet, I attract it
Everywhere I go you know trouble follows
I'm just a magnet for pain
Magnet for pain

They say I'm born to lose but nothing gold has ever stayed
I've nothing left to offer but this gift of misery
I know that's what you wanted
Such dramatic agony
The fever breaks again
I can feel it following
And it's calling my name

I'm a magnet, I attract it
Everywhere I go you know trouble follows
I'm just a magnet for pain
I'm a magnet, I attract it
Everywhere I go you know trouble follows
I'm just a magnet for pain
Magnet for pain

I'm a magnet, I attract it
Everywhere I go you know trouble follows
I'm just a magnet for pain
I'm a magnet, I attract it
Everywhere I go you know trouble follows
I'm just a magnet for pain
(I'm just a magnet for pain)
I'm a magnet, I attract it
Everywhere I go you know trouble follows
I'm just a magnet for pain
Magnet for pain
