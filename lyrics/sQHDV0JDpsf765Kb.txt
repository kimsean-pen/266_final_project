I see overcast again
Light snow in February
I can't make amends, I cannot pretend
Estuaries
Flow under this bridge
Hatchets we'll never bury
You dug up the ditch, I tried not to miss
What's dead already

I won't take your word
This cemetery's full of graves you cursed
And you were so despondent upon your descent
And every single promise was fraudulent then

I won't believe you anymore
Cause she was never yours
And I don't even need a metaphor to tell you
I hate the person you became
The curse inside your brain
Was turpentine it burst your mind in flames
I'm to blame

I'm at the overpass tonight
Rainfall in late October
I can't stand the sight, dark foreboding skies
Hover over
Roads where we collide
Closed eyes instead of closure
Confrontations rise
Conversations die
We get older but

Time won't heal these wounds
Full exposure to
Crimes you still refute
And you were so despondent upon your descent
And every single promise was fraudulent then

Terrors in the night always find a space inside
Terrors in the night always find a place to hide
