What's up with all the new faces
These days everybody wanna be famous
Don't wanna study wanna make it on the A-list
They swap their dignity for hits
Ain't got no patience
'Cause everybody wants a portion
Of the Devil's pie without caution
Don't know its gonna cost a fortune
To sell your soul
They're running just to get in first place
I'm walking going at my own place
I'm great
They say slow and steady wins the race
Ain't wrong of us for trying to fly
They're fading like we're losing the sky
I'm fine waiting, for my payday
Baby don't lose your pride 'cause you're deprived
Thats career suicide, to sign without your mind
Then they monopolise your enterprise
Then they'll leave you paralysed, hah
Be on your grind, and take your time (uh-huh)
Pay no mind to the dollar sign
Don't let the moolah make you blind
Or you will find your name on the guest-list, uh
A house on a necklace, uh
Well-known and respected, uh
Lamborghini not rented
'Till your money going right down, (right down), uh
No single ready right now, (right now)
You ain't got no more hits
Label said you're dismissed
They're running just to get in first place
I'm walking going at my own place
I'm great
They say slow and steady wins the race
Ain't wrong of us for trying to fly
They're fading like we're losing the sky
I'm fine waiting, for my payday
All that glitters isn't gold
Oh baby don't you know
First they love you then they don't
You were hot now then so cold
Gave the world but you lost your soul
Now you're losing your control
For some rocks and brand new clothes
There's fire, take it slow
They're running just to get in first place
I'm walking going at my own place
I'm great
They say slow and steady wins the race
(I'll be taking my time, I'll be taking my time)
Ain't wrong of us for trying to fly
They're fading like we're losing the sky
I'm fine waiting, for my payday
