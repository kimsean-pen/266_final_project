Heavenly ocean
Covered in flesh
Everything's in motion
Laced with lingering eyes
Sleepless nights
Killing intro
Studying my red heart

Do whatever you feel like doing right now
I'm losing sight of these
Calmly embracing it all
Deep down below
Where the oxygen flows
There's an underworld
If you motion there I'll carry you

Flickering lights
In an unborn life
Everything's brighter
But it beats the brown eyes
Sleepless nights
Killing intro
Now living in my heart
