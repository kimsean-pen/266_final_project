I don't really like people
Such a thorn in the side of me
And I don't really, like being
Or feeling boring, or try to fake
Cause I don't really like people
Making comments, about my teeth
And I don't really, like seeing
The news today, I'm trying to breathe
I'm trying to

After this, I feel I like you more
I feel I like you
After this, I feel I like you more
I feel I like you

I don't really like people
Making comments, behind a screen
Cause I don't really, mind being
On my own, just for a day
Sometimes I'm feeling, that people
Keep on talking over the top of me
Then I see what, you've created
I get forgetful, but excited
Excited

After this, I feel I like you more
I feel I like you
After this, I feel I like you more
I feel I like you

I'm not saying it's all too late
They're calling my name
They're calling my name
It means too much, but it's all the same
I'm not saying it's all too late
It's in my head
It's in my head
I wake up in the morning and it's all been changed

After this, I feel I like you more
I feel I like you
After this, I feel I like you more
I feel I like you

After this, I feel I like you more
I feel I like you
After this, I feel I like you more
I feel I like you

I feel I like you
I feel I like you
