So just give me a chance, you know I never wanted one
You and I are seriously outnumbered
Meet me outside we'll run away like we're kids
Bonnie and Clyde or something just as stupid...
Your scars are just a kiss from a past mistress
Across a crowded room I'm whispering something and
Only you can understand me

If you look at me from a different angle
Do you see something that you just can't handle?
I don't have much time, like a butterfly
Only one night to try and change my life
Let's get out of here, head to the city
We walk through the streets jangling your keys
Some days I feel like I'm made out of glass
I think I'm better off just keeping my distance
â€˜Cause maybe they can see right through me?

Soul with sutures
Redeeming features
Don't wanna feel it
It's a one way feeling so I've got it all
