Times flies when you're by my side
Got butterflies in my belly now ow ow
Take me back to the place I found
You were lost staring at the ground ow ow

So open your eyes
Or own paradise is here
By your side, by your side
And what if we fall
We are not afraid to lose control
We own the night, we own the night

This is who we are
We are meant to touch the starts
Supposed to know the truth
That lies inside of you
We're faces in the crowd
Our voices are so loud
And it's a matter of time
Until we all become the sound
I can't help

Thinking back feels like I was blind
We are young
There was nothing in my mind
And despite all the frozen clouds
I'll be your friend
Be the best thing you've got now

So open your eyes
Or own paradise is here
By your side, by your side
So what if we fall
We are not afraid to lose control
We own the night, we own the night

This is who we are
We are meant to touch the starts
Supposed to know the truth
That lies inside of you
We're faces in the crowd
Our voices are so loud
And it's a matter of time
Until we all become the sound
I can't help
(We are meant to touch the starts)
(That lies inside of you)
(Our faces)
(Our voices)
