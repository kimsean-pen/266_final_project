There is no time
Only us and the oceans
I used my luck
Just to stay in motion
I hear the people
Whispering secrets
Behind my back
Watching me go through all this

Trivial motion
Trivial motion
Throwing my weight through trivial motion
Trivial motion
Trivial motion
Wasting my time with trivial motion

I'm not a Romeo
My pyre is spent
I've been to ruin
To move with intent
Material love
Is that what I need to feel at peace within?
Quit all this acting out on

Trivial motion
Trivial motion
Throwing my weight through trivial motion
Trivial motion
Trivial motion
Wasting my time with trivial motion

And I'm looking for something to hold
Too much too fast and I let go
Am I spitting out words I don't even know?
Too much too fast and I lose control

Trivial motion
Trivial motion
Throwing my weight through trivial motion
Trivial motion
Trivial motion
Wasting my time with trivial motion

And I'm looking for something to hold
Too much too fast and I let go
Am I spitting out words I don't even know?
Too much too fast and I lose control

And I'm looking for something to hold
Too much too fast and I let go
Am I spitting out words I don't even know?
Too much too fast and I lose control
