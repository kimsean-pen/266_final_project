I knocked at your door
There you were, no t-shirt on
Big lump in my throat
Scared to death, are you sober?
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Let's go outside and be together
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Let's run away, be free forever
And I'll fix you
And I'll fix you
Money, love, success
These are the things that we do best
Money, love, success
These are the things that we do best
If this is what you want
Then this is what you get
Money, love, success
Success
Success
Darker than before
Back to back just like you asked
Handsome as you were
In your world I felt so lost
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Let's go outside and be together
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Let's run away, be free forever
And I'll fix you
And I'll fix you
Money, love, success
These are the things that we do best
Money, love, success
These are the things that we do best
If this is what you want
Then this is what you get
Money, love, success
Success
Success
Though there never was a time we cried together
You said I was your best mistake
Do you [?] when I'm with you all your [?]
Each one laced with pleasure and pain
Can I fix you?
Will I fix you?
Money, love, success
These are the things that we do best
Money, love, success
These are the things that we do best
If this is what you want
Then this is what you get
Money, love, success
Success
Success
Money, love, success
These are the things that we do best
Money, love, success
These are the things that we do best
If this is what you want
Then this is what you get
Money, love, success
Success
