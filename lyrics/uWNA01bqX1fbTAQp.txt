Connection has never been stronger
We see the same things
I gave all my money to God
Expecting relief
And as they kicked me out
I swore

Somebody is a liar
You shouldn't play with fire
You may get burned
You know, you know
I put my trust in this
But I know, I know
I've been misplacing it

I thought I was different
No, but I did the same things
You were wrong and admitted it
Saw you were just like me

Where was the grace I had before?

Somebody is a liar
You shouldn't play with fire
You may get burned
You know, you know
I put my trust in this
But I know, I know
I've been misplacing it

I ran
And I ran
And I ran for You
But I broke my work
I broke my word
I see
And I see
And I see it's true
That I broke my word
That I broke my word

Where was the grace I had before?

Somebody is a liar
You shouldn't play with fire
You may get burned
You know, you know
I put my trust in this
But I know, I know
I've been misplacing it

I broke my word!
