I asked you where you'd been and you said "None'ya"
"None'ya business, don't you ask no more"
You said "If you would do a better job of listenin'
Then maybe you would understand why I'm at the door"
You just had to paint the front porch ceiling turquoise
You said "That's the way we do it in the South"
You claimed it keeps out all the evil spirits
Sometimes I can't believe the words a-comin' out your mouth

But I try because I want to
I know your heart the best way that I can
Through the laughter and the pain
And the sometimes just insane
Girl, all I wanna do is be your man

Sometimes we'll pretend like we are strangers
Out there meeting up for the first time
I'll be a doctor or a secret agent
Just hopin' that you laugh at me as I throw out my lines

I used to tell myself I had it covered
That everything was where it needs to be
But then you showed up and you looked me over
And now I see, aw, I see
Now I see, darlin', I see

And so I try because I need to
I know your heart the best way that I can
For the laughter, for the pain
For the way you call my name
Girl, all I wanna do is be your man

I asked you where you'd been and you said "None'ya"
"None'ya business, don't you ask no more"
