Rising up
New dawn to see
Toughen Up
All that I can be
I never talk about the sun and the rain
I never talk about pleasure or pain
You turn up
And you turn down
And I make way
For me
Calling back
New chance for me
Summing up
All that I can see
I always talk about the sun and the rain
I never talk about the pleasure or pain
So if you tell me you'll help me
Oh, I'll be on my way
But if you tell me you hate me
Oh, how I'd love you to stay
Crashing down... Lesson for me

Toughen up... so all of you can see
I never care about my dangling chain
What use of trying when it's always the same?

Rising up for a new dawn to see
Rising up for a new dawn for greet
Rising up for a new day to meet.
