Oh, I put your story on a timer
I'm skimming through your lips
Maybe something sticks

Oh, I only have so many heartbeats
I'll give you that kiss
Just to check it off my list

Level level up
Better be the better
Level level up
Better every second

Oh, 'cause every second needs a purpose
I eat food for fuel
Everywhere I go I go to school

Oh, go step it up I'm on a deadline
Only picking up the phone
When I'll be talking to a stepping stone

Level level up
Better be the better
Level level up
Better every second

Level level up
Party under pressure
Level level up
Better every second

Oh, take a good look at the clock babe
Tell me what's the harm
In setting an alarm

Oh, I only have so many heartbeats
I'm putting in the sweat
So I'll be smiling when I'm done and dead

Level level up
Better be the better
Level level up
Better every second

Level level up
Party under pressure
Level level up
Better every second
