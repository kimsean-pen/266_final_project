Blackbird blackbird don't sing to me
Don't sing below my window
Fly somewhere else don't bother me
Don't sing below my window

You sang when he was in my bed
You sang when my heart sang
Now you remind me of something I'll never have
So blackbird don't sing
Blackbird don't sing

Blackbird blackbird I am now alone
Somewhere else go make your home
Don't nestle here go find lovers of your own

I am now alone...

You sang when he was in my bed
You sang when my heart sang
Now you remind me of something I'll never have
So blackbird don't sing
Blackbird don't sing
Blackbird don't sing

You sang when he was in my bed
You sang when my heart sang
Now you remind me of something I'll never have
So blackbird don't sing
Blackbird don't sing
Blackbird don't sing
