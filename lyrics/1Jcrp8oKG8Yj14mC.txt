Hi

Blazing hip hop and R&B
DJ Clue, Desert Storm
New Mariah
Often immitated, never duplicated

Whatever, look they can't do it like though

W-C-L-U-E
Just play the record, Clue

Guess who's back in the motherf*ckin' house
With two big tigglebitties for your mouth
Heartbreakers must partake in the sensation
So So Def and Clue hits in the making

Oh, guess who's driving the 5 double o
Like Yipi Yi Yipi Yo yeah
When I talk smack y'all better skip back
Like here we go, cause the bitch don't play

Ooh, your love's so good
I don't wanna let go
And although I should
I can't leave you alone
Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst of you
And I cannot resist at all

Boy if I do
The things you want me to
The way I used to do
Would you love (love) me (me) baby
Or leave me feeling used
Would you go and break my heart

Heartbreaker you've got the best of me
But I just keep coming back incessantly (Keep comin boy, oh why)
Oh why did you have to run your game on me (Did you)
I should of known right from the start
(I shoulda known right from the start you'd go and break my heart)
You'd go and break my heart

I need someone to give me some real love
I need someone to give me some real love
I need someone to give me some real love
I need someone to give me some real love
Ooh, real
Said I need somebody

Why, when I met you that night baby
I didn't know it wouldn't last
I gave my love to you honey
Wish I could take it all back
See I have never met a guy (C'mon, yea yea)
That would spend time telling lies (C'mon yea yea, yea yea)
Should've know you'd break my heart

Well if Da Brat gave a fuck about a nigga
My heart would be broke
Should of know you were star struck
When I left your stroke
My guards were up in the beginning
But then I gave you my heart and you broke it again
I'm a fool when you smile at me, I'm convinced
I get caught up in you and I just can't resist
I know you lie to me, it just drive me nuts
That one kiss could persuade me to believe your bluffs
You set it up and impressed me with gifts and rings
I wish love was dollars cause shit money ain't a thang
Cause Iluminati and MC move the party
I got a heater ready to blaze somebody
It's that dummy you, it's that for each member of my crew
In fact, I'ma heartbreak you
Lay you flat on your back
You really don't know
So I advise you not to trust me no

Yo, yo
Baby, I the real thing
So why you got me sweating you constantly baby
Baby, I got that good thing
So while you're making love to me you crazy baby
(Oh!)

I like the way he used to spank me
He used to lie me on my back take that!
He used to have me in the sack, legs back
But now he be buggin' lately
Hey boy why you actin' stinky
I keep ya stiff like wood baby
So if you wanna keep a good lady
You need to stop with all the heartbreaking

Heartbreaker you've got the best of me (Oh boy you got the best of me)
But I just keep coming back incessantly (I keep on coming babe)
Oh why did you have to run your game on me
(Why did you have run your game)
I should of known right from the start (Right from the start that you'd)
You'd go and break my heart

Heartbreaker you've got the best of me
But I just keep coming back incessantly
Oh why did you have to run your game on me
I should of known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart [fade]

I need someone to give me some real love...
