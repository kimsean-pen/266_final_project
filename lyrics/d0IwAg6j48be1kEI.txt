Red snow, you see,
My emptiness is overfills me.
I close my eyes
And falling in your cold embrace.
I feel so enchanted
With red snow where I sleep (forever)
I feel so enchanted
With red snow where I sleep (forever).

I never felt like this way before,
I don't know how to breathe.
This night
Will change my life forever.
And tears will turn in ice.

Red snow, you see,
My emptiness is overfills me.
I close my eyes
And falling in your cold embrace.
I feel so enchanted
With red snow where I sleep (forever)
I feel so enchanted
With red snow where I sleep (forever)
