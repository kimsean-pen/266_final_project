Come under my wings, little bird
Come under my wings, little bird
Come under my wings

Unmade
Unmade
I swear that there's nothing
Up my sleeve
And then back again
I swear there's nothing
Unmade

There's no faces
Won't grow back again
Broken pieces
Unmade

I swear there's nothing
Won't grow back again
I swear there's nothing

Come under my wings
Come under my wings
Come under my wings
Under my wings
We're unmade
