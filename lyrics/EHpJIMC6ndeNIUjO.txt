Calm down, twenty five
Was it a waste of time
All we did twice underlined
Same tracks on the ground
We're spinning round and round
Oh, please, someone gets a car

We made our way across the land
We made our way across the town
We're all about to explode

So (oh, oh, oh, oh) time for a change
Oh, oh, oh, oh, well
Can you feel it?

So (oh, oh, oh, oh), time for a change
Oh, oh, oh, oh well
Can you feel it?

Sometimes, coming home at dawn you realize
All your city's undersized
Woman, friends of mine
I've got to leave afar
But I'll never let you down

We made our way across the land
We made our way across the town
We're all about to explode

So (oh, oh, oh, oh) time for a change
Oh, oh, oh, oh, well
Can you feel it?

So (oh, oh, oh, oh) time for a change
Oh, oh, oh, oh, well
Can you feel it?

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm ready to run
What is your plan? Now, what's on your mind?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm ready to run
What is your plan? Now, what's on your mind?

We made our way across the land
We made our way across the town
We're all about to explode

So (oh, oh, oh, oh) time for a change
Oh, oh, oh, oh, well
Can you feel it?

So (oh, oh, oh, oh) time for a change
Oh, oh, oh, oh, well
Can you feel it?

So (oh, oh, oh, oh) time for a change
Oh, oh, oh, oh, well
Can you feel it?

So (oh, oh, oh, oh) time for a change
Oh, oh, oh, oh, well
Can you feel it?
