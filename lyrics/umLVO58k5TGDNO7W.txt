You built this house
You built it stone by stone
Hammer in your hand
You built this home

And this house is strong
You raised it with your love
A shelter from the winds
From the cold and dark

Nobody has to cry
To make it seem real
Nobody has to hide
The way that they feel

If you'll stay right here
Tomorrow you'll be fine
I will be here for you
Standing by your side

So come home
Come home

You built those walls
To hide your fears inside
We were younger then
It's safe now to come outside

We built this home
On this little piece of land
The sky above is dark
No rain comes in

Nobody has to cry
To make it seem real
Nobody has to hide
The way that they feel

If you'll stay right here
Tomorrow you'll be fine
I will be here for you
Standing by your side

So come home
Come home

As the storm grows stronger deeper and wide
My face a winding river with no riverside
As the years grow longer I will be here by your side
Ashes to dust and storm by storm
Forever I will always be your love

Nobody has to cry
To make it seem real
Nobody has to hide
The way that they feel

If you'll stay right here
Tomorrow you'll be fine
I will be here for you
Standing by your side

So come home
Come home
Come home
