Sleep well my friend
You must be tired
I wouldn't blame myself
I'm different

Now don't be foolish
No one keeps their promise
How could you know?
When I would be so oh

You can't escape the crips of desire
You lie to yourself, but you always remember

Your love stung like a bee
Keep that stuff away from me, it's caution
Shouldn't I forgive him? I would know
Don't wanna let it grow like poison

Now don't be silly, no one clears their conscience
Blown out of proportion, Silly me I cried for weeks
An ocean

You can't escape the crips of desire
You lie to yourself, but you always remember

What can I say? Nothing can change

You can't escape the crips of desire
You lie to yourself, but you always remember

When you lose yourself
Then you lose yourself
Can't forgive yourself, oh no
