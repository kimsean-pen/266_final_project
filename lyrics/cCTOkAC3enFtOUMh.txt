He is the prince of the land of Fife
Noble and true with a heart of steel
Now it is lost vengeance shall be his
Angus McFife is his name

Across the wasteland, I ride upon swift steed
Behind me lies the burning ruins of Dundee
No turning back now, my journey lies ahead
I won't give up until the sorcerer is dead
A raging hero with a destiny of steel
With glory overcomes a mighty quest concealed

He is the prince of the land of Fife
Noble and true with a heart of steel
Now it is lost vengeance shall be his
Angus McFife is his name

He is the prince of the land of Fife
Noble and true with a heart of steel
Now it is lost vengeance shall be his
Angus McFife is his name

In ancient castle, frozen for all time
Inside the dungeons my beloved waits to die
Ride fast for vengeance, but I must find a way
The force of unicorns makes Zargothrax fight great
Power of the sorcerer to great to be controlloed
Glenrothes trees will heal the torment in my soul

He is the prince of the land of Fife
Noble and true with a heart of steel
Now it is lost vengeance shall be his
Angus McFife is his name

He is the prince of the land of Fife
Noble and true with a heart of steel
Now it is lost vengeance shall be his
Angus McFife is his name

He is the prince of the land of Fife
Noble and true with a heart of steel
Now it is lost vengeance shall be his
Angus McFife is his name

He is the prince of the land of Fife
Noble and true with a heart of steel
Now it is lost vengeance shall be his
Angus McFife is his name
