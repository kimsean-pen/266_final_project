This could be the saddest dusk
Ever seen
Turn to a miracle
High-alive
My mind is racing
As it always will
My hand is tired, my heart aches
I'm half a world away here
My head sworn

To go it alone
And hold it along
Haul it along
And hold it
Go it alone
Hold it along and hold
Oh, the lonely deep sit hollow
I'm half a world
Half the world away

My shoes are gone
My life spent
I had too much to drink
I didn't think
And I didn't think of you
I guess that's all I needed

To go it alone
And hold it along
Haul it along
And hold it
Blackbirds, backwards, forwards and fall and hold,

Oh, this lonely world is wasted
Pathetic eyes high-alive
Blind to the tide that's turned the sea
This storm it came up strong
It shook' the trees and blew away our fear
I couldn't even hear

To go it alone
And hold it along
Haul it along
And hold it
To go it alone
And hold it along
Haul
To go it alone
And hold it along
Haul it along
And hold it
Blackbirds, backwards, forwards, and fall and hold,

Oh, this could be the saddest dusk
Ever seen
Turn to a miracle
High-alive
My mind is racing
As it always will
My hand is tired, my heart aches
I'm half a world away
Go...
