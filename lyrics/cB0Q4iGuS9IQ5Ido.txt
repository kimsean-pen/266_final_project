Hey yeah, yeah
Whoa, yeah
whoa, whoa, yeah,

Well everyone got an opinion now don't they
But it ain't no thing to me
It really don't make any difference now to me
If you don't like what you see
I pay no mind to the negative kind
'Cause that's just no way to be
I don't stop to please someone else's needs
Gonna live my life for me

I'm gonna keep on
I'm gonna do my own thing
we've all got a song that we're meant to sing
And no matter what people say or might think
I ain't going no place, no I'm here to stay
Gonna keep on doing my thing
'Cause whether they love or they hatin' on me
I'll still be the same girl I used to be
'Cause I ain't going no place
No I'm here to stay, ohh yeah
I'm here to stay, ohh yeah

I've never been the type to be shy
I know some would say I'm too headstrong.
But i'd rather be a woman who voices her mind
Whether you think I'm right or wrong
And I know some people wanna criticize
Makes them feel better about themselves
So say what you will, time will reveal
In the end, that I will be here still

I'm gonna keep on
I'm gonna do my own thing (yeah)
We've all got a song we're meant to sing (ah, meant to sing)
No matter what people say or might think (think)
I ain't going no place, no I'm here to stay (I'm here to stay)
Gonna keep on doing my thing (oh, gonna keep on)
'Cause whether they love or they hatin' on me (hatin' on me)
I'll still be the same girl I used to be (that I used to be)
'Cause I ain't going no place,
No I'm here to stay (I'm here to stay)

Gotta get up
Keep my head up
Gonna keep on turning it up
Never let up
If I keep stepping it up
I'm gonna prove that
I ain't never gonna be stopped
Like it or not

Gotta get up
Keep my head up
Gonna keep on turning it up
Never let up
If I keep stepping it up
I'm gonna prove that
I ain't never gonna be stopped
Like it or not
(ohh whoa whoa whoa)

No matter the pressures that face me
I believe, I believe that we'll see (we'll see)
I'll never let anyone break me, yeah
Hold me down, all I can do now is have strength in me (strength in me)
And life it ain't always that easy
Gotta fight to see past the boundaries
Crossing the line, I will define
Everytime, that forever is mine

I'm gonna keep on
I'm gonna do my own thing
we've all got a song that we're meant to sing
And no matter what people say or
might think (no matter what they say, yeah)
I ain't going no place, no I'm here to stay
Gonna keep on doing my thing (keep on)
'Cause whether they love or they hatin' on me (hatin' on me)
I'll still be the same girl I used to
be (I'm still the same girl i used to be)
'Cause I ain't going no place (and I ain't going no place)
No I'm here to stay, ohh yeah
I'm here to stay, ohh yeah

I'm gonna keep on
I'm gonna do my own thing (oh)
we've all got a song that we're meant to sing (so sing your song)
And no matter what people say or might think
I ain't going no place, no I'm here to stay (I ain't going no place)
Gonna keep on doing my thing (keep on doing my thing)
'Cause whether they love or they hatin' on me (love or hate on me)
I'll still be the same girl I used to be (same girl i used to be)
'Cause I ain't going no place (and I ain't going no place)
No I'm here to stay (yeah)
