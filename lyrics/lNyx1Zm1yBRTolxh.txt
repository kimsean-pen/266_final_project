From the place that I stand
to the land that is openly free
Watching rivers run black
by the trees that are vacant to greed

Gotta Give it up
Gotta get a second chance
Gotta Give it up
Gotta get a second chance
and the jokes just started

Gotta Give it up,
Give it up,
Give it up
Gotta Give it Up

Or tell me why I'm so wrong
Where does love come from
If you've sold your reasoning out

How can I learn
if I don't understand what I see
If I'm giving this mess
Take a walk through a nightmare so real

Gotta Give it up
Gotta get a second chance
Gotta Give it up
Gotta get a second chance
and the jokes just started

Gotta Give it up,
Give it up,
Give it up
Gotta Give it Up

Or tell me why I'm so wrong
Where does luck come from
When you've never been without

(Instrumental)

Give it up,
Give it up,
Give it up
Gotta Give it Up
Give it up,
Give it up
Gotta Give it Up

tell me if I'm so wrong
Where does love come from
If you've sold your reasoning out
Or tell me if I'm so wrong
Where does luck come from
When you've never been without

Can do it

you can do it

you can do it

Gotta give up
