On the second floor you were up all night
They were there to help you feel alright,
When the darkness fell on the midnight bell
They were there to help you one more time

I'm a pusher man
I'll give her what I can
She will never learn, but that's alright
I'm alright

When the hammer falls you wont feel at all
They were there to help you feel alright
When the bullet flies in the city skies
They were there to wake you one more time

I'm a pusher man
I'll give her what I can
She will never learn, but that's alright
I'm alright
