Tell me
When the time has come
And no one's left to save me
Is there any chance?

I know I might be wrong, not enough to doubt
That the one thing I pursue and what I'm all about
Are like a cage for me, one that I create
Still unlocked but can I realize before it's too late?

But if suddenly
You were standing right in front of me
I could barely hope and dare to say
That you're the reason why I'm on my own now

Tell me
When the time has come
And no one's left to save me
Can we leave it all behind and start again?
Can we start again?

Can we start again?
Can we start again?

Let me think again, take a second glance
Can I really dare to hope there is a second chance
To give up on it, leave that hate behind
And eventually get to smile again when you're on my mind

And now finally
You are standing right in front of me
Liberation when I came to see
I may be on my own but I don't hate you

Tell me
When the time has come
And no one's left to save me
Is there any chance?

And when the time comes I'll greet you as a friend
Let go of all the stories I thought would never end
The time comes what I know to be true
All along I've been waiting for you

Tell me
When the time has come
And no one's left to save me
Can we leave it all behind?

All that I want to move on beyond
And I know that I was wrong
So tell me
Can we leave it all behind and start again?
