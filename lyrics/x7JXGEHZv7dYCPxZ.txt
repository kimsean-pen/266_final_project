I'm in over my head
I don't think of you as bits and pieces
I think of you only
Like a miracle
Loving so deeply I feel it
through all my past lives
It feels good
I'm never saying goodbye
It feels good
I'm never saying goodbye

I'm in over my head
over my head...
I'm in over my head
over my head...

Science
They explain it to me
There's no joy I can take with
knowing what's waiting
Here for now
but, not for long
Where will my mind slip away?
Explain that to me

I'm in over my head
Loving so deeply I'm in over my head
