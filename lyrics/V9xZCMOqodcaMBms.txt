I'm countin' on this fire
To hold me, love
Been smokin on this blunt
To keep me up
If I beg for it, Will you get me off?
Cause what you need to give to me
It ain't much
It ain't much, ooh

If we're birds, we'll fly together
Others can't have what we're having
You supply what I'm demanding
I want it all (hoo hoo)

I want it all (hoo hoo)
I want it all (hoo hoo)
I want it all (hoo hoo)
Hoo hoo
That's why I call you up at 4 in the morning
Cause I'm not above that
That's why we're making love all night until dawning
Cause I'm not above that

Tender nights just to keep you smiling
'fraid I'm not above that
You know our love is like the thunder and lightning
No I'm not above that, not above that

I wanna wrap it all around you (around you ooh)
Hold you down like I'm s'posed to (s'possed to)
Yeah, you know you hit it right, babe, don't you?

Don't think I'll ever be
If we're birds, we'll fly together
Others can't have what we're having
You supply what I'm demanding
I want it all (hoo hoo)
I want it all (hoo hoo)
I want it all (hoo hoo)
I want it all (hoo hoo)

Hoo hoo
That's why I call you up at 4 in the morning
Cause I'm not above that
That's why we're making love all night until dawning

Cause I'm not above that
Tender nights just to keep you smiling
'fraid I'm not above that
You know our love is like the thunder and lightning
No I'm not above that, not above that
If the world came tumbling down
I'd still be holding you down
Not above that
Not above that
That's why I call you up at 4 in the morning
Cause I'm not above that
That's why we're making love all night until dawning
Cause I'm not above that
Tender nights just to keep you smiling
'fraid I'm not above that
You know our love is like the thunder and lightning
No I'm not above that, not above that
