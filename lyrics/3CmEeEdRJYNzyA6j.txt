Tell me all your sweet, sweet little lies
All about the dark places you hide
Tell me all your problems, make them mine
Tell me all your sweet, sweet little lies

I live a picture in my head
Call it soaring as I float up but my body and my bed, yeah
And I wonder if I'm dead
Saw the white lights flicker
So I wake up in a sweat, code red
Sirens going off, probably something that I dread
Thinking 'bout the shit I never told you that I meant
I can shake it off, chloroform peace and rest
But you know all I ever really wanted was a friend

Tell me all your sweet, sweet little lies
All about the dark places you hide
Tell me all your problems, make them mine
Tell me all your sweet, sweet little lies
I wonder if the sun will shine again
If I'll ever see your face again
You know I'd rather die than say goodbye
So tell me all your sweet, sweet little lies

I'm not fantasy
Just wanna teleport again
I got a spare key
We can go and play pretend
(We can go and play pretend)
Yeah, we can really transcend, ohh
(We can really transcend, yeah)
You and me, in an empty room
They can't get in, only room for two
If you play your part and I play mine too
I'll never take my eyes off you

Tell me all your sweet, sweet little lies
All about the dark places you hide
Tell me all your problems, make them mine
Tell me all your sweet, sweet little lies
I wonder if the sun will shine again
If I'll ever see your face again
You know I'd rather die than say goodbye
So tell me all your sweet, sweet little lies

(Sweet, sweet, tell me all your sweet, sweet little lies)
Tell me all your sweet, sweet little
(Sweet, sweet, tell me all your sweet, sweet little lies)

I love the picture in my head
But I know that it's not real
I leave a picture in my head
'Cause I like how it makes me feel

Tell me all your sweet, sweet little lies
All about the dark places you hide
Tell me all your problems, make them mine
Tell me all your sweet, sweet little lies
I wonder if the sun will shine again
If I'll ever see your face again
You know I'd rather die than say goodbye
So tell me all your sweet, sweet little lies

(Sweet, sweet, tell me all your sweet, sweet little lies)
Tell me all your sweet
(Sweet, sweet, tell me all your sweet, sweet little lies)
