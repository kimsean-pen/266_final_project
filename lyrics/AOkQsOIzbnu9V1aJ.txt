If you're looking for a place
You can fly together
And you're really afraid of
What you're leaving behind
Take the easiest road
But take care my brother
For you'll never find peace
With a troubled mind

Far better to love each other
Than to worry so deeply
¡®bout the place you're in
And far better to kiss her softly
Than lookin' back on a love
You'll never have again

Time's as fickle as
The sky in winter
And two hearts always
Were better than one
Love has the wings
Of a tireless angel
She'll stay beside you
Till the day is done

La la la la la ...

You'll never have again
No no no, never again
You'll never have again
