We finished our old lives
Like we finished off the wine
Now we're used to staying up all night
Two hearts beating
Oh yeah, oh yeah

You can keep tomorrow
After tonight, we're not going to need it
Beat up (beat up)
Beat down (beat down)
Wet ground, but too drunk to feel it
(2x)

We used to dream
Now we worry about dying
(4x)

I don't want to worry about dying
I just want to worry about those sunshine girls
(2x)

Young hearts
Spark fire
All night
Oh yeah, oh yeah

You can keep tomorrow
After tonight, we're not going to need it
Beat up (beat up)
Beat down (beat down)
Wet ground, but too drunk to feel it
(2x)

We used to dream
Now we worry about dying
(4x)

I don't want to worry about dying
I just want to worry about those sunshine girls
(5x)
