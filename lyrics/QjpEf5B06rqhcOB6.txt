Solace
Lost and left to fade
We are falling

I am falling apart
From the apathy of our kind
An abortion of our heart
They will tear apart
As we remain numb
So much has been corrupted by the
Liars and the thieves

Liar, bastard, judging us
As we succumb to our disease
Liar, bastard, judging us
We are left here without the cure

As I fall apart
All is going dark
As I fall apart

I must see
I must feel
All I fight for
Left inside

All I see
All I feel
I'll still fight for
What's inside my heart

We were the sons
We were the daughters
That must consume
As we have no choice
To give up our life
To a window made of light
We're lost

Liars
Bastards
Thieves of man

We are falling
