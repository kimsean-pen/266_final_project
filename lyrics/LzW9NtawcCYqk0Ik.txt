Every evening when all
My day's work is through
I call my baby and ask her
What shall we do

I mention movies but
She don't seem to dig that
And then she asks me
Why don't I come to her flat

And have some supper
And let the evening pass by
By digging records
Beside a groovy hi-fi

I say yeh, yeh
That's what I say
I say yeh, yeh

My baby loves me
She gets me feeling so fine
Because she loves me,
She makes me know that she's mine

And when she kisses
I feel the fire get hot
She never misses
She gives it all that she's got

And when she asks me
If everyhing is okay
I got my answer
The only thing I can say

I say yeh, yeh
That's what I say
I say yeh, yeh

We'll play a melody
And turn the lights down low
So that I can't see

We gotta do that
We gotta do that
We gotta do that
We gotta do that

And there'll be
No one else alive in all
The world cept you and me
Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh
Yeh, yeh and a yeh yeh

Pretty baby
I never knew such a thrill
It's hard to tell you
Because I'm trembling still

My pretty baby
I want you all for my own
I think I'm ready
To leave those others alone

No need to ask me
If everything is okay
I got my answer
The only thing I can say

I say yeh, yeh
That's what I say
I say yeh, yeh
That's what I say

We'll play a melody
And turn the lights down low
So that I can't see

We gotta do that
We gotta do that, yeh, yeh
We gotta do that
We gotta do that

And there'll be
No one else alive in all
The world cept you and me
Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh
Yeh, yeh and a yeh yeh

Pretty baby
I never knew such a thrill
It's hard to tell you
Because I'm trembling still

My pretty baby
I want you all for my own
I think I'm ready
To leave those others alone

No need to ask me
If everything is okay
I got my answer
The only thing I can say

I say yeh, yeh
That's what I say
I say yeh, yeh
That's what I say

I say yeh, yeh
That's what I say
I say yeh, yeh
