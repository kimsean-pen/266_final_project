They say that life
Is a gift given divine
But it's a sweat and it's a grind
Saying you can better

And they say that life
Will bring heartache and bring pain
But also sunshine after rain
And that it will get better

So you hold on
'Cos you don't know what you'll find
Making money, spend your time
Keep fighting

You hold on
As you live until you die
'Cos you don't know who you'll find
Somewhere, out there
In this life

Work hard, put on a smile
Place all your fears in the back of your mind
Just work hard, put on a smile
Place all your fears in the back of your mind
Just work hard, put on a smile
Place all your fears in the back of your mind
Just work hard, put on a smile
Place all your fears in the back of your mind
Just work

All of my life
I've been protecting what was mine
And I know that we could find
Someplace better

So don't give it up
'Cos in this big wheel that we spin
Just let it go and just give in
There's nothing better

So you hold on
'Cos you don't know what you'll find
Making money, spend your time
Keep fighting

You hold on
As you live until you die
'Cos you don't know who you'll find
Somewhere, out there
In this life

Work hard, put on a smile
Place all your fears in the back of your mind
Just work hard, put on a smile
Place all your fears in the back of your mind
Just work hard, put on a smile
Place all your fears in the back of your mind
Just work hard, put on a smile
Place all your fears in the back of your mind
Just work, work, work, work, work
