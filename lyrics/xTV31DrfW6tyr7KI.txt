I've been running through this town
I've been combing every street
I've been searching for the reason within reasons
Been searching for the higher ground in me

And I've been trying to surrender
To trust in every word
All my days of misery
Someone could have taken them from me

I've been searching for myself
For oh so many times
I've been searching for the answer within answers
But no one seems to know what's on my mind

Craving for her love
Aching for her touch
All my days of misery
Someone could have taken them from me

So tell me where you are
Tell me how you feel
Tell me what you need
Just tell me how you feel

And let it all just rain on me
Let it all just rain on me
Let it all just rain on me
Rain down on me

If only for a day
Oh, if only for one night
I could tell you this is everything
That I have ever lived for

But I'd be giving it all away
So look into these eyes
And tell me how you feel
All my days of misery
Someone could have taken them from me

So tell me where you are
Tell me how you feel
Tell me what you need
Just tell me how you feel

And let it all just rain on me
Let it all just rain on me
Let it all just rain on me
Rain down on me
