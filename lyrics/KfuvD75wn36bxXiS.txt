Now look at them yo-yos that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Money for nothin' and chicks for free
Now that ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Lemme tell ya them guys ain't dumb
Maybe get a blister on your little finger
Maybe get a blister on your thumb

We gotta install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We gotta move these refrigerators
We gotta move these colour TVs

See the little faggot with the earring and the makeup
Yeah buddy that's his own real hair
That little faggot got his own jet airplane
The little faggot he's a millionaire

(We gotta install microwave ovens)
(Custom kitchens deliveries)
We gotta move these refrigerators
(We gotta move these refrigerators)
(We gotta move these colour TVs)

I should'a learned to play the guitar
I should'a learned to play them drums
Look at that mama, she got it stickin' in the camera
Man we could have some fun
And he's up there, what's that? Hawaiian noises?
He's bangin' on the bongos like a chimpanzee
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Get your money for nothin' get your chicks for free

We gotta install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We gotta move these refrigerators
We gotta move these colour TVs, Lord

Listen hear!
Now that ain't workin' that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Money for nothin' and your chicks for free
(Money for nothin' and chicks for free)
Money for nothin' and your chicks for free
(Money for nothin' and chicks for free)
Money for nothin' and your chicks for free
(Money for nothin' and chicks for free)
Money for nothin' and your chicks for free
