I want to share your mouthful
I want to do all the things your lungs do so well
I'm gonna bed into you like a cat beds into a bean bag
Turn you inside out to lick you like a crisp packet

(Ooooooooh)

You're the first and last of your kind
(Pull me like an animal out of a hole!)
I want to be every lever you pull
And all showers that shower you
I'm gonna paw, paw at you
Like a cat paws at my woollen jumper
Be your Minpin
And Borrower of handsome trivia

(Ooooooooh)
Devour me
(Ooooooooh)
Lou, Lou, let the cover girls sing!

All handclaps, you will clap
(Let me be the wallpaper that papers up your room!)
I want to be every button you press
And all the baths that surround you
Yes, I'm gonna roll around you
Like a cat rolls around saw dusted patios
I'm gonna kiss you
Like the sun browns you

(Ooooooooh)
Devour me
(Ooooooooh)
Devour me
(Ooooooooh)
(Ooooooooh)
If you really think that you can stomach me

I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle, freckle
