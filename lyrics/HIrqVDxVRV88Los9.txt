I heard
Church bells ringing
I heard
A quiet singing
I saw my love
Walk down
The aisle
On her finger
He placed a ring

Oooh, oh

I saw them
Holding hands
She was standing there
Wwith my man
I
Heard them promise
'Til death
Do us part
Each word
Was a pain
In my heart
All I could do

All I could do
Was cry
All I could do
Was cry
I was losing
The man
That I love
And all
I could do
Was cry
And now

The wedding
Is over
The rice
Rice has been thrown
Over their heads
For them life
Has just begun
But mine
Is ending
Ooh
All I could do

All I could do

Was cry
All I could do
Was cry
I was losing
The man
That I love
And all
I could do
Was cry
