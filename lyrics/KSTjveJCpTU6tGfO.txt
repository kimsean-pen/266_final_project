Well, it rains
Yeah, it rains
We can be someone forgiven
At least a some forgiven
With the strength
We never change
Its the reason we're together
We're just waiting for the weather to part us

I've been rolling my days away
And turn up the light that keeps me awake
I've been trying to sleep for a while
There be nothing left to talk about
No one left to hear
and a while we'll put water on these aches and this walls will disappear
for a while, we've been coring the cold light of day

Lost are lost
You put it down
Someone for safe keep it
to said you don't remember
but it's okay
makes some noise
it's you the all I needed
and all these books that we've been reading too long

I've been rolling my days away
And turn up the light that keeps me awake
I've been trying to sleep for a while
There be nothing left to talk about
No one left to hear
and a while we'll put water on this aches and this walls will disappear
For a while, we've been coring the cold light of day

The cold light of day

I've been rolling my days away
And turn up the light that keeps me awake
I've been trying to sleep
I've been trying to sleep for a while
There be nothing left to talk about
No one left to hear
and a while we'll put water on this aches and this walls will disapear
For a while, we've been coring the cold light of day
