Sometimes I feel like I can't move on
Nothing in life is turning me on
But I still see clearly
When I see you smiling

You know and nothing seems to fit
I couldn't see my way through the shit
When every single second
Of my waking day

Was thinking of you
Thinking of you
You never know

That I am alive
I am alive
I wanna grow

And there are so many things I can do
Just like falling in love with you
So take my hand now, understand me
You can come here too

C'mon people, we're making it now
Yeah, yeah, yeah
C'mon people, we're making it now
Yeah, yeah, yeah

But today, I worked it out
I got something I can shout about
Someone who believes
In all the things I'm thinking

But where have you gone?
Where have you gone?
I'll never know

Or I am alive
I am alive
I wanna grow

And there are so many things I can do
Just like falling in love with you
So take my hand now, understand me
You can come here too

C'mon people we're making it now
Yeah, yeah, yeah
C'mon people we're making it now
Yeah, yeah, yeah

C'mon people we're making it now
If only you could be with us

I feel fine now
I feel fine now

Don't stop now
No, no, no, don't stop now
Oh, no, no, don't stop now
Oh, no, no, don't stop now

Oh, no, no, don't stop now
Oh, no, no, don't stop now
Oh, no, no, don't stop now

Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no

Oh, no, no, don't stop now
Oh, no, no, don't stop now
No, no, no, don't stop now
Oh, no, no, don't stop now
No, no, no, don't stop now
