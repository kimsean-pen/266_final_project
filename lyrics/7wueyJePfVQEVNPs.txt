Send them over the waves, our sentinels
They report in the news, position of our foes
This battlefield's been chosen, tactically in advance
Time to alert our fighters, we're soon in range

Midway
We'll meet at Midway
Naval war

Calling all men to deck, got to be airborne
Head out into the sun, descending on our foes
This is the crucial moment, in the heat of the war
To fly and hit our targets, down in the waves

Midway, display their might
Ordering carriers, admirals at war
We'll meet at Midway to win the fight
Tactics are crucial, naval war

Far from shore, a pacific war
Bombs are falling from the skies
It's a bomb run day, it's the naval way
A blood red sun is on the rise
