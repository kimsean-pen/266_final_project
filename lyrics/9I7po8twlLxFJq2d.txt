(Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohl
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Listen up, everybody if you wanna take a chance
Just get on the floor and do the new kids' dance
Don't worry 'bout nothin' 'Cause it won't take long
We're gonna put you in a trance with a funky song

'Cause you gotta be
(Hangin' tough, hangin' tough, hangin' tough)
Are you tough enough?
(Hangin' tough, hangin' tough, hangin' tough)
We're rough

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Everybody's always talkin' 'bout who's on top
Don't cross our path 'cause you're gonna get stomped
We ain't gonna give anybody any slack

And if you try to keep us down we're gonna come right back
And you know we're
(Hangin' tough, hangin' tough, hangin' tough)
Are you tough enough?

(Hangin' tough, hangin' tough, hangin' tough)
We're rough
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Get loose, everybody, 'cause we're gonna do our thing
'Cause you know it ain't over' till the fat lady sings
Yo! Check it out!

Everybody's
Hangin' tough (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Just hangin' tough (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Hangin' tough (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Just hangin' tough (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Hangin' tough (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
