Ten years from now, I watched from far away
Ten years from now, I might have found my way
Ten years from now, I see with different eyes
Better, wiser and not as bland

Always looked for acceptance
I might understood what it's like to be different
Cannot believe in transcendence
This life gave birth to independence

Just no one see it like I do
Just no one knows that we're just passing through
No one feel what I do
We're passing through

These sihoulettes remain, they're not the sum of me
No longer represent who I used to be
They just remind me of where I used to wait
How I used to think. How I used to wake

Ten years from now, I watched from far away
Ten years from now, I should've found my way
Ten years from now, I see through different eyes
Better, wiser and not as bland

Just no one see it like I do
Just no one knows that we're just passing through
No one feel what I do
That we're passing through

Just no one see it like I do
Just no one knows that we're just passing through
No one feel what I do
That we're passing through

I always looked for acceptance
I understand what it's like to be different
Did not belive in transcendence
Just independence

Just no one see it like I do
Just no one knows that we're just passing through
No one feel what I do
That we're passing through

Just no one see it like I do
Just no one knows that we're just passing through
No one feel what I do
We're passing through
