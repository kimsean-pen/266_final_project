Can you feel it? [5x]
In the beginning there was Jack, and Jack had a groove
And from this groove came the grooves of all grooves
And while one day viciously throwing down on his box
Jack boldly declared: "Let there be House" and House music was born
I am you see, I am the creator and this is my house
And in my house there is only House music
But I am not so selfish because once you enter my house
It then becomes our house and our House music
And you see, no one man owns house
Because House music is a universal language
Spoken and understood by all
You see, House is a feeling that no one can understand, really
Unless youre deep into the vibe of House
House is an uncontrollable desire to jack your body
And as I told you before, this is our house and our House music
(Can you feel it?)
And every house, you understand there is a keeper
And in this house, the keeper is Jack

Now some of you might wonder: "who is Jack?"
"What is it that Jack does?"
Jack is the one who gives you the power to jack your body
Jack is the one who gives you the power to do the snake
Jack is the one who gives you the key to the [...]
Jack is the one who learns you how to rock your body
Jack is the one that can bring nations and nations of all Jackers together, under one house
You may be black, you may be white, you may be Jew or Gentile
It don't make a difference in our house
And this is fresh
Can you feel it? [2x]
Can you feel it?
-Can you feel it?
[3x]
(House, just turn me up [? x])
Let there be house [? x]
-Can you feel it? [2x]
