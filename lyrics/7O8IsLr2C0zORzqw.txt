They've got fire
Well I've got lightning bolts
They keep hunting
Trying to kill my hope

And everywhere I go
I see them in the corner of my eye
Shouting that it's over
Shouting that I'd stop the fight

Can somebody tell me
How to win a fight?
Can somebody tell me
Is the fear inside?

I wanna learn how to live
Without the consequences
I wanna learn how to live
Without the consequences

Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh-ooh

Shakin' fingers
Just gets harder now
Try to stay calm
Try to come back down

But everywhere I go
I see them in the corner of my eye
Shouting that it's over
Saying I should stop the fight

Will somebody tell me
How to win a fight
Can somebody tell me
Is the fear inside?

I wanna learn how to live
Without the consequences
I wanna learn how to live
Without the consequences

Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh-ooh

I wanna learn how to live (Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh)
Without the consequences (Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh)
I wanna learn how to live (Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh)
Without the consequences (Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh)

I can see them waiting
Outside the window
Tryna tell me how to live
Oh they won't go
I can see them waiting
Outside the window
Tryna tell me how to live

Oh they won't go
Oh they won't go
Oh they won't go
Oh they won't go

Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh-ooh

I wanna learn how to live
(Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh)
Without the consequences
(Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh)
I wanna learn how to live
(Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh)
Without the consequences
(Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh)
