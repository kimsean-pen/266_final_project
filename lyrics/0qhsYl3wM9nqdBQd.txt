Thought I lost you once again
All that drinking brought some trouble to our name
Late at night I feel no shame
All my old world stories
Take me back again

Now the lights out, I discover
She is sleeping, with another
Oh, tell me it's not over

What a place to seal your fate
A deserted carpark not even a date
Please don't tell me it's too late
If you love someone don't throw it all away

Now the lights out, I discover
Just a weekend undercover
Tell me it's not over

Tell me it's not over
Tell me it's not over

Now the lights out, I discover
Just a weekend undercover
Now the lights out, I discover
She is sleeping with another
Oh, tell me it's not over
