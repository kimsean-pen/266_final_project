Holiday in the hospital
No snow, just a long white coat
Choking rhythms on a stethoscope
This year I'm gonna die

I hear the elevator doorbell ring
Listen for the shuffle of familiar feet
Walking down the hallway
But I guess no one will come to say good night

Oh my lord, I wish that I didn't know
The world's not gonna end for anybody else

See the future in dry erase
Time blocks, corresponding names
The empty space beyond the window pane
Or a beep to stay alive

Oh my lord, I wish that I didn't know
They'll still make TV shows long after I go

Why does it take so long to say good night?
Why does it take so long to say good night?

When I cross over, what song will I hear?
Something lovely or a digital clipping in my ear?
And at that moment my final breath danced around my lungs
To the music in the background
"The Price is Right" theme song

Why does it take so long to say good night?
Why does it take so long to say good night?
Good night
Why does it take so long to say good night?
Why does it take so long to say good night?
Good night
