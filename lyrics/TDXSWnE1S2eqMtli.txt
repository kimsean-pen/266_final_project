I've been around this world yet I see no end
All shall fade to black, again and again
This storm that's broken me, my only friend, yeah

In this river all shall fade to black
In this river ain't no coming back
In this river all shall fade to black
Ain't no coming back

Withdrawn a step away just to find myself
The door is closed again, the only one left
This storm that's broken me, my only friend, yeah

In this river all shall fade to black
In this river ain't no coming back
In this river all shall fade to black

In this river all shall fade to black
In this river ain't no coming back
In this river all shall fade to black
Ain't no coming back

In this river all shall fade to black
In this river ain't no coming back
In this river all shall fade to black

In this river all shall fade to black
In this river ain't no coming back
In this river all shall fade to black
Ain't no coming back
