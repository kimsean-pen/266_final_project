Give me a heartbreak but not a heartache
Give me a reason take your time I'll wait

I'll stop hurting your heart when you stop hurting my heart

I'll stop hurting your heart when you stop hurting my heart

You cried, I lied we don't know why
Will we stop hurting our hearts

Give me a heartbreak but not a heartache
Give me a reason take your time I'll wait

I'll stop hurting your heart when you stop hurting my heart
I'll stop hurting your heart when you stop hurting my heart

You cried, I lied we don't know why
Will we stop hurting our hearts

(Hey!)
(Hey!)
