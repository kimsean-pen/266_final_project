Come find me, I'm hiding in the deepest night
Far away from the riddle of time
Come down here in twilight we can reunite
Sharing hopes of a wonderful life
You see me, you see me through your own disguise
Even blind still had you in sight
Dependent, addicted to your judging eyes
Cure my wounds and I'll stay by your side

So align with all the dreamers while we fight for our lives
It is hard to find a reason when you're heading for demise
We descend into deception and deny our given time
Still, we tremble when we're breathing

As we reach for the sun, we are burning our tongue
Drift in the sky with the clouds
At end of the line, on the edge of a knife
Diving into the divine
Icon shines, offering its soul to darkness
Falling down, heading for a life in torment

This time dear, this time I know we'll do it right
Dance evading the menacing scythe
Fall deeper and deeper in our precious lie
Death is us together at last
Walking away
From the home that we once shared
Still I know that we are
Undivided

Passing the days
All their words turned into blame
Who we are is denied
Uninvited

So align with all the dreamers while we fight for our lives
It is hard to find a reason when you're heading for demise

We descend into deception and deny our given time
Still we tremble when we're breathing

As we reach for the sun, we are burning our tongue
Drift in the sky with the clouds
At end of the line, on the edge of a knife
Diving into the divine
Icon shines, offering its soul to darkness
Falling down, heading for a life in torment
