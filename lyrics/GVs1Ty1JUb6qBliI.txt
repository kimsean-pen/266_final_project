She can be whatever you wanted to be
I'm saying Lord knows
She done showed your boy a whole lot things I did never seen
Sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll, you know she can't turn it down
So to any man that wants you
He can have you now

She like to party, have a good time, ain't nothing wrong
She control the vibe, playing all her favorite songs
But when she roll up, put something in her cup
Don't you be scared 'cause she don't give a fuck
'Cause her hair's hanging down
'Cause she know her body right
Plus what she's on
She could go all night
She's really what you want
Dog she's just your type
I'm just trying to change my life
Going once and going twice

I know you've seen a lot of girls but she's the one you want, yeah
She can sex you up, cook a mean, and pay the bills
All while she's on the phone
She may talk a lot of shit
But only inside she really ain't tough, no
I could help her pack her stuff
Hell I'll even rent the truck

She like to party, have a good time, ain't nothing wrong
She control the vibe, playing all her favorite songs
But when she roll up, put something in her cup
Don't you be scared 'cause she don't give a fuck
'Cause her hair's hanging down
'Cause she know her body right
Plus what she's on
She could go all night
She's really what you want
Dog she's just your type
I'm just trying to change my life
Going once and going twice (yeah, yeah)

Oh, could I
Found me a new one
She bad, she's so bad
She bad, she's so bad
Treats me better
Treats me better
So much better
Treats me better
So much better than you
I found me a good one
She bad, she's so bad
She bad, she's so bad
Treats me better
Treats me better
So much better
Treats me better than you

She like to party, have a good time, ain't nothing wrong
She control the vibe, playing all her favorite songs
But when she roll up, put something in her cup
Don't you be scared 'cause she don't give a fuck

'Cause she know her body right
Plus what she's on
She could go all night
She's really what you want
Dog she's just your type
Don't you be scared 'cause she don't give a fuck
