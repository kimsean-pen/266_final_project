Someone, someone is trying
To tell him something,
Will he listen?
(Should he listen?)
Someone, someone is dying
To find out something,
Will he reason?
(What is the reason?)

Do you see it,
There on the door?
Death is coming,
Life nevermore
Obsession drives me,
Clouding my mind
What's the message,
Am I running out of time?

Someone, someone is trying
In search of something,
Death by numbers
(Getting closer)
Someone,
Someone is dying
To know the answer,
The key to heaven
(One thirty seven)

Do you see it,
There on the door?
Death is coming, life
Nevermore
Obsession drives me,
Clouding my mind
What's the message,
Am I running out of time?

(Take me to the other side)
(Show me what I cannot find)
(Never ending number line)
(Can he find a sign)

I can see it,
Here on the door
One three seven,
Forevermore
Between dimensions,
The boundary line
One three seven,
I am running out of time

(Take me to the other side)
(Show me what I cannot find)
(Never ending number line)
(Take me to the other side)
(Show me what I cannot find)
(Never ending number line)
(Take me to the other side)
(Show me what I cannot find)
(Never ending number line)
(Take me to the other...)
