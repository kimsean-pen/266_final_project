hey i just wanted you to know
i just wanted you to blow
some smoke
my way
blow some smoke
my way

hey i just wanted you to say
i just wanted you to pray
for me
you're saving me
believe in me
Today

please don't kill my vibe
you're breaking me
you know it's me

please don't let this die
cuz it's all a dream
you're waking me

please don't let this slide
you're wasting time
it's not my life

please go take your time
believe in it
you're breathing it,
