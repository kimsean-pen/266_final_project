Closed books is what some people's minds are like
Shut tight, new ideas, they just always get passed by
Prejudice, living in their thoughts and deeds
Ignoring all the other people's needs

You say a double standard's OK
I'm telling you that this is insane
What is it that you've got in your fist
Could it be another one of your lists

Noone else can do the job just right
Unless they're Anglo-Saxon white
Foolish, the minds that have this attitude
You can't judge everybody by that rule

You say a double standard's OK
I'm telling you that this is insane
What is it that you've got in your fist
Could it be another one of your lists

No place in this country for this
Everyone has to have an equal place
Nazis, they lost it 40 years ago
Rednecks just realize this a little slow

You say a double standard's OK
I'm telling you that this is insane
What is it that you've got in your fist
Could it be another one of your lists
