(Verse)
All through the night is only dead end
We run and hide and we just pretend.
We live the life, the lies of others
All through the night, the lies of others.

(Chorus)
Oh, you didn't think so, honey,
Oh, you didn't think so.
Oh, you didn't think so, honey,
Oh, you didn't think so.

(Verse)
We want a light but we don't wanna play
Why were reward for we can just stay.
We want the life, the lies of others,
All through the night, the lies of others.

(Chorus)
Are they gonna find us honey,
Are they gonna find us?
Are they gonna find us, honey,
Are they gonna find us?

Oh, you didn't think so, honey,
Oh, you didn't think so.
Oh, you didn't think so, honey,
Oh, you didn't think so.

(Bridge)
Oh, every time I look at you
I can't find a single reason
Why I don't believe in you,
There's so much to believe in.

(Chorus)
Oh, you didn't think so, honey,
Oh, you didn't think so.
Oh, you didn't think so, honey,
Oh, you didn't think so.
