Running just to feel the
Night in our head for a while
It's foolish, I know
Chasing the moon between the buildings
Wouldn't it be nice
To hold just once

Suddenly I'm free
Of every heavy thing
The pain, the hurt
The sorrow, it leaves me
We run, quicksilver in the moonlight

We don't need words to speak
Just the electricity
Of silence around us
My heart calls out to you
Like a song of the sea
Trapped inside a shell

Suddenly I'm free
Of every heavy thing
The pain, the hurt
The sorrow, it leaves me
We run, quicksilver in the moonlight

Years from now
Still see you shining in the night
Years from now
Still see you shining in the night
Years from now
Still see you shining in the night
Years from now

Watch as the sun rises
To change the magic in the air
From black to blue to gold
We walk beneath blossom
As the city inhales
And stars all over again

Once we were free
Of every heavy thing
The pain, the hurt
The sorrow, it leaves me
We run, quicksilver in the moonlight
