This can't be all in my head
Trip down the steps take a dive
Into the concrete
Such giant thrones for, such tiny kings

Suffer Just to Believe
In a life on a string
Fixed blade cuts into me
I pour out from the opening

Your flame Your flood took hold and shook
Took everything from me and anyone I touched...
I'm tired of doing the right things the wrong way.
I'm going home and taking the long way
The long way...

Suffer just to believe
In a life on a string
Fixed blade cuts into me
I pour out from the opening

I'm finding it hard to please you...
I'm finding it harder to reach you...
I'M FINDING IT HARD TO PLEASE YOU...
You've given me nowhere to turn to.
I'm finding it hard to please you!
You've given me nowhere to turn to!

Suffer just to believe
In a life on a string
Suffer just to believe
Fixed blade cuts into me...
