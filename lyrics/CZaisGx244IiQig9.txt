Take me away to some other land, than'you
I gotta get away from that girl before I go crazy
She took my love away
She took it to another man
Now I gotta get away from that girl
Before I go crazy

Take me away to some other land
I gotta get away from that girl before I go crazy
She took my love away
She took it to another man
Now I gotta get away from that girl
Before I go crazy

Take me away to some other land, than'you
I gotta get away from that girl before I go crazy
She took my love away
She took it to another man
Now I gotta get away from that girl
Before I go crazy

Take me, take me away

Gotta get away
Crazy
She took my love away
Now I gotta get away, oh

Take me away to some other land
I gotta get away from that girl before she drives me crazy
She took my love away
She took it to another man
Now i gotta get away from that girl
before she drives me crazy
