Here I stand on the edge
Now I'm barely hanging on
Where did life go wrong
Life is pain
You better get used to it
Remember that it'll always be there

I'm alive
Thanks to you
Now I can breathe
I feel so free
I'm alive
thanks to you
Now I can see what's hurting me

I lived my darkest day
Goldest day this is my apology
I was dead inside until I met you

I'm alive
Thanks to you
Now I can breathe
I feel so free and alive

I hope you find what you're looking for
You know I'll be standing next you
All the way
Every day
Life is pain
you better get used to it
Remember that it'll always be there

I'm alive
Thanks to you
Now I can breathe
I feel so free
I'm alive
Thanks to you
Now I can see what's hurting me

I lived my darkest day
Goldest day this is my apology
I was dead inside until I met you

I'm alive
Thanks to you
Now I can breathe
I feel so free and alive

I'm alive
Thanks to you
Now I can breathe
I feel so free
I'm alive
Thanks to you
Now I can see what's hurting me

I lived my darkest day
Goldest day this is my apology
I was dead inside until I met you

I'm alive
Thanks to you
Now I can breathe
I feel so free and alive
