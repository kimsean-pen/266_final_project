I find it hard to say bye-bye
Even in the state of you and I
And how can I refuse?
Yeah you rid me of the blues
Ever since you came into my life

Because you're my medicine
(Yeah, you're medicine)
Yeah, you're medicine
(You're medicine)

I, I wanna marry you
Said I, I adore you
And that's all I have to say bye-bye
And you opiate this hazy head of mine

Because you're my medicine
(Yeah, you're medicine)
Yeah, you're medicine
(You're medicine)

Because you're my medicine
(Yeah, you're medicine)
Yeah, you're medicine
(You're medicine)
(You're medicine)
