Lido missed the boat that day, he left the shack
But that was all he missed, and he ain't comin' back
At a tombstone bar in a juke joint car, he made a stop
Just long enough to grab a handle off the top

Next stop, Chi-town, Lido put the money down, let it roll
He said, "One more job oughta get it
One last shot 'fore we quit it
One for the road"

Lido, whoa, oh-oh-oh
He's for the money, he's for the show
Lido's a-waitin' for the go
Lido, whoa, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
He said, "One more job oughta get it
One last shot 'fore we quit it
One more for the road"

Lido be runnin', havin' great big fun until he got the note
Saying, "Tow the line or blow it," and that was all she wrote
He be makin' like a beeline headin' for the border line, goin' for broke
Sayin', "One more hit oughta do it
This joint, ain't nothin' to it
One more for the road"

Lido, whoa, oh-oh-oh
He's for the money, he's for the show
Lido's a-waitin' for the go
Lido, whoa, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
"One more job oughta get it
One last shot, then we quit it
One more for the road"

Lido, whoa, oh-oh-oh
He's for the money, he's for the show
Lido's a-waitin' for the go
Lido, whoa, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
"One more job oughta get it"
