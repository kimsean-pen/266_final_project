This is evolution
The monkey, the man, then the gun
If Christ was in Texas
The hammer the sickle the only Son
This is your creation
The atom of Eden was a bomb
If Jack was the Baptist
We'd drink wine from his head
This is evolution
The monkey, the man then the gun
This is evolution
The monkey, the man then the gun
I am a revolution
Pull my knuckles down if I could
I am a revelation
And I'm nailed to the Holy Wood
This is evolution
The monkey, the man then the gun
This is evolution
The monkey, the man then the gun
We are dead and tomorrow's canceled
Because of things we did yesterday
We are dead and tomorrow's canceled
Crucify us in our space, oh oh
In our space, in our space, in our space
In our space, in our space, space, space
This is evolution
The monkey, the man then the gun
This is evolution
The monkey, the man then the gun
This is evolution
The monkey, the man then the gun
This is evolution
The monkey, the man then the gun
This is evolution
This is evolution
This is evolution
The monkey, the man then the gun
This is evolution
The monkey, the man then the gun
This is evolution
The monkey, the man then the gun
This is evolution
