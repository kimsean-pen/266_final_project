Who are you to even think you can know the difference
Between good and evil?

You keep pushing me right to the edge
You are sanctified and I'm just a mess
And you blame me for, you blame me for everything you hate
And you wage your wars no matter what I give you'll always take
(God what have I done)

You can crucify, you can nail me to your cross (light me up, light me up)
You can find me guilty for everything you've lost (light me up, light me up)
Go ahead blame me for your sins
Go ahead and sacrifice me
Make me your martyr
I'll be your Joan of
I'll be your Joan of Arc
(Burn, burn, burn, burn)
(Burn, burn, burn, burn)

You want to satisfy your high command
You want to touch my face with your dirty hands
So you blame me for, you blame me for the madness you create
And I wage my war cause either way you'll burn me at the stake
(God what have I done)

You can crucify, you can nail me to your cross (light me up, light me up)
You can find me guilty for everything you've lost (light me up, light me up)
Go ahead blame me for your sins
Go ahead and sacrifice me
Make me your martyr
I'll be your Joan of
I'll be your Joan of Arc
(Burn, burn, burn, burn)
(Burn, burn, burn, burn)

Who are you to even think you can know the difference
Between good and evil?
Into the everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and his angels
What do you need, I'm here as his child

Go ahead burn me for your sins
Go ahead and sacrifice me
Go ahead burn me for your sins
Go ahead and sacrifice me
Sacrifice me
You can crucify, you can nail me to your cross (light me up, light me up)
You can find me guilty for everything you've lost (light me up, light me up)
Go ahead blame me for your sins
Go ahead and sacrifice me
Make me your martyr
I'll be your Joan of
I'll be your Joan of Arc
(Burn, burn, burn, burn)
(Burn, burn, burn, burn)
