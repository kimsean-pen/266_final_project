I am your love, I am the music
I am the sunset, I am the walk on the beach
I give you some sweet loving
I can't believe what's happening

I am the [?], I am the [?]
I am [?], I am your hand in mine
It feels as if I'm dreaming
One look from you and I know

Oh, Miami beach
[?] poetry
I never knew it could be magical
Like this
Oh, Miami beach
[?] of dreams
I never knew it could be magical
Like this

I have the moon, I have the midnight
I have the sweet breeze, I have you closing your eyes
Saying you wanna take it all in
I close mine too, I let my mind go easy as the wind

Oh, Miami beach
[?] poetry
I never knew it could be magical
Like this
Oh, Miami beach
[?] of dreams
I never knew it could be magical
Like this

Oh, the world is so beautiful
That it hurts my eyes
Happiness is a strange thing
It makes you wanna cry
It makes you cry

I never knew you could be magical
Like this
Oh, Miami beach
[?] poetry
I never knew it could be magical
