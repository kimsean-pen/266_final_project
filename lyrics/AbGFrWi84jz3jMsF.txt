Faded
Stumblin' through these ladies
None of 'em even phase me, hey
Drinkin'
Sippin' that liquid courage
Trying to get Mrs. Perfect, hey
You don't have to say a damn word
Your body says it all

Girl, I've wanted you from the jump
We can kick it off with some conversation
Your place will be fine for the night
Lookin' for that late night invitation
'Cause I just want to be where you are
Just a little punch drunk recreation (punch drunk recreation)

Don't mess with it, just move with it
Don't mess with it, just move with it
Don't mess with it, just move with it

Baby, better go call that taxi
'Cause we gonna work in that back seat, hey
Take it, I know just how you want it
Run it back in the morning, hey
You don't have to say a damn word
Your body says it all

Don't mess with it, just move with it

Lookin' into your eyes, the party's begun (ahh, ahhh)
Got the invitation to be your plus one (ahh, ahhh)
