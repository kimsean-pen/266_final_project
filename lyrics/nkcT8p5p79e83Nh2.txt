I see his eyes moving away from me
Oh no, is this another end in trust?
He knows he holds them in over me
But what a gate is worth the cost?
We share the cold and grace of cousins
I wonder if I've seen him somewhere else before
And as I wonder at his answers be
How messy in leaving out the door
I hid the tale, you have no story
How else my way is a requisition of faith
I hear his lips behind this glory
But all that I hear is me afraid
So from the fog of every morning
Until the heat of day is here
I watch the clock 'cause it comes backwards
I see the water run up you
I hid the trail, you have no story
How else my way is a requisition of faith
I hear his lips behind this glory
But all that I hear is me afraid
I hid the trail, you have no story
How else my way is a requisition of faith
I hear his lips behind this glory
But all that I hear is me afraid
