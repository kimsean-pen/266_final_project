in the middle of a moment
in the dark of a dream
with the focus of a fool
man, you can tell me anything

there's a reason for deceit
and the chaos that I covet
try to find my self
before I start to loathe it

no I can't just let you run
I never knew such sorrow as the setting sun
now I take my last breath
of my lonesome only friend

oh give me what I please
the desire to be free
just to stop all the pain and the shivering

no I can't seem to let it go
the truth it leaks like a lie
I know you tried to save me baby
but you ran out of time

no, I can't see myself astray
I feel the emptiness at the first light of day
and now I take my last breath
oh my lonesome only friend

I try to run but I can only crawl
every time I stand I slip and surely fall
oh now I take my last breath
of my lonesome only friend
