Don't shed your tears
Just meet me in a house love
You know when you're there because the colors just soak you up
Once I was lost but in this house I can be found
Feel like the sun, we're rising and we won't come down

Into to the light
Into forever
Like the planet and stars
Into to the light
Into go forever
Let's go together
Like the planet and stars

It's cold in the street
But we can build a house of love
We'll hold up the walls, with lovers and their yearning hearts
Once I was lost but in this house I can be found
Feel like the sun, we're rising and we won't come down

Into to the light
Into forever
Like the planet and stars
Into to the light
Into go forever
Let's go together
Like the planet and stars

Into the night
Into the night
Into the sunrise
Into my eyes
Into the sunrise
And best of luck

I'm blowing up now
We built this house together
Can't stop into walls
We're gonna live together
Together Into to the light
Into forever
Like the planet and stars
Into to the light
Into go forever
Let's go together
Like the planet and stars
