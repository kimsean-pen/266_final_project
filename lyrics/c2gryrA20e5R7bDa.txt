Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I travelled the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I travelled the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Oooh, ha, ha, ha
Oh, ho, ho

Hold your head up
Keep your head up
Movin' on
Hold your head up
Movin' on
Keep your head up
Movin' on
Hold your head up
Movin' on
Keep your head up
Movin' on
Hold your head up
Movin' on
Keep your head up

Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

Oooh, ha, ha, ha
Oh, ho, ho
