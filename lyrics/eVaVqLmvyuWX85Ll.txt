Everybody wants her, Miss Sexy in the city
She's on the prowl, she rock this town
Who's that girl? A fly ferocious lady
Get up and dance, get up, get up and

"Sashay! Shantay! Panther on the runway"
Do it, do it, oh-oh
All the girls say

"Sashay! Shantay! Panther on the runway"
Do it, do it, oh-oh
All the boys say, "Welcome to the jungle"

She's so wild, so animal
She's gonna work that sexy body, so sexual
She's like a female phenomenon, she's a glamazon
A female phenomenon, a glama-z-a-a-on

She's so wild, so animal
She's gonna work that sexy body, so sexual
She's like a female phenomenon, she's a glamazon
A female phenomenon, a glama-z-a-a-on

Nobody do it like her, she taking names and kicking-
Ask, you shall receive, what do you need?
It's all right, it's all about the body
Tonight's the night, get up, get up and

"Sashay! Shantay! Panther on the runway"
Do it, do it, oh-oh
All the girls say

"Sashay! Shantay! Panther on the runway"
Do it, do it, oh-oh
All the boys say, "Welcome to the jungle"

She's so wild, so animal
She's gonna work that sexy body, so sexual
She's like a female phenomenon, she's a glamazon
A female phenomenon, a glama-z-a-a-on

She's so wild, so animal
She's gonna work that sexy body, so sexual
She's like a female phenomenon, she's a glamazon
A female phenomenon, a glama-z-a-a-on

Ladyboys and girls
And those who dream to rule the world
Smokey eyes, cherry lips
Stilettos on, now break it down

Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, she's a glamazon
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, she's a glamazon (Get up and)
