I found a way to be everything I dreamed of
And I don't know what's in me that I will become who I wanna be
And I finally found it
And I'm taking the long way out
'Cause it's gonna be
Somethin' special to me
Somethin' special to me
Yeah, Yeah

Days go by (Days go by)
And I'll grow stronger (I'll still try)
It takes time but I'll never let go (Never let go)
Days go by (Days go by)
And I'll try harder (I'll still try)
To make it mine (Because I know)
It's somethin' special to me
Somethin' special to me
Somethin' special to me
Yeah

I found so many things I dreamed of (dreamed of x3)
And I don't know what's in me that I will become who I wanna be
And I finally found it
And I'm taking the long way out
And it's gonna be
Somethin' special to me
Somethin' special to me

Days go by (Days go by)
And I'll grow stronger (I'll still try)
It takes time but I'll never let go (Never let go)
Days go by (Days go by)
And I'll try harder (I'll still try)
To make it mine (Because I know)
It's somethin' special to me

More than I hoped for
More than I dreamed of
This is how it should be

Days go by
And I'll grow stronger

Days go by (Days go by)
And I'll try harder (I'll still try)
To make it mine (Never let go)
I'ts somethin' special to me
Somethin' special to me (Days go by)
It's somethin' special to me (I'll still try)
Somethin' special to me (Never let go)

Days go by (Days go by)
