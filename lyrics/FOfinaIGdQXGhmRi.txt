Do you recall the first one
turning to smoke and six was nine
We loved it then and we love it now
But you are walking on that thin line

This time it's all up to you
We all know you're on the fast track
You took the wrong step years ago
into a deadly parasite

You're so awake, that you can't see
Still trying to believe that you are free
Killing yourself and the ones you love
Only one thing left for you to do

When you stumbled and fell
We were there and had your back
Everyone knows, and you know it as well
Got to get off that thin line

This time it's all up to you
We all know you're on the fast track
You took the wrong step years ago
into a deadly parasite

You're so awake, that you can't see
Still trying to believe that you are free
Killing yourself and the ones you love
Only one thing left for you to do

When I feel good, I'm moving slow
You ought to try to change the pace
I know your flame needs air to burn
So you just come and take a breath
Unless your life will end

I like to let my hair fly
But I don't let it eat my mind
Don't let this feeling blind your eyes
Slow down and start feeling fine
If you don't quit you'll surely die
Get off the thin line

Got not excuses left to use
Feel like running away from yourself
So beat, so tired of having to lose
Only thing is to get off the thin line

This time it's all up to you
We all know you're on the fast track
You took the wrong step years ago
into a deadly parasite

You're so awake, that you can't see
Still trying to believe that you are free
Killing yourself and the ones you love
Only one thing left for you to do
