Climb the wall to make the sun rise in time
But the night had already begun
Climb the wall to make the sun rise in time
But the night had already begun
Now here I am, I am the one

So hang high soft star
Don't shine, before swine

Not a lot of room to move, but where's my guide
I tried looking up to you girls
Please correct me, but didn't you let the work slide
Capitalize on a novelty, cheap pink, spotlight.
Is it all right?

Choose the highest bidder was my answer
When they told me I was up for sale
Schoolyard, Junior high style
Bullies have always tried to buy the better girls
But failed now, the cheque is in the mail.

Bubblegum bought Martini
Is nothing like d√©panneur red wine
Travel through time
Who were you after you were mine
Choose the highest bidder was my answer

When they told me I was up for sale
Schoolyard, junior high style
Bullies have always tried to buy the better girls
Haven't they?
Choose the brightest future

Mind the death
And try to buy the better girls
But failed 'till now
Cheque is in the mail
So hang high

Soft rock star
Hang high
Soft rock star
Don't shine before swine

Choose the highest bidder was my answer
When they told me I was up for sale
Schoolyard, junior high style
Bullies have always tried to buy the better girls, haven't they?
