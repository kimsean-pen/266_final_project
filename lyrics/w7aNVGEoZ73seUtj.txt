Loving you
All I wanna do
I keep your picture on the wall
In the den of my mind
Loving you
An easy thing to do
You just tell the girls and then you tell the analyst
You've made up your mind
Ah, make up your mind
Sing it baby one more time

To wake up with you
That's all I wanna do
Billie she was skipping all night
We didn't even notice her
To fall asleep with you
Drift and dream with you
Where could heaven even really be if not here in this temple?

I'm just following through
With what the spirit led me to do
A match that's made beyond the barricades of the space and the time

Oh, complex you
I know just what I will do
I'll simply write another verse of you, a melody to keep you inside
So deep inside
Sing it baby, one more time

Mostly talent, mostly mystic
The rest it is magic
You're protecting your instincts
So small, they're so fragile
Ah, you're tapped in
Babe, you know you're more than a gift

Loving you
Oh, complex you
Oh, complex you
Oh, complex you
