I've waited and given the chance again
I'd do it all the same but either way
I'm always out played up on your down days
I left in the right way to start again

Now watch me rise up and leave
all the ashes you made out of me
when you said that we were wrong, life goes on
just look at how long I've agreed
Now watch me rise up and leave
all the ashes you made out of me
when you said that we were wrong, life goes on
just look at how long I've agreed

Out of place like a gem on a coal face
lost on the right way, it's all the same
Cause I've had my hopes raised, right in the wrong ways
scared when you felt safe to start again

Now watch me rise up and leave
all the ashes you made out of me
when you said that we were wrong, life goes on
just look at how long I've agreed
Now watch me rise up and leave
all the ashes you made out of me
when you said that we were wrong, life goes on
You blew me away
Away
Away
Away...

Now watch me rise up and leave
all the ashes you made out of me
when you said that we were wrong, life goes on
just look at how long I've agreed
Now watch me rise up and leave
all the ashes you made out of me
when you said that we were wrong, life goes on
You blew me away
Away
Away
Away...

I sink like a stone, I lost my control
I sink like a stone, I lost my control
I sink like a stone, I lost my control
