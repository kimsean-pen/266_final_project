I love you though you're different than me
You don't look like me
You don't talk like me
You don't
I love you though you're foreign to me
And unknown to me
And there is no, no, no assuming
I love you 'cause you wanted to be
More of you and nobody
Can ever, ever try to be
A copy, a copy, a copy, a copy
A copy, a copy, a copy, a copy
A copy, a copy, a copy, a copy
A copy, a copy, a copy, a copy
A copy, a copy, a copy, a copy

Let them (Let them)
Take us (Take us)
To the supernova (Super, super)
Let them (Let them)
Take us (Take us)
To the supernova (Ooh, a super-, supernova)

And if I'm gonna say to you
Can I say it to me too?
Dyin' and dyin'
Now we are imagining
You bein' you and me bein' me
No, no, no diffusing
An echo keeps repeating to me
More of you and nobody
Can ever, ever try to be
A copy, a copy, a copy, a copy
A copy, a copy, a copy, a copy
A copy, a copy, a copy, a copy

Now we are imagining

Let them (Let them)
Take us (Take us)
To the supernova (Super, super)
Let them (Let them)
Take us (Take us)
To the supernova (Ooh, a super-, supernova)
Let them (Let them)
Take us (Take us)
To the supernova (Super, super)
Let them (Let them)
Take us (Take us)
To the supernova (Ooh, a super-, supernova)

Ooh, a super-, supernova
Ooh, a super-, supernova

We make a supernova
Make
Super, super
Oh, yeah
Make a supernova
Ooh, a super- supernova
We make a supernova
Oh yeah
Super, super
Oh yeah
We make a supernova
Ooh, a super-, supernova
Ooh, a super, super
Ooh, a super, super
Super, super
Super, super
