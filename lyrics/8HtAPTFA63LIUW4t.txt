I don't feel like going out much
It's way better in my head
I don't feel like shouting out loud
It's way better in my head

Wherever I go I feel like I am lost
And after all
Everything that you say fades

I never find the right words
I want to smile and I fall
I never find the right words
I close my eyes, cover my ears
Why don't we change the rules?

I don't feel like going home
It's way better in my head
You have it easy
You fill a space, don't you?

I don't know why
Everything that you say fades
Fades

I never find the right words
I want to smile and I fall
I never find the right words
I close my eyes, cover my ears
Why don't we change the rules?

Can you hear that one song
Blasting through my headphones?
Do you remember the words?
It says that we can be us
Just for one second
You know that moment
When you feel
You're breathing loud?

right words
I want to smile and I fall
I never find the right words
I close my eyes, cover my ears
Why don't we change the rules?

Right words
I want to smile and I fall
I never find the right words
I close my eyes, cover my ears
Why don't we change the rules?

Right words
I want to smile and I fall
I never find the right words
I close my eyes, cover my ears
Why don't we change the rules?
