Through endless Asia, through the fields of Cathay
Or enslaved in a pebble-dash grave with a kid on the way
If you're far over Africa on the wings of youth
Or if you're down in some satellite town and there's nothing you can do

Just give me, give me, give me the power
I wanna make them believe
Give me, give me, give me the power
Although I'm just the common breed

You might live in a screen kiss
It's a glamorous [Incomprehensible]
Or belong to a world that's gone
It's the English disease

But give me, give me the power
I wanna make them believe
Give, give me, give me the power
Although I'm just the common breed

Give me, give me, give me the power
I gonna make them believe
Give me, give me, give me the power
And I'll make them believe
