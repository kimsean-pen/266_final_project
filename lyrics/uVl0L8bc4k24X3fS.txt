In a battle
You only brought your shield
I picked the nearest blade I found
To meet you in the field
I'm sure that I told my fair share of lies
If not I bend the truth
But good fortune never was shinning on me
The way it shone on you
Shock me
I needed a surprise
Shock me
I needed a surprise

In a dream
A great calamity
To stone my heart and firm resolve
And render nerves to steel
The polestar wheeled above my head
Until such time it grew
A deep well of despair I found
The day my dreams came true

Shock me
I needed a surprise
Shock me
I needed a surprise
Shock Me!

Shock Me
I needed a surprise
Shock Me
I needed a surprise
Shock Me!
