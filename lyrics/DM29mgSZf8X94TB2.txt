I am starting to realize
that I can do nothing on my own
Everything that I start to build crumbles
into nothing!
It's safe to say, then, no matter what
I try I fall so short
This unrelenting pride
continues to widen the space
between you and I
Is there any point in trying to change?
No matter what I do
it always stays the same.

But I feel like this has been made for me
Is there something more that I can't say?
All I want is to let go
I try so hard; this pride still grows
Just for once to breathe in deep
And catch a glimpse of what you see in me
So many years of sorrow and grief
The bitterness I tasted in the face of defeat

How can I forget the joy of the mountain tops
down in the valleys?!
Is there any point in trying to change?
No matter what I do it always stays the same.
But I feel like this has been made for me.
Is there something more that I can't say?
But your ways are different they call out to me
no matter what I do you always stay the same

And I will have the choice to say
there is more to this life I am living

There is more
There is more
And even amidst the struggle
of finding the man
you've called me to be
Your love reminds me

that though I am broken I am still standing
I am still screaming!
Is there any point in trying to change?
No matter what I do
it always stay the same.
And I will have the choice to say
there is more to this life I am living
there is more to this life I am living
there is more to this life I am living
