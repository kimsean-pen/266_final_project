Read your eyes
Taste my skin
Open wide
Let me breath you in

You stare as a secret star
Touches all of my sins
All alone I'd never know where to begin

But you and I
Left your scars on me now
But you and...
Left your scars on me now
On me now
On me now
On me now

Feed the lies
Heal within
Hold it tight
Through the changing winds

We saw lovers through the night
Share a mark in the shape of wings
And all alone you'd never know where to begin

But you and I
Left your scars on me now
But you and...
Left your scars on me now
On me now
On me now
On me now

On me now
On me now
