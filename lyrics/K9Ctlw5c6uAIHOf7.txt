Not in time
Never stay around
If you stop me, then
We ll be on our own
We ll be on our own

This time try
Try it hard to make it better
If you stop me, then
We ll be on our own
We ll be on our own
Always on the run

Always on the run
Always on the run
Always on the run
Always on the run

So many words can entertain us
You may be fucked but u understand us
Get you getting down and down
We ll be on our own
We ll be on our own

This time try
Try it hard to make it better
If you stop me, then
We ll be on our own
We ll be on our own
Always on the run

Always on the run
Always on the run
Always on the run
Always on the run

You deal right
You gave out promises, promises
(it's not itself the same,
the things change,
I'm never, never the same
the things change)
We lost in time
I've never been a crime
If you stop me, then
We ll be on our own
We ll be on our own
Always on the run

Always on the run
Always on the run
Always on the run
Always on the run

The things change
It's not the same tho
The things change
It's not the same tho
