Oh, where've been with that fist so full of cracks?
As we transcend, but we're making plans and we're on our own tonight
Blame it on the Argonauts and the still of the fallen nights
Don't you wish that we were back again?

Lay down your swoon, there's a scratch upon my back
Yeah, these are growing days that hustle for the chance to get it right
Out on my perch now, where voices crackle all around
Spitting sentences for hours and hours

You ought to kick and scream
For every fallen dream, there's a hard knock on the door
Like stones, yeah we'll never move to shore

Wake from your sleep in a town that slaps right back
Do you hear the feet-trampling coming around the bend?
I think we'll make it out, I think I hear the latest sound
Now we're falling on our knees tonight

You ought to kick and scream
For every fallen dream, there's a hard knock on the door
Like stones, yeah we'll never move to shore

Blame it on the Argonauts and the still of the fallen nights
Don't you wish that we were back again?
Blame it on the Argonauts and the still of the fallen nights
Don't you wish that we were back again?

You ought to kick and scream
For every fallen dream, there's a hard knock on the door
Like stones, yeah we'll never move to shore
