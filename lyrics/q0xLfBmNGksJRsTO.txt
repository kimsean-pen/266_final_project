If you wanna call me out, I'll over roll
Cause when I ever show you half, you raise me all

For you could be a star by now
And I could be free somehow

Release your mind
Neutralise

From the eyes of jealousy, jealousy, jealousy
Oh who you gonna slave for?

I'm dying of jealousy
I'm dying of jealousy
You got me dying
You got me dying
You got me dying

For you could be a star by now
And I could be free somehow

Release your mind
Neutralise

From the eyes of jealousy, jealousy, jealousy
Oh who you gonna slave for?

I'm dying of jealousy
I'm dying of jealousy
You got me dying
You got me dying
You got me dying

Bring you down to size
The high off your rise
Bring you down to me
Where I can see
The motives up ahead
For your innocence is mine
And you could be a star by now
And I could be free somehow
You gonna slave for me
Oh are you gonna slave for me?
In the eyes you'll fall
They're the strongest eyes of all
They're the strongest eyes
They're the strongest eyes

You got me dying
You got me dying

If you wanna call me out, I'll over roll
Cause when I ever show you half, you raise me all

You got me dying
You got me dying
