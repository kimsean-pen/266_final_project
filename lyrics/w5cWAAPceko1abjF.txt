We are each other's hemispheres

I am fine tuning my soul
To the universal wavelength
No-one is a lover alone
I propose an atom dance
Our hearts are coral reefs in low tide
Love is the ocean we crave
Restlessly turning around and around
I am dancing towards transformation
Learning by love to open it all
Let this ugly wound relief
We fear unconditional heart space
Healed by atom dance

When you feel the flow as primal love
Enter the pain and dance with me!
We are each other's hemispheres

We aim at peeling off dead layers of loveless love
No-one is a lover alone
Most hearts fear their own home
Come in themselves fully
It scares them all

When you feel the flow as primal love
Enter the pain and dance with me!

No-one is a lover alone, no-one
Most hearts fear their own home

You are my same hemisphere, hemisphere
The atoms are dancing, dancing
Atoms are laughing at last
At last
