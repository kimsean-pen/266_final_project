And that's the way the night rain flows
It's known to feel no shame
It comes through all open windows
But when their closed we know the rain will still remain the same
Pouring off what's left of me
Driving me so recklessly into my own Cobain
But then the lion ran away and left his lioness
There's no one left to bring the prey
I guess I pushed away the only one who really cared
Take the pain that's always there
Roam around, be nowhere, but in my own Cobain

I can't believe it's over
I can't believe I'm broken
Would someone tell me that it's all just dreamin'
I need myself a brand new meanin'

And that's the way that life moves on, it's so mysterious
Wish I could have a crystal ball
But you know life it's just so bitter sweet
You know the taste loving you is not erased

Emotions are all yours to take
That's the way it's played
Broken hearts and broken dreams
In my mind I cannot scream
Never seems the way it seems
But you know me and I will always be the way
You want me to but not today
It's never true, take some time to breathe, in my own Cobain

I can't believe it's over
I can't believe I'm broken
Would someone tell me that it's all just dreamin'
I need myself a brand new meanin'

I can't believe it's over
I can't believe I'm broken
Would someone tell me that it's all just dreamin'
I need myself a brand new meanin'

Ya! Oh oh, Oh oh, Oh oh
Ya! Oh oh, Oh oh, Oh oh
Ya! Oh oh, Oh oh, Oh oh!
Ya! Oh oh, Oh oh

You're amazing, so amazing
I been spendin' most of my time pretendin'
Maybe, you would save me
You're amazing, so amazing
