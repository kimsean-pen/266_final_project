Once I loved
And I gave so much love to this love
You were the world to me

Once I cried at the thought
I was foolish and proud
And let you say goodbye

Then one day
From my infinite sadness you came
And brought me love again

Now I know, that no matter, whatever befalls
I'll never let you go
I will hold you close
Make you stay

Because love is the saddest thing
When it goes away

I will hold you close
Make you stay
Because love is the saddest thing
When it goes away

Because love is the saddest thing
When it goes away
Goes away
