Sorries pour out of you
All wide-eyed simple smiles
Certain to see you through
Like a QC full of fake humility

You say, "Oh, please forgive"
You say, "Oh, live and let live"
But sorry doesn't help us
And sorry will not save us
And sorry will not bring my teen years
Back to me any time soon

Forced back, it springs right out
Seasoned, you have no doubts
You lied about the lies that you told
Which is the full extent of what being you is all about

You say, "Oh, please forgive"
You say, "Oh, live and let live"
But sorry doesn't help us
Oh, sorry will not save us
Oh, sorry will not bring my love
Into my arms as far as I know

Oh, sorry doesn't help us
Oh, sorry will not save us
Oh, sorry is just a word
You find so easy to say
So you say it anyway

Oh, sorry doesn't help us
Oh, sorry won't protect us
Oh, sorry won't undo
All the good gone wrong, my love
