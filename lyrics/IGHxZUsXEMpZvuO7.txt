Slag pit
Stag shit
Honey bring it close to my lips, yes
Don't blow those brains yet
We gotta be big, boy
We gotta be big

Starfucker, just like my daddy, yes
Starfucker, just like my daddy, yes
Selling his baby, yes
Just like my daddy, yes

Gonna strike a deal
Make him feel like a congressman
Running in the family, oh
It's run in the family

Rest your shoulders, peaches and cream
Everywhere a Judas as far as you can see
Beautiful angel calling
We got every re-run of Muhammad Ali

Prism perfect
Honey bring it close to your lips, yes
What is termed a landslide
Of principle proportion boy
It's gotta be big
I said it better be big, hey, hey

Starfucker, just like my daddy, yes
Starfucker, just like my daddy, yes
Selling his baby, yes
Just like your daddy, yes
Selling his baby

Gonna strike a deal
Make him feel like a congressman
It's running in the family, oh
It's run in the family, hey
It's running in the family, hey baby
It's run in the family, hey yeah

Mother Mary, China white
Brown may be sweeter, may be sweeter
Mother Mary, China white
Brown may be sweeter, she will supply
She will supply
She will supply
She will, supply
Supply, supply
Gimme peace, love, peace, love
Gimme peace, love and a hard cock
