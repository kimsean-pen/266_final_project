You should never leave me home alone
You should never leave me home alone
Heaven knows where I might wanna go
When you ask if you could be my man
I say thank you, honey, come again
That? s why you like it

Strange boy, innocent

Strange boy, innocent
You? re here, magnificent, magnificent

Should have told you 'bout the way I choose
Should have told you 'bout the way I choose
Everything that we are gonna do
Everything that we are going through
Just how you like it

Strange boy, innocent
You? re here, magnificent

Oh baby, don't you realize?
Oh baby, don't you realize?
Oh no, no, no
You? re waiting for the world to pass you by
Living in a state of compromise
You? re waiting for the world to pass you by
No, no, no, no

Strange boy, innocent
