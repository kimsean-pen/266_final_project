Since I met you
this small town hasn't got room
for my big feelings,

violently happy
'cause I love you,
violently happy
but you're not here

violently happy
come calm me down
before i get into trouble

I tip-toe down to the shore,
stand by the ocean-
make it roar at me
and I roar back,

violently happy
'cause I love you,
violently happy
but you're not here

violently happy
overemotional
violently happy
I'll get into trouble
real soon
if you don't get here
baby!

violently happy
'cause I love you
violently happy
I'm aiming too high
violently happy
it will get me into trouble
violently happy
i'm driving my car
too fast
with ecstatic music on

violently happy
I'm getting too drunk
violently happy
I'm daring people
to jump off roofs with me

only you
can clam me down
I'm aiming too high

Soothe me...
