In this perfect shadow
Red light fills my eyes
Words that only we know
In the darkness lies

Oh and do you wonder what could have been?
In the moments that came between
Is this love or is this just a fool's paradise?
Here tonight

Too close to know
To let go, to hold
For now let's stay
In gold

Too close to know
To let go, to hold
For now let's stay
In gold

I don't want a reason
To wish this love goodbye
As you slowly leave me
One kiss at a time

Oh and do you wonder what could have been?
In the moments that came between
Is this love or is this just a fool's paradise?
Here tonight
Too close to know
To let go, to hold
For now let's stay
In gold

Too close to know
To let go, to hold
For now let's stay
In gold

Too close to know
To let go, to hold
For now let's stay
In gold

Too close to know
To let go, to hold
For now let's stay
In gold
