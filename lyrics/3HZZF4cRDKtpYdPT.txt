Seasons know so well
That we're holding on to past and
Present selves.
Remembering our youth
All the things we swore and said
We'd never do.
Ohhhhh ohhh oh ohhh
Ohhhhh ohhh oh ohhh
You were all I knew
In the oceans of a crowd you'd
Shine bring blue.
And years like time fell through
And despite myself I fell in love
With you.
Ohhhhh ohhh oh ohhh
Ohhhhh ohhh oh ohhh
It's the one thing that I swore I'd
Never do
It's the one thing that I swore I'd
Never do
And despite myself I'm still in love
With you.
