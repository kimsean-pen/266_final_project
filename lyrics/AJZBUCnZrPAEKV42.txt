There's only one place that I wanna be
Home with you girl so I can hear you breathe
With your hair up like you do
And that face that you give me, when you've missed me

And I've missed our go so guide them my child
Smoked a lot and I feel so rough
Guess this is just what I wanna do
Keeping half smoked smokes in the tin
To half fill room
'cos I was young and irresponsible
About a year ago and it's impossible to tell
If my hands will ever warm up
Don't believe in growing up but
Look at me now I'm engaged to be married
I'm only 23 and I've got my self a family
She's not mine and she never will be
And I'm reminded every day
She's not mine and it fucking kills me

She won't look at me that way

I was young and irresponsible
About a year ago and it's impossible to tell
If my hands will ever warm up
Don't believe in growing up.
