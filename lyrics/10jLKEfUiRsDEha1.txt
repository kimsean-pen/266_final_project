I write to stay awake, light dies quicker in the winter time
Wolves line the city streets, all that's left is a tired crime
I'll sleep away the cold, I'll wrap myself up like a twisted wire
Coiled like a rattlesnake, bites burn just like a bush fire
I'm in shock, I'm in shock
I'm in shock, I'm in shock
I'm a switchblade renegade, my heart's buried in the junkyard
Covered it in kerosene, burned it up in cold regard
I'm a switchblade renegade, I'm not stand up, I've got lies down
To the core, I'm a carnivore, I will never be earthbound
Dark bites away the sun, leaves behind its shy twin
Light's there for anyone, I have had my fill within
My thoughts break like falling glass, shatter when I try to let them out
Color cracks, I can't take it back, I wish I'd never opened my mouth
I'm in shock, I'm in shock
I'm in shock, I'm in shock

I'm a switchblade renegade, my heart's buried in the junkyard
Covered it in kerosene, burned it up in cold regard
I'm a switchblade renegade, I'm not stand up, I've got lies down
To the core, I'm a carnivore, I will never be earthbound
I will never be earthbound
I'm in shock, I'm in shock, I'm in shock, I'm in shock
I'm in shock, I'm in shock, I'm in shock
I'm a switchblade renegade, my heart's buried in the junkyard
Covered it in kerosene, burned it up in cold regard
I'm a switchblade renegade, I'm not stand up, I've got lies down
To the core, I'm a carnivore, I will never be earthbound
(I'm in shock) I will never be earthbound
(I'm in shock) I will never be earthbound
(I'm in shock) I will never be earthbound
