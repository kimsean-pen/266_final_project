I've been smoking on the peace pipe
I've been wondering just what would peace be like
I've been staring into headlights
Swallow me whole, finding my peace of mind
I'm just trying to seize the moment
Trying to love the little things, even if they're hard to love
A monument to love unspoken
Carved into stone "Unwilling to come undone"

It feels good to be running from the devil
Another breath and I'm up another level
It feels good to be up above the clouds
It feels good for the first time in a long time now

I remember back in Oakland
I was lying there in rapture on the bathroom floor
Moving hotel to hotel
Out on the road, no idea really what's in store
Light it up just like a flashlight
Let it shine, let it rise just like a foreign sun
Turn it over and it's capsized
It's finally done, the battle's lost yet I feel I've won

It feels good to be running from the devil
Another breath and I'm up another level
It feels good to be up above the clouds
It feels good for the first time in a long time now

It feels good for the first time in a long time now
It feels good to be me

I'm high, staring at the ceiling
Sending my love, what a wonderful feeling
What comes next, I see a light
I'm along for the ride as I'm taking flight

I'm high, staring at the ceiling
Sending my love, what a wonderful feeling
What comes next, I see a light
I'm along for the ride as I'm taking flight

It feels good to be running from the devil
Another breath and I'm up another level
It feels good to be up above the clouds
It feels good for the first time in a long time now

It feels good for the first time in a long time to be me
It feels good for the first time in a while I'm free

I'm high, staring at the ceiling
Sending my love, what a wonderful feeling
What comes next, I see a light
I'm along for the ride as I'm taking flight
