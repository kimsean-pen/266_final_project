I got designs
Every time
That you ever need me
You bloom white lies
Every time
That I ever need them

And I'll unlearn everything
Down on my knees
And I'll torch the covenant
For your belief
And for all the riches
I can't give you
I'll cut up the seas
Promise it to me
You'll never leave me

And the world will forget us
But we can leave this cruel world just outside that door
Girl-

You're on my mind
Every time
That I blink I dream of
You were in time
And when I die
Tell someone to thank you

And I'll unlearn everything
Down on my knees
I got futility
And you got your memes
For all the riches
I can't give you
I'll cut up the seas
Promise it to me
You'll never leave me
For all the riches
I can't give you
Cut up the seas
Promise it to me
You'll never leave me
NEVER LEAVE ME
