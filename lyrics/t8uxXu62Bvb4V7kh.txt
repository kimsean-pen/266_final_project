Do you know?
Do you care?

Are we just passing through moments wasted in time?
Can we be more to this than leave ashes behind?
Lightning strikes, the fires rage
Tear out the pages from the story of this life
The cloud of anger left behind
Let tell the future will we be buried deep or flying high
Or just the anger left behind
The light is fading now as stars fill the sky
Raise!

Throw your body to the wolves, lay screaming as you die
Tear flesh from bone and lose your mind

Tear out the pages from the story of this life
The cloud of anger left behind
Let tell the future will we be buried deep or flying high
Or just the anger left behind

Be more than anger left behind, left behind
Be more than anger left behind, left behind

Tear out the pages from the story of this life
The cloud of anger left behind
Let tell the future will we be buried deep or flying high
Or just the anger left behind
Or just the anger left behind
