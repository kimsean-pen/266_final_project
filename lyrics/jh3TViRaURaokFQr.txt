From the silence of a headless horror, learn!

When an answer comes in mind, more questions follow,
Knowledge burns like an everlasting flame.
The Promethean regime,
My authority supreme

From the silence of a deadly horror...
Burn...
My disciples wear a burning halo
Burn...

An epiphany experienced in ultra violet
As the seeker finds the truth he wants to find
Purifier of thoughts, in the clarity of forms

Learn

From the silence of a headless horror, learn
Burn
Feel the hunger of the dark explorer
Burn

From the silence of a deadly horror...
Burn...
My disciples wear a burning halo
Burn...

From the silence of a headless horror, learn!
