It's got some Looney Tunes biology
The planet of straw men
Their only purpose is to disagree
And do it publicly, amen
They're always going for the coup de grâce
They think they're gonna fuck a movie star
But all paths lead to nowhere
And it all adds up to nothing

It radiates more of a loneliness than it does a visible light
But it's a beacon to the cosmonaut
A weekend to the taikonaut, alright
And then Beijing sends her diplomats
And then the Kremlin sets their wiretaps
And they send a probe to mine the gold
On the planet of straw men

Don't hate the player, hate the game, right?
Don't hate the singer, hate the song
But don't go saying that to the straw men
Or to their rubble kings, King Kong
They want the glory of the coup de grâce
A mating ritual or a courtship dance
But all paths lead to nowhere
And it all adds up to nothing

You'll be picking Chinese cotton on the moon soon
On the planet of straw men
And you'll be buried in an egg and disinterred I've heard
And made to do it all again
Up on the surface, it's a charcoal roast
There's ruined temples in the undergrowth
And strange insects chirping
With all the rancor of a coliseum

They want the glory of a coup de grâce
They want the glory of a coup de grâce
They want the glory of a coup de grâce
On the planet of straw men

They want the glory of a coup de grâce
They want the glory of a coup de grâce
They want the glory of a coup de grâce
On the planet of straw men

They want the glory of a coup de grâce
They want the glory of a coup de grâce
They want the glory of a coup de grâce
On the planet of straw men

They want the glory of a coup de grâce
They want the glory of a coup de grâce
They want the glory of a coup de grâce
On the planet of straw men

They want the glory of a coup de grâce
They want the glory of a coup de grâce
They want the glory of a coup de grâce
