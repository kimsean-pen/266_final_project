There's truth beneath the floorboards
There's hope in brick and stone
But they tell me just to shut my mouth
Leave well enough alone

But I think maybe all that's needed
is a match and gasoline
Because I don't think that any one of them believes
That there will be a reckoning

But I will see this city burn

There are still good shepherds scattered
But they're far between and few
And the sheep's skin that the wolves all wear
Is so thin I see right through
And I think maybe all that's needed
Is some gas and open flame
Because I don't think that any one of them believes
That fire can erase their names

But I will see this city burn
I said I will see this city burn

We will burn it down and
Build it again what was buried in flame
Burn it down and
Build it again from the bricks that remain

I love this city, but I've set and numbered its days
I love this city, enough that I'll set it ablaze
I love this city, but I've set and numbered its days
I love this city, enough that I'll set it ablaze

There is truth beneath the floorboards
There is hope in brick and stone
But they tell me just to shut my mouth
Leave well enough alone

But I think that maybe all that's needed
Is some flint and hardened steel
Because I don't think that any one of them believes
The revolution's real

We will burn it down and
Build it again what was buried in flame
Burn it down and
Build it again from the bricks that remain

We will burn it down and
Build it again what was buried in flame
Burn it down and
Build it again from the bricks that remain

I love this city, but I've set and numbered its days
I love this city, enough that I'll set it ablaze
I love this city, but I've set and numbered its days
I love this city, enough that I'll set it ablaze

I love this city, but I've set and numbered its days
I love this city, enough that I'll set it ablaze
I love this city, but I've set and numbered its days
I love this city, enough that I'll set it ablaze

And it will burn
Watch the city burn
It will burn...
