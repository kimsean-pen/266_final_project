Yeah, you know what it is, it's Hot 97
My name is Peter Rosenberg, and, uh
We're gonna get to some new music right now
This is a record called "Desperado"
Okay, by my girl, Azealia Banks
Man, I've been waiting for Azealia Banks
Waiting for Azealia Banks
Waiting for Azealia Banks
(Desperado!)

Up's and Up, Seductive Pup
Flux - Did a dip, pack up then strut
Up's nigga, w-what's up nigga?
With that buck, can I get that rrr-rompin' uh?!
Mutt's in Tux, Deluxe and such
I be in the mirror looking Luxe N Plush
Luxe N Such, Seductive Strut
I be aquafizzy or that Passion Punch
Or the Fashions Munch, but the fabric's lush
You don't get the access, none!
Spun him on my axis - sun
Hit him with the hazard hun
Denim and a satin rump
Blend it with the carrot blush
Plus I got the cash and the bass have ya spazzin' some
Come get ya limps in bum!
Dinner with the Princess one, printed in expensive funds

Ayo! That's how I do my thing!
Desperado!
Ayo! That's how I do my thing!
Desperado!

I be pretty, prissy, plenty plush and stuff
You be piggy-pissy, penny-crushed and crunched!
Crust and dust! Slumped and jumped!
Queen scissor-cut suit, other's not trump
Giddy up this buck, titty tuck no such!
I be freaky frizzy in the front and uh
You be very sleazy lady-lump hip-strut!
Betty-bump this bun, parrrump-pun-dun

Ayo! That's how I do my thing!
Desperado!
Ayo! That's how I do my thing!
Desperado!
Ayo! That's how I do my thing!
Desperado!
Ayo! That's how I do my thing!
Desperado!
Ayo!
Desperado!
Ayo!
Desperado!

Desperado!
Desperado!
Ayo! That's how I do my thing!
Desperado!
Ayo! That's how I do my thing!
Desperado!
Ayo!

Hit 'em with the acid tongue
Denim and a python pump, bet he hunt this hun
Here the huntress come
Get amongst this one - if the freaky function fun
I could be the perfect one!
Splurging on the purchase, -yum!
Merging on the purpose - won!
When the verse is spun, I'm a Hertz this
Can't-can't rehearse this, none!

Desperado!
