Broad-shouldered beasts fill the sky
Manhattan beams at the night
But you are wrapped up in white
Curled up in fright

So I took you to the city for the night
To dance under dizzying silver light
And for a moment you were wild
With a? like a child
Just a moment

But wasn't it you who said I was not free?
And wasn't it you who said I needed peace?
And now it's you who's flawed by fear of it all and it's alright
Take it out on me
And it's alright
Take it out on me

These apartment walls are paper thin
And no one is trying to listen in
Want to hear our doubts, hear our whispers and shouts?
They don't care

Wasn't it you who said I was not free?
Wasn't it you who said I needed peace?
And now it's you who's flawed by fear of it all and it's alright
Take it out on me
And it's alright
Take it out on me

When you feel the world
Wrapping around your neck
Feel my hand wrapped in yours
And when you feel the world
Wrapping around your neck
Don't succumb

But it's alright
Take it out on me
And it's alright
Take it out on me

And it's alright
Take it out on me
