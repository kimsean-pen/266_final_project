Soak it in. Soak it in.
Tell me the one about the friend you knew
And the last good night that we toasted too
Soak it in. Stay for me

Stay for me
We drank wine in the matinee
And the spotlight showed what I chased away
Stay for me

She saw my comb over her hourglass body
She had problems with drinking milk and being school tardy
She'll loan you her toothbrush
She'll bartend your party

Kill me, kill me
Called and I called but I can't get through
He said he's on his own but his own is you
Kill me

She saw my comb over her hourglass body
She had problems with drinking milk and being school tardy
She'll loan you her toothbrush
She'll bartend your party
She saw my comb over her hourglass body
She had problems with drinking milk and being school tardy
She'll loan you her toothbrush
She'll bartend your party
