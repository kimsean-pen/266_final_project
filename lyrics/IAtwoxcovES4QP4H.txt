I hear the countdown it's ticking - the victim of my ambition on a mission to the stars
No way back I find myself on the edge of one gaping nothing - did I really order this?
Face the crowd, make us proud, it's up to you now, break a leg, we'll be right back
Ten nine eight seven six five four three two one and
All systems go, shield your soul, it's 4th and goal from the 21
In danger I know of losing it all, still it can be done
This could be my moment in time it's there for the taking - the question is can I make it last?
Face the crowd, make us proud, it's up to you now, break a leg, we'll be right back
Ten nine eight seven six five four three two one and
All systems go, shield your soul, it's 4th and goal from the 21
In danger I know of losing it all, still it can be done
Ten nine eight seven six five four three two one and
All systems go, shield your soul, it's 4th and goal from the 21
In danger I know of losing it all, still it can be done
All systems go, face the unknown, one last shot from the 21
I enter the zone cause deep down I know yes it can be done
You might receive what you want and still end up with nothing
