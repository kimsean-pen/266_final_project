Friends tell me I am crazy
That I'm wasting time with you
You'll never be mine
Oh, Ooh

People always talk about reputation
I don't care what you do to them
Just be good to me
Oh, Ooh

Friends tell me I am crazy
That I'm wasting time with you
You'll never be mine
Oh, Ooh

Friends are always telling me you're a user
I don't care what you do to them
Just be good to me
Oh, Ooh

I don't care what you do to them
Just be good to me
Oh, Ooh

Friends seem to always listen
To the bad things that you do
You never do them to me
You may have many others
But I know when you're with me
You are all mine
Oh, Ooh

People always talk about reputation
I don't care what you do to them
Just be good to me
Oh, Ooh
(Just be good to me)
(Just be good to me)
Oh, Ooh
