(Lena)Games we don't want to play
Same winner everyday
Kill for the second best
Feel no more, feel no less

We have our minutes cut
We lose our feelings but
That's what the movies show
This is where stories go

(yulia)Stars we don't want to reach
Scars we don't want to stitch
Go where we haven't been
Fly away, time machine

Cloud we will chase him out
Crowds, we will face them down
This is our secret place
Outer space, outer space

(both)Our home forever is outer space
Black stars and endless seas, outer space
New home, new destinies, outer space
Forever we'll be in
Outer space, outer space

(Lena)Ground we don't want to feel
Found what they didn't steal
Time, we were really lost
Bridges burnt, fingers crossed

We, shall we ever be free
With no guarantee
Life on another plane
Same before, same again

(yulia)Go where you want to go
So no one ever knows
Only what we decide
Is it gone
Has it died

Dry every tear in my eye
You can tell me why
This is our secret place
Outer space, outer space

(both)Our home forever is, outer space
Black stars and endless seas, outer space
New home, new destinies, outer space
Forever we'll be in
Outer Space, outer space

(Lena)Outer space is where we get together
And this place we're meant to be
Stars are dancing and the time is fading
Dead forever
You and me
You and me
(yulia) Racing stars and common moons are planets
In the cosmos, we are free
There's no atmosphere
And no obsessions
It'll always be
It'll always be
(both)Our home forever is, outer space
Black stars and endless seas, outer space
New home, new destinies, outer space
Forever we'll be in
Outer Space, outer space
Our home forever is, outer space
Black stars and endless seas, outer space
New home, new destinies, outer space
Forever we'll be in
Outer space, outer space
