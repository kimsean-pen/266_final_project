Evil had knockin' at my door
Evil making me its whore
I don't mind if you take whats yours
but give me mine

Evil, want you to know
I'm much to young to be old
I don't mind if you take what's yours
but give me mine

Hey there little girl
come inside I've got some sweet things
put your hair in curls
paint you up just like a drag queen

I don't mind decay
you are the night that saves my day

Hey there little girl
come inside don't be afraid I'll keep you safe

I'm evil knocking at your door
I'm evil making you my whore
I don't mind if you take what's yours
but give me mine

I am like decay
I rot the ground to guide your way oh
hey there little girl
come inside i've got some sweet things
put your hair in curls
paint you up just like a drag queen

How you like me now?
did i succeeded in making you proud?

Hey there little girl
come inside don't be afraid i'll keep you safe
