I roamed the night and winding shadows led me home
And as I ran into the depths,
there was no light to guide me on my path

And the night devoured my sreams
and preyed on my soul
I faded away

Oh now i fell and the demons laughed
as they were filled with bloodlust and spitefulness
Oh how I crawled through the dirt
and I could feel my life will being drained and dissolved

I was submerged into the endless gaping void
No air to breath, no heart that beats,
there was no life to carry me along

Then the flares, they turned into flames
and they carried my soul
through the endless pain, I ascend

then the flames turned into flesh
and the making me whole
As I ascend

I was submerged into the endless gaping void
No air to breath, no heart that beats,
there was no life to carry me no more

And the night devoured my screams
and preryed on my soul
I faded away

As the grat fires of the deepes tracts of hell
consumed all my weaknesses and traces of humanity
I arose withe a grandeur without equal,
with a darkness in my eyes and with a plgue
to wield the world

I rise as the flares are turning to flames
and they carry my soul
through the endless pain
I rise as the flames are turning into flesh
and they make me whole
As I ascend

Dominus Satans
I am the spear
Dominus Lucifer
I am the fire

May our black light blind the world
May the serpent eat the world
May our black flame burn the world
May our darkness never end
