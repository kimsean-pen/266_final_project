I wish there was a situation to be mad at
Or a person I could blame
I've got a loud mouth, I'm pale with a ghost obsession,
But behind the scenes with her I'm playing 21 Questions
There's gotta be a reason
You keep your guy in hiding
I'm becoming what I've hated
But your talk is so inviting

But then what?
You drop your guy and take me on,
It's everything I wanted,
But then what?
Would you get tired of my time?

My mood's dictated by our conversations,
And if you don't text I get too frustrated
I want you all to myself this time
Conflicted looks good on me
I'm trying desperately
I want you all to myself this time

I never have to
Carefully shape sentences
When I've got some words to say,
They're falling from my mouth from the time
That they hit my brain

'Cause we built a picture made for frames
We live in chemistry away from all the wasted time and taste

But then what?
You dropped your guy and took me on,
It's everything I wanted,
But then what?
Would you get tired of my time?

My mood's dictated by our conversations,
And if you don't text I get too frustrated
I want you all to myself this time
Conflicted looks good on me
I'm trying desperately
I want you all to myself this time

We built a picture made for frames
We live in chemistry away from all the wasted time and taste

And it sucks to sleep
'Cause you aren't talking to me
I wanna give you space
But the amount between us is wrecking me

But then what?
You dropped your guy and took me on,
It's everything I wanted,
But then what?
Would you get tired of my time?

'Cause then what?
You dropped your guy and took me on,
It's everything I wanted,
But then what?
Would you get tired of my time?

'Cause then what?
You dropped your guy and took me on,
It's everything I wanted,
But then what?
Am I in his position now?

'Cause then what?
You dropped your guy and took me on,
It's everything I wanted,
But then what?
Would you get tired of my time?

My mood's dictated by our conversations,
And if you don't text I get too frustrated
I want you all to myself this time
Conflicted looks good on me
I'm trying desperately
I want you all to myself this time

I'll forget you if you need me to,
Like nothing ever happened
My sun still sets without you,
Like nothing ever happened
