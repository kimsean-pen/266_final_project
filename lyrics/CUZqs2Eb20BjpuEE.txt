Resound the outcry
raise the signal of distress
We are compromised
They have silenced our dissent

A dull complacency covers humanity
This systematic hate of deceit
How many more will die
before we realize
the truth has been disguised?

Violence increased
no justice and no peace
In the great deceit
The discontent
silenced or put to death
In the great deceit
It's mental slavery

Our segregation
is further fed by ignorance
This disconnection
through color of the flesh
Blood of generations
saturate our roots
But history conceals the truth

Violence increased
no justice and no peace
In the great deceit
The discontent
silenced or put to death
In the great deceit
It's mental slavery

How can we breathe?
The silence is killing me
How can we breathe?
Who is the enemy
How can we breathe?
Suffocate humanity
How can we breathe?
No justice, no peace

Violence
No justice and no peace
In the great deceit
The discontent
silenced or put to death
In the great deceit
It's mental slavery
