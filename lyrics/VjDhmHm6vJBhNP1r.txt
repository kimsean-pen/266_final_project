You were always there for me
Blue skies and fields of green
And the night stars glittering

I cried a deep, blue sea
'Cus I see the ghost you'll be
Your beauty is withering

I know you'll have the last laugh
Still be here when it's all gone bad
We'll be like an old memory you had
And you'll still be spinning around

Will we close our eyes and stay the same
Dancing beneath the poison rain
'Til it all goes up in flames

Hold a flower up to the sun
Watch the petals fall one by one
Like a thread unraveling

I know you'll have the last laugh
Still be here when it's all gone bad
We'll be like an old memory you had
And you'll still be spinning around

Maybe we're just not meant to last
Maybe it's true, all things must pass
We'll be like an old memory you had
And you'll still be spinning around

You'll still be spinning around
You'll still be spinning around
