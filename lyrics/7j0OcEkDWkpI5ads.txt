Starsailor

I am a bee out in the fields of winter
And though I memorized the slope of water,
Oblivion carries me on his shoulder:
Beyond the suns I speak and circuits shiver,
But though I shout the wisdom of the maps,
I am a salmon in the ring shape river.

Composer's Notes. Harmonic structure: a set of horizontal vocal lines
is improvised in at least three ranges, the vertical effect
of which is atonal tone clusters and arhythmic counterpoint.

Performance: the written melody is to be sung, after which
the lines of lyric are to be reordered at will and sung
to improvised melody, taking advantage of the opportunity
for quartertones, third note lengths, and flexible tempo.
