I'm not usually the type of guy to call twice and leave a message every time
(It's me again)
That's quite alright
And most days I just dust them off like that
Girls text me, you're the only one I text back

'Cause you know where the party's at
And I'm like, yeah
Everything you heard is true
Everybody knows I'm hung up on you
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
And I'm like, yeah

Telling other girls I'm through
Everybody knows I'm hung up on you
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
So big, this thing that we got going on
Riding round downtown where you take the top off, yeah
It turns me on
And I'm like, whoa

Girl, how'd you get me hooked like this?
One look, one touch, one kiss, one chick
And then I can't resist
And I'm like, yeah
Everything you heard is true
Everybody knows I'm hung up on you

(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
And I'm like, yeah
Telling other girls I'm through
Everybody knows I'm hung up on you
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Uhhh uhhh uhh
Up on you

Uhhh uhhh uhh
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
You got the style, you got the flavor
I want you now, I want you later
I'm hung up, so let's get down tonight
Floating around, a couple of gypsies

Shaking it up, we're getting tipsy
You show me yours
'Cause imma show you mine
And I'm like, yeah
Everything you heard is true
Everybody knows I'm hung up on you

Yeah!
Telling other girls I'm through
Everybody knows I'm hung up on you
And I'm like, yeah
Everything you heard is true
Everybody knows I'm hung up on you
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
And I'm like, yeah
Telling other girls I'm through
Everybody knows I'm hung up on you
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Uhhh uhhh uhh
Up on you
Uhhh uhhh uhh
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
You got the style, you got the flavor
I want you now, I-I want you later
I'm hung up, so let's get down tonight... hung up on you!
