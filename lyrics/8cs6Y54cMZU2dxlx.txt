Just take it all: my heart, my mind, my every word from out my lungs
My every breath and every thought, take every word I've ever sung
Although I'm glad to help you out and get your feet back on the ground
Please, understand I'm just a man, you understand? I'm just a man
And I feel helpless when I stumble, and my anxiety escapes
I lose all hope, and I'm afraid that once again I've lost my place

I give it all, and when I fall
I get up and give some more
Until there's nothing left of me
Just some bones stacked on the floor

But every song's a two-way street: I give to you, you give to me
And as long as that remains, I will still haul my heavy feet
Because you're all worth every word, and, yeah, you're all here in my heart
And I know we can sing together to avoid falling apart

I give it all, and when I fall
I get up and give some more
Until there's nothing left of me
Just some bones stacked on the floor

I give it all, and when I fall
I get up and give some more
Until there's nothing left of me
Just some bones stacked on the floor

At the end of everything
This is for you, this is for me
Your fight to overcome defeat
Has set the skies alight for me

I give it all, and when I fall
I get up and give some more
Until there's nothing left of me
Just some bones stacked on the floor
I give it all, and when I fall
I get up and give some more
Until there's nothing left of me
Just some bones stacked on the floor

I give it all, and when I fall
I get up and give some more
Until there's nothing left of me
Just some bones stacked on the floor
I give it all, and when I fall
I get up and give some more
Until there's nothing left of me
Just some bones stacked on the floor
