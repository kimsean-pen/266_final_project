bap-ba-bap-pab-ba oo-woah-oh

It was a summer day,
When you took my cares away
When you whispered to me,
And it was so sweet,
She can blow us off track, so marry me,
You found the weathered boat,
Ocean baby you would know,
When you feel the bow cutting through the waves
No other motion can pass the day

Seafarer look what you've done
Got me chasing after the sun
I've left my home and friends behind
You've driven me clean out of my mind

Don't tell me when you've set sail
You'd face a number if you could scale
I know I never learned to set the oar
Nothing left for me back on shore

Oh-oo-oo-oh-oo-oo-ohoh-o Seafarer I must love you,
Why else would I follow you
I've left my home and friends behind
You've driven me clean out of my mind

Seafarer, oh-o-oh, you and I belong together
Seafarer, oh-o-oh, you and I belong oh-o-o-oh-woah
Seafarer, oh-o-oh, you and I belong together
Seafarer, oh-o-oh, you and I belong oh-o-o-oh-woah
