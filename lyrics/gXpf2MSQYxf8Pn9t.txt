Heartache, heartache
Heartache from the best day ever
Breakup, makeup
Breakup, this will go on forever
Breakup, breakdown
Take a break and we get back together
Last day, last day
This is the last day
We get the best day ever

I hope it's enough to give my love
To get on with this breakup
Just leave me your heart as you walk out the door
I'll keep it on the tub
And don't turn around if you love me
You let me be, let me be, baby
And maybe we'll fight down the line
If we love ice it won't hurt too much

Don't cry, don't cry
Tonight, it was the best day ever
Goodbye, we cry
We're tired, tired of forever
Kiss me, miss me
Cut my, cut my tether
Last day, last day
Last day, make it the best day ever

I hope it's enough to give my love
To get on with this breakup
Just leave me your heart as you walk out the door
I'll keep it on the tub
And don't turn around if you love me
You let me be, let me be, baby
And maybe we'll fight down the line
If we love ice it won't hurt too much

I love my magnet we were taking out of time
That we should never met, never met, never met, never met
Thank God we met

I hope it's enough, oh, to give my love
To get on with this breakup
Just leave me your heart as you walk out the door
I'll keep it on the tub
And don't turn around if you love me
You let me be, let me be, baby
And maybe we'll fight down the line
If we love ice it won't hurt too much
And don't turn around if you love me
You let me be, let me be, baby
And maybe we'll fight down the line
If we love ice it won't hurt too much
