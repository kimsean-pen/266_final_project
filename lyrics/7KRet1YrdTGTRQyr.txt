I know that you've been searching for me elsewhere
In the cracks beneath your feet and in the spaces between walls
In the dark wells of the mirror, in the space I used to stand
I know that you've been searching for me elsewhere

In the black pits of my mind
Where the tar of my emotions swirls black and ever thicker
Where I retreat to hide from life
I have the reaper in my heart and black tar pits for eyes

I have the cold heart of the lost ones
And no love to tear us apart
I know that you've been searching in the spaces between words
But let me tell you, theres nothing there to read, there to read

Well, I know that you've been searching
And you've looked inside your heart
But under oceans and in coffins
Is a better place to start, place to start

You can't begin to know the depths of the abyss
Until you've lost it all, until you've seen yourself
Cause that reflection just ain't what it used to be
It sure as hell ain't what I want to see

Well, I know that you've been searching
And you've looked inside your heart
But under oceans and in coffins
Is a better place to start

Heartbreak is the burden I bear
And the bottle's is the blood I smear, oh
Just burdens, just guilt
Just loss and just fear

Well, I know that you've been searching
And you've looked inside your heart
But under oceans and in coffins
Is a better place to start

Well, I know that you've been searching
And you've looked inside your heart
But under oceans and in coffins
Is a better place to start
