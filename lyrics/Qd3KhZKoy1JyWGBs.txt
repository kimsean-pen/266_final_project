You dig in places till your fingers bleed
Spread the infection where you spill your seed
I can't remember what she came here for
I can't remember much of anything anymore

She's gone
She's gone
She's gone away

A little mouth opened up inside
Yeah, I was watching on the day she died
We keep licking while the skin turns black
Cut along the length (but you can't get the feeling back)

She's gone
She's gone
She's gone away

Are you still here?
