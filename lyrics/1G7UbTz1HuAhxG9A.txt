That's my energy, big dick energy
Never let a fake ho get in front of me
Bitch, you better let go, you can't take the heat
That's my energy, big dick energy

Superstar, I'm a superstar
When I walk in, the room go dark
Took your girl and I don't feel sorry, no way, just playin'

Don't be scared of me havin' fun
A-B-C-D-E, F you want? Cup of Hennessy
And a blunt like a fog machine
Can't name one bitch who drip like me

That's my energy, big dick energy
Never let a fake ho get in front of me
Bitch, you better let go, you can't take the heat
That's my energy, big dick energy
That's my energy, big dick energy
Never let a fake ho get in front of me
Bitch, you better let go, you can't take the heat
That's my energy, big dick energy

12 inches, take a poll
I'm uncut, out of control
Stroke of genius, 'bout to blow like you never seen before
Once a week, post on Instagram and they be screamin', "Goals"
I be busy breakin' molds, catchin' ice, I'm too cold
Yeah, frappuccino mocha, don't give me granola
I might turn my back on you, beach, like Corona
Beamer or Corolla, can't fuck up my aura
I got so much balls, you could call it tapioca
I got all these cameras all around me
Always TMZ in my vicinity (Don't stop)
They be tryna bling on my frequency (Smash, smash)
Got my fingers covered in Swarovski
Champagne breath in the party (Party)
Fendi balls hangin' from my car keys (Car keys)
How do I put this harshly? (Harshly)
Play a fake bitch like a Barbie (Okay)
I'ma just drop it like it's hot, quick
For the 7 million fans that I be with
You wanna be slick, but you could not fit
So you better put it back in your sock, prick

Don't be scared of me havin' fun
A-B-C-D-E, F you want? Cup of Hennessy
And a blunt like a fog machine
Can't name one bitch who drip like me

That's my energy, big dick energy
Never let a fake ho get in front of me
Bitch, you better let go, you can't take the heat
That's my energy, big dick energy
That's my energy, big dick energy
Never let a fake ho get in front of me
Bitch, you better let go, you can't take the heat
That's my energy, big dick energy
