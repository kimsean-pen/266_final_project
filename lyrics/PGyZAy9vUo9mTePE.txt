A little crazy from the start
Fires like this can tear the world apart
I'd rather take a hit and fall
They never fuck it up with you at all

Feel it come inside my lungs
All in, all in
Wanna take in all your love
Release

'Cause sparks in the dark
Gonna tear through my heart
And start a fire
So before it all goes up
Baby, can we burn it slow-low-low-low-low?
Baby, can we burn it slow-low-low-low-low?
I don't wanna lose control-ol-ol-ol
Baby, can we burn it slow-low-low-low-low?

Contact from the way you act
Makes me forget the rails and go off track
Once we let go, no turning back
Damn, this feeling pushes me to the max
Feel it come inside my lungs
All in, all in
Wanna take in all your love
Release

'Cause sparks in the dark
Gonna tear through my heart
And start a fire
So before it all goes up
Baby, can we burn it slow-low-low-low-low?
Baby, can we burn it slow-low-low-low-low?
I don't wanna lose control-ol-ol-ol
Baby, can we burn it slow-low-low-low-low?

Can we burn slow?
Can we burn slow?

Feel it come inside my lungs
Wanna take in all your love
So before it all goes up
So before it all goes up

Baby, can we burn it slow-low-low-low-low?
Baby, can we burn it slow-low-low-low-low?
I don't wanna lose control-ol-ol-ol
So baby, can we burn it slow-low-low-low-low?
Can we burn slow?
Can we burn slow?
