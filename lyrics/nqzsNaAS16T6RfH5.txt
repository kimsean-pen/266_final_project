I'm a psychedelic addict
Satisfaction is a savage
When the sweetest acid slides right into my bones
All strictly systematic
ABCâ€”alphabetic
This focus is fatal, baby please don't leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone

Pour it all together, I don't set the measure
Only my fate bears responsibility
Baby it's whatever
This magical texture
Fills up the void inside of me
Think I learned my lesson
On another level
Take me home and put me straight to sleep
I gotta confess
First I felt refreshed

But the aftertaste is bittersweet

I'm a psychedelic addict
La-lay me down on the mattress
Will you just take off my panties and put the shower on
Warning content's graphic
When the water washes away the rebel you
Should pick it up and grab it before it's gone
Before it's gone

Before it's gone
Before it's gone
Before it's gone
