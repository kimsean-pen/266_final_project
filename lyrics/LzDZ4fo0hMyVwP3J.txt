Back in 84' i nearly choked on the u-cord
until my dad came and cut me loose he said,
'the pain you felt today, it will never go away'
and 'the best way out is always through'.
He said, 'watch out for the world trying to shape you living here
you got to know the truth'
twenty five years later everything is the same
a civilization gone deaf-mute
