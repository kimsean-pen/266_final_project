I'm a beautiful guy
And you have just walked by
And I have gave you the eye
But you pretend to be shy
But I'm a beautiful guy
(You know what I mean? You know what I mean?)
So I want you to know why, why, why
You make me cry, cry, cry
'Cause you wanna try, try, try
Some stupid game on me
They're drinking lighter
They're full of water
I hear them say:
"Let's jog..."
They're playing tennis
They're butts are tighter
What could be whiter?
Hey?
Your athletic approach has a lot of appeal
The girl is responding to your little deal
She's modern 'n empty 'n totally vain
But beauty, of course, can feel no pain
