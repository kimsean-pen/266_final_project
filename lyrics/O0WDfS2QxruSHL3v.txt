Spoon

Candle in the room in the afternoon
How do you spoon? She will be soon
Wait me a fork, raise your knife
Speaks a joke, she soaks me alive

Candle in the room in the afternoon
How do you spoon? She will be soon
Wait me a fork, raise your knife
Speaks a joke, she soaks me alive

Oh, sit down on my chair when nobody want to care
Oh, sit down on my chair when nobody want to care

Candle in the room in the afternoon
How do you spoon? She will be soon
Wait me a fork, raise your knife
Speaks a joke, she soaks me alive

Oh, sit down on my chair when nobody want to care
Oh, sit down on my chair when nobody want to care
Oh, sit down on my chair when nobody want to care
Oh, sit down on my chair when nobody want to care ...
