Mmhhmm...
hmmm...

I'll never see the clouds fall on you,
Baby tell me how is it what you do
When the sun shines thru the rainbow
I know the truth
Baby you my life I'll wait for you

At the boat yard we've been waiting
to the coast guard we've been waving
hoping that the rumors aren't true
I hope you come true
and I'll never lose you

I'll never see the clouds fall on you,
Baby tell me how is it what you do
When the sun shines through the rainbow
I know the truth
Know that all my life I'll wait for you

Sharp winds are cold and slaving
No matter how long I'm saving
Knowing trusting and praying
I know you'll come through
And I'll never lose you

I never see the clouds follow you
Baby tell me how is it what you do
When the sun shines thru the rainbow
I know it's true
Baby your my life

I will wait for you

uhhhh
mhmm
Will you come through
will you be true
God I miss you
I see your face
In this empty space
I'm never leaving
Never leaving this space

OOOhhhhhh
yeahhhh

I'll never see the clouds fall on you
So baby tell me how is it what you do
When the sun shines through the rainbow
I'll know the truth and baby your my life
I will wait for you

I will wait for you
I've never seen the clouds fall
On... you baby
Oh now baby would you tell me how
Would you tell me how
Yeah... ooohhh
Say I'll never see the clouds fall on you
They never fall on you (3x)
Baby it's what you do
Is it how you move, Come on babe
I'll never see the clouds... fall on you
