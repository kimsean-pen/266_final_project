Watch it all play out
Reactions too familiar
The way I act too dissimilar
To always see it in my mind
Say just what you mean
The love I don't believe in
The days we spend deflating
And passing by the time

Stand up straight
With my back against the wall
Keep me still
And wondering just why we falter

Don't you want to stay here
Or do you want to phase me out
Don't you want to lay here
Or would you rather do without

Eventually you'll crack
And remember there's no need for
Siphoning some reason
From a disputing line we drew

Stand up straight
With my back against the wall
Keep me still
And wondering just why we falter

Don't you want to stay here
Or do you want to phase me out
Don't you want to lay here
Or would you rather do without

Stand up straight
With my back against the wall
Keep me still
And wondering just why we falter

Don't you want to stay here
Or do you want to phase me out
Don't you want to lay here
Or would you rather do without

Don't you want to stay here
Or do you want to phase me out
