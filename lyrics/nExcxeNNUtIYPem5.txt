M-M-M-Murda...

I see you watching so I walked into your stare
'Cause I ain't in the position to be walking over there
I got a situation, I can tell you wanna know
How you can take an honest girl and turn her to a...
If I'ma take a gamble then you better come correct
I need more than them diamonds that you got around your neck
Shit, anybody can flex, my baby do it best
If you come with somethin' better, then we might just take it there

I know I ain't right for tempting you
But I just wanna see what you would do
If I gave you a taste of what I do
Just remember that I don't belong to you

You gon' have to come stronger than this liquor
Wanna take me home, better be more convincing
It'll take more than that to get to me
More than that to get your way
Boy, you better come stronger than this liquor
Wanna take me home, better be more, more convincing
It'll take more than that to get to me
More than that to get your way
I'm stronger than this liquor

If my man notice, there'll be some issues
But take my number down, I just might hit you
No, I'm just playing, I'm so deep in love
But the way you talkin' might just have me actin' up
The way you looking at me, boy, I know what's up
I can feel how you feel without even a touch
But don't think that's gon' make me give it up
Boy, your time is up

I know I ain't right for tempting you
But I just wanna see what you would do (Ooh, see what you would do)
If I gave you a taste of what I do
Just remember that I don't belong to you

You gon' have to come stronger than this liquor
Wanna take me home, better be more convincing
It'll take more than that to get to me
More than that to get your way
Boy, you better come stronger than this liquor
Wanna take me home, better be more, more convincing
It'll take more than that to get to me
More than that to get your way
I'm stronger than this liquor

It'll take more...
