My head's chained down by the voices
It's looking like they want war again
Their weapon of choice is a poison
Made up of all the words you said

Yeah they're better off without you
You know how they talk about you
Your fears coming true and now you
Ask

When will the voices stop making trouble inside?
If I look in the mirror will I see through their eyes?
When will the voices in my head just stop and let me rest?
I can't take it (take it)
Here come the voices again

I'm up to my neck in the noises
So I thank god that walls can't talk
I do anything to avoid it
Tear em down cause I've had enough

Yeah they're better off without you
You know how they talk about you
Your fears coming true and now you
Ask

When will the voices stop making trouble inside?
If I look in the mirror will I see through their eyes?
When will the voices in my head just stop and let me rest?
I can't take it (take it)
Here come the voices again
