You blink to start the day
Look down on your way up
The floor falls away
The shadows come to play
We'll dance all the way up
Our fears fade away

Watching all our worries
Knowing they're not worthy
Round and round up and down
No one's gonna stop us now
We sleep in our heads
So fuck the things that they said
My whole worlds love
Makes me wanna stay up like

They say you'll never last
For nothing but a no one
Still flunking middle class
While I'm standing on this roof
Shut my eyes I'm living proof
Watch me jump without a parachute

Watching all our worries
Knowing they're not worthy
Round and round up and down
No one's gonna stop us now
We sleep in our heads
So fuck the things that they said
My whole worlds love
Makes me wanna stay up like

We do it our way
We'll do it our way
We do it our way
Round and round up and down
Nothing's gonna stop us now

We sleep in our heads
So fuck the things that they said
My whole worlds love
Makes me wanna stay up like

We sleep in our heads
So fuck the things that they said
My whole worlds love
Makes me wanna stay up

We sleep in our heads
So fuck the things that they said
My whole worlds love
Makes me wanna stay up
