I liked it
Until you took it away
You can be hard to take
But I wouldn't have another way
I wanna feel love
But I don't want my heart to break
I wanna feel love, feel love
Baby I'm dyin'
To take ya home, home, home
Baby I'm cryin'
So take me home, home, home
We can fight it
Or we can throw it away
You're invited for however long you wanna stay
I wanna feel love
But I don't want my heart to ache
I wanna feel love, feel love
Baby I'm dyin'
To take ya home, home, home
Baby I'm cryin'
So take me home, home, home
Baby I'm dyin'
To take ya home, home, home
Baby I'm cryin'
So take me home, home, home
Baby I'm dyin'
To take ya home, home, home
Baby I'm cryin'
So take me home, home, home
Baby I'm dyin'
To take ya home, home, home
Baby I'm cryin'
So take me home, home, home
