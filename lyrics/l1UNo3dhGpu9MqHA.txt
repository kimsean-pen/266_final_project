Fear of the sacred
We're blurring lines between the real and the fake here.
And so I scream, "Return to me.
Return to me. Return to me."

Fear of the sacred
We're blurring lines between the real and the fake here.
And so I scream, "Return to me.
Return to me. Return to me."

Breathe slowly; take shallow breaths.
Fear will strip you till there's nothing left.
We are all the same; seeking comfort in the knowledge that we're insane?
Fear nothing, but your own mind
We drag ourselves through the fire's. Blind

"Free me," said the man on fire.
"Release me to the higher.
Finding sanity I know, will leave me breathless."
"Find me," said the man on fire.
"Release me to the higher.
Forever in the dark alone, forgotten."

My vision must be failling
Im seeing shadows in the dark
And all I here is screaming.
Is it paranoia, that keeps calling me?
Or the voices of the souls that used to be
I must find a way to drown out the sound!
I must find a way to drown out the sound!

"Free me," said the man on fire.
"Release me to the higher.
Finding sanity I know, will leave me breathless."
"Find me," said the man on fire.
"Release me to the higher.
Forever in the dark alone, forgotten."

Set me alight, for I am losing it.
Set me alight, for I am losing it.
Set me alight, for I am losing it.
Set me alight, for I am losing it.

Fear of the sacred
We're blurring lines between the real and the fake here.
And so I scream, "Return to me.
Return to me. Return to me."
