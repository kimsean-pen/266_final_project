Turn around, open your eyes
Can't move on, the fear is tying you down
Open your eyes
It's all right, oh

I'm hellbound in this life, keep fighting this endless war
It's always been like this, I don't know why
Enslavement of your mind, your fear, it ties me down
Going down, I won't bow, no

Screaming at the walls of fire, they're closing in on me
I hunger for the vertigo, the silver moonlight, it's where I wanna be
Screaming at the walls of fire, but I'm still running free
In the silver moonlight, I can breathe

These days are only now breathing in the coldest lies
I think that's only what you have in mind
Holding on to the best of you, I hit the pavement
Going down, I won't bow down

Screaming at the walls of fire, they're closing in on me
I hunger for the vertigo, the silver moonlight, it's where I wanna be
Screaming at the walls of fire, but I'm still running free
In the silver moonlight, I can breathe

I'm impatient, but it's colours that I need
Too many shades of grey, I cannot breathe
The dreams I have ain't tainted, I need you to believe
The only way to make them real, oh

Screaming at the walls of fire, they're closing in on me
I hunger for the vertigo, the silver moonlight, it's where I wanna be
Screaming at the walls of fire, but I'm still running free
In the silver moonlight, I can breathe

Turn around, open your eyes
Can't move on, the fear is tying you down
Open your eyes
It's all right
