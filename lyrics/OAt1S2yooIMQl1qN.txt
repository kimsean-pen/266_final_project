See I left my mother's heart
See I left my father's home
And I fell into a well of hope

I'm carrying my heart but it's made of stone
I'm carrying my heart but my heart is made of stone

See I left my mother's heart
See I left my father's home
And I fell into a well of hope

I'm carrying my heart but it's made of stone
I'm carrying my heart but my heart is made of stone
I'm carrying my heart but it's made of stone
oh I'm carrying my heart but my heart is made of stone
Oooh ohhwooahh oooooah aoowoahh
