The sharpest I've ever been
In your arms
I'm trying to make you see
And talk about letting go of something
You'd trade it all for me
Undignified, don't you think?
Just standing there
With nowhere else to go
You sprayed your hair, added hold
Stability, a scaffold for the soul
The weather is better
Oh we could ride there
Cruising on our bikes
'Till the sun comes up
We gotta be smarter
Oh look at you, so careless on this road
Let your hands go free
The sharpest I've ever been
Is knowing the trouble that I'm in
And love is such a burden
A tiger balm to irritate the skin
Oh we could tell just looking at
The top of your overcoat collar
Candy pieces all smeared out
Surely you see there are two versions of me
One googles itself
And the other one lives free
The weather is better
Oh we could ride there
Cruising on our bikes
'Till the sun comes up
We gotta be smarter
Oh look at you, so careless on this road
Let your hands go free
