World a reggae music on yah - eh
Keep me rockin with me daughter - eh-a
World a reggae music on yah - eh
Never lef' ya', never no sah - eh-a
Now just be nice and hold your space
I won't entertain no more disgrace
Out in the streets they call it merther
when rhythm spacing out your head
(1st)
Man showing how man feeling
Man singing goodness gracious I
Ten thousand rydims peeling
It makes the spider kiss the fly
World a reggae music on ya - eh
Keep me rocking with me daughter - eh -a
World a reggae music on ya - eh
Lord I thirsty, give me water - eh-a
(1st)
