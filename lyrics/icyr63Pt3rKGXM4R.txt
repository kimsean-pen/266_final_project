As I lay down on the bed
Try to tell us with what it's just been said
I don't know what I should look or what to say
Is this happening to us today?
If I could than I would scream
I wipe the tears off of my face
Wake me up if it's a dream
This is more than I can take
I give everything I am
If someone else could take my place
Can someone else please take my place?
How could life be so unfair?
I can't breathe, in fact I'm choking on the air
It's so over I can see it in your eyes
I'm head down and them leave my side
If I could than I would scream
I wipe the tears off of my face
Wake me up if it's a dream
This is more than I can take
I give everything I am
If someone else could take my place
Can someone else please take my place?
If I could than I would scream
I wipe the tears off of my face
Wake me up if it's a dream
This is more than I can take
I give everything I am
If someone else could take my place
Can someone else please take my place?
