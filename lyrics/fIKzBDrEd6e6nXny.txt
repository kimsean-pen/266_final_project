The city's dead by morning
Slipping past the great divide
It chases over bridges
Spins me out of my own mind

How much are you likin'
What you see is what you get
Oh, say you love me again
But you never do

I'm not singing a love
Singing a love song
'Cause love is a game to you now
Watch just to see how long

Oh I want to fall away
And waste another day
'Cause love is a game to you now
Watch just to see how long

I still disappoint you
Why dont you find another threat
It seems that you fall now
If you fall would you tell anybody

You may waste no time dear
But you cant waste mine

Oh, say you love me again
But you never do

I'm not singing a love
Singing a love song
'Cause love is a game to you now
Watch just to see how long

Oh I want to fall away
And waste another day
'Cause love is a game to you now
Watch just to see how long

But if you can't say love anyway
You love again

'Cause love is a game to you now
Watch just to see how long
Oh I want to fall away
And waste another day

'Cause love is a game to you now
Watch just to see how long
