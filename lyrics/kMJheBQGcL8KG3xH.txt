Burning Embers Of The Second Death Will Come In The Night
Priests And Kings, The Alpha And Omega, Poison Bites
False Prophets And Deceivers, Swing From The Trees
Now. Dawn The Age Of Birds
Drunk With Blood, Like Lepers With Disease
Lord Of The Sky, Mercury The Guide
Lord Of The Underworld, I Swear The Sacred Rite
I Will Crucify, Slay Them With Their Tribe
Hear My War Cry
They'll Find No Sanctuary Hidden In Their Ancestral Halls
Let Loose The Knot That Binds
The Spirit And Flesh, Let It Fall
For Only Courage And Heroism Linger After Death
So, Hold Fast Thy Sword, Rejecting Pain, Feel The Dragons
Breath
Lord Of The Sky, Mercury The Guide
Lord Of The Underworld, I Swear The Sacred Rite
I Will Crucify, Slay Them With Their Tribe
Hear My War Cry

I've Sworn The Oath
I've Sworn The Oath
I've Sworn The Oath

Lord Of The Sky, Mercury The Guide
Lord Of The Underworld, I Swear The Sacred Rite
I Will Crucify, Slay Them With Their Tribe
Hear My War Cry
