I saw the light today
I saw the light today
I saw the light today
I saw the light today

silence loud and wind so long
the quiet building in the dark
surrender to the game
I saw the light today

the silent scream that we're apart
I dare to dream, for there you are
I bleed, but I won't break
I saw the light today

I saw the light today
I saw the light today
today
today
today
today
