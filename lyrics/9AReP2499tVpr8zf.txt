She got out of town
On a railway, New York bound
Took all except my name
Another alien on Broadway
Some things in this world you just can't change
Some things you can't see until it gets too late

Baby, baby, baby
When all your love is gone
Who will save me
From all I'm up against out in this world

Maybe, maybe, maybe
You'll find something that's enough to keep you
But if the bright lights don't receive you
You should turn yourself around and come on home

I got a hole in me now
I got a scar I can talk about
She keeps a picture of me
In her apartment in the city
Some things in this world, man, they don't make sense
Some things you don't need until they leave you
They're the things that you miss, you say

Baby, baby, baby
When all your love is gone
Who will save me
From all I'm up against out in this world

Maybe, maybe, maybe
You'll find something that's enough to keep you
But if the bright lights don't receive you
You should turn yourself around and come on home

Let that city take you in (come on home)
Let that city spit you out (come on home)
Let that city take you down
For God's sake, turn around

Baby, baby, baby
When all your love is gone
Who will save me
From all I'm up against out in this world

Maybe, maybe, maybe
You'll find something that's enough to keep you
But if the bright lights don't receive you
Turn yourself around and come on home

Yeah, come on home
Maybe, maybe, baby, baby
Come on home
Yeah, come on home
Come on home
Come on home
