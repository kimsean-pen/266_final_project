There is nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say
But you can learn how to play the game
It's easy

Nothing you can make that can be made
No one who can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do
But can learn to be you in time
It's easy

All You Need Is Love
All You Need Is Love
All You Need Is Love, Love
Love Is All You Need

Love, Love, Love
Love, Love, Love
Love, Love, Love

All You Need Is Love
All You Need Is Love
All You Need Is Love, Love
Love Is All You Need

There's nothing you can know that isn't known
Nothing you can see isn't shown
There's nowhere you can be
That isn't where you're meant to be
It's Easy
