Fall
Their bodies fall
I am the immortal
Chosen to judge your sins
To the ones disloyal
Judgment will bring you death

I will tear the flesh
Desecrate you
These peasants will see who stands over them all
As their bodies fall (as their bodies fall)
The reign of a king who will never be gone
Will destroy you all (will destroy you all)

Standing as towers
Staring down at the coward
Standing as towers

These monsters burn in rage
Their victims have themselves to blame
Unleash the wolves from hell
Devour their souls and engorge yourselves
Engorge youselves

All on their knees
The weak will weep
Gasping just to breathe
Cold and dark
Compassion has fled
Death lives here instead
Through the streets a river of red
I smile at the dead
I smile at the dead

I never said I'd
Show any mercy
Throw them all in the pit
I never said I'd
Show any mercy
Throw them all in the pit

I am the immortal
Chosen to judge your sins
To the ones disloyal
Judgment will now begin
