Sickly sweet, his poison seeks
For the young ones who don't understand
The danger in his hands
With a jaundiced wink see his cunning slink
Oh trust in me my pretty one
Come walk with me my helpless one
Candyman

Syrup lies upon your tongue
Ge latine saliva spills
The flash of a guillotine a smile
Candyman, oh, candyman

No pity for him
Their misery screams unspeakable things
No pity for him
Their misery screams unspeakable things
Candyman

A cool missile, yes it's in his smile
With open arms to welcome you
Beware the masked pretender
He always lies, this candyman
Those lips conspire in treachery
To strike in cloak and dagger, see
Candyman, oh, candyman

And all the children
He warns "don't tell" those threats are sold
With their guilt and shame
They think they're to blane for candyman
Candyman, candyman, candyman, candyman
