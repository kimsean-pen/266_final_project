I was fine right before I met her
Never hurt and nothing could control me
You know I tried but I can't regret her
She's the first, ask anyone who knows me
Terrified that she'd find my heart and break it
Paralyzed by the thought of her with someone else

I wish I would have known...

I shouldn't have fallen in love with her
It's been nothing but trouble till now
I shouldn't have fallen in love at all
But I couldn't stop myself
What gives her the right
To tear up my life
How dare she be so perfect
What did I do to deserve this
Woooah
(I'll never let her go)
How dare she be so perfect

(You started the fire)
I haven't cried since the day she left me
Cause that would mean that I admit it's over
I tell myself that she's trying to test me
She'd never leave she still needs me to hold her
Horrified cause she found my heart and broke it

Mortified when I picture her with someone else
I wish I would have known...
I shouldn't have fallen in love with her
It's been nothing but trouble till now

I shouldn't have fallen in love at all
But I couldn't stop myself

What gives her the right

To tear up my life
How dare she be so perfect
What did I do to deserve this
(Got to let her go)
How dare she be so perfect
Tell me why, tell me why...
You started the fire
And played me like that
Tell me why, tell me why...
You started the fire
And played me like that

(Oh Oh, Oh Oh)
(Oh Oh, Oh Oh)
(Oh Oh, Oh Oh)
I shouldn't have fallen in love with her
(Oh Oh, Oh Oh)
It's been nothing but trouble till now

(Oh Oh, Oh Oh)
I shouldn't have fallen in love at all
But I couldn't stop myself
(I've got to let her go)
What gives her the right
To tear up my life
How dare she be so perfect
What did I do to deserve this
Wooah
(I've got to let her go)
How dare she be so perfect
Tell me why, tell me why...
You started the fire
And played me like that
Tell me why, tell me why...
You started the fire
And played me like that
