You live in Phnom Penh
You live in New York City

But I think about you so so so so
So much I forget to eat

It's 4 am I check my email
I'm too geared up to fall asleep
So I write you back and count the days until we'll be together

The first thing that I'll do
Is throw my arms around you

And never let go
And never let go

I call you from my hotel room
I'm sitting on the hallway floor

I know that we are so
So so
So tired my phone card just expired

You only call me when you're drunk
I can tell it by your voice

It's the only time that you
Open up to me and tell me that you love me

The first thing that I'll do
Is throw my arms around you

And never let go
And never let go
I'm thirty-thousand feet high
Flying through the dead of night
I took an Ambein and you came to visit me in my dreams.
You were bathed in blue light

Floating right in front of me
Your face was so
So so
So bright I had to close my eyes to see
The first thing that I'll do
Is throw my arms around you
And never let go
And never let go
Never let go oh oh
Never let go oh oh
Never let go oh oh
Never let go oh oh
Never let go oh oh
