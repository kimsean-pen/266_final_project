I'm in the thicker crowds
I'm gonna pick you out
You know I never forget
You should keep your wits about
I'm lose like liquor know
You're bright as blood in my head

Nothing phasin' me, nothing phasin' me
Nothing shakin' me, it would usually
All these feelings coming up, I don't know why I'm acting tough
What the fuck was that I just said?

Help me out, can you talk me down?
Let me out I'ma hurt you now

It's what you made me, I'm a monster
And I'll haunt ya and I'll do just what you say
'Cause baby lately an imposter is taking over
And she knows she's gotta stay

It's caught up in my throat, I think I'm gonna choke
On all the lies I slept with in bed
Try to keep it on the low, like I'm under control
But you still got inside of my head

Nothing phasin' me, nothing phasin' me
Nothing shakin' me, it would usually
All these feelings coming up, I don't know why I'm acting tough
What the fuck was that I just said?

Help me out, can you talk me down?
Let me out I'ma hurt you now

It's what you made me, I'm a monster
And I'll haunt ya and I'll do just what you say
'Cause baby lately an imposter is taking over
And she knows she's gotta stay
(I'm a monster, I'm a monster)

It's what you made me, I'm a monster
And I'll haunt ya and I'll do just what you say
'Cause baby lately an imposter is taking over
And she knows she's gotta stay

It's what you made me, I'm a monster
And I'll haunt ya and I'll do just what you say
'Cause baby lately an imposter is taking over
And she knows she's gotta stay
(I'm a monster, I'm a monster)
