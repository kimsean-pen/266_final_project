Don't you wanna dive on in? Yeah the water feels right
Dancin' on the edge of the love you're a beautiful sight
So why're you still standin' there in the half moonlight
Come on, baby, give me a little more you
Come on, baby, give me a little more you

You're battin' those baby blues and honey I swear
The way you got me needing you, girl it just ain't fair
You've given me a little bit yeah, but don't stop there
Come on, baby, give me a little more you
Come on, baby, give me a little more you

I'm here fallin' for you, my heart's callin' for you
I know I never can get enough
Don't hold back one bit of your love
Strong and steady for you, I'm all ready
Come on, baby, give me a little more you
Come on, baby, give me a little more

You're teasin' me with a touch and the whole world shakes
Keep holdin' that river back and the levee may break
There's only so much that this ol' boy can take
Come on, baby, give me a little more you
Yeah, come on, baby, give me a little more you

I'm here fallin' for you, my heart's callin' for you
I know I never can get enough
Don't hold back one bit of your love
Strong and steady for you, I'm all ready
Come on, baby, give me a little more you
Come on, baby, give me a little more you
Come on, baby, give me a little more

Ooh, give me a little more
You give me a little more
You give me a little more
You give me a little more
