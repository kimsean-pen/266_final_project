Call the police
'cause things are getting ugly
Get on your feet
I want you running with me

Do what you like
Say what you mean
Do what you please

We'll set the streets on fire
And when it comes on top
We'll give it lots of aggro
We're giving it lots of aggro

And when it comes on top
We'll give it lots of aggro

Blood on the streets
You see the trouble happening
Get on your feet
You see the crowds are gathering

Do what you like
Say what you mean
Do what you please

And when it comes on top
We'll give it lots of aggro
We're giving it lots of aggro
