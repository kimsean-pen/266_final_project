But don't worry, mom, I met him in a restaurant
And all this time I've been getting to know him
He's got an ex-wife in pasadena
And sometimes she's a mess to deal with
But mostly we've been living here uninjured
There's a silence, and she says

"Listen here young lady
All that matter is what makes you happy
But you leave this house knowing my opinion
Won't make you love me if you don't care to."

But mom, I'm sending you this photograph
I swear this one is going to last
And all those other bastards were only practice

I feel the sun on my back
I smell the earth in my skin
I see the sky above me like a full recovery

"Listen here young lady
All that matter is what makes you happy
But you leave this house knowing my opinion
Won't make you love me if you don't care to."

"Listen here young lady
All that matter is what makes you happy
But you leave this house knowing my opinion
Won't make you love me if you don't care to."

"Listen here young lady
All that matter is what makes you happy
But you leave this house knowing my opinion
Won't make you love me if you don't care to."

"Listen here young lady
All that matter is what makes you happy
But you leave this house knowing my opinion
Won't make you love me if you don't care to."
