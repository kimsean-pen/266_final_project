Livin' on the edge, flyin' down hill
To where the good girls don't, but the bad girls will
Bad girls will

Do I know your name? You can tell me lies
Show me all the secrets hidden in your thighs
In your thighs

Yeah, seduce me tonight, se-se-seduce me tonight
I'll play acts, set the stage, dim the lights
And baby, seduce me tonight

I wanna be your slave, set me a scene
Take me all the places that I've never been
Never been

Play the leading role, love me till I cry
Let the curtain fall and love me till I die
Till I die

Yeah, seduce me tonight, seduce me tonight
I'll play acts, set the stage, dim the lights
And baby, seduce me tonight

Yeah, seduce me tonight, seduce me tonight, yeah
I'll play acts, set the stage, dim the lights
And baby, seduce me tonight

Seduce me tonight, se-se-seduce me tonight
I'll play acts, set the stage, dim the lights
And baby, seduce me tonight
