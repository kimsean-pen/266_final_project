Say it was your babel
Said it was my babel
It was my babel
Tell all people

Now you know it's over rolling off her shoulder
You can take a ladder to the shadows and forget
Was it how she kissed you and then dismissed you?
Was it purposeful and was it just to hook you in?

Hallucinating
Chasing
Changing
Racing
Breaking
Hating
Till you lost it all
Where was your girlfriend
He was not your man
Where you were going
You are on your own

He was quick to burning
He was slow to learning
Though inside you're misted
He still kissed her when she cried
And did your best to please her
You didn't up and leave her
You befriended the harsh way it ended
Now sleep tight

Hallucinating
Chasing
Changing
Pacing
Bracing
Breaking
?

You wanna be the one that shoots that truth?
I'm not dead
I'm running so far out of my head
This sprain of heart that ripples my day
You can never sail by thinking away
