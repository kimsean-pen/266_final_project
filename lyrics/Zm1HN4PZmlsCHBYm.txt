I still love you
I still want you
I still need you
Don't hang up and say goodbye

Walking on the beach last night and hoping things would be alright
But later lying on her bed, it's you I saw instead
Thinking of the one I love
You know what I'm thinking of
San Francisco days, San Francisco nights

I met a girl in Mexico
And should have told her then I know
That I still think of you
We never will be through
San Francisco days, San Francisco nights
San Francisco days, San Francisco nights

I still love you
I still want you
I still need you
Don't hang up and good-bye

Walking down on Market Street
And feeling my heart skip a beat
To see someone that looks like you
I guess that I'm not through
Dreaming of the one I love
You know what I'm dreaming of
San Francisco days, San Francisco nights

I'm headed for that Golden Gate
And hoping I won't be too late
To find the one that I still love
It's you I'm dreaming of
San Francisco nights
San Francisco days, San Francisco nights
San Francisco days, San Francisco nights
San Francisco days
San Francisco
San Francisco nights
San Francisco
San Francisco
San Francisco
