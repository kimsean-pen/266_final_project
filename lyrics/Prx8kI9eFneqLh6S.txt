Who Could See And Not Believe? The Heart That Beats The Wavelength.
And Who Could Say But Never Do. Things They've Said To Someone Who
Thru All That's Been And All Will Be - So In Line So Thoughfully(Lessly)
In Tune With You. So In Time For Me. New Thoughts Arrive. So In Time For Me.
Who Can Count The Time I'm Beatin... With My Hands?
Who Can Stop The Smoke From Breathin... In My Head?
Words Will Come And Words Will Go. Make Believe And Overthrow.
Just Believe And You Can Do.
You Know My Heart - It Beats For You.
It Beats4u - So In Time We Beat. Your Thoughts Align - So In Time With Me
