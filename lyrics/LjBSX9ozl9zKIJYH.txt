terrified of little
she grabs my hat to settle
uniformed hero
scared of jaggy nettles
incoming sounds
think its heavy metal
cohesive and loud
angels roaring like a lion
on the white and yellow lines
we're standing before
the red line and im thinking
not now
figures standing in the middle
dressed in all yellow
with his hat down and a stop sign
he shouts come now

waterfalls appear in the centrefold
bite your lady with your teeth like an animal
like the desert in the nights it gets cold
to get the credit scan your barcode
the faults of mummy discipline and her comforts
respiratory food and water the constructs
rival siblings technicolour dreamcoats
sister let me have some sugar in my porridge oats
