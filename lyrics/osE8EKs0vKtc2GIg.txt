Blinded by the fire and the sorrow of the day
...
I come knocking at your door
To dry the tears away
The eventide is calling me to take a look into your eyes

...
Pull me on and make me mesmerized!
...
Riding on the wings of light

...
Dreaming dreams and holding tight:
Leaving all my sorrow far behind
Your eyes are the gate

To the land of the miracle
...
Where our love can make us fly, make us fly
...

In the land of the miracle
...
We can find a reason why and how we can fly.
...

Open up the book up madness read the page of life!
...
Who's the one to tell you what to do and how to rise?
...

And if the stars would fall one day I'd climb up the sky
...
To put them back for you to save your smile.
...

Riding on the wings of light
...
Dreaming dreams and holding tight:
Leaving all my sorrow far behind

Your eyes are the gate
...
To the land of the miracle
...
Where our love can make us fly, make us fly
...
In the land of the miracle
...
We can find a reason why and how we can fly.
...
To the land of the miracle
...
Where our love can make us fly, make us fly
...
In the land of the miracle
...
We can find a reason why and how we can fly.

...take a look into the book of fantasy and poetry
...
And you will see: what you can feel is everything
You need to heal your crying mind, the soul behind
And everything that you may find inside your head...
...A million years have passed away to make us head
For the decay and to unlearn just what we yearn
For all day long: right to be strong and stick to
Our ideals, are they for real and do we just have lost the thread?...

...I believe in miracles they happen every day
In your arms a dream comes true for me...

I believe in miracles they happen everyday
In your arms a dream comes true for me...

I believe in miracles they happen everyday
In your arms a dream comes true for me...

I believe in miracles they happen everyday
In your arms a dream comes true for me...

I believe in miracles they happen everyday
In your arms a dream comes true for me...
