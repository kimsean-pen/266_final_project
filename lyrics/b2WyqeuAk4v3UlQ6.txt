Just 'cause you think it,
Don't make it so,
Drop you to drink it,
Won't let you go.

Plenty of girls and boys in love,
Plenty of girls... and boys in love.

Move to the city,
Lose all your heart,
She weren't that pretty,
You ain't too smart.

Plenty of girls and boys in love,
Plenty of girls... and boys in love.

But ain't it a shame,
Woaaaaaaaah ohhhh,
Ain't it a shame,
Woaaaaaaaah ohhhhhh,
Ain't it a shame,
I've let you go,
Plenty of girls... and boys in love.

Plenty of girls... and boys in love. (3x)
