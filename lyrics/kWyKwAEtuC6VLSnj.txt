Don't expect me to make you smile
When I walk in through your door.
Some days I can't smile at all.
I could lose it all
I could lose it all
Grey skies
I can see those clouds again.
Don't wait around all day
I may never show my face.
I came into your life like a ghost
Never left a trace.
Grey skies
Getting ready for the rain.

Don't expect me to make you smile
When I walk in through your door.
Some days I can't smile at all
I could lose it all
I could lose it all
Grey skies
I can see those clouds again.
I came into your life like a ghost.
Never left a trace
Never left a trace
Grey skies
Getting ready for the rain.
Grey skies
