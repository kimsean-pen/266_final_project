The black hole
Forever mine
I need the fear
Push me out
Oh, be brave
Show me signs
Should I feel shame for the questions that I have?

If you could be
The things I need
I'll crawl through knives an inch per tear
These knees they bleed, for you
Let the colour persuade the hate that you fear

Feed the lie
Force the reason
Leave me in doubt need some motivation

It's in my hands, the sky so bright
It's burning, it's for me to decide
If flames will reach heaven tonight
It's in my hands

Nailed to the floor
Paralyzed
Emotions drifting
Touching the new

If you could be
The things I need
I'll crawl through knives an inch per tear
These knees they bleed, for you
Let the colour persuade the hate that you fear

It's in my hands, the sky so bright
It's burning, it's for me to decide
If flames will reach heaven tonight

It's in my hands, the sky so bright
It's burning, it's for me to decide
If flames will reach heaven tonight

It's in my hands, the sky so bright
It's burning, it's for me to decide
If flames will reach heaven tonight
It's in my hands, the sky so bright
It's burning, it's for me to decide
If flames will reach heaven tonight
