Educated with money
He's well dressed not funny
And not much to say in most conversations
But he'll foot the bill in all situations
'Cause he pays for everything

Girls don't like boys
Girls like cars and money

Boys will laugh at girls
When they're not funny
Paper or plastic
Don't matter she'll have it
Vacations and shopping sprees
These are a few of her favorite things

She'll get what she wants if she is willing to please
His type of girl always comes with a fee
Hey now there's nothing for free
Girls don't like boys
Girls like cars and money

Boys will laugh at girls

When they're not funny
And these girls like these boys
Like these boys like these girls
The girls with the bodies like boys with ferraris
Girls don't like boys

Girls like cars and money
...
Girls don't like boys
Girls like cars and money
Boys will laugh at girls
When they're not funny
And these girls like these boys
Like these boys like these girls
The girls with the bodies like boys with ferraris
Girls don't like boys
Girls like cars and money
...
All of these boys and all of the girls are losing their souls
in a material world
All of these boys and all of the girls are losing their souls
in a material world
