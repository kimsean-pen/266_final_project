(R. Pollard)

I am breathing, yet I feel no sky
Things without wings have begun to fly
Unhitched trailers---I see trailers trail
From the well i pull an empty pail
Little man bleeding, little heart beating so
Evil speaker blow my circuits---oh no
Brothers, sisters---all transistors, you know
Father logic sometimes gets cosmic, you know
