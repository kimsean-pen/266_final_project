i thought that you knew it all
well you've seen it ten times before
i thought that you had it down
with both your feet on the ground
i love slow slow but deep
feigned affections wash over me

dream on my dear
and renounce temporal obligations
dream on my dear
it's a sleep from which you may not awaken

you build me up then you knock me down
you play the fool while i play the clown
we keep time to the beat of an old slave drum
you raise my hopes then you raise the odds
you tell me that i dream too much
now i'm serving time in disillusionment

i don't believe you any more i don't believe you
i don't believe you any more i don't believe you

i thought that i knew it all
i'd seen all the signs before
i thought that you were the one
in darkness my heart was won

you build me up then you knock me down
you play the fool while i play the clown
we keep time to the beat of an old slave drum
you raise my hopes then you raise the odds
you tell me that i dream too much
now i'm serving time in a domestic graveyard

never let it be said i was untrue
i never found a home inside of you
never let it be said i was untrue
i gave you all my time i gave you all my time
