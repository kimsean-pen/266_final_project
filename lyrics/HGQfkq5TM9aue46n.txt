Oh, Chloe
I still remember the day that you told me
Got me thinking about the way
That we are, we are, we are
Drifting apart now

Your body's bigger
Lost the figure that you had
Heart is beating like a drum
Soon she's gonna be someone
And I start to shiver
Something 'bout you has changed

Watching you, watching you
Watching you, watching you
Watching you, watching you
Got me thinking 'bout a few things
Watching you wanting to
Feel the things that you do

There's a heart, there's a life
There's a look in your eyes
'Cause I know that you found the answer
There's a doubt in my mind, am I doing it right?
'Cause I don't think I found the answer
Oh, Chloe

Wearing someone else's clothes
Tryna play the biggest shows
Or worry 'bout the radios
Tryna make a house a home
We are, we are, we are, we are, we are
Drifting apart
But I'm still still here for you

Watching you, watching you
Watching you, watching you
Watching you, watching you
Got me thinking 'bout a few things
Watching you wanting to
Feel the things that you do

There's a heart, there's a life
There's a look in your eyes
'Cause I know that you found the answer
There's a doubt in my mind, am I doing it right?
'Cause I don't think I found the answer
Oh, Chloe

Your body's bigger
Little finger like her thumb
Now your body's bigger
Soon she's gonna be someone
Soon she's gonna be someone

There's a heart, there's a life
There's a look in your eyes
'Cause I know that you found the answer
There's a doubt in my mind, am I doing it right?
'Cause I don't think I found the answer
Oh, Chloe
