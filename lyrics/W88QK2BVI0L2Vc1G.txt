See through part of your fragile spell
There's no walls to build
There's no walls to build here
When will you figure
That's what's intended
Don't be condescended

If this what's taking back for more
There's no wrong to go here
When it's forming angles that never existed
Don't know the condition

Forward, forward, it's all here, forward
Forward, it's all here, forward
Reasons you don't explain
And reasons I can't explain
Forward, it's all here, forward
Forward, it's all here, forward
Reasons you don't explain
And reasons I can't explain

What was keeping back from this?
There's no way to get
There's no way to get through it
Nothing to grasp to
Not what I'm used to
Hope that it'll move soon

Silver pair in golden land
There's nowhere to go here
When it's forming angles that never existed
Too precious to leave here

Forward, forward, it's all here, forward
Forward, it's all here, forward
Reasons you don't explain
And reasons I can't explain
Forward, it's all here, forward
Forward, it's all here, forward
Reasons you don't explain
And reasons I can't explain

Don't know what condition
Don't know what condition we're in
Don't know what condition
Don't know what condition we're in
(There's no walls to build here)
Don't know what condition
(There's no walls to build here)
Don't know what condition we're in
(There's no walls to build here)
Don't know what condition
(There's no walls to build here)
Don't know what condition

Forward, it's all here, forward
Forward, it's all here, forward
Reasons you don't explain
And reasons I can't explain
Forward, it's all here, forward
Forward, it's all here, forward
Reasons you don't explain
And reasons I can't explain

There's no walls to build here
There's no walls to build here
There's no walls to build here
There's no walls to build here
