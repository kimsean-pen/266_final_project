I can tell when you are not around
I don't mind, 'cause I can be there on my own
On my own
Somehow I just need to figure out
Who you are, 'cause I can't seem to let that go
And I have to know

Can I be the light in your eyes?
Can I be a bird in your sky?
I cannot tell what you are
I cannot tell what you are
Can I be the light in your eyes?
Can I be a bird in your sky?
I cannot tell what you are

So take what's mine
Baby, look right into my eyes
Can we go further than the sky?
Be mine, be mine, be mine
Be mine

Pa-da-pa-da-pa, pa-da-pa-da-pa-da
Pa-da-pa-da-pa, pa-da-pa, pa-da-pa-da-pa-da-da

Felt so right when you were by my side
Now that I can hear, I wonder who am I
Who am I?
Darling, I am longing, can't you see?
Everywhere I run, you're still a part of me
Now I cannot breathe

Can I be the light in your eyes?
Can I be a bird in your sky?
I cannot tell what you are

So take what's mine
Baby, look right into my eyes
Can we go further than the sky?
Be mine, be mine, be mine
Be mine

Pa-da-pa-da-pa, pa-da-pa-da-pa-da
Pa-da-pa-da-pa, pa-da-pa, pa-da-pa-da-pa-da-da
Pa-da-pa-da-pa, pa-da-pa-da-pa-da
Pa-da-pa-da-pa, pa-da-pa, pa-da-pa-da-pa-da-da
Pa-da-pa-da-pa, pa-da-pa-da-pa-da
Pa-da-pa-da-pa, pa-da-pa, pa-da-pa-da-pa-da-da

You can be the darkness, I can be the light
We can try whatever it is what we are
You could be the darkness, I could be the light
We can try whatever it is what we are
What we are, what we are

So take what's mine
Baby, look right into my eyes
Can we go further than the sky?
Be mine, be mine, be mine
Be mine
