The sparrows tend to fall asleep
The wind doesn't speak to me no more
The water that becomes to sea
It holds me until I can't breathe at all

I dream of things I've never seen
The sunlight doesn't wait for me now
My demons, they walk with me
They tell me that I let you down

You were just a heartbeat, yet to come alive
Just two feet, yet to stand upright
Was just three times we cried that night
'Cause it was four months until you arrived
And though I'll never be able to describe
How you were born with your mother's eyes
And how your hands felt when they met mine
And how Luke thinks we look alike

If I'm wed, I'd tell her she's beautiful
And that I think she should smile more
You'd never know, but she misses you
More than anyone she's known
And though I'll never get to recognize your voice
On the other line when you've grown
And made me proud to call you mine

I still know you
I still know you

You were just a heartbeat, yet to come alive
Just two feet, yet to stand upright
Was just three times we cried that night
'Cause it was four months until you arrived
And though I'll never be able to describe
How you were born with your mother's eyes
And how your hands felt when they met mine
And how Luke thinks we look alike

I'll keep you safe inside my mind
As I try to say goodbye
There was more than one heart that stopped that night
If I'm honest
I'll keep you safe inside my mind
As I try to say goodbye
There was more than one heart that stopped that night
If I'm honest

You were just a heartbeat, yet to come alive
Just two feet, yet to stand upright
Was just three times we cried that night
'Cause it was four months until you arrived
And though I'll never be able to describe
How you were born with your mother's eyes
And how your hands felt when they met mine
And how I'll always feel like
I still know you
I still know you
I still know you
I still know you

I will keep you safe inside my mind
As I try to say goodbye
There was more than one heart that stopped that night
I'm so sorry
