I'm hollowed out where a bright crux used to be
I'm shredding my skin like you wouldn't believe
I couldn't help myself I just needed to grieve
While I lived vacant in a memory

Backtrack never thought I'd ever be back
Think fast never thought I'd ever be last
I'm selfish with time it's my only worth
Step back cuz I'm feeling really outmatched
Forced in while I'm dealing with the contrast
You're far from me that's hard for me tread carefully

I'm tongue tied inside
with a little bit of lust mixed in to mold myself this solitude
I live in Pretend
like I'm never gonna need a friend again
I'll keep myself intact

Drift away to a place that's not so harrowing
To the back plate of my mind, digging up what's left to find
With the bar set way to high for me I'm bound to sink uncomfortably

I'm tongue tied inside
with a little bit of lust mixed in to mold myself this solitude
I live in Pretend
like I'm never gonna need a friend again
I'll keep myself intact

I'm tongue tied inside
with a little bit of lust mixed in to mold myself this solitude
I live in Pretend
like I'm never gonna need a friend again
I'll keep myself intact
