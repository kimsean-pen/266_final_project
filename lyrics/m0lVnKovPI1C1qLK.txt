Now I know
You've been cheatin' and lyin' all the time
I didn't know
You were gonna be so unkind
I've been trying
Just to find out how we went wrong
But I know
That I can't trust you girl anymore

Chorus:
Rip it out
Take my heart
You wanted it
From the start
You got it now
So goodbye
So rip it out
Watch me cry

It's so sad
I'm that glad to be with you today
And it's bad
'Cause I can't stop the pain day by day
If I knew
How to stop you, I don't think I'd try
I think it's better
If we just part and don't say goodbye

Rip it out
Take my heart
You wanted it
From the start
You got it now
So goodbye
So rip it out
Watch me cry

I hope you suffer!

Rip it out
Take my heart
You wanted it
From the start
You got it now
So goodbye
So rip it out
Watch me cry
Rip it out
Take my heart
You wanted it
From the start
You got it now
So goodbye
So rip it out
Watch me cry
Rip it out
Rip it out
Rip it out
Rip it out
Rip it out
Rip it out
Rip it out
