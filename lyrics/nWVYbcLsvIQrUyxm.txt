Darlin', my dreams are trouble again.
You're my friend, I know this,
I shan't forget again.
Wherever sun shines, that's where we will go,
We'll brave the sleet, the hail, the rain, the snow.
You've opened up my eyes, I no longer lie in the dark;
I'm afraid of everything.
Shadows loom in my heart and gather in my soul.
I know our kind of closeness is worlds apart.
On the bridge I fell worse than Niagara Falls.
Somehow you heard my cries. Whenever pigeons fly
In darkness, stars are born,
Forgive me my misfortune, forgive the fools I mourn.
I know you flew the highest in fields of corn.
I pray with all my might from dark 'till dawn.
Don't know how you heard my prayers,
I've never been so scared in my life.
The moon is my alibi,
The only witness to myself when I gaze in the sky.
I know you shone the brightest I won't deny
This one truth.
You've opened up my eyes, I no longer must rely on my dreams
Are all in color again.
