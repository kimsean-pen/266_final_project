Follow the light
Down the tunnel.
Just know, I'll be waiting.
I'll be waiting for you.
Follow the light
Down the tunnel.
Just know, I'll be waiting.
I'll be waiting for you.
Learn to forget is what they tell me to.
Destroy the past and start new.
I'd rather fade away than be dreaming awake.
Have you ever laid on your back at night?
Stared into darkened corners and seen the faces of the dead alive?
Apparitions of a tormented mind.
Let the light take my soul
I'm ready to let go.
Lower my body below.
Beyond the sky is home.
Follow the light
Down the tunnel.
Just know, I'll be waiting.
I'll be waiting for you.
When they take me, I will be happy.
And when they take me, I will be happy.
I won't fear the touch of death
To see you standing next to me.
Let the light take my soul,
I'm ready to let go.
Lower my body below.
Beyond the sky is home.
Let the light take my soul,
I'm ready to let go.
Lower my body below.
Beyond the sky is home.
A memory is not enough!
When the light of day fades
My soul will drift away.
And I'll promise you, I'll meet you at the gates.
When the light of day fades
My soul will drift away.
And I'll promise you, I'll meet you at the gates.
When the light of day fades
My soul will drift away.
And I'll promise you, I'll meet you at the gates.
When the light of day fades
My soul will drift away.
And I'll promise you, I'll meet you at the gates.
When the light of day fades
My soul will drift away.
And I promise you, I'll meet you at the gates.
