Black is the sunlight shimmering below;
It flows through life and the guilt we share
Our sorrow, it cuts through the undergrowth,
As we abandon this ravenous Earth alone

The zeitgeist dimmed the surface and seized the soul
Our Mother wept behind the fence,
And we drained her blood, then forgetting her face,
And hide from everyone...

To breathe, to conquer,
To linger, to utilize the ignorant herd

In rapture from nature we divorce,
Like orphans by desire,
From this closing light

The bewildered sleep -
The shadowy voyager is lurking;
He's in the flesh of landscapes vaporous
The vacant, untiring Sovran of old...
He's the machinery; igniting the paralyzed soil

We took the blood of the earth
And fell in love with death
With life itself as an excuse

Black is the sunlight shimmering below;
It flows through life and the guilt we share

We're hiding in chorus as starry eyes close,
And seasons part in farewell;
'cause we drained her blood, then forgetting her face
To hide from everyone

The bewildered sleep -
The shadowy voyager is lurking;
He's in the flesh of landscapes vaporous
The vacant, untiring Sovran of old...
He's the machinery; igniting the paralyzed soil
