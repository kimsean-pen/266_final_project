We're only dirt of the road
Dust in the wind, leaves in the breeze
'Cause we are supersonic
Supersonic, supersonic

Life is a book where all the pages
Tell the stories many different ways
Who's the writer of your story?
Is it nightmare or fairytale?
You must have to choose

Too much we talk about just loneliness
Anxiety, depression
You know the feel of emptiness
You're broken, broken, can't find a way
Sometimes the pills don't work

We should be writing, writing, writing, writing
Writing our poetry
We have to dive in, dive in, dive in, dive in
Dive into deep blue sea

We love flying, flying, flying like wind
'Cause we are supersonic, 'cause we are supersonic
We are jumping, jumping, jumping to dreams
'Cause we are supersonic, we are supersonic

Hear the sound of the woods
Watch the rise of the day
Why do we stop only then
When blue horizon fades away?
We have time to choose

We should be writing, writing, writing, writing
Writing our poetry
We have to dive in, dive in, dive in, dive in
Dive into deep blue sea

We love flying, flying, flying like wind
'Cause we are supersonic, 'cause we are supersonic
We are jumping, jumping, jumping to dreams
'Cause we are supersonic, we are supersonic

When you are young, you are proud, we all rebel and yell
Do you recognise yourself when you're getting older?
Do we crash? Do we learn? Do we sing our songs
Louder and louder?

We should be writing, writing, writing, writing
Writing our poetry
We have to dive in, dive in, dive in, dive in
Dive into deep blue sea

We love flying, flying, flying like wind
'Cause we are supersonic, 'cause we are supersonic
We are jumping, jumping, jumping to dreams
'Cause we are supersonic, we are supersonic
