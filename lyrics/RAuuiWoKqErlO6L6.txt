Some were reborn,
Some were simply shaken free,
And some were the colors
That took to the streets.

They found in those later years
They knew what we need
It's love for each other,
And every living thing.

And all my time, (All my time...)
Is used,
It's all my only and lonely time too.

Some simply shaken free,
Some were the colors,
That took through the streets.

They thought in those younger years,
They knew what to do.
They knew what to say,
Had nothing to lose.

Now pick up and pack up
The place you were pink,
And falling around.
Dripping and crawling and
Clawing and inside,
You're missing some sounds.

The ones that float, carry
And dance about time,
And space that it lends.
Room to be free
Like the sun and the moon,
Save for the sounds.

Take from the air, take to the streets, and I.
Take from the air, take to the streets, and I.
Take from the air, take to the streets, and I.
Take from the air, take to the streets, and I.

We'll be reborn,
We'll simply be free,
And we'll be the colors
That pour through the streets.

And find in our after years
That we're all, we're all the same.
We're all made of colors
And pour through the streets.

Take from the air, take to the streets, and I.
Take from the air, take to the streets, and I.
Take from the air, take to the streets, and I.
Take from the air, take to the streets, and I.
Take from the air, take to the streets, and I.
Take from the air, take to the streets, and I.
