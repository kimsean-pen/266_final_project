I've been around the World - hey hey
I've been around the World - hey hey

In the kitchen where I'm cooking what is good for me
Spices from the Globe
Little by little is the finest meal
It's half the type for hope
Come and see

You mix it all together in your dreams
Ingredients from the Seven Seas, and I
I'm realizing things ain't what they seem
That's the riddle of it
That's the spirit of it
That's the power of life

I've been around the World - round the world
And I've seen it all - seen it all
I've been around the World - round the world
'Cause the wind will always rise or fall

I've been around the World - round the world
And I wanted to see - see it all
I've been the only girl - round the world
All surrounded by mystery

In the living room I'm cleaning up from top to floor
Place I love the most
Wall is covered up with all my souvenirs
I got from coast to coast
Come and see

You mix it all together in Your dreams
Ingredients from the Seven Seas, and I
I'm realizing things ain't what they seem
That's the riddle of it
That's the spirit of it
That's the power of life

I've been around the World - round the world
And I've seen it all - seen it all
I've been around the World - round the world
'Cause the wind will always rise or fall

I've been around the World - round the world
And I wanted to see - see it all
I've been the only girl - round the world
All surrounded by mystery

I'm still coming around
I keep chasing dreams
Girl I keep coming around
Hey hey

I keep coming around
And I can never stop
Girl I keep coming around
'Cause if I do a lot

Around around
And around the World

I've been around the World - round the world
Hey hey - seen it all
I've been around the World - round the world
All surrounded by mystery

I've been around the World - round the world
And I've seen it all - seen it all
I've been around the World - round the world

Sun will always rise and fall - round the world
