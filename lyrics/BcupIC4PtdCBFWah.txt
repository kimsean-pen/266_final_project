Under the ocean
Next to a boiling vent
He's none the wiser
Earth's only resident

It piled up
Man, it was wall to wall
Blink of an eye
And all the problems solved

Let's all go play Nagasaki
We can all get vaporised
Hold my hand, let's turn to ash
I'll see you on the other side

Before the garden
When you were all alone
You made the atom
Was that some inside joke

Open the gates
And then conceal the path
Let's load the gun
And see how long they last

Let's go ring and run the bunkers
Baby won't you come outside?
Across the sea the birds are free
Let's watch them scream across the sky

Let's all go and meet our maker
They don't care whose side you're on
We're so afraid, I prayed and prayed
Before I learned to love the bomb

Let's all go play Nagasaki
What a lovely way to die
To finally show where we all go
So no one has to say goodbye

Lets all go and meet our maker
Won't matter whose side you're on
We're so afraid, I prayed and prayed
When God told me to love the bomb
