One day, yes, one day less to live
I want you to be my sedative
Sometimes when I drive my car
I feel trapped like a bee inside a jar

Grains of sand is all we are
Crawling on our manic star
One tiny person
In one shiny car
Spinning on our manic star

Time doesn't stop for anyone
It doesn't matter what you've done
I want to lose myself in you
Are you afraid of dying too?

Grains of sand is all we are
Crawling on our manic star
One tiny person
In one shiny car
Calling from our manic star

Let's love like there is no tomorrow
Shelter each other from the pain and sorrow

Grains of sand is all we are
Crawling on our manic star
One tiny person
In one shiny car

Don't know how I got this scar
Crawling on our manic star
I'm all right, at least so far
Hanging on our manic star

Spinning on our manic star
Calling from our manic star
