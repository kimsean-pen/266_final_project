Betrayed and forgotten
Erased and led astray
Retribution
When the core has rotted
It begins to erode away
Execution
Suffer in pain
You can not evade

Turning your back on the bond we've made
You've dug your own grave
And now your terror is mine to shape
I'll watch you die afraid

Tidal waves
They're washing me far away
Islands of misery
Can't escape
Disintegrate what we've made
Shattered trust cutting deep

On these islands of misery
On these islands of misery

Turning your back on the bond we've made
You've dug your own grave
And now your terror is mine to shape
I'll watch you die afraid

Tidal waves
They're washing me far away
Islands of misery
Can't escape
Disintegrate what we've made
Shattered trust cutting deep

There is no life left in these bones
Emptiness has swallowed me whole
There is no light within this soul
Emptiness has swallowed me whole

Turning your back on the bond we've made
You've dug your own grave
And now your terror is mine to shape
I'll watch you die afraid

Tidal waves
They're washing me far away
Islands of misery
Can't escape
Disintegrate what we've made
Shattered trust cutting deep

Tidal waves
They're washing me far away
Islands of misery
Can't escape
Disintegrate what we've made
Shattered trust cutting deep

On these islands of misery
On these islands of misery
