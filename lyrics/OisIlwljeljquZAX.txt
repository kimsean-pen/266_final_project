Suck my cockiness
Lick my persuasion
Eat my words then
Swallow your pride down, down

Place my wants and needs
Over your resistance
And then you come around
You come around
You come around

I want you to be my sex slave
Anything that I desire
Be one with my femin-ay
Set my whole body on fire

They mad at Rihanna game
Taking over your empire
She may be the queen of hearts
But I'm gonna be the queen of your body parts

No one can do ya
The way that I do
Boy I wa-a-ant

(Youuuuuu)
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it

I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it

Suck my cockiness
Lick my persuasion
Eat my poison
And swallow your pride down, down

Place my wants and needs
Over your resistance
And then you come around
You come around
You come around

I can be your dominatrix
Just submit to my every order
Enter my diamond matrix
If you want my golden flower

Make me your priority
There's nothing above my pleasure
She may be the queen of hearts
But I'm gonna be the queen of your body parts

No one can do ya
The way that I do
Boy I wa-a-ant

(Youuuuuuuu)
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it

I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it

Homie don't beat it like a bullet
Beat my drum drum
Like a drum line boogie
(I love it when you)

Dive head first if you wanna
Sing to my body
Hold me tight mister lover
(I love it when you)

Do it like I do it
Like I said
Keep it up, boy
We can do this all day
Be my Harlem
And me St. Tropez
Never found nobody
That will do it this way

No one can do ya
The way that I do
Boy I wa-a-ant

(Youuuuuu)
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it

I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
