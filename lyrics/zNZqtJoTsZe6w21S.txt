We're getting old now (We're getting old now)
But I don't feel it (But I don't feel it)
I say you're beautiful (I say you're beautiful)
And I still mean it (And I still mean it)
And I don't wanna know (And I don't wanna know)
What old age feels like (What old age feels like)
So promise me you won't (So promise me you won't)
Give up on this life (Give up on this life)

And we'll be busy tryin'
While the rest of them are dyin'

Promise me we'll never grow up
I don't wanna let go
I wanna stay young
And even when the wrinkles show up
We'll be laughing, and
We can play forever
Don't make me face the truth

I think it's obvious
That we'll stay happy
'Cause I'm the happiest ('Cause I'm the happiest)
When you smile at me
And we won't end the same
A broken family
I'll never walk away
Without you with me

And times are getting harder
But I'm nothing like my father

Promise me we'll never grow up
I don't wanna fall out
I wanna make love
And even when we can't, so what?
We're together, and
Happy ever after
Don't make me face the truth

That I'm dying soon
That we're dying

Don't say goodbye (When did we get so old, so old, so old?)
We're so much older...
All I want is one more life with you
When did we get so old?
Why'd you get so sick?
And how could you die?

You promised me you'd never grow up
Now I have to let go
God, I miss you so much
And even when your heart gave out
I was thinkin' how
I won't say goodbye

You promised me you'd never grow up
But you fucking grew up
God, I miss you so much
And even when your heart gave out
I was thinkin' I'd
Love you 'til forever
And I can't face the truth

That I died with you
That you lied (That you died...)
You died
