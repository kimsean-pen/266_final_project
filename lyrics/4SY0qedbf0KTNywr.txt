Do you think that we'll change when we're older?
Say five years time
Don't you think the world feels so much colder
Without our love

You couldn't play it by the rules
I was cheated, I was beaten by your hand
If I were a fool
I would treat you how you probably deserve it
But baby you're worth this

Wanted to be stronger to see clearer to be bolder
But that weren't me
Maybe we should stay here it'll get better
Well I was wrong

You couldn't play it by the rules
I was cheated, I was beaten by your hand
If I were a fool
I would treat you how you probably deserve it
But baby you're worth this
I want you to promise to

Take good care of yourself
Put those troubles to bed
You should be so proud of yourself
Know the time that we spent together was good
Together was good

Take good care of yourself
Put those troubles to bed
You should be so proud of yourself
Know the time that we spent together was good
Together was good

Do you think that we'll change when we're older?
Say five years time
Don't you think the world feels so much colder
Without our love
