We are lost on the sea of mystery
And when the night is getting darker
See a light it might just get us out alive
One by one they've torn our dreams apart!
One last time they say they tainted mine

When empty oceans at souls
We will sing from the top of our voices

We are the sun and the sea and the mountain
We are the children who still can believe
We have faith we have hope we have answers
In our heart is where we are free

So stand alone in the ash of the shadow
We can't deny within the dream shallow through
We will guide you and the days where you feel lost
So after all this shit you're mine
I see the others staring back

It seems to me that the only way to get through this tonight
Is with hope and building dreams
So make believe that we'll build it up brick by fucking brick
This world wont tear us down

Listen up young hearts this world is your
Don't stop believing, don't yell scared
Have faith in yourself and I'll promise
That these anchors won't pull us down

We are the sun and the sea and the mountain
We are the children who still can believe
We have faith we have hope we have answers
In our heart is where we are free!

Just save yourself.
Just save yourself.
