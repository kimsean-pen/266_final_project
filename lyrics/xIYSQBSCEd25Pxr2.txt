Lord have mercy, I've fallen in love with you
I can't keep my hands to myself, baby, I'm so screwed
I'm tongue tied and twisted, whenever you're alone with me
And then you said, as sweet as can be
Baby, baby, baby

Shut up & kiss me
Shut up and kiss me

Oo-wee, baby, you set my soul on fire
You got my temperature rising, I'm full of hot, burning desire
I'm tongue tied and twisted, it's all a bit too much
I lose control of my heart and soul
Baby, when I feel your touch
Shut up and kiss me

Shut up and kiss me
Shut up and kiss me
Whatever you want, whatever you need, baby
Shut up and kiss me
If I gotta beg, if I gotta plead, baby

When you stand close to me
I can feel your body heat, so sweet
Shut up and kiss me

Ooh, when you stand close to me
Ooh, I can feel your body heat, so sweet
Shut up and kiss me

Whatever you want, whatever you need, baby
Shut up and kiss me
If I gotta beg, if I gotta plead, baby
Shut up and kiss me
Whatever you want, whatever you need, baby
Shut up and kiss me
Sweet satisfaction is guaranteed, baby
Shut up and kiss me

Woo-hoo-hoo
Woo-hoo-hoo
Shut up and kiss me
Woo-hoo-hoo
Woo-hoo-hoo, ow
