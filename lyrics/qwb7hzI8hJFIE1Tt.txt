Stranger in a crowd
Treading fire after dark
Lost in a city
Pulsing to the sound
Of the spirit and soul
A city that is breathing
Living through the cables
Alive across the wires
Faces without names
Playing devils and angels
Lit up by the strobes
Moving hypnotized
I caught your reflection
In the neon on glass
An electric silhouette
Against a static sky

It's a beautiful dream
It's a beautiful life
It's just a reflection
A world I must survive
We're children of the past
Who look beyond today
Designing the present
So when is the future

We live in a dream
Keeping visions alive
It's just a reflection
A world that never dies
The image we create
Now image we designed
It's a beautiful life
So when is the future

Time moves so fast
In a single direction
Fighting with the present
Racing from the past
We're searching for something
That can never satisfy
The reality of answers
When lives are on the line
I've waited a lifetime
For the age of wonder
A place that I remember
In a splinter of time
A stranger in a strange land
Caught in the flow
Still searching for answers
Among the neon lights

It's a beautiful dream
It's a beautiful life
It's just a reflection
A world we must survive
We're children of the past
Who look beyond today
Designing the present
So when is the future

We live in a dream
Keeping visions alive
It's just a reflection
A world that never dies
The image we create
Now image we designed
It's a beautiful life
So when is the future

It's a beautiful dream
It's a beautiful life
It's just a reflection
A world that must survive
We're children of the past
Who look beyond today
Designing the present
So when is the future

We live in a dream
Keeping visions alive
It's just a reflection
A world that never dies
The image we create
Now image we designed
It's a beautiful life
So when is the future
