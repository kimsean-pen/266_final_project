I'm the devil's son, straight out of hell and you're an angel, with a haunted heart.
If you're smart, you'd run and protect yourself, from the demon, living in the dark.
There's nothing to be gained, 'cause I can never change and you can never understand, my sickness.
(I'll never understand my sickness).

Save yourself, from a life, full of lies and a heart full of pain and sorrow!
Save yourself, from the choices, I make, 'cause nothing but failure follows me.
Save yourself, save yourself!

You're the perfect drug, when it hurts like hell, I've never needed, anyone so much
There's no-one else I love and I curse myself, 'cause the right thing is to give you up.
I'm overcome by shame, 'cause I can never change and you can never understand, my sickness.
(I'll never understand my sickness).

Save yourself, from a life, full of lies and a heart full of pain and sorrow!
Save yourself, from the choices, I make, 'cause nothing but failure follows me
Save yourself, from a life, full of lies and a heart full of pain and sorrow!
Save yourself, from the choices, I make, 'cause nothing but failure follows me, save yourself!

You'll never understand, my sickness (I'll never understand, my sickness).
'Cause I don't understand, my sickness (I'll never understand, my sickness).

Save yourself, from a life, full of lies and a heart full of pain and sorrow!
Save yourself, from the choices, I make, 'cause nothing but failure follows me
Save yourself, from a life, full of lies and a heart full of pain and sorrow!
Save yourself, from the choices, I make, 'cause nothing but failure follows me.
Save yourself, save yourself!
