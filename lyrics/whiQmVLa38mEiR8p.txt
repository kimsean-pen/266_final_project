Learn to be a stranger
Blond on blond
In silence she says..."excalibur"
I beg of you now
What was it that fell
Was it...

One fallen leaf
Like the feather that it was
Was... freedom by choice
Or baby... was it love
Was it a thorn in your side
Something that you hide
Something you don't touch
Because it hurts too much
Ooo...

Well... have you come to see
That my face is not seen
Ooo... outside my frost covered windows
Oh and just how deep...
Do you hold that dream
In your hands each night... this time
In your hands each night... this time

Oh was it you...
I heard calling... which voice
Well I know that you are going
Which voice...
Did I force you to remember
In the sacred name of love...

To be brave save the stranger
Sable on blond...
Dark upon light...
Because it hurts too much
Just how deep
Do you hold that dream
In your hands each night
In your hands each night
In your hands each night

Ooh... I beg of you now
What was it that fell
Well this time I think it was you babe
This time
Ooo... well I think it was you babe
This time
Ooo... well I think that it was you baby
This time...
