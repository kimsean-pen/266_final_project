When I step onto the stage, see the curtain raise
I'm apparent, I've got someone to play
All the crowd, they're in the seats
Looking straight at me for an answer
They just get what they see
They applaud and the usher's locking the door till the matinee

So I get to know the cast, though it doesn't last
I'm a pro but I won't take it too far
Now I know I shouldn't get comfy on the set
Every time it all comes down when we end
That's the truth that the stage school doesn't teach you
But it's good to know

It takes much more than just learning the script
You see, you gotta take the part and believe it
Oh, I sometimes make up all of my lines on the spot
But I will always give what I got

I thought I was only acting
But I felt exactly like it was all for real
I sure didn't know it hurt so bad
That no rehearsal could show you how to feel inside
What you gotta hide
Where to put your pride
When to realize you've had your time
Find another role
Carry on the show

You should be able to feel a performance with your whole body and soul
Now I'm going to teach you everything
And you, and you, and you, and you

Oh, I sometimes make up all of my lines on the spot
But I will always give what I got

I thought I was only acting
But I felt exactly like it was all for real
I sure didn't know it hurt so bad
That no rehearsal could show you how to feel inside
What you gotta hide
Where to put your pride
When to realize you've had your time
Find another role
Carry on the show

I thought I was only acting
But I felt exactl-exactl-exactl-exactl-exactl
What you gotta hi-
How to feel inside
What you gotta hide
Find another role
