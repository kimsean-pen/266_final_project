My, my, my, my, my heart, heart
My, my heart, heart
My, my heart, heart, heart

My heart booms at the speed of light
But the exit signs always on my mind, always in my sight

I can say that I, really want to stay
But the devil inside always wins the fight, always gets his way

Jump out the window gotta get out on the highway
When things are getting too attached, I need an escape
I'm seeing stars and there is nothing more that I hate, baby

There's something that I gotta say

It's disgusting, how I love you
I can't take it, I should hate you
'Cause your messing up my name
Gotta walk my talk my fame
But I just want to touch your face
It's disgusting

It's disgusting, how you changed me
From a bandit to a baby
Thinking I might gotta change my name
I'm gonna walk this walk of shame
Look at what you do to me
It's disgusting

My mind blinks like a traffic light
It's green and red and stop and go, changing all the time
And it makes me scared, that I haven't left
That it's still right here more or, or, or less

Jump out in traffic, yeah, I gotta go my own way
My head is slipping too intense, I need an escape
I'm seeing starts and there is nothing more that hate, baby

There's something that I gotta say

It's disgusting, how I love you
I can't take it, I should hate you
'Cause your messing up my name
Gotta walk my talk my fame
But I just want to touch your face
It's disgusting

It's disgusting, how you changed me
From a bandit to a baby
Thinking I might gotta change my name
I'm gonna walk this walk of shame
Look at what you do to me
It's disgusting

(My, my, my, my, my heart, heart)
(D-d-d-disgusting)
(My, my, heart, heart, heart)
(My, my, my, my, my heart, heart, heart)
(D-d-d-disgusting)
(My, my, heart, heart, heart)

Chapter by chapter
I'm falling faster and faster
Becoming manic and magic
It's so romantic I panic, oh

Hit the eject button but
It must be stuck somethings up
I'm drifting now right over that brink, baby

It's disgusting, how I love you
I can't take it, I should hate you
'Cause your messing up my name
Gotta walk my talk my fame
But I just want to touch your face
It's disgusting

It's disgusting, how you changed me
From a bandit to a baby
Thinking I might gotta change my name
I'm gonna walk this walk of shame
Look at what you do to me
It's disgusting

Look at what you do to me
It's disgusting
