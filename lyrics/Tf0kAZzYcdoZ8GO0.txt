As I stepped out me house I saw this man named Clyde
He took me by the hand saying I'll take you for a ride
I said I cannot go there there are things to get done
He said boy you must, 'cause I ain't got a son

There's a little secret no one should know
Deep into the forest we both gotta go
I show you the way I earn my daily bread
But dare not to reveal it or you gonna loose your head

I make barrels of whiskey, it ain't no champagne
It's served in our brothels to keep away the pain
What I share with you my lad
Is the biggest secret I've ever had

I make barrels of whiskey, it ain't no champagne
It's served in our brothels to keep away the pain

See the soldiers at war, on the battlefield
They've got more than a gun, my whiskey is their shield
Look at the crippled and wounded down the street
A passport to hell and a bottle to their feet
You don't leave a child or a sweetheart behind
This is our secret vow so boy don't be blind

I make barrels of whiskey, it ain't no champagne
It's served in our brothels to keep away the pain

What I share with you my lad
Is the biggest secret I've ever had
I make barrels of whiskey, it ain't no champagne
It's served in our brothels to keep away the pain
What I share with you my lad
What I share with you

I make barrels of whiskey, it ain't no champagne
It's served in our brothels to keep away the pain
What I share with you my lad
Is the biggest secret I've ever had
I make barrels of whiskey, it ain't no champagne
It's served in our brothels to keep away the pain
