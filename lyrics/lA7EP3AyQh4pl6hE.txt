It's tearing away,
Tearing a hole in me,
They say find your way,
But I can't see anything.
And I'll be just fine.

Fear and doubt,
I've found found a place for these,
They say figure it out,
you dont know anything.

I want to be free again,
To feel again, to dream
And one day, I hope I say,

I'm finally okay,
I'm finally okay,
I'm finally okay,
With who I am today.

Par for the course,
Met with their empathy,
Unreciprocated
Cause I don't feel anything.

But you'll see again,
Believe again,
In me.
And one day, I know I'll say.

I'm finally okay,
I'm finally okay,
I'm finally okay,
With who I am today.

Time after time I'll just pick up the pieces,
To be free again, to feel again.
Time after time I'll just pick up what's left,
You'll see again, believe again.

I'm finally okay,
I'm finally okay,
I'm finally okay,
With who I am today.
