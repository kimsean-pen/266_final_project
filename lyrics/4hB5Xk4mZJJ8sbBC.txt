I'm on the corner
waiting for a light to come on
That's when I know that you're alone
It's cold in the desert

water never sees the ground
special unspoken without sound
you told me you loved me
that I'd never die alone

Hand over your heart, let's go home
Everyone noticed
everyone has seen the signs
I've always been known to cross lines

I never ever
Cried when I was feeling down
I've always been scared of the sound
Jesus don't love me, no one ever carried my load
I'm too young to feel this old
Here's to you
Here's to me
on yo us
Nobody knows
Nobody sees
Nobody but me
