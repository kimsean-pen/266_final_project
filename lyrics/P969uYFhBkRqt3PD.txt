Brothers of war, we stand tall on the edge of our land
In this riverbed we draw the line

Blood is thicker than this frozen water we stand upon
Ice beneath our feet
Hellfire burns within

With bravery and valor
With hatred and rage
Our might lies not in numbers

Few against a legion
Few against the horde
With ferocious force we go forth

With our steel
We strike them down
Blood paints the ground
Red frozen soil

Crimson moon will rise
No silvery light
We strike them down
To the red frozen ground

May the earth tremble as they march
And their arrows blacken the sky

Drain the strength from the fear
Burn with wrath, scorch and sear
Blood we'll shed apart we tear
