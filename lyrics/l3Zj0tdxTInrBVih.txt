Stay Forever

Silence in the living room
Hours feel like days
Silence when I speak to you
Your thoughts seem miles away
My euphoria
Oh yes, you're worth the price
Because when my mind gets clouded
I forget about our fights

Stay forever is never again
Our words have been spoken
It will come to an end
Stay forever is never again
Our words have been spoken
It will come to an end

Artificial energy
Running through my veins
Chemical the love I feel
For faces without names
My euphoria
Oh yes, you're worth the price
Because when my mind gets clouded
I forget about our fights

Stay forever is never again
Our words have been spoken
It will come to an end
Stay forever is never again
Our words have been spoken
It will come to an end

This empty house is not a home
Find the will to stand alone
Without your armor
Flesh and blood have turned to stone
Find the will to stand alone
Too late to turn away

Stay forever is never again
Our words have been spoken
It will come to an end
Stay forever is never again
Our words have been spoken
It will come to an end

Stay Forever
Stay Forever
