It hurts
Because you're growing
You can't escape
Patterns keep you going

I'm on codeine
Suffer to dream
In the most caring way
I am defined
By the endeared

Do you see the soul syncable?
Do you see the soul syncable?

The most came from
Another
Although it hurts
The most painful is when it allows
To hurt yourself

I'm on codeine
Suffer to dream
In the most caring way
I am defined
By the endeared

See, see the soul syncable
Do you see the soul syncable?
Do you see the soul syncable?
