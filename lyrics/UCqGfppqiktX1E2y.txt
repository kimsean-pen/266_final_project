My body is a cage
This union is a cage
About a cage, about a cage
And this, and this town too
I'll see you once in a while but I can't be seen with you
This place is a narrative mess
A floor of tangle of bedsheets and battered sundress
The ink has dried in the well
The journey once was consequential
You're sequential
Sequential

When will you silence your hounds?
The eldest sons to the alter of the Eternal Sound

Their blood is spilled at the dawn
A nation bound to your will
Still a violin plays on

Plays its devotional song
Once it was, once it was so essential
You're sequential
