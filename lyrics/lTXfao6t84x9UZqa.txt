I know you better than you think I do
You coulda stuck with me
But I guess a girl's gotta do what she has to
Every now and then, my name passes your lips
Your late night stroll down a memory lane
On your, your finger tips

Do you miss me so much?

Feeling like I hypnotised you
Feel a burning deep inside you
The only thing that satisfies
You miss me so much
And now you're burning with that old flame
Yearning for my old game
You tremble when you hear my name
You miss me so much
Well, that's too bad

And we go together like a hand and gun
Squeeze off a couple rounds
Put me away 'til next time you wanna hurt someone
Every now and then, you like to empty your clip, no no
Then I go right under your belt on your hip

Do you miss me so much?

Feeling like I hypnotised you
Feel a burning deep inside you
The only thing that satisfies
You miss me so much
And now you're burning with that old flame
Yearning for my old game
You tremble when you hear my name
You miss me so much
Well, that's too bad
Too bad
Too bad

Feeling like I hypnotised you
Feel a burning deep inside you
The only thing that satisfies
You miss me so much
And now you're burning with that old flame
Yearning for my old game
You tremble when you hear my name
You miss me so much, so much
And you miss me
Well, that's too bad
