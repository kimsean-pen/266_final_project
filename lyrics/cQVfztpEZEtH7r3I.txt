You walked in and said "I've got some news"
I didn't say all I wanted to
You know I told you that I wasn't scared,
but I lied!
You told me baby, I only think of you
And I said all I've got is a bunch of sad stories
And I told them all before the night was through
And you cried, oh,
But hear now
That I'm trying hard to make you love me,
but I don't wanna try too hard
And I'm trying hard to make it lively,
but I'm here now!

Those four walls now are the only place where I can breathe out
Those four walls now are home
Those four walls now are the only place that I can feel,
Those four walls now are home

I wanna make you feel now how I feel when I'm, missing it to love songs
I wanna take you to the peak of everything, yet you are
You're everything I need to night!
And I'm trying hard to make you want me,
but I don't wanna try too hard
I was thinking you got by what you came for,
but you're here now!

Those four walls now are the only place where I can breathe out
Those four walls now are home
Those four walls now are the only place that I can feel,
Those four walls now are home

Falling at hand of the perfect man!
Falling at hand of the perfect man!

Those four walls now are the only place where I can breathe out
Those four walls now are home
Those three words now are the only thing that can save me,
Those three words now are home

Falling at hand of the perfect man!
