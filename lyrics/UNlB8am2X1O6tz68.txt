IS THIS THE KIND OF WORK YOU'D LIKE TO DO?

Tonight I meet my friends
Together we celebrate...
THE BODY MUTILATED
ANOTHER MUTILATED BODY
WE HAVE AGREED TO TRY HYPNOSIS
HAVE YOU GONE COMPLETLY MAD?
I wake up freezing bleeding in the basement
O my head, I don't remember anything
I guess the night was exciting

LISTEN CAREFULLY!

When I'm clear I happen to regret
All the losses I will never retrieve
Hey you, hey me, carcass in the mirror
As hard as a rock and selfish to the core
WATER, WATER EVERYWHERE
I've been waiting for the good times

I NOSTRI SOGNI SONO SEMPRE PRESENTI
ALL THE BODIES MUTILATED IN THE SAME OBSCENE MANNER
