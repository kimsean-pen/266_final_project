Failure, victim, nothing
Bleeding, losing, everything

Failure, victim, nothing
Bleeding, losing, everything

I was never the one
In their eyes no one will
I am lost and catatonic

I laid them all to rest
The demons inside of me
I am lost and catatonic

Bury my heart
In your icy womb
I am lost and catatonic

Away from the light
Into earth's silent tomb
I am lost and catatonic

Choking, cursing, shattering
Blame, blame, blame
Burning, cutting, I'm vanishing
Shame, shame, shame

Walls are closing in
They're staring
Shade's still chanting
Run, do it, done?

Brake your wows of trying
Let them suffer in longing
Be remembered
...for nothing?

I was never the one
In their eyes no one will
I am lost and catatonic

I laid them all to rest
The demons inside of me
I am lost and catatonic

Bury my heart
In your icy womb
I am lost and catatonic

Away from the light
Into earth's silent tomb
I am lost and catatonic

Felt the pain
But I numbed it down
Crowded steets
But no one's around

These kingdoms of dust
These empires of loneliness
We are lost and catatonic

Walk through me you all
Curse you, you heartless
We are lost and catatonic

Failure, victim, nothing
Pain, pain, pain
Cutting, burning, I'm vanishing
Shame, shame, shame

I was never the one
In their eyes no one will
I am lost and catatonic

I laid them all to rest
The demons inside of me
I am lost and catatonic

Bury my heart
In your icy womb
I am lost and catatonic

Away from the light
Into earth's silent tomb
We are lost
