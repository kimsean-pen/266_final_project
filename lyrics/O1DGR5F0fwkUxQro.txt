Give me something to break before I break myself
Or take me somewhere, anywhere is fine - just fine

"Fine, just fine"
Words as these, may they come true by repetition?
Monotony, my constant woe, ally and foe
We're doing this silly dance together
tip, tip, tip on toe

Tripping, once again
I cannot help but to smile
But trust me, it is in frustration
Would you really believe things just as much?

No matter what, I end up with this mindnumbing feeling
The shallow smile is gone but there is this unjustified joy
But in the end all of that doesn't really matter
I just end up shivering by this echo within:

Is it cold in here, or is it just me?
