why can't we be on fire, at least that'll do it for me
i know that you are a liar, don't think you're going to fool me
i want to be inside of me, and have you come away today
i know how its going to be
i know how it's going to do

i got nothing to do, i'm nothing without you

la la la la la la la
the taste of you comes to me
i don't know what could you say
i don't care if you ever
i don't care if you never

i got nothing to do, i'm nothing without you
