Numb and broken
Here I stand alone
Wondering what were
The last words I said to you
Hoping, praying that I'll find a way
To turn back time
Can I turn back time?

What would I give to behold
The smile the face of love
You never left me
The rising sun
Will always speak your name

Numb and broken
Here I stand alone
Wondering what were
The last words I said to you
It won't be long
We'll meet again

Rock
What would I give (What would I give), to behold
The smile, the face of love?
You never left me (You Never Left Me)
The rising sun
Will always speak your name

It won't be long, we'll meet again
Your memory is never passing
It won't be long, we'll meet again
My love for you is everlasting

I mourn for those who never knew you
I mourn (I mourn) for those (for those)
who never knew you (who never knew you)

It won't be long, we'll meet again
Your memory is never passing
It won't be long, we'll meet again
My love for you is everlasting

It won't be long, we'll meet again
It won't be long, we'll meet again
It won't be long, we'll meet again.
It won't be long, we'll meet again.
