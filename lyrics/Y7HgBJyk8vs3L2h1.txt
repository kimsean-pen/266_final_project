Sister Bluebird flying high above
Shine your wings forward to the sun
Hide the mysteries of life on your way
Though you've seen them, please, don't say a word

What you don't know, I have never heard
Starship Trooper, go sailing on by
Catch my soul, catch the very light
Hide the moment from my eager eyes
Though you've seen there, please, don't tell a soul
What you can't see, can't be very whole

Speak to me of summer
Long winters longer than time can remember
Setting up of other roads
To travel on in old accustomed ways

I still remember the talks by the water
The proud sons and daughters
That knew the knowledge of the land
Spoke to me in sweet accustomed ways

Mother life, hold firmly on to me
Catch my knowledge higher than the day
Release as much as only you can show
Though you've seen me, please, don't say a word
What I don't know I have never shared

Loneliness is a power that we possess to give or take away forever
All I know can be shown by your acceptance of the facts
There shown before you
Take what I say in a different way and it's easy to say
That this is all confusion
As I see a new day in me, I can also show if you and you may follow

Speak to me of summer
Long winters longer than time can remember
Setting up of other roads
To travel on in old accustomed ways

I still remember the talks by the water
The proud sons and daughters
That knew the knowledge of the land
Spoke to me in sweet accustomed ways
