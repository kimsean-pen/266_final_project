I guess that this is where we've come to
If you don't want to, then you don't have to believe me
But I will be there when you go down
Just so you know now, you're on your own, now believe me

Yo, I don't wanna be the one to blame
You like fun and games, keep playin' em I'm just sayin'
Think back, then we was like one and the same
On the right track but I was on the wrong train

It's like that now you gotta face the pain
And the devil's got a fresh new place to play
In your brain like a maze you can never escape
The rain every damn day's the same shade of gray

Hey, I used to have a little bit of a plan
Used to, have a concept of where I stand
But that concept slipped right outta my hand
Now, I don't really even know who I am

Yo what do I have to say, maybe
I should do what I have to do to break free and
Whatever happens to you, we'll see
But it's not gonna happen with me

I guess that this is where we've come to
If you don't want to, then you don't have to believe me
But I will be there when you go down
Just so you know now you're on your own now, believe me

Back then, I thought you were just like me
Somebody who could see all the pain I see
But you proved to me unintentionally
That you would self destruct eventually

Now I'm thinkin' like the mistake I made doesn't hurt
But it's not gonna work 'cause it's really much worse than I thought
I wished you were something you were not
And now this guilt is really all that I've got

You turned your back and walk away ashamed
All you got is a memory and pain, nothing makes sense
You can stare at the ground, and hearin' my voice inside your head
When no one else is around

So what do I have to say
Maybe I should do what I have to do to break free man
Whatever happens to you we'll see
But this not gonna to me

I guess that this is where we've come to
If you don't want to, then you don't have to believe me
But I will be there when you go down
Just so you know now you're on your own now, believe me

I guess that this is where we've come to
If you don't want to, then you don't have to believe me
But I will be there when you go down
Just so you know now you're on your own now, believe me
I'm doin' what I have to do
You're on your own now believe me
Whatever happens to you
You're on your own now believe me
What do I have to say
You're on your own now believe me
It's not gonna happen to me
You're on your own now believe me
