You showed me how to do
Exactly what you do
How I fell in love with you
Oh oh, it's true
Oh, I love you

You showed me how to say
Exactly what you say
In that very special way
Oh oh, it's true
You fell for me, too

And when I tried it
I could see you fall
And I decided
It's not a trip, at all

You taught it to me, too
Exactly what you do
And now you love me, too
Oh oh, it's true
We're in love, we two

La, la la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
We're in love, we two
We two

You showed me how to do
Exactly what you do
How I fell in love with you
You taught it to me, too
Exactly what you do
And now you love me, too

And now you love me, too

And now you love me, too

And now you love me, too

And now you love me, too

And now you love me, too...
