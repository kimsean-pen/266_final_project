This little girl of mine
I wanna say she's so fine
And each and every day
I make sure she has her way

Now, we don't feel tied down
Although our hearts are bound
I don't have to chase her all over town
My baby, she's always around

The girl's alright with me
You know the girl's alright
Listen, the girl's alright with me
You know the girl's alright

Now, she's so good to me
I guess that's why I feel fancy free
Just to see the glow in her eyes
Makes me once again realize

I love her with all of my heart
And I know we'll never, never part
I never heard about or caught her playing
I guess that's why you always hear me saying

The girl's alright with me
You know the girl's alright
The girl's alright with me
You know the girl's alright

When I visit at her home
Other fellows never, never ring her phone
She lets them know just where they stand
She tells them all that I'm her man

And when we're out on a date
Other fellows wait till I walk away
They try to beat my time
She tells them in a nice way, she's mine, all mine

The girl's alright with me
You know the girl's alright
And I trust her with my heart, now
(The girl's alright with me)
Everyday now
(You know the girl's alright)

You know, you know that the girl's alright
(The girl's alright with me)
In every way now
(You know the girl's alright)
