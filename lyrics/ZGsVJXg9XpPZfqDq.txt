Star-crossed lovers' high
Star-crossed lovers' high

We're like strangers
Walking down the aisle
Holding hands and trying to pretend
We're like lovers
But here we are again
Entangled in a dance that never ends

This is karma, this is where our worlds collide
So for better, for worse
Let's bite that magic bullet
A-Leave it all behind
I need to feel the mercy
Of a star-crossed lovers' high
Bite that magic bullet
Enjoy this crazy ride
Only you can give me
A star-crossed lovers' high

So give me that
Star-crossed lovers' high
(Oh oh oh oh)
Star-crossed lovers' high

So give me that
Star-crossed lovers' high
(Oh oh oh oh)
Star-crossed lovers' high

We are dancing
Where the wildflowers grow
We're lost within a world that's so intense
We go crazy
Time and time again
Spinning on a storm that never ends

This is karma, this is where our worlds collide
So for better, for worse
Let's bite that magic bullet
A-Leave it all behind
I need to feel the mercy
Of a star-crossed lovers' high
Bite that magic bullet
Enjoy this crazy ride
Only you can give me
A star-crossed lovers' high

So give me that
Star-crossed lovers' high
(Oh oh oh oh)
Star-crossed lovers' high

So give me that
Star-crossed lovers' high
(Oh oh oh oh)
Star-crossed lovers' high

Oh oh oh oh...
Oh oh oh oh...

Star-crossed lovers' high

So give me that
Star-crossed lovers' high
Star-crossed lovers' high
