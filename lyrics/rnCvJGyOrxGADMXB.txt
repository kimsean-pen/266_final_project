You are just like the sunrise
When I'm Lookng in you're eys
Oh baby you make me cry

When I'm Lookng in you're eys
Youre just liek the dark night
Oh baby you make me cry

I have finally found you
I have finally found you
I have finally found you

I would travel through the skies
For You, my love
I'd kil with my hands, for you

You are just like the sunrise
When I'm Lookng in you're eys
Oh baby you make me cry

When I'm Lookng in you're eys
Youre just liek the dark night
Oh baby you make me cry

Baby you make me cry
