I wear the same face as you
and you share my sick point of view
But I do hate you
Vomit my heart
Pull my head apart
Vomit my heart
Pull my legs apart

Mad pilot fly high to the sky just
Just to tear off their arms
Just to tear off their arms

With carousel charm
I wear the same face as you
and you share my sick point of view
but I still hate you

Vomit my heart
Pull my head apart
Vomit my heart
Pull my legs apart

I wear the same face as you
and you share my sick point of view
But I still love you
My brains a carnival all aflame
Cause your not the same
Its all rearranged
But I do love you
Vomit my heart
