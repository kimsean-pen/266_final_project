Why do we always bicker?
This is affecting me
Darkness is coming down
And I can clearly see
I wish we could be together
Love to my memory now
And when I see your photo
I know it, I know it, I know it's true

I can't control this love I have for you
I can't control, I can't control this love
I can't control this love I have for you
I can't control, I can't control this love

Walking with the sun
Dreams are still with me
I'm laying in my bed
But still swimming in the sea
I wish we could be together
And love to my memory now
I'll stick with you forever
And ever, and ever you know it's true

I can't control this love I have for you
I can't control, I can't control this love
I can't control this love I have for you
I can't control, I can't control this love
