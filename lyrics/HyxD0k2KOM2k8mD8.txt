Scrub the floor or just mop it (okay)
Show these gangsters how you pop lock it (okay)
Don't care what you got in your pocket (okay)

Flip that thang, thang, don't stop it
Wanna just bang, bang and pop it
While the club crowded just watch you (work it out)

Got a gang of cash, and it's going all on the bar (now work it out)
And it's going fast 'cause I feel like a superstar (now work it out)
And you may not have it,
I might have just broke the law (now work it out)
It's your turn to grab it,
Now make this whole thing yours (now work it out)
