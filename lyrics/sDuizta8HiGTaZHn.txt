Looks good in a dress, even better in my sweatshirt
My car is a mess, but she don't mind
She never complains, even when I'm out all night
I sleep in all day and that's just fine
'Cause she knows that I'm falling fast
Oh, oh
I know that I'll never let her go

Singing oh yeah
I'm loving that way she makes me feel
Singing oh yeah

She's so rad, this is just unreal
And all around the world

I've never seen a girl that makes me crazy, baby
Girl, you're just amazing
Oh, oh, girl, you're just amazing
Oh, oh, girl, you're just amazing

Start of the show, but doesn't beg for attention
She already knows, she's got the part (Ohh yeahh)
She lives in the now, even if it's not forever

So girl take a bow, you've won my heart
Oh, 'cause she knows that I'm falling fast
Oh, oh
I know that I'll never let her go (let her go)

Singing oh yeah
I'm loving that way she makes me feel
Singing oh yeah
She's so rad, this is just unreal
And all around the world

I've never seen a girl that makes me crazy, baby
Girl, you're just amazing (Girl, you're just amazing)

Oh, oh, girl, you're just amazing
Oh, oh, girl, you're just amazing
Oh, oh, girl, you're just amazing (Girl, you're just amazing)
Oh, oh, girl, you're just amazing

Now baby listen to me
You're more than all that I need when you're by my side
I must be under a spell
And girl if you couldn't tell, you light up my life, yeah yeah

Singing oh yeah
I'm loving that way she makes me feel (come on)
Singing oh yeah

She's so rad, this is just unreal
And all around the world

I've never seen a girl that makes me crazy, baby
Girl, you're just amazing
Singing oh yeah
I'm loving that way she makes me feel

Singing oh yeah
She's so rad, this is just unreal
And all around the world

I've never seen a girl that makes me crazy, baby
Girl, you're just amazing
Oh, oh, girl, you're just amazing
Oh, oh, girl, you're just amazing
