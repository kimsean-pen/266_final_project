Baby, so you think you know crazy
I think you know what you know,

And then I wave goodbye as you run for your life

A little advice for aspiring fires
You'll get put out if you don't get a little higher
Drag and track it get it right, you don't got the do, well it just to lose you mind
You gotta be kiddin' me right, ayee ayee yeah

A little advice for aspiring fires
You'll get put out if you don't get a little higher

Aspiring fires a friend
Not to try to feel it crazy

A little advice for aspiring fires

Ooh (you gotta be kiddin' me right) ayee ayee yeah
