It's all in the family
And then you sneak it all away

When they said he's ill
Laughed it off as if it's no big deal
What a joke to joke, no joke

It's all in the family
And then you sneak it all away
Sick has to eat well too
And dumb it down

And you can't get back
You won't come back
You can't come back to it
And you won't come back
You can't come back
You won't come back to it
And you won't come back
You can't come back
You won't come back to it
And you won't come back
You can't come back
You won't come back to it

Its all in the family
And then you sneak it all away
Sick has to eat well too

Got to like it all
Got to like what kills
It kills just to like what kills
Got to like it all

So it goes to show what all things know
Just one thing keep it live
Keep it live, dead or alive
These guys get to live on
And you give up on the upside
Give it up on the other side

And you can't get back
You won't come back
You can't come back to it
And you won't come back
You can't come back
You won't come back to it
And you won't come back
You can't come back
You won't come back to it
And you won't come back
You can't come back
You won't come back to it
