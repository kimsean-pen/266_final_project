We're born to die so
I'm gonna fight for how I wanna live
Spark up the riots
I guess I'm a criminal and a futurist
With the charges
I've caught won't stand your trial
You can take it out on me, yeah
I've been to hell but
I've learned to keep my cool
Hold onto the devil
Got him by the throat 'cause I refuse
Yeah, I won't take my last breath in denial
But you can't take it from me, yeah

I've seen peaks, been
Released into the prisons below
My days here disappear
There's things that I can't ignore
The sweetest release might take a while

So take me out in style
Yeah, you
Yeah, just take me out in style, oh
If you're gonna take me out, take me out in style

We're in the lion's den
Consumption is our medicine
And so I'm high again
You can say I'm a true American
Well the sweetest revenge is being set free
You can't take it from me, yeah

It begins at my end, my death will never survive
I've been cleared of my crimes, don't need no alibi
The sweetest release might take a while

Just take me out in style
Yeah, you
Yeah, just take me out in style
If you're gonna take me out, take me out
Take me out in style
Yeah, you
Well, the sweetest release might take a while
Just take me out, take me out in style

(You'll never take me alive)

Just take me out in style
(If you're gonna take me)
Take me in style
If you're gonna love me
Love me in style
The sweetest release might take a while
Take me out, take me out in style

If you're gonna fight me
Fight me in style
If you're gonna hate me
Hate me with style
If you're gonna love me
Do it in style
Yeah, just do it in style
