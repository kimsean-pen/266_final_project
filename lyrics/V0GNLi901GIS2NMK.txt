Come close and take off your shoes
Tell me all the thoughts the weigh on you
Bad love left a visible scar
But it won't fool me
'Cause I know who you are

Every wall we build inside
Will never be high enough
To keep the water from our eyes
And all the good you see in me
Will never be good enough
It doesn't have to be good enough
It'll never be enough
It'll never be enough

The years pass in the blink of an eye
Still you hope for change but live in lies
And bad luck left a hole in guard
But it won't fool me
'Cause I know who you are

Every wall we build inside
Will never be high enough
To keep the water from our eyes
And all the good you see in me
Will never be good enough
It doesn't have to be good enough
It'll never be enough
It'll never be enough
It'll never be enough
It'll never be enough
