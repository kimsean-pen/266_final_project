Let me hear the beat
it just keeps going ha?
ohh it's fast
can you slow it down, a little bit?

I could use a little more rythm
knock a little louder sugar

Yeah that's really bad
nothings change, nothings change, nothings change
but everything must change!

There we go...
now we're doing something

There we go...
now we're doing something

There we go...
now we're doing something

A little distortion in my left ear
a little distortion, tell me can't you hear?
A little distortion in my left ear
a little distortion, tell me can't you hear?

It feels good to me, makes me feel alright
it feels good to me, makes my burdens light
It feels good to me, makes me feel alright
it feels good to me, makes my burdens light

A little distortion
A little distortion
A little distortion
A little distortion

It feels good to me, makes me feel alright
it feels good to me, makes my burdens light
It feels good to me, makes me feel alright
it feels good to me, makes my burdens light

A little distortion
