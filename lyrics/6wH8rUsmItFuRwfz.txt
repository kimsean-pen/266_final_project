They're lining up in columns
They're lining up in pairs
They're lining up around the globe
They line up everywhere

Without reservation
Without cause to care
Fuck the complication
Last man standing

I heard the blowing siren
Heard boots upon the ground
Heard the brave in unison
Hear their engines pound

As God will be our witness
And evil is commanding
Fuck the abdication
Last man standing

Last man standing, last to fall
Last man rise to take it all
Last define the best of what we do

Last man standing, last to fall
Last man rise to take it all
Last man in to tighten up the screw
Get in the mix and fight
Fight

The fever turned to anger
The anger turned to hate
The hate became the reason
In the hands of fate

Without reservation
Pause to dedicate
All our admiration
Last man standing

Stronger by the dozen
Stronger by score
Stronger by the thousands
With a cry of war

As God will be our witness
And loyalty demanding
Fuck obliteration
Last man standing

Last man standing, last to fall
Last to rise and take it all
Last define the best of what we do

Last man standing, last to fall
Last to rise and take it all
Last man in to tighten up the screw
Get in the mix and fight
Fight

All our footsteps have taken us here
To the place that we all can call home
And all of our hearts sing together in what we bring
All in a place we call home

Last man standing, last to fall
Last to rise and take it all
Last define the best of what we do

Last man standing, last to fall
Last to rise and take it all
Last man in to tighten up the screw

Get in the mix and
Get in the mix and
Get in the mix and fight

Fight
Fight
Fight
