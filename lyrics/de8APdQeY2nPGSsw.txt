Blown a wish right in between
Where you are and what you wanna be
The truth spins in dark circles
Can you see what I see?
(No one is untouchable)

Sometimes it feels just like a dream
Weaving out and in between
The same basic themes
Thoughts. Complaints. Ideas. Actions

So if you want a reaction, let's go
Because in my mind it's almost forever
And my patience is a cold, hard sliver
So if you fuckers wanna find out
I'm like a ghost that never leaves
Ready to receive

Dreams will die
Blue will burn
But when the cards drop
You'd be the first to go running
