Sitting ducks on razor blades
Just waiting to be swallowed by the soup, mhm
The repetition of a bad dream
A loop within a loop within a loop

Here comes the feeling
But not the words
It's like a love song in reverse
I just don't love you
But don't know how to say
It gets stuck in my
It gets stuck in my teeth
It gets stuck in my
It gets stuck in my teeth
Can't find the words to say goodbye
(Goodbye)

Hot tongue, cold shoulder
Who am I to turn my back on you?
Why bring this back to life?
Why raise the dead?
Why hold this gun up to my head?

Here comes the feeling
But not the words
It's like a love song in reverse
I just don't love you
But don't know how to say
It gets stuck in my
It gets stuck in my teeth
It gets stuck in my
It gets stuck in my teeth
Can't find the words to say goodbye

No words, no words
No words, no words
No words, no words
Can't find the words to say goodbye

I don't know the language
I can't find the rhythm
I don't know the way to say I tried
I don't know the language
I can't find the rhythm
I don't know the way to say goodbye, bye

It gets stuck in my
It gets stuck in my teeth
It gets stuck in my
It gets stuck in my teeth
Can't find the words, can't find the words
Can't find the words to say goodbye
Can't find the words, can't find the words
Can't find the words to say goodbye
