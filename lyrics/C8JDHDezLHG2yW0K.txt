Didn't mean to get you wrong
I'm so glad that I found you
I'm so glad that I found you
I'm so glad that I found you
I'm so glad that I found you
I'm so glad that I found you
I'm so glad that I found you

Stood in the road when I saw you
I couldn't see through the rain though
Baby, we know how this goes
It's getting cold on your porch

Stood in the road when I saw you
I couldn't breathe and I fucked up
Maybe he'll leave and I'll show up
It's getting cold and I miss you

I forget me like I knew the neighbours were searching
I had always hoped that I would find me in person
Tell me how you love me but I'm making you nervous
I'm nervous and I can't speak
I'm so glad that I found you
I'm so glad that I found you
I'm so glad that I found you
I'm so glad that I found you
I'm so glad that I found you
I'm so glad that I found you

This is the part that I can't do
I don't want no one to have you
Wait all night if I have to
I'm so jealous I can't sleep
Maybe they're trying to find us
Baby, stop crying, I'll light up
Wait all night if I have to
I am so jealous I can't leave

I forget me like I knew the neighbours were searching
I had always hoped that I would find me in person
Tell me how you love me but I'm making you nervous
I'm nervous and I can't speak
I'm so glad that I found you
I'm so glad that I found you
I'm so glad that I found you
I'm so glad that I found you
I'm so glad that I found you
I'm so glad that I found you
