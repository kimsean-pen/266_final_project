Yo, I've been jugging and jugging to get these bands up
Man got a problem I'll get a man touched
Back of the rave we keep the ting tucked
Still man are bogging at me thinking they're Montana
Moving like Mad Max top shotta
Leaving with Rita check my aura
Nickname lemonade, my bae sour
But I tell her time is money let's make hours

And I'm living la vida, vida loca
Courtesy of the coffee nigga mocha
And she's smelling the money from my posture
Couldn't walk a mile in my jeans you man are fostered
Shake it shake it for me
Key to ignition start it slowly
Hand on the gear stick move it with ease
Her body like a beamer back it up on me

So I wanna know
Ah who got the keys to the beamer, her body goes vroom vroom vroom
Ah who got the keys to the beamer, her body goes vroom vroom vroom
She got the body like a motor
She got the body like a motor, yeah yeah yeah
She got the body like a motor
She got the body like a motor, yeah yeah yeah

Badder than who, we badder than them man
No one can stop me not even Batman
Bane I salute darg fi dun talk
Pull up looking like the UK's new age Rockafeller
Overseas smoking cubaners
My black monolo we are hermanas
I'm like Jimmy Conway i'm a good fella
Switch gears she handles it better soon as I spoil her

And I'm living la vida, vida loca
Courtesy of the coffee nigga mocha
And she's smelling the money from my posture
Couldn't walk a mile in my jeans you man are fostered
Shake it shake it for me
Key to ignition start it slowly
Hand on the gear stick move it with ease
Her body like a beamer back it up for me

So I wanna know
Ah who got the keys to the beamer, her body goes vroom vroom vroom
Ah who got the keys to the beamer, her body goes vroom vroom vroom
She got the body like a motor
She got the body like a motor, yeah yeah yeah
She got the body like a motor
She got the body like a motor, yeah yeah yeah

Just gimme your key I'mma start your car
