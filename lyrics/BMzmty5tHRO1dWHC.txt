I had a dream last night
Had a dream last night you died
Didn't wrap my head around it
World of a relief when I woke up
We were in a dark place
You didn't leave with me alive
Didn't wrap my head around it
World of a relief
Never leave these eyes
Never leave these eyes
Lights up
45
Only remember the day when I saw you alive
Lights up
45
Only remember the day when I saw you alive

I had to hide your obituary under my shelf
If it saw the light of my life it would let my health
I had to hide your obituary under my shelf
If it saw the light of my life
Never leave these eyes
Never leave these eyes
Lights up
45
Only remember the day when I saw you alive
Lights up
45
Only remember the day when I saw you alive
Never leave these eyes
Never leave these eyes
Lights up
45
Only remember the day when I saw you alive
Lights up
45
Only remember the day when I saw you alive
And the memory still haunts me
As I sip my coffee I can't believe
Why would my mind weave such pain for me
And the memory still haunts me
As I sip my coffee I can't believe
Why would my mind-
Never leave these eyes
45
Only remember the day when I saw you alive
Lights up
Lights up
Never leave these eyes
45
Only remember the day when I saw you alive
Never leave these eyes
45
Only remember the day when I saw you alive
Lights up
Lights up
Lights up
