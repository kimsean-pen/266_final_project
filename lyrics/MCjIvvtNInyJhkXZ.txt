Ooh

It comes to me, plain to see
Not only me, nowhere to be, I got a ride
Go leave it on the ground and throw a bone
Not on my own, I got a zone, I got a ride

Lift this sick old leg (Ooh)
Far from the other leg
Lick this sick instinct (Ooh)
Drip from a constant heartache

And leave it on the ground until it's down
My mind is blown, it's coming home, it's in my eyes
And when it makes a sound, the coast is clear
Not on my own, I got a zone, I got a ride

Lit from a light within
Made from a brittle thing
We got a special thing (Ooh)
Stuck between a rock and a hard place

Go leave it on the ground
Go, go, go, go
Go leave it on the ground
Go, go, go, go
Go leave it on the ground
Go, go, go, go
Go leave it on the ground
Go, go, go, go
