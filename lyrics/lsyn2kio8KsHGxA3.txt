Got to arm yourself before they take your life
Got to arm the teachers, 'cause the kids ain't right
'Cause you know war's just part of life
'Cause you know war's just a way to get to the other side

Human forming, human target
Human fear's a perfect market
Human forming, human target

Fuck the NRA
Fuck the NRA
Fuck the NRA
Fuck the NRA

Yeah, you're talking freedom, yeah you're talking rights
While you keep your eye on your bank accounts
Attacking those looking to survive
'Cause you know culture war's just part of life

Human forming, human target
Human fear's a perfect market
Human forming, human target

Fuck the NRA
Fuck the NRA
Fuck the NRA
Fuck the NRA

Fuck the NRA
Fuck the NRA
Fuck the NRA
Fuck the NRA

Motherfucker!
Skank!
Suck my dick!

Human forming, human target
Human fear's a perfect market

Fuck the NRA
