The day you passed away
Something about this place changed
We were waiting for signals of love
But you were cold and I guess you'd had enough

Spoke my name, I felt your pain
As your eyes cloud up and then close shut
I saw your soul leave this room like it was sick of you
You had this look on your face like you were thinking

Just take me away
I'll never change
Take me away
I will never change

My father was broken and low
And I saw a side that he'd never shown
So many secrets he kept
Some things he was forced to accept

Spoke my name, I felt your pain
As your eyes cloud up and then close shut
I saw your soul leave this room like it was sick of you
You had this look on your face like you were thinking

Just take me away
I'll never change
Take me away
I will never change

Crossed his heart and hoped to die
I know you fought so hard
And held your pride
I wish you knew my thoughts and heard my voice
Cause I was tied in knots but stood with poise

And when you spoke my name
I felt your pain as your eyes cloud up and then close shut
I saw your soul leave this room like it was sick of you
You had this look on your face like you were thinking

Just take me away
I'll never change
Take me away
I will never change
