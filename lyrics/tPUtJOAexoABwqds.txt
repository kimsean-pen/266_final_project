Hey kid, you've got a lot of potential
But I think its time to move up
So go on and blow us away with your sound

Now you're everything that we've come to love
You taught us to move, so we'll show it off
Just drop us the beat

Here's to the fast times, the times we felt alive
To all the nights that we forgot to get back home

Stay seventeen, the party scene
Has got the best of me and you
We've got to let this go

Drink up last call
Before the sunrise sets the scene
Of empty bottles, heavy hearts
The memories of broken dreams

We were so tired yet so alive
Wrapped up in lies
Like sheets of another one night stand
You know you left the girl with nothing

But the sunrise through the window pane
Where tired eyes will close

Stay seventeen, the party scene
Has got the best of me and you
We've got to let this go

I know she hopes I choke on this last drink
Drop dead before my influence gets to her head
She said, "I'll love you forever
Or find something better

It's all just the same as when we sleep together
We wake up with headaches
And trouble remembering
What went wrong

Stay seventeen, the party scene
Has got the best of me and you
We've got to let this go
