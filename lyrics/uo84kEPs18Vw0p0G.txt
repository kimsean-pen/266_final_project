They said, that I can't change without you.
That I can't change without you.
That I can't change without you.

Those nights I can't sleep
I'm stuck here.
Lost in your dreams
I'm stuck in here.
Like why can't I get much better?
Like why can't I get much better?

So swipe it, and take it all away
And never, never lie to me.
So swipe it, and take it all away
And never, never lie to me.

The only reason my eyes close
Is so they open with you by my side.
Like why can't I get much better?
Like why can't I get much better?

So swipe it, and take it all away
And never, never lie to me.
So swipe it, and take it all away

And never, never lie to me.
And never lie
Never, never lie.
I will, wait for
Wait for
Wait for
I will wait for
Wait for
Wait for
Wait for life
Wait for you
Wait for life
Wait for life
I will wait for you
Never wait
I Wait for tomorrow.

So open your eyes, my darling
Today's a new day as I'm wakin' up.
Like why can't I get much better?
Like why can't I get much better?
Like why can't I?
Like why can't I?
Get better.
