I can't stand the sight of you anymore
I can't remember why I thought that you were worth fighting for
Was it worth it?
Well was it worth it?

I push you away but you just won't listen
You beg for me back but I still don't miss you at all

I never stood so tall since we lost it all
I felt the weight lift from my hands
There's no hope
You're too far gone

Frame by frame, it all starts to flood my brain
I see red when I think back to all of the pulling teeth
It wasn't worth it
It wasn't worth it

You're begging for help but I won't come and save you
I beg for the space but you won't fucking leave me alone

I never stood so tall since we lost it all
I felt the weight lift from my hands
There's no hope
You're too far gone
You're too far gone

It's sad to hear that you're still breathing
Would it kill you to spare me from your speaking?
You pulled me in just to watch me drown slowly
Our past was bright, now the future's just ugly

It's sad to hear that you're still breathing
Would it kill you to spare me from your speaking?
You pulled me in just to watch me drown slowly
Our past was bright, now the future's just ugly

You're like a devil never picking a side
Every villain needs a victim
It's just not me this fucking time

It's just not me this fucking time

I still don't miss you at all
I never stood so tall since we lost it all
I felt the weight lift from my hands
There's no hope
You're too far gone
I never stood so tall since we lost it all
I felt the weight lift from my hands
There's no hope
You're too far gone
I'm free from your chains, yeah you're too far gone
