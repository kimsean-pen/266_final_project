Yeah, yeah
Let's go

Now everybody, everybody
Put your hands in the air, (put your hands up)
Yo
Put your hands up, yo
Yo, now everybody
Everybody put your hands in the air (put your hands up)
Put your hands up
Pledge allegiance to United States of Horror

Everything dies at the end of time
Livin' my life,
not givin' a fuck with no regrets, stay true to yourself
Don't let nobody bring you down
God let be so leave 'em, beasts in weak
Minds don't live free, casualty with the massive key
I came through the door with savagery

Everybody put your hands in the air (in the air)
Yo, put your
Ev'rybody, ev'rybody
Ev'rybody put your motherfuckin' hands up
Yo, and pledge allegiance to United States of Horror
I say this is for my niggas on the East Side (this for my niggas)
I say, I say, I
This is for my niggas on the West Side
This for my niggas up north, nigga
This is for the South

Be the fuckin' worst you can be
Bad kids rule the world, self-proclaimed savages
Reign terror, if I die tomorrow I could care less
Ease the stress, fill my vein, damaged brain
All I need is cloudy weather with a little bit of rain
Bring the thunder motherfucker, wherever you can have the fame
Represent for my niggas, one love
Game to hate
Middle finger to whoever in my motherfuckin' way

Everybody put your hands in the air
Yo, put your
Ev'rybody, ev'rybody
Ev'rybody put you motherfuckin' hands up (Let's go)
Yo, and pledge allegiance to United States of Horror
I say this is for my niggas on the East Side
I say, I say, I
This is for my niggas on the West Side
This for my niggas up north, nigga
This is for the south

Ayo
If you stand for somethin', put your fist in the air
If you stand against police brutality, racism, government oppression
Motherfuckers abusin' they power
Forced profits tryin' to feed they fuckin' bullshit
Know'm sayin'?
If you wanna be somebody you understand you better be ready for war
Ain't shit free, we livin' in hell
But you 'bout to let 'em know you ain't takin no shit
When this shit come back I want you to burst into flames

Let's go
Ev'rybody put your hands in the air
Yo, put your
Ev'rybody, ev'rybody
Ev'rybody put your motherfuckin' hands up
Yo, pledge allegiance to United States of Horror
I say this is for my niggas on the East Side
I say, I say, I
This is for my niggas on the West Side
This for my niggas up north, nigga
This is for the south
