I could make it all feel far away
I would race my age out of this place, separate

"Pile your clothes for a better run", I was told
Save your life as all you've ever known and ever owned

I should bathe it out to feel sun
I'll trade space to hit the ground and run
Shout it proud!

"Pile your clothes for a better one", I was told
Save your life as all you've ever known and ever owned

Ain't it funny how we went nowhere?
Ain't it funny how we went nowhere?
Ain't it funny how we went, funny how we went nowhere?
Ain't it funny how we went nowhere?

Given the chance to break, would you be on your way out?
Who are you?
Given the chance to break, would you be on your way out?
Who are you?

Who are you?
Who are you?
