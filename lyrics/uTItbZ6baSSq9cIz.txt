Apprehension of the countless mistakes
Trying my best to sink in
All that was fucking lost

Memory erasing procedure activated
Blissfully ignorant towards what's been said and done

Truth discovered, doomed to repeat the same mistakes, better off fucking dead

Wake me from my tired life
I have bled once too many times
Should I resort to violence?
Fuck

Truth discovered, doomed to repeat the same mistakes, better off fucking dead
