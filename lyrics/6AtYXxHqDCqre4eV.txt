Nothing I must do
Nowhere I should be
No one in my life
To answer to but me

No more candlelight
No more purple skies
No one to be near
As my heart slowly dies

If I could hold you one more time
like in the days when you where mine
I'd look at you 'till I was blind
So you would stay

I'd say a prayer each time you'd smile
Cradle the moments like a child
I'd stop the world if only I
Could hold you one more time

(hmmmmmm)
I've memorized your face
I know your touch by heart
Still lost in your embrace

I'd dream of where you are

(music break)
(hmmm)
If I could hold you one more time
Like in the days when you were mine

I'd look at you 'till I was blind
So you would stay
I'd say a prayer each time you'd smile
Cradle the moments like a child
I'd stop the world if only I
Could hold you one more time
One more time
