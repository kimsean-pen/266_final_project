This country tells us that we're down and out,
Got you thinking that we're through.
Got to suffer to get us moving,
Say it's up to me and you.
Well, look around and you'll see who gets the goods, not you or me.
Cause they ain't suffering, no, not for us,
They're masquerading like pissers must.
They abuse us, keep us right underfoot,
With the illusions of contentment and good.
Well, it's not over, war's still around
And they've got no problem when you're underground.
