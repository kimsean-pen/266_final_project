Just bring me the storm and I'll carry home
To the city of the Echo
And when Hell comes rolling in
Time won't lie

A cold, cold silver armed embrace
You're so delicate, you're so delicate
Lie down
You cut with your eyes, you're undercover
The moment to bleed and to discover
Footsteps in the rain
A calling
A killer

Just bring me the storm and I'll carry home
To the city of the Echo
And when Hell comes rolling in
Time won't lie
This ain't no machine, it's just a girl
Hey twisted world, I've discovered a dreamer
Just one look and she'll pull you in

A cold, cold shiver down my spine
You're so eloquent, you're so eloquent
Run all night
I was coming for you
And now they're coming for us
Footsteps in the rain
A calling
A killer

Just bring me the storm and I'll carry home
To the city of the Echo
And when Hell comes rolling in
Time won't lie
This ain't no machine, it's just a girl
Hey twisted world, I've discovered a dreamer
Just one look and she'll pull you in

Rest assured, assume it's not over
Just bring me the storm and I'll carry home
To the city of the Echo
