We're lit by a torch as we kneel in the court of the king.
As we sift through the bones of an idol,
We dig for the bones of an idol when the will is gone
'Cause something keeps turning us on.

You hold up the cup you've been searching for since you were young.
When you still had the bones of an idol,
If you still had the bones of an idol, you'd be long, long gone.
But something keeps turning you on.

We cling to the raft we are missing by half what we wanted.
But we escaped with the bones of an idol,
Escaped with the belt and the title, but our land is gone.
And something keeps turning us on.
