Shatter the illusions
Of the world that you believed in long ago
You can let go

Nothing's sacred, can't survive
You'll reach the end
On borrowed time
But you must try

Just save yourself
There is nothing to hide but the truth
There's no one else
Here beside you
Please save yourself
'Cause you don't have a moment to lose
The time will tell
If you're meant to survive on your own

Crying for redemption
It's a mystery [below and broke] your heart
And left you scared
The time is now
There's no recourse
It's only what you see and what you are
I know it's hard

Just save yourself
There is nothing to hide but the truth
There's no one else
Here beside you
Please save yourself
'Cause you don't have a moment to lose
The time will tell
If you're meant to survive on your own

On your own

And when you see
The promise of what life should be
The destiny
You must believe
The courage is all that you need
That's all you need
(All you need)

Save yourself
There is nothing to hide but the truth
No one else
Here beside you
Save yourself
Or you're lost on this island of fools
Time will tell
If you're meant to survive on your own
