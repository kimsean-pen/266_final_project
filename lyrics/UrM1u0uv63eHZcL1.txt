Safe from harm
I'm swaying back and forth
Cradling me
The arms of halcyon seas

And it feels like I'm stranded
And I feel so lost

How would it feel down under the waves
Smothering air I've breathed, so alive

Drowning
Drowning
Drowning

Stuck in time
A new beginning awaits
I can help you to find
Your course in the dark

Do you feel the corrosion?
Do you feel lost at sea?
Following the moonlight glistening deep blue
I've been here before and I will bring you home
So long!

How would it feel down under the waves
Smothering air I've breathed, so alive

Drowning
Drowning
Drowning

I've never felt so blue
I've never felt so blue
I've never felt so blue
I've never felt so blue

Do you feel the corrosion?
Do you feel lost at sea?
Following the moonlight glistening deep blue
I've been here before and I will bring you
I will bring you home

Drowning
Drowning
(Drowning) Breathing incessantly
(Drowning) In deepest waters
(Drowning) Baptized so forcibly
(Drowning) To never wither
I'm alive

Why am I alive?
How would it feel to fade away?
Smothering air I've breathed
So alive
