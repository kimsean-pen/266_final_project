Lipstick letter 'cross the mirror this morning
Said good-bye baby, you left without warning
Like a thief in the night you ran away with my heart
I can't believe my eyes, must be a bad dream
You always said we had a good thing
You never once let on, we were falling apart
That ain't no way to go
Girl, it just ain't right
Don't you think, that I deserve, to hear you say goodbye
That ain't no way to go
Was it all a lie
After all this time that ain't no way to go

Gettin' nowhere I'm tired of thinkin'
Guess I'll do a little wishful drinkin'
Make a whiskey wish upon a star
Train whistle blowin' down the tracks
Lonesome sound says she ain't comin' back
It's such a cold blow from out of the dark

That ain't no way to go

Girl, it just ain't right
Don't you think, that I deserve, to hear you say goodbye
That ain't no way to go
Now was it all a lie
After all this time that ain't no way to go
Now girl it just ain't right
Don't you think, that I deserve, to hear you say goodbye
That ain't no way to go
Now was it all a lie
After all this time that ain't no way to go
