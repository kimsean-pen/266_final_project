Lying to myself, could you talk me down?
My mind is on the ledge, and I can't even see the ground
If I was someone else, maybe then I could be proud
I can't avoid this feeling 'cause it always comes around

Just like a carousel
Full of thoughts that make me doubt myself
Threw all my sense into a wishing well
So I can break from this imposter's shell, imposter's shell

I'll hide my face behind a mask I've made
To cover up my shame
And when you find out that I'm not me
I'll flee the scene

And repeat just like a carousel
Full of thoughts that make me doubt myself
Threw all my sense into a wishing well
So I can break from this imposter's shell, imposter's shell

I'll keep my hands steady, I'll leap when I'm ready
I don't need luck, I've got plenty, I'll keep up like a dead heat
I'll keep my hands steady, I'll leap when I'm ready
I don't need luck, I've got plenty, I'll keep up like a dead heat

Carousel
Full of thoughts that make me doubt myself
Threw all my sense into a wishing well
So I can break from this imposter's shell, imposter's shell
Carousel
Full of thoughts that make me doubt myself
Threw all my sense into a wishing well
So I can break from this imposter's shell, imposter's shell
