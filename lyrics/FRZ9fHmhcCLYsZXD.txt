With you, girl
Ain't no point in looking at the liquor store
With you, girl
I find you looking for the cash in my top drawer
But I keep my money in the bank
Pussy in the bed
Liquor out of reach
Put a bullet in my head
I'm no closer
And then I find myself thinking of you

And then you wanna talk dirty in the middle of the night
While I'm here waiting for you
I'm here waiting for you
I'm here waiting for you
I'm here waiting for you
I'm here waiting for you
I'm here waiting for you

I'm waiting for my lover
She's almost seventeen
Surrounded by the vision of a thousand fantasies
I'm waiting for my lover
I'm waiting for my lover

I'm waiting for my lover
She's just got to be a teen
I'm waiting undercover
I'm kneeling at her feet
I'm waiting for my lover
I'm waiting for my lover

With you, girl
Ain't no point queuing at the night club door
With you, girl
I sit here wondering what the hell I'm waiting for
Because I keep my money in the bank
Pussy in the bed
Liquor out of reach
Put a bullet in my head
I'm no closer
Then I find myself thinking of you

And then you say you want to see me
But it just wouldn't be right
So I'm here waiting for you
I'm here waiting for you
I'm here waiting for you
I'm here waiting for you
I'm here waiting for you
I'm here waiting for you

I'm waiting for my lover
She's almost seventeen
Surrounded by the visions of a thousand fantasies
I'm waiting for my lover
I'm waiting for my lover

I'm waiting for my lover
She's just got to be eighteen
I'm waiting undercover
I'm kneeling at her feet
I'm waiting for my lover
I'm waiting for my lover
