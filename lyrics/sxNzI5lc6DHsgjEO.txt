I wanna fire a gun - show me
I wanna be unseen - show me
A deep disguise
A deep disguise

Five years of nothing good
Still screaming
Shout this secrets out
Deep, distant and pure
Deep, distant and pure
Kill rhythm

Deep feelings, I'm keeping, still dreaming
Now, my secrets out
Deep, distant and pure

I wanna walk on air - show me
It's gonna feel so rare - show me
Don't wanna look suspicious or undone
But I really think this rhythm is the only one

Five years of nothing good
And still screaming
Shout, get this secret out
Deep, distant and pure

Deep feelings, I'm keeping, cold comfort,
Shout - this secrets out
Deep, distant and pure
Deep, distant and pure

I wanna fire the gun - show me
I wanna be unseen - show me
A deep disguise
To kill this guy

Finalize the rhythm
The rhythm

Deep feelings I'm seeking, kill rhythm
Shout this secrets out
Deep, distant and pure
Deep, distant and pure
