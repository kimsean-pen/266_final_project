Blue everyday
Blue everyday
Blue everyday

Bruised from another place
Everyday takes grace
And the air's still warm
From a bullet in the wrong place

You're still moving
I'm still wounded
From the speed
Never leave so free
(Free)

I still stare
From the glare
(From the glare)
Of the last of my stare

Bruised from another place
Everything takes grace
And the air's still warm
