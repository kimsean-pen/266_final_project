A sad song it was
Through renewal it brought
And a month seems sometimes shorter
Than a half nights longing

Hidden and hard
Are the reasons for war
Polar twist, invert and flea

I can't dissolve
This feeling of mine
But patience will
Unlock the doors

And the maps of reasons
Rewritten for me
When the wait is over
And the punishment's due

Each day I crawl
To the hall of the giants

And I beg for mercy
And I beg for mercy
In vain

One night is a mare
Two is worse
How can I manage three?

Each day I crawl
To the hall of the giants

Each day I crawl
To the hall of the giants
