Time doesn't erase the demons you don't see still dancin in your dreams
Draggin up the ways temptation is overgrown looks like we're all alone
Truth is coming to light so let me show you
Can't keep me here in the dark
I said you look like a spark into oblivion, into oblivion
Can't take me down to the boat
I'll turn you back into smoke into oblivion

Rise wrath of the rage those spineless spirits bleed the only half of me
Crawling out of my skn shed every trace of you just one last thing to do
Truth is coming to light so let me show you
Can't keep me here in the dark
I said you look like a spark into oblivion, into oblivion
Can't take me down to the boat
I'll turn you back into smoke into oblivion
Can't keep me here in the dark
I said you look like a spark into oblivion, into oblivion
Ayo ayooaaa x3

So let me show you
Can't keep me here in the dark
I said you look like a spark into oblivion, into oblivion
Can't take me down to the boat
I'll turn you back into smoke into oblivion
Can't keep me here in the dark
I said you look like a spark into oblivion, into oblivion
Can't take me down to the boat
I'll turn you back into smoke into oblivion
