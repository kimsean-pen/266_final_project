I'm so pathetic for ever thinking I'd change
When there are pieces of my past that I conveniently erased
I fell in over my head, you wouldn't understand
And now my brain is just a tired mess of all the things I've abandoned

And you should know you never were an exception
I think I shut you out as a form of protection
Now there's an empty space
That's growing in my head and in my home
Starting to show, I thought you should know

You can fall to your knees and pray
'Cause I'm a sinner now
And I won't be saved
I've been lying to you more each day
'Cause I'm a sinner now
And all my sins I've found
They won't wash away

I let you down, it's what I always do best
I found my way under your skin
And somehow crept into your chest
There's all the hours I wasted trying hard to fool you
Well they were never enough
Never enough to hide the pain I put you through
(Wash away your sins)

You can fall to your knees and pray
'Cause I'm a sinner now
And I won't be saved
I've been lying to you more each day
'Cause I'm a sinner now
And all my sins I've found
They won't wash away

I should be living the life and not tryna fight it
Instead of giving it up I'm just tryna hide it

You can fall to your knees and pray
'Cause I'm a sinner now and I won't be saved
(I won't be saved)
I've been lying to you more each day
(More each day)
'Cause I'm a sinner now, I'm a sinner now
(A sinner now)

You can fall to your knees and pray
'Cause I'm a sinner now and I won't be saved
I've been lying to you more each day
'Cause I'm a sinner now and all my sins I've found
They won't wash away

You can fall to your knees and pray
'Cause I'm a sinner now and I won't be saved
(I won't be saved)
I've been lying to you more each day
(Been lying to you more each day)
'Cause I'm a sinner now, I'm a sinner now
(Fall to your knees and pray)

You can fall to your knees and pray
'Cause I'm a sinner now and I won't be saved
I've been lying to you more each day
'Cause I'm a sinner now, I'm a sinner now
