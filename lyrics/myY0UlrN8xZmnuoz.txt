It wasn't always like this
It wasn't always so
We did it in the darkness
We did it in the cold

Caught in a fairly extraordinary world
It's emotional
Where talking it rarely that necessary
And time doesn't count at all

Bohemian boys and Brazillian girls
A familliar noise in unfamilliar worlds
It's like a million beats in a Parisian heart
(We're made of glass)
From the boy in the West to the girl in the East
They've been working a sweat in the name of the beast
Where oblivion stops and oblivion starts
(We're made of glass)

Chorus:
Love makes the world go round
I hold it in my hands
But it slips away
(And I watch it fade)
Love is a mystery
I hear it talk to me
But the words are strange
(Like it knows my name)
Love makes the world go round
I hold it in my hands
But it slips away
(And I watch it fade)
Love is a mystery
I hear it talk to me
But the words are strange
(They're made of glass)

It wasn't always easy
It wasn't always fun
We intertwine niaively
But in the end we're one

Caught in a fairly extraordinary world
It's emotional
Where talking it rarely that necessary
And time doesn't count at all

Chorus:
Love makes the world go round
I hold it in my hands
But it slips away
(And I watch it fade)
Love is a mystery
I hear it talk to me
But the words are strange
(Like it knows my name)
Love makes the world go round
I hold it in my hands
But it slips away
(And I watch it fade)
Love is a mystery
I hear it talk to me
But the words are strange
(They're made of glass)

Bohemian boys and Brazillian girls
A familliar noise in unfamilliar worlds
It's like a million beats in a Parisian heart
(We're made of glass)
From the boy in the West to the girl in the East
They've been working a sweat in the name of the beast
Where oblivion stops and oblivion starts
(We're made of glass)
