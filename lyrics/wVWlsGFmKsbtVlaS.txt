Not gonna be the one to stay inside alone
Not gonna be the one to sit there by the phone
We've got a reputation, we'll shake it off someday
Not gonna be the ones to turn and walk away

No reservations
No hesitations
No bad reactions
Just celebrations

We don't need money to have a good time
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon
Forget our worries and do what we like
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon

Not gonna be the ones just talking to ourselves
Not gonna be the ones just sitting on the shelf
We got no education but we find a way
Not gonna be the ones to try(?) and walk today

No reservations
No hesitations
No bad reactions
Just celebrations

We don't need money to have a good time
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon
Forget our worries and do what we like
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon

Not gonna be the fools who don't know who they are
Not gonna be the fools who just say blah blah blah
We got a reputation, I ain't gonna play
Or will you be the ones to turn and walk away

No reservations
No hesitations
No bad reactions
Just celebrations

We don't need money to have a good time
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon
Forget our worries and do what we like
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon
When we were younger we had our hunger
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon
We don't need money to have a good time
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon
