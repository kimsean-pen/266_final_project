Day after day, if you were to say
What could we be, with will and belief?
Why stay apart, when we can leave together?
Would you let us leave, if I were to find a way out?
When there is nothing to gain
When there is nothing to lose
If I knew the way would you go?
When there is nothing to lose
If I asked the way would you know?
If I knew the way would you go?
Nothing to lose

Sail away. If I were to sail away, suddenly
What could we be, if we were to leave?
Nothing to lose
Sail away. If I were to sail away
Sail away
When there is nothing to gain
When there is nothing to lose
Nothing to gain
There is nothing to lose
If I knew the way would you go?
Nothing to lose
Would you, would go?
You, you, you, you, you
Go, go
Would you, would you, would you
