Many choose to find their hope
In the thoughts of afterlife
When there is none to be found
Right here before we die
So I understand
The feeling of helplessness
When we are just taught to wait here, wait here for death

Wait here for death
Wait for this suffering to end
Wait here for death, wait here for death
Wait for this suffering to end
We are not forgotten
For a kingdom is offered
Beyond that of golden streets
We can represent now
What will one day be complete

Simplicity is not a curse
Where strength is humbled and the powerless rise
This is a kingdom born upside-down
This is a kingdom where the broken are crowned

Wait here for death (wait here for death)
The "blessings" of excess are only a burden on us

It is a broken system
Where we just wait for death
It is a broken system
Where suffering can never end

Simplicity is not a curse
Where strength is humbled and the powerless rise
This is a kingdom born upside-down
This is a kingdom where the broken are crowned
The broken are crowned

If helplessness is our system then were better off upside-down
