I lost my faith, made my mistakes
Gonna find a way to make it easy
I'll be better on my own, believe me
Pain I hold back, can't live like that
Yeah, I made my peace with all of the sorrow
And now I'm livin' for tomorrow

I'm a girl with a new face, and a life that's been changed
You know, you know, you know?

I was a little bit lost, but I'm not anymore
I was a little bit hurt, but I'm not anymore
I was a little left out, but I'm not anymore
'Cause the tears fell down, but they don't anymore
I was a little messed up, but I'm not anymore
I was a little lucked out, but I'm not anymore
I was a little far gone, but I'm not anymore
Yeah it's alright now, baby I got the cure

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah it's alright now, baby I got the cure

Now it's me and myself, yeah, don't need no one else
This happiness was always inside me
But Lord, it took a minute to find me
And this freedom I found is worth a million you now
And I'm puttin' all my troubles behind me
I only need my heart to guide me

I'm a girl with a new face, and a life that's been changed
You know, you know, you know?

I was a little bit lost, but I'm not anymore
I was a little bit hurt, but I'm not anymore
I was a little left out, but I'm not anymore
'Cause the tears fell down, but they don't anymore
I was a little messed up, but I'm not anymore
I was a little lucked out, but I'm not anymore
I was a little far gone, but I'm not anymore
Yeah it's alright now, baby I got the cure

Oh, oh, oh, oh, (I got the)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, (I got the)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, (I got the cure)
Yeah it's alright now, baby I got the cure
Oh, oh, oh, oh, (I got the)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, (I got the)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, (I got the cure)
Yeah it's alright now, baby I got the cure

And I
And I'll learn to love again
'Cause I
'Cause I finally understand

I was a little bit lost, but I'm not anymore
I was a little bit hurt, but I'm not anymore
I was a little left out, but I'm not anymore
(Little bit oh, little bit oh)
'Cause the tears fell down, but they don't anymore
I was a little messed up, but I'm not anymore
I was a little lucked out, but I'm not anymore
I was a little far gone, but I'm not anymore
(Tears fell down now, tears fell down now, tears fell down now)
Yeah it's alright now, baby I got the cure
I was a little bit lost, but I'm not anymore
I was a little bit hurt, but I'm not anymore
