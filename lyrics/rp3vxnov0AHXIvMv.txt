Hey, let's all go into the forest
Nobody will notice for a while
There we can visit all the creatures,
Maybe they can teach us facts of life

Or we can travel to the ocean
Don't forget your lotion,
It's quite hot
I once met seven lovely crabs
They said I should go back and join them for tea

Oh wait, the forest got demolished
When they built the airport years ago
But we can still go see the ocean
'Cause they put it in a bowl at the mall
