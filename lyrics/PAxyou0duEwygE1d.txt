Born out of pain, of fire and flame
A creature so deadly to all
Spikes on her back, and wings on her side
A heavenly storm in the sky

In shades of grey and stories full of magic
Through heaven's gate we fly

In the valley of the holy
In the dragons territory
For the kingdom and the glory
Set in fire
Battle in the sky

The fight of her life, she cuts like a knife
Unveiling the power she holds
Marks on her skin, and scales on her back
The cry carries forevermore

In shades of grey and stories full of magic
Through heaven's gate we fly

In the valley of the holy
In the dragons territory
For the kingdom and the glory
Set in fire
Battle in the sky

"When the dragon lies bleeding
And the protector of the realm has fallen"
"My sword and my armour is broken
And the dawn of a new era begins"

In the dark of the night
When the moon's shining bright
My defender of kings we bow in sorrow
In the first morning light
I'll call on the eve of the fight we fall
My defender of kings, we rise tomorrow
In the wake of an army broken
In the words of a spell unspoken
My defender of kings
We bow and follow by your side

In the valley of the holy
In the dragons territory
For the kingdom and the glory
Set in fire
Battle in the sky
