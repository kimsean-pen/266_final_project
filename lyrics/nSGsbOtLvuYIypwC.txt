Come down off your high horse
Who do you think you are?
Just a clown in a one horse town in a broke down second-hand car

Can you still get it up?
Or are we pushing too hard?
If you wanna get your hands on a beautiful girl
You gotta use a MasterCard

There's no excuse for bullshit
So don't try to feed me none
You better shake some action
Bring it on, bring it on

You don't like the way we speak
You don't like it when you lose
You shouldn't be sad, don't get mad
Or we're gonna teach you how to sing the blues

Get on your horse and ride
Where shall we go today?
Let's go to a place I know, where the speedfreaks babble all day

Can you still talk dirty?
Or are you gonna be mean?
If you ever speak to a beautiful girl
She'll laugh you right out of your jeans

There's no reason we should listen
Why do you talk so much?
You better bite your finger
Bring it up, bring it up

You don't like the way we fight
You don't have a fucking clue
You won't be great, but don't be late
Or we're gonna teach you how to sing the blues

There's nothing out here for you
Why would you wait so long?
You better shake your moneymaker
Bring it on, bring it on

You don't like the way we laugh
At you and your retro shoes
Don't be a heel or an imbecile
Or we're gonna teach you how to sing the blues

You ain't gonna be no hero
'Cause you ain't got nothing to lose
So move it out and shut your mouth
Or we're gonna teach you how to sing the blues

Teach you how to sing the blues
