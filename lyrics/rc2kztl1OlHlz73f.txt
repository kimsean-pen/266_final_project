With the wind at your back and the light in your eyes,
the freeze of your blindness will show.

Under the cloud cover, the flares signal change.
Will you ever know?

The fields they are burning, the smoke chokes your breath.
Will you stand or run?

You dream of a mountain, the peaks rise to the sky.
Will you answer its call?

Is your heart still beating? Can you feel this at all?
This landslide will bury us all.

With the storm on your mind and the clouds in your eyes,
will you survive?

Lie in wait, I will lie awake.
Falling through a world unknown.
