There must be an explanation
A logical way to find
The constant paranormal is nothing that
That can't be defined...

'Cause she's the only one
Thinking it through.
She's got the shoulder pads,
No nonsense attitude.

The truth is out there,
But so are lies.
To see the world through
Dana Katherine Scully's eyes.
The picture of composure,
She knows the facts and she won't pacify.
She wants to know what's out there,
But she needs to know why.

'Cause she's the only one
Thinking it through.
She's got the perfect hair,
No nonsense attitude.

The truth is out there,
But so are lies.
To see the world through
Dana Katherine Scully's eyes.

There's a monster every single week,
Lost time and ghosts in the machine.
There's a bee dome in the desert;
Searching for the sister forever.
The truth is out there,
But so are lies.
To see the world through
Dana Katherine Scully's eyes.
She owns the (?)
She separates the fact from fiction.
