It's like I dressed up in my momma's clothing
It's like I'm talking to a voice that doesn't exist
It's like I got a wire crossed upstairs
But all I want is just a little truth and that's it

They say I'm mental but I'm just confused
They say I'm mental but I've been abused
They say I'm mental 'cause I'm not amused by it all

Another anchor man is on the TV
He's got that far away and vacant look in his eyes
I turn the channel but nothing is changing
The only truth is that everything is a lie

They say I'm mental but I'm just confused
They say I'm mental but I've been abused
They say I'm mental 'cause I'm not amused by it all

There's truth in everything
There's truth in lies
With all this knowledge
Well I think I'm gonna be wise

They say I'm mental but I'm just confused
They say I'm mental but I've been abused
They say I'm mental 'cause I'm not amused by it all
