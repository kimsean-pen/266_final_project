Darling you know exactly what happened, last year just about this time
Yes you know exactly what happened, last year just about this time
You asked me for one hundred dollars, and I didn't have but ninety nine

Yes I'm in love with the little girl, just because she's so nice and kind
I'm in love, I'm in love with the little girl, just because she's so nice and kind
I was so sorry when she asked me for one hundred dollars,
I couldn't give her but ninety nine

Yes my baby taken sick on July twenty-nine
Yes the one I love she taken sick on July twenty-nine
Her doctor billed her four hundred dollars,
And I didn't have but three hundred and ninety nine
