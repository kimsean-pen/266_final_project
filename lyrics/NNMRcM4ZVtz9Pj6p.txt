What if I changed my mind
What if I said it's over
I been flying so long
Can't remember what it was like to be sober
What if I lost my lives?
What if I said "Game over"?
What if I forget my lies?
And I lose all my composure

Honestly, she's the only one
That's watching over me
Gives me oxygen when it gets hard to breathe
And if I'm wrong or right
She's always on my side
And if I lose the fight

I know she'll bring me back
Bring me back, bring me back to life
Bring me back
Bring me back, bring me back to life

What if we never met
What if I never saw her
'Cause I've been burning up for so long
In a world that just keeps getting colder

Honestly, she's the only one
That's watching over me
Gives me oxygen when it gets hard to breathe
And if I'm wrong or right
She's always on my side
And if I lose the fight

I know she'll bring me back
Bring me back, bring me back to life
Bring me back
Bring me back, bring me back to life

Nobody does this like you
I've been around the world
I seen a lot of girls
I been a lot of places
I seen a lot of faces
Nobody does this like you

Honestly she's the only one
That's watching over me
Gives me oxygen when it gets hard to breathe
And if I'm wrong or right
She's always on my side
And if I lose the fight
I know she'll bring me back to life
