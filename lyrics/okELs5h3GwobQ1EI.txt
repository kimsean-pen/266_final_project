Silently obsessing
Over the upsetting
Words to come
Forgive me tonight

I picked out a corner
I feel the sweat pouring
My chest gets tight
As we sit down to dine

We toast
Compose

Pushed away
The flowers
And looked into
Those soaring eyes
Those sorry eyes
Begin

Lean in and fire
We fought loud
We fight loud
Built up inside us
We hold out
We held out
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Forcing out the silence

I'll make up for what's happening
I'll make up for what's going to be
I'll make it up

At 17 I woke and left behind
All traces of my springtide life
At 17 times were rough, but I won't deny
I still haven't tried to recover
That 17th summer was the best I'd remember
Cause after that summer I'd never recover
That 17th summer was the best I'd remember
Cause after that summer I'd never recover

Try
You wanted to find something inside
I won't deny
Holding up lights in front of my eyes
I'd never disowned you...
Not in my life
