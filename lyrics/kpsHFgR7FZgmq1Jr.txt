Aquabats, The
The Fury Of The Aquabats
Super Rad
I had a small friend,
Who had a fat friend
Who had a big friend
Who gave birth to many friends
With our flashlights to the sky
We waited for them to land.

I got two tall friends
Who know my small friend
Who seem to have a problem with you
They got roman candles
Bottle rockets for the vandals
Who covered our lockers in glue.

(bridge)
We're on our way here we go
We're gonna take over
Set it off one last time
Here we come again.

We were strangers
And we were pilgrims
Role models of the family man
Pioneers and patriarchs
Patriots and matriarchs
Staking out the promised land

Our little army
We were commandos
Gorillas with decoder rings
We felt some opposition
From some villains
Who were wishin'
They could be cadets and kings.

(bridge)

(chorus)
All systems go!
Soon the world will know
The fury of attack
Feel the wrath of
The super rad
The super rad
Super rad!

And if we die
Before the battle's through
Tell our mom's, tell our dads
That we were super rad!

(bridge)

(chorus x2)

All systems go
As we step into the octagon
Feel the wrath of mission code name:
Applesauce applesauce applesauce

Super rad!
