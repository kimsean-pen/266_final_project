Oh since you're crazy
Act like it baby
No instinct for monogamy
Oh since you're crazy
Unlock it baby
Reach down and be who you need to be
Oh since you're crazy
Act like it baby
No instinct for monogamy
We look so scared now
We're both prepared
Dig down and be who you wanna be
Be you on top of me

Holy at night your eyes push through me
I feel the blood squeeze from my heart
Only the undressing of heaven cuts the air

No accusations
I don't wanna tell you anymore
All the way until it's gone
No complications
I don't wanna argue anymore
All the way until it's done

Oh since you're crazy
Unlock it baby
No instinct for monogamy
We seem so scared now
But we're prepared
Reach down and be who you wanna be
Be you on top of me
It just might set us free
It just might set us

Holy at night your eyes push through me
I feel the blood squeeze from my heart
Only the out-crying of heaven cuts the air

There is nothing I want more than to die with you next to me
Right next to me

Now everyone is gone
I've got you all alone I can't believe the road we're on
Your touch speaks to me
At last we can be deliberate

When everything's coincidence
There's less responsibility and barely consequence
In a world out of time
Should yours become mine
I'm fortunate
I'm fortunate
I'm fortunate
