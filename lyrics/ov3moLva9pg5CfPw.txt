I
I wonder why
I wonder why
I've come undone

I've come undone
Stay with me lord

Play with me
O.K. I know, I missed it
The point I mean, I missed it
So (So could I know?)

And if I could (could change it all)
Good God I would

Stay with me lord
Play with me
Now I see the way I'm headed
Down and down, the youth descended
Have it here and without worry

Baby please, there is no hurry
I'm fine

Stay with me lord

Play with me
Stay with me lord
Play with me
Ego?!... It's only a song!
Fire it up!!!

We are the word, we are the one!
We are forever debted to you, so we know you'll come!
Now I see the way I'm headed
Down and down, the truth descended
Hell is here, but it has no fury
Woman still, there is no hurry
I'm fine!
Stay with me lord (Play with me)
