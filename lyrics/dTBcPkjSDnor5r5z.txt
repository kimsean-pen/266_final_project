I can brave the cold alone
I'm sleeping on the ground
I hate your golden throne
But want it for my own
I see that I'm the one
Who's breakin' us in two
How could this be the end?

You're my, you're my
Number Thirteen
You're my, you're my
Loss of control
You're my, you're my
Everything
You're my, you're my...

Rake our nose across the stone
We're never leaving home
We're headed to the West
Beyond the dying breath
Our boots will scratch and scrape
But we cannot escape
We're running to our fate

You're my, you're my
Number Thirteen
You're my, you're my
Loss of control
You're my, you're my
Everything
You're my, you're my...

I know the fields are burnin'
Blacks out the cruelest dawn
I hear the God's a-screamin'
The war goes on and on

I can brave the cold alone
I'm sleeping underground
I've made your golden throne
But want it for my own
I see that I'm the one
Who's breakin' us in two
How could this be the end?

You're my, you're my
Number Thirteen
You're my, you're my
Loss of control
You're my, you're my
Everything
You're my, you're my...
