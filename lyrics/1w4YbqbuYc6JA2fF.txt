I'm barely operating
Yet a functional being
I always seemed to be vacant
parading myself as an abductee
Then one day I was transposed
from a simple young man
to a godly tomato that held all existence
and told me that we should expand

and now the world always seems to revolve

around me
I'll wake up and I will always be fine
now I know
Everything will always will be easy
and the way I like
I'm grateful that I held that tomato
So he could change my life
Cause i'm different
At least I thought so.

What a triumphant occasion
to change your design
that one has left my head on a pillow on my cloud nine
I wonder how many more fruits
can connect to my head
I would take a papaya
travel the world and the universe as two best friends

and the world will always revolve

Now we're different

Time, I'm coming back with
