For the culture
Real culture
(Ego)
For all my niggas

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, look

When it payback with a Maybach
I'ma lay back on the low
For the meantime, let me fuck once til' I say I gotta go
Tell her stay back, tell her A$AP, I don't play that with a ho
She gon' hate that, she gon' say that I'm an asshole but I know
Listen, nigga
You ain't really 'bout the shit
I been balling from the start and now I'm really 'bout to spit
Who you fuckin' with?
'Bout to kill the game with a hit
Started eating tracks and we ain't never starved ever since
Goddamn
I say damn too much
I feel like my niggas buying grams too much
Goddamn
Think I am too much
Making moves but I think I plan too much
God.damn
They don't hand too much, even when they do I never plan to touch
I stand with the fam too much
Fuck with us and they gon' say he ran too much

I promise all my niggas gon' ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride
I promise all my niggas gon' ride
And we gon' push you to the side, to the side, to the side
I promise all my niggas gon' ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride
I promise all my niggas gon' ride (yuh)
And we gon' push you to the side, to the side, to the side

Listen ho
Don't ask me for the word
I'm the type that don't give a fuck about what you heard
You the type to let any bullshit get on your nerves
We the type to get anything we think we deserve and splurge
I'm going big, bitch I'm going big
I been saying that shit ever since I was a kid
I been doing shit I thought I never woulda did
There's no sleeping in the crib, but they sleeping on the kid
Whoa, oh man
I don't think I wanna go through this again
Cousin told me that my flow would probably purchase me a Benz
Mama told me "watch your back, don't be depending on a friend"
That's why all my niggas real you
see ain't none of this pretend, oh man
I don't think them other niggas understand
Started rapping so they'd listen and they still don't comprehend
What a nigga got to do to let 'em know we coming in
It don't finish, it don't end
Been working since I was ten

I promise all my niggas gon' ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride
I promise all my niggas gon' ride
And we gon' push you to the side, to the side, to the side
I promise all my niggas gon' ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride
I promise all my niggas gon' ride (yuh)
And we gon' push you to the side, to the side, to the side
