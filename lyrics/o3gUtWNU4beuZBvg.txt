Censor, censor, realize
Censor, censor, no friend of mine
Time won't keep us anymore
It's the usefulness of letting go

Your perfect plan has come and gone
Like the nuclear centuries' benefits
They say
You bought the same old trip

So innocent you're out of reach
You bought the same old trip
Lawful, vengeful, awful, friendship, misfits
Bits of feeling, thieving, fits inside revealing
Time to censor, censor, realize
Censor, censor, no friend of mine
You bought the same old trip
So innocent you're out of reach (we don't mind the scope)
You bought the same old trip
Sigh of relief inside of a dream (we all lie)

You bought the same old
Censor, censor, realize
Censor, censor, paid to
Censor, censor, realize

Censor, censor, no friend of mine
You bought the same old trip
So innocent you're out of reach (we don't mind the scope)
You bought the same old trip
Sigh of relief inside of a dream (we all lie beyond)
You bought the same old trip
You bought the same old trip (we don't mind the scope)
You bought the same old
