Things that you thought you'd be
Shake mediocrity, you know
Burbs or the streets
Doesn't matter where the crows don't eat
Where the crows don't feast
On the hungry and the weak

Click click, pen to the track
After this babe you can't go back, you know
Cus if you aint all that
Might as well have your bags by the door to go
Because you're on your own
Because you're on your own

(And they say)
Put me back together
Fix my broken mind
Make them wheels roll
Oh lord
Make them wheels roll

Back to the grind
conform or redesign, you know
No place for a cog that thinks all on their own
Just flesh and bone
Oh just flesh and bone

(And they say)
Put me back together
Fix my broken mind
Make them wheels roll
Oh lord
Make them wheels roll x2

(And they say)
Put me back together
Fix my broken mind
Make them wheels roll (yeah, yeah)
Oh lord
Make them wheels roll
(where am i supposed to go, my love)

Put me back together
Fix my broken mind
Make them wheels roll (yeah, yeah)
Oh lord (yeah, yeah)
Make them wheels roll
