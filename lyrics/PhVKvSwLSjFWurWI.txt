Woke up this morning
With a smile on my face
Jumped out of bed, took a shower, dressed
Cleaned up my place
Made me some breakfast, toast
Two scrambled eggs, grit
Grabbed my keys, grabbed my purse
Grabbed my jacket, off to work
Beaming all the way down third

Is it the way you love me, baby?
Is it the way you love me, baby?

4:30, can't wait to get home
Naw girl, I got something else to do
Go 'head, really get your groove on
'Cause tonight my man's coming through
We gon' have to connect some other time
As much as I like to shake my thing on the dance floor
I got another, nasty, freaky, just right way in mind
Tonight, I'm gonna beat the high score

Is it the way you love me, baby?
Is it the way you love me, baby?
Is it the way you love me, baby?
Is it the way you love me, baby?
