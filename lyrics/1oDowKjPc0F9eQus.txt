Submerged in subjugated provocation
Thy euphoric misfortune (tribulation)
Laceration upon my flesh
Diminishing lucidity unto a void of perversion

The fulfilling desolation, in flames I arise!

Possession, entraps my mortal soul
Demented, hunger of anguish I crave

The feast of 2000 years,
The sin of abomination I foresee

Damned in Christ's blood, thy soul is not of he
Catholic degeneration, unholy desolation

Perversions of the trinity,
The sign of unholy victory
Angels falling, burn eternally
666, blasphemy!

We ride as one through a sea of eternal sewage
The dawn of retribution is among thee
Fighting 'til death, annihilation is evident, obliteration.
