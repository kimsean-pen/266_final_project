Daylight won't stop the flashing lights
It feels like a thousand years have gone by without you
I miss someone like you
I wanna tell you secret things
My lips won't say anything that make sense

I wanna run to you
But my legs won't respond
I wanna know
Exactly what you are
If you come dance with me
I think you will like my moves
If you get next to me
I will have nothing left to prove

Here I am
There you are
Just inches away
But still too far

Look in my eyes
You'll see the reflection of you
In me, On me, my eyes
I have nothing left to prove

I wanna run to you
But my legs won't respond
I wanna know
Exactly what you are
If you come dance with me
I think you will like my moves
If you get next to me
I will have nothing left to prove

Here I am
There you are
There's nothing left between us
Nothing left between us
So dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
