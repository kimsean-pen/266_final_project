Stepping out tonight, flying so high
Its the good times keeping me alive
Are you ready to hit it running?
This is where it's at six in the morning

You can't fake this, only imitate this
You wanna lose control
You wanna lose control
You can't fake this, only imitate this
You wanna lose control
You wanna lose control

The way that she does it, I can't get enough

Attack! We keep it on the dance floor
Discotech! Meet me at the back door
Let's get down, we've been waiting a long time
A long time
She's back, I can feel it in the air
Discotech! You know she's gonna be there
Let's get down, we've been waiting a long time
A long time

(The way that she does it, I can't get enough)

Show up in the crowd, take a look around
Me and my crew, we came to get down
She's giving me looks, I can't help it
The way I'm feeling, it's gonna happen

You can't fake this, only imitate this
You wanna lose control
You wanna lose control
You can't fake this, only imitate this
You wanna lose control
You wanna lose control

The way that she does it, I can't get enough

Attack! We keep it on the dance floor
Discotech! Meet me at the back door
Let's get down, we've been waiting a long time
A long time
She's back, I can feel it in the air
Discotech! You know she's gonna be there
Let's get down, we've been waiting a long time
A long time

You make fast living look just fine
Looks like I got here just in time
Tonight, the city is yours and mine
But it won't last forever...

Attack! We keep it on the dance floor
Discotech! Meet me at the back door
Let's get down, we've been waiting a long time
A long time
She's back, I can feel it in the air
Discotech! You know she's gonna be there
Let's get down, we've been waiting a long time
A long time
