Mercury
Creeping on the sea
How she wails
Flails her arms and weeps
Accumulation of debris
Lips apart
Flapping as a lark
For in the dark there is release

Every familiarity scarce as the great white shark

Oh, to build
Walls with golden gills
Spike in hand
High above the sand
To kill the sanctuary

Every mile that is owned
Only stands still by the grace of the stone

Every familiarity scares as the great white shark

Look, daughter and owl
Listen to her howl
I howled when you were born to me
And you're alive with a breath you can't see
Oh, by the grace of this dream
