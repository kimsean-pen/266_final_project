A higher power underground
From seraph skies and now to chaos bound
He's sitting sacred and profound
In midst of sinners lifting up to kiss his crown

Pathetic humans in despair
Defaced, deflowered, now to death devout
A fallen angel in His lair
In midst of sinners kneeling down before his clout

Old One,
Master
All beauty lies within
Old One,
Master
All beauty lies within you

This oasis is a poison well
Of rotting carcasses that clog the deep
A prince in exile here in Hell
In midst of sinners flocking up like soulless sheep

Old One,
Master
All beauty lies within
Old One,
Master
All beauty lies within you

Old One,
Master
All beauty lies within
Old One,
Master
All beauty lies within you

Old One,
Master
All beauty lies within
Old One,
Master
All beauty lies within you

...Your Infernal Majesty
