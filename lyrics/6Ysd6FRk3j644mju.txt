Little hands, shoeless feet, lonely eyes looking back at me
Will we leave behind the innocent too brief
On their own, on the run when their lives have only begun
These could be our daughters and our sons
And just like a drum I can hear their hearts beating
I know my God won't let them be defeated

Every child has a dream to belong and be loved
Boys become kings, girls will be queens
Wrapped in Your majesty
When we love, when we love the least of these
Then they will be brave and free
Shout your name in victory

When we love when we love the least of these
When we love the least of these
Break our hearts once again
Help us to remember when we were only children hoping for a friend
Won't you look around these are the lives that the world has forgotten

Waiting for doors of our hearts and our homes to open
Boys become kings, girls will be queens
wraped in your majesty

When we love, when we love the least of these
Then they will be brave and free
shout your name in vitory
when we love, when we love the least of these
when we love the least of these
If not us who will be like Jesus
To the least of these
If not us tell me who will be like Jesus
Like Jesus to the least of these
Boys become kings, girls will be queens
Wrapped in your majesty
When we love, when we love the least of these
Then they will be brave and free shout your name in victory
We will love we will love the least of these
We will love the least of these
(Boys become kings)
We will love the least of these
(Girls become queens)
We will love the least of these
(Boys become kings)
We will love the least of these
(Girls become queens)
We will love the least of these
