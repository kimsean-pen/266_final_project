Here with you now I'm good, still miss you
I don't know what I can do, we can't be true

満たされる事なく二人の距離
縮まって行く度切ない...

あふれ出した想いつのるだけで
Uh It's hard for me to say
Cuz we can see how it's going to end
But I got my love for you
もしもこのまま君を忘れることができたら

なんて思えば思うほどに
君を忘れることなんて僕にはできるはずもなくて
We always wish tonight could last forever
I can be your side
I shouldn't be in your heart
Either the time we have spent
And I want you to know what the truth is
But sometimes it makes me feel so sick, oh no
I just can say to you, No I won't
Cuz we can see how it's going to end
But I got my Love for you
もしもこのまま君を忘れてしまったら

二度と愛す事もないかな？
僕は本当にそれで心から幸せと言えるかな？
Yes, we always wish tonight could last forever
I can be your side
