I don't care
If your beautiful lips
Exist out there
'Cause I'm wonderless

Why the best can't make it in Hollywood
No more
It's like a long drag taken before the smoke hits the white sky
Like the birds at night

& it's fake, just like the movies
Oh, yeah
& I can't wait
Just to see you again
& your 2 faces are locked on mine

Had the worst time chasing the thought away
No hope
(Oh, no hope)
'Cause maybe I'm a fake

Maybe you're to blame
Maybe I'm a star
(Stumbling drunk light)
My mistakes I've made won't leave me

Alone
Oh, no
& if you don't find me on the front page
Find a way to say that you saw me
& if you don't find me in a movie
Find a way to say that you knew me
& if you don't find me on the front page
Find a way to say that you saw me
& if you don't find me at all
Then I won't care
Oh, yeah
If I could find a place for the holiday
Maybe I would call
You're a payphone away from the mess that I've become
I'm destroying what I love
