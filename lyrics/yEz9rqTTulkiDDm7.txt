Is this on?
OK, after four!
Four!

I used to think she was the greatest thing
I really can't give her a diamond ring
She said she'd rather die than ever leave me

Well I never saw her face since then
And if the law don't get her then I will
Four little diamonds

She must be somewhere on the open road
She always said she was the lonely one
She gets you down with her tales of woe

She took me for everything
And if the law don't get her then I will
Four little diamonds

Ooooo
Four little diamonds

I looked around, I climbed up high into the dawn
But she was gone into the night

I thought about the things she said and all the things we'd done
But where could she run
There's just no answer to give

I keep a-wonderin' 'bout her day and night
She probably thinks I was a fool, she's right
She don't know it but I'm gonna keep on searchin for that woman

I'm gonna search everywhere
And if the law don't get her then I will
Four little diamonds

Ooooo
Four little diamonds

I looked around, I climbed up high into the dawn
But she was gone into the night
I thought about the things she said and all the things we'd done
But she ran away
There's just to answer to give

I still hear her callin' out to me
I still listen for her endlessly
But it never even crossed my mind, she was a cheater

I gotta find out where she hides
Cause if the law don't get her then I will
Four little diamonds
Said if the law don't get her then I will
Four little diamonds
Said if the law don't get her then I will
Four little diamonds
Four little diamonds
Four little diamonds
Four little diamonds
Four little diamonds
Four little diamonds
Four little diamonds
