Waiting on the day,
When my thoughts are my own,
When this house is my home,
And plans are made.
When you'll be there for me baby
When you'll love me all the way
When you'll take my side in every little fire fight
When you'll hang your things and stay.

I'm waiting on the day.
When my life on the run
Bleaches out in the sun
And shows my age
Waiting on the day,
When that voice comes to say
That it's not wrong what you did for just a kid

When you'll be there for me baby.
When you'll love me all the way.
When you'll take my side in every little fire fight
When you'll hang your things and stay

I'm waiting on the day,
waiting on the day
When these words are in stone.
When the kids are all grown,
And we go dancing.
Oh, can you do it babe?
Can you love me all the way?
Will you tie me tight in little strands of paradise?
Will you walk with me before the morning fades?

I'm waiting on the day.
Waiting on the day.
