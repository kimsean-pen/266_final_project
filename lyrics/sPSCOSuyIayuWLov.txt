Tonight we are victorious
Champagne pouring over us
All my friends were glorious
Tonight we are victorious

Oh oh oh oh victorious
Oh oh oh oh

Double bubble disco queen
Headed to the guillotine
Skin as cool as Steve McQueen
Let me be your killer king
It hurts until it stops
We will love until it's not
I'm a killing spree in white
Eyes like broken Christmas lights

My touch is black and poisonous
And nothing like my punch drunk kiss
I know you need it
Do you feel it
Drink the water
Drink the wine

Oh we gotta turn up the crazy
Livin' like a washed up celebrity
Shooting fireworks like it's the fourth of July
Until we feel all right
Until we feel all right

I'm like a scarf trick
It's all up the sleeve
I taste like magic
Waves that swallow quick and deep
Throw the bait
Catch the shark
Bleed the water red
Fifty words for murder
And I'm every one of them

My touch is black and poisonous
And nothing like my punch drunk kiss
I know you need it
Do you feel it
Drink the water
Drink the wine

Oh we gotta turn up the crazy
Livin' like a washed up celebrity
Shooting fireworks like it's the fourth of July

Tonight we are victorious
Champagne pouring over us
All my friends were glorious
Tonight we are victorious

Tonight we are victorious
Champagne pouring over us
All my friends were glorious
Tonight we are victorious

Oh we gotta turn up the crazy
Livin' like a washed up celebrity
Shooting fireworks like it's the fourth of July
Until we feel all right
Until we feel all right

Tonight we are victorious
Champagne pouring over us
All my friends were glorious
Tonight we are victorious
