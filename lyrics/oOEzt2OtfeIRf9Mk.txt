It's a new day
Just in time for me to say
I'm sorry
For all the things I said
I didn't mean
It's a new time
So why must
I wait in line for what is mine?
It's a new day
Why must it be the same?
Been gone too long
So don't wait up
It's 3 am
I got held up
Tried to call
I'm on my way
Will I see you?
I've got lost in foreign lands
Tried to get back
I hoped you understand
Just remember
The love is a gun in your hand
It's a new year
Just in time for me to say
I'd be there
But didn't make the great
To new time
So why must I wait in line for what is mine?
It's a new day always feels the same
Been gone too long
So don't wait up
It's 3 am
I got held up
Tried to call
I'm on my way
Will I see you?
I've got lost in foreign lands
Tried to get back
I hoped you understand
Wait forever
The love is a gun in your hand
In the deep blue
I'm a hundred milles away
Treading water
It's too deep for me too stay
Just remember
Love is a gun in your hand
Just in time for me to say
I'm sorry
Why must I wait in line for what is mine?
In the deep blue
See the whitecaps from the shore
But I can't swim
And it keep me wanting more
Just remember
Love is a gun in your hand
Will I see you?
I've got lost in in foreign lands
Tried to make it back
I hoped you understand
Wait forever
For love is a gun in your hand.
