I'm not asking
Such a hard thing to do
I'm not asking you
To be the stronger of us two
I just want you to be happy
Every step of the way
When I'm in this sunny valley
When I'm walking in the way
I'm not asking
Such a strange thing to do
To be there for me
To love what I do
I just want you to be happy
Every step of the way
When I'm in this sunny valley
When I'm walking in the way

I'm not asking
For anything out of the blue
I don't want you to
Be the one to pull me through
I just want you to be happy
Every step of the way
When I'm in this sunny valley
When I'm walking in the way
When I'm walking in the way
