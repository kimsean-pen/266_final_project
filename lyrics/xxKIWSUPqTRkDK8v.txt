Eerie whispers
Trapped beneath my pillow
You won't let me see
Your memories

And I know you're in this room
I'm sure I heard you sigh
Floating in between
Where our worlds collide

It scares the hell out of me
And the end is all I can see
And it scares the hell out of me
And the end is all I can see
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa

And I know the moment's near
And there's nothing we can do
Look through a faithless eye
Are you afraid to die?

It scares the hell out of me
And the end is all I can see
And it scares the hell out of me
And the end is all I can see
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa

It scares the hell out of me
And the end is all I can see
And it scares the hell out of me
And the end is all I can see
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa
