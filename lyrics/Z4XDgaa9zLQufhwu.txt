Did you think I could stop being selfish?
I do what I can but it's chemical
There are just some things you can't change
Like the color of your eyes
Or how your hair parts to one side naturally
Please don't tell me to change
I'm more than content living this way
And I hope some day
That you will feel the same about me
If you could change anything
Please just stay the same
Because I love everyting about you
It's the color of your hair (the color of your hair)
The way you rub your eyes when you get tired
And how you can fall asleep nearly anywhere
And you said I'm just too thin
And you hate your dad and I'm just like him
I always become afraid when shit gets real
I've lost all of my composure
Floating down your stairs breaking souvenirs
That your grandmother handed down to you
Let's just say I messed everything up
And my attitude starts her damage (?)
I will never be what you need
