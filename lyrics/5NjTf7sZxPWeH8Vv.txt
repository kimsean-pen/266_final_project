Reading the madness they took her away under the cross
Bailiff and bishop and monk
Malleus Maleficarum, the law
Prayed for salvation, I fought for her soul
Scared by the horned
The devil was creeping around
Until she died in the flames as he saw

Father forgive me for I've hardly seen
The human deep within
Just an intention, so holy and clear
Paving the way to madness for us

Serpents on the way to paradise
Dying for love, fighting for ages
Serpents on their way to paradise
Raging with anger and pain for the cross

Father forgive me for what I have done
For I betrayed the one that I loved like a son
Demons and spells are they reality?
The pest and the schism, the power of the Moor
We've got to fight
Keep our people afraid
Keep them away from what they shall not see

I see a menace to our paradise
In these evil times
Heaves is burning, people are yearning
For a new doctrine, they are

Serpents on the way to paradise
Don't know they'll end in final damnation
Serpents on their way to paradise
Raging with anger and pain for the cross

Lord if I'm an unbeliever, what do I believe?
Can you tell me lord what you had done
If you were me?
I have stared into the eyes
Of innocence and fear
I saw Anna in the tower in a lake of tears
Something strange is going on and
Still I don't know why
I have stared into the secrets
They still try to hide

Vandroiy can you tell me what you know about it all?
Vandroiy can you help me
To leave this prison hall?
Vandroiy can you help me
Free Anna from the chain?
Vandroiy can you help me
To become a little sane?

Serpents on the way to paradise
Dying for love, fighting for ages
Serpents on their way to paradise
Raging with anger and pain

Serpents on the way to paradise
Dying for love, fighting for ages
Serpents on their way to paradise
Raging with anger and pain
