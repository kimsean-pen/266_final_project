You told me that you're moving on
But it feels just like giving up
I want to tell you how I feel
But I don't want to make you feel
Like it's your fault for leaving me at all

But this won't change the way I look at you
This will change how I sleep
I wish I would have cherished it
You used to keep me warm
Now my warmth comes from embarrassment

Why can't things go the way I hope?
The way I want them too?
(At all)
Always how I assumed they will
(At all)
How they always do
Why can't things go the way I hope?
The way I want them too?
(Is that all)
Always how I assumed they will
(At all)
How they always do

Simply but life can't not be defined it can't be simply put
But you gotta do your best 'cuz nobody forgets the things that they regret
There's no rewind and I should have kept that in mind
But on the bright side I'd say I prefer sadness over spineless anyway

But this won't change the way I look at you
This will change how I sleep
I wish I would have cherished it
You used to keep me warm
Now my warmth comes from embarrassment

I hope things go the way I hope
