When I was a little bit younger
The strain I was under could make me cry

Now I'm a little but older, a little bit bolder
But never so shy

Sweet darlin', come hold me
Just a little bit longer now

Sweet darlin', come hold me
Just a little bit longer now

When things were a little bit clearer,
When we got nearer I shrugged from your touch
Now that I know what I want, see
I think that it haunts me,
I want you too much

Sweet darlin', come hold me
Just a little bit longer now

Sweet darlin', come hold me
Just a little bit longer now

Sweet darlin', come hold me
Just a little bit longer now

Sweet darlin', come hold me
Just a little bit longer now

Sweet darlin', come hold me
Just a little bit longer now

Sweet darlin', come hold me
Just a little bit longer now

Sweet darlin', come hold me
Just a little bit longer now

Sweet darlin', come hold me
Just a little bit longer now

Sweet darlin', come hold me
Just a little bit longer now

Sweet darlin', come hold me
Just a little bit longer now
