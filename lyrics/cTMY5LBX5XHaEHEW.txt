She's up in the sky
She's up in the domes
She's up in the sky
Up in the dome

I knew a girl who came from Villa Luz
Had a house filled with
Religious regret and infinite debt
Heaven's pressure

She's a light in the dark
She's out of the fire
She's up in the sky
Up in the domes

Alabaster lover
You go and get gone
We make each other
You won't get more

Alabaster lover
You won't get more
We make each other
You won't get more

She's up in the sky
And the sky is on fire
She said the hope
Make the hope to lie

Then in a peep hole
I will read out all of their names
Run away, run away, run away

And with victory
The whole world would be ours
We will feel nothing ever
Nothing ever

Alabaster lover
You won't get more
We could make each other
You won't get more
Alabaster lover
You won't get more
We made each other
You won't get more
Alabaster lover
We made each other
