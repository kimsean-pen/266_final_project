Open up my brain
Tell me what you see
I can't find a thing
Won't you rescue me?
Rescue me

Help me stay awake
I've been skipping days
I'm not making sense
Time, it has no frame
Has no frame

Daylight dreaming
Darkness seeking
Daylight dreaming
There must be some kind of way out of this
Way out of this
Daylight dreaming
Darkness seeking
Daylight dreaming
There must be some kind of way out of this
Way out of this

Can't keep faking it
I am not myself
Selling you blank stares
I have lost my way
Lost my way

Way out of this
Way out of this

Way out of this
Way out of this

Daylight dreaming
Darkness seeking

Time has no frame!

Well I belong right here
Where the light runs from me
I don't believe in fear
'Cause this place can't haunt me

Well I belong right here
Where the light runs from me
I don't believe in fear
'Cause this place can't haunt me
