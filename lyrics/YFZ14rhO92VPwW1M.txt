I look into the mirror, all I'm seeing is a skeleton
I keep losing weight, so they got me taking medicine
I can't go a day without relying on these sedatives
Therapy and doctors, I feel like a specimen
Every fucking night that I've been laying in my bed
Doing all I can to fight the certain sense of dread
Feeling like this panic that I have will never end
And so I fantasize about that gun up to my head
And now these pills got me feeling asleep
When I'm awake, can't get away
Even when I sleep I feel pain
Vivid visions in the past creeping into my brain
About to break, I just want to feel like I'm sane
And I just want to know what I did
Do I deserve this, like why I gotta deal with this shit, man
And I just wanna know when it happened
When I lost my mind and will I ever truly feel happy, motherfucker

I wanna know when the pain stops
Walking around with the same thoughts
I wanna know when the pain stops
Face down, fucked up with the door locked
I wanna know when the pain stops
Walking around with the same thoughts
I wanna know when the pain stops
Face down, fucked up with the door locked

I've been fighting this with everything that I have
And I've been trying to separate the good from the bad
Well, I can't see an end to all the pain that I face
I had to cancel the tour, I couldn't take any more

I feel the weight of expectation pressing down on my chest
I feel like everybody has their own belief of what's best
Meditation, medication, should I pray to a god?
I refuse to let this win and be consumed by my thoughts

I wanna know when the pain stops
I wanna know when the pain stops
I wanna know when the pain stops
I wanna know when the pain stops
I wanna know when the pain stops
I wanna know when the pain stops
I wanna know when the pain stops
I wanna know when the pain stops

I wanna know when the pain stops
Walking around with the same thoughts
I wanna know when the pain stops
Face down, fucked up with the door locked
I wanna know when the pain stops
Walking around with the same thoughts
I wanna know when the pain stops
Face down, fucked up with the door locked
