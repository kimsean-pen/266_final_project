You seem to find the dark when everything is bright
You look for all thats wrong instead of all thats right
Does it feel good to you to rain on my parade?
You never say a word unless it's to complain
Its driving me insane

If I were you
Holding the world right in my hands
The first thing I'd do
Is thank the stars for all that I have
If I were you

Look what surrounds you now
More than you ever dreamed
Have you forgotten just how hard it used to be?
So what's it going to take for you to realize?
It all could go away in one blink of an eye
It happens all the time

If I were you
Holding the world right in my hands
The first thing I'd do
Is thank the stars above
Tell the ones I love that I do
If I were you
If I were you
If I were you
If I were you

So what's it going to take for you to realize?
It all could go away in one blink of an eye
It happens all the time

If I were you
Holding the world right in my hands
The first thing I'd do
Is thank the stars above
For the ones I love
Take a breath and enjoy the view
Live the life that I've wanted to
If I were you
