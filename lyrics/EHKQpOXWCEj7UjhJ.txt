Just gimme a glimpse, I have to know
Just give me the business end to go
I wanna be done by twenty to four
Show me the bones under the floor in your room
Have I awoken something sleeping in you?

That was the future on the phone
He said it's up to me
It's up to me, it's up to me, it's up to me
I've gotta try it again
It's up to me, it's up to me, it's up to me
I've gotta figure it out
It's up to me, it's up to me, it's up to me
I said, I said

Help me
I can't do the thing you want
Can't do the thing you want
Can't do the thing you want
Help me
I can't do the thing you want
Can't do the thing you want
Can't do the thing you want

I'm loving the bass
I'm loving the drums
I cannot imagine how to be wrong
Dear life, dear life
Dear life, dear life

But that was the horror on the phone
He said, it's up to me
It's up to me, it's up to me, it's up to me
I gotta try it again
It's up to me, it's up to me, it's up to me
I gotta rip it apart
It's up to me, it's up to me, it's up to me
I said, I said

Help me
I can't do the thing you want
Can't do the thing you want
Can't do the thing you want
Help me
I can't do the thing you want
Can't do the thing you want
Can't do the thing you want
Help me
I can't do the thing you want
Can't do the thing you want
Can't do the thing you want
Help me
I can't do the thing you want
Can't do the thing you want
Can't do the thing you want

It's up to me, it's up to me, it's up to me, it's up to me
Just wanna be on my own
It's up to me, it's up to me, it's up to me
I gotta rip it apart
It's up to me, it's up to me, it's up to me
I said, said

I can't do the thing you want
Can't do the thing you want
Can't do the thing you want
Help me
I can't do the thing you want
Can't do the thing you want
Can't do the thing you want
Help me
I can't do the thing you want
Can't do the thing you want
Can't do the thing you want
Help me
I can't do the thing you want
Can't do the thing you want
Can't do the thing you want

Can't do the thing you want
Can't do the thing you want
Can't do the thing you want
Just wanna be on my own
Can't do the thing you want
Can't do the thing you want
Can't do the thing you want
Just wanna be on my own
