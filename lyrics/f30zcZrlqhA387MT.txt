Feel something right
And feel something good
'Cause if one thing works
You might know it's true, it's true

'Cause if this is the life, this is the life
This is the life, this is the life
This is the life, then who'd argue?

And if this is the life, this is the life
This is the life, this is the life
This is the life, then who'd argue?

One year, 5 days
And we're starting new
Try to make a change
It's one more thing to do, to do

'Cause if this is the life, this is the life
This is the life, this is the life
This is the life, then who'd argue?

'Cause if this is the life, this is the life
This is the life, this is the life
This is the life, then who'd argue?

And if this is the life, this is the life
This is the life, this is the life
This is the life, then who'd argue?
Then who'd argue?
