They speak of love and tolerance
They prey on people's ignorance
To make you all
Slaves of fear

They feed on your anxiety
To build their gent society
They kept you down for 1000 years

They nurture prejudice and hate
To them the wars that they create
In the name of one ample god

They gladly sacrifice your life
Increasing power is their price
Without regrets, they'll spill your blood

They're feeding you lies
With calculating smiles
With slaves made of the human mind
As long as you kneel to their authority
Religion, it's what makes you blind

They'll treat all you as mindless fools
They use you as obedient tools
It's time to set your spirit free
This world we cannot tolerate
It's time to seal all preachers fate
We looked ahead from Odin's grave

Your lives are a strain of egotistic chains
They locked you up and threw away the key
Your souls are for sale, and you're the ones who pay
But still, you'll never be set free
