Movement subdued back then
So quiet now
Subsequence systematic violence
The great cold distance
The itch
The urge
Make way
Think of something
Bring out the fear
Past the tracks
Part the ways
One stand here
Medicate
Kill the itch
Check the air
And push and push and push and get there
Monochrome
Symbol on the surface
Reduced illumination
Chemical inheritance
The lies
The fever
