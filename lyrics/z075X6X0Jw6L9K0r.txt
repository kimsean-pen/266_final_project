Do I feel alright?
I'll go anywhere you say you wanna to take me
Save me, run away-ay-ay, steal away-ay-ay
'cause I feel alright
I'll do anything you say you wanna make me
Take me, far away-ay-ay, run away-ay-ay
We've been up all night
Tryin' to avoid a situation
Hold me, let me feel your way
'cause I wanna stay
Let them all start talkin'
We won't give ourselves away
Our love leads to madness
Our love leads to madness
Our love leads to madness
Do you feel alright?
And can you see me when you're lookin' in your mirror?
Crazy, try to find a way, so your heart don't pay
Run away-ay-ay
Don't you give yourself away
Our love leads to madness
Our love leads to madness
Our love leads to madness
Our love leads to madness
