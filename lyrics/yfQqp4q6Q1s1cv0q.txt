Stitch up this heart
And hide it away
I keep it somewhere dark and safe
Watch it fade to grey

I still feel this way
When light catches your face
You open these stitches again
When I see your face
When I see your face

I guess what I'm saying is I don't wanna die alone
Keep looking around and there's nowhere left for me to roam
I can't keep my head up, there's nowhere left to go alow
Please take me home

And now we're standing here with blood on our hands
You tear me open and dig through my chest
I'm so sad and cold with the spaces you left
I stitch up my heart again and lay this to rest
To rest
