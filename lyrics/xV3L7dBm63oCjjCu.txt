If you want to kiss a funky beagle

Hitch a ride upon an eagle
Read a catalog from Spiegel
Go on and do it, do it, do it
Go on and do it, do it, do it
Hey do it, do it to it
But do it good
(Do it good)
If your read the album cover by now
You know that my name is
What my name is
(Do it good)
When I came in here to try and
Do this, something
I've never done before
Mr Jones looked at me, said to me
Don't worry about it
(Do it good)
Just do what you do
And do it good
(Do it good)
(Do it good)
Ah, fish was made for hook-in'
And grits was made for cookin'
And eyes were made for lookin'
Go on and do it, do it, do it
Go on and do it, do it, do it
Hey do it, do it to it
But do it good
(Do it good)
(Do it good)
(Do it good)
