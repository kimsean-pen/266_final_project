Oh poor twisted me
Oh poor twisted me
I feast on sympathy
I chew on suffer
I chew on agony

Swallow whole the pain
Oh it's too good to be
All this misery
Is just for oh poor twisted me
Ooh yeah

Poor twisted me
Poor mistreated me

Poor mistreated me
I drown without a sea
Lungs fill with sorrow
Lungs fill with misery
Inhaling the deep dark blue

Oh woe its me
Such a burden to be
The Poor mistreated me, yeah
Finally reached the shore

Survive the storm
Now you're bare and cold the sea was warm
so warm
You bathe your soul again

Again, and again and again yeah
Finally reached the shore
Survive the storm
Now you're bare and cold, yeah, the sea was warm

so warm
You bathe your soul again
Good to feel my friend
Oh woe it's me
Such a burden to be
Oh poor twisted me
Yo poor twisted me
Oh, Yo, Yo, poor twisted me
