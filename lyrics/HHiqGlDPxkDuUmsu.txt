On a tear across the old country
Reached out for the prize, tripped over my knees
Fell right back to the Antipodes
Clean slate
I was waiting at the dock of the bay
For another cargo ship to take me away
Cut all my losses, start again in Bombay
Clean slate

In the rain, I was waiting in vain
Wipe it clean

I left home, my love, my land
Built a castle made of sand
Felt the handcuffs on my hand
The cool handshake of aluminium
And you don't know how grave it is
My friend's eyes are wide with fear
Wipe my clean slate down with tears
Scorched earth for ten thousand years
Clean slate

Got my eyes
(Still) Got my neck
(Still) Got my chain
(Still) Got my chequebook
(Still) Got my fingers
(Still) And a toe
I've got nowhere left to go

Clean slate (Clean slate)
Clean slate (Clean slate)
Clean slate (Clean slate)
Clean slate (Clean slate)
Clean slate (Clean slate)
Clean slate (Clean slate)
Clean slate (Clean slate)
Wipe it clean
