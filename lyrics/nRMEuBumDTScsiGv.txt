I'm feelin' so energetic
Don't think y'all will ever get it (4x)

The floor is callin' me
And I don't know what else to do
The energy in here is fire
And the speakers too
See the DJ hittin' that replay
Do what he say and turn me on
Imma do a lotta talkin' with my feet
And the beat and I promise don't need no phone

Put me on (6x)

Meet me in the club (4x)

I feel like I'm up there abo- abo- above the clouds
Did you meet my speaker?
Ain't he, ain't he, ain't he talkin loud?

Don't he beat (5x) the floor
Don't he beat (3x) the floor
Don't he beat (5x) the floor
That's that and I ain't gotta say no more

I'm feelin' so energetic
Don't think y'all will ever get it (4x)

Watch me do it with no hands
I can make you see some things that you ain't never seen before baby
I can do it all again
Watch me do one more for you that will just make your heart stop baby

When ya gonna make me
C'mon and make me (x3)
