My mama told me
She said, son, please beware
There's this thing called love
And it's everywhere

She told me, she can break your heart
And put you in misery
Since I met this little woman
I believe it's happened to me
Let me tell you

It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe, I believe I'm falling in love
It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe, I believe I'm falling in love

I found myself phoning her
At least ten times a day
You know, that's so unusual for me
To carry on this way

I'll tell you, I can't sleep at night
For wanting to hold her tight
I've tried so hard to convince myself
This feeling just can't be right
Let me tell you

It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe, I believe I'm falling in love
It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe, I believe I'm falling in love

It's too late to turn back now, baby
I believe, I believe, I believe I'm falling in love
It's too late to turn back now, baby
I believe, I believe, I believe I'm falling in love

Now I wouldn't mind it now if I knew
She loved me too
But I hate to think that I'm in love alone
And there's nothing that I can do

It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe, I believe I'm falling in love
It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe, I believe I'm falling in love

Oh baby, it's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe, I believe I'm falling in love
It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe, I believe I'm falling in love
