I'm getting desperate 'cause it's really kinda late
Been loving you for such a long time
And the timing's right, sweet baby
To make you mine
It's gonna feel so fine

When we break out - let your love run free
Give me some time - baby spend your life with me
Break out - tell me darling what it's all about
Gotta get back to love - that we feel inside

It wasn't long ago I was too afraid to show
Emotions I was feeling inside
I know you're just like me
But sweet baby
Forget your pride 'cause you don't have to hide

Touch me tonight - let your love run free
Body and soul - I'll give you every part of me
Reach out - tell me darling what it's all about
Gotta get into the love

Can't you feel it
Can't you feel it
