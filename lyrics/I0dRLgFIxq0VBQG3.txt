Have you looked up lately?
And seen the cold lonely skies?
And looked into the mirror
And seen your black lonely eyes?
Well, I have and I want to know
Why I feel like death is round the corner
I still feel so young
And in my chest I've the beating of
A thousand youngbloods.

Youngbloods run free forever
Forget the death that's ever nearer
Youngbloods young hearts alike
Let the fires burn inside your eyes.

We won't give up these memories.
We won't go near those cemeteries.
And have you ever felt the breath of the midnight reaper?

His whisper's deathly cold, deathly cold and nearer
The sun never rises when you're in his presence
Your tears run black as coal
And your chest ceases its movements
And your young blood runs so cold
Have you felt the darkness calling?
And the whispers in the skies
Well so have I, so we need to run together

Youngbloods, youngbloods, youngbloods run free forever
Forget the death, that's ever fucking nearer
Light up the sky and scream fuck the reaper
This life is for the keeping
Youngbloods just keep on screaming.

Youngbloods run free forever
Forget the death that's ever nearer
Youngbloods young hearts alike
Let the fires burn inside your eyes.

We won't give up these memories.
We won't go near those cemeteries.

Youngbloods, youngbloods, youngbloods just keep on screaming
This life is for the keeping
This song is for the dreamers
Youngbloods, youngbloods, youngbloods just keep on screaming
Just keep on screaming
Just keep on screaming...
Let's go

Youngbloods...
Youngbloods young hearts alike
Let the fires burn inside your eyes.
We won't give up these memories.
We won't go near those cemeteries.

Youngbloods young hearts alike
Let the fires burn inside your eyes.
