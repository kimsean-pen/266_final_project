All my friends will desert again
And I don't want to be a loner
In my head, I can sleep when I'm dead
Baby, don't let the hype delude ya (Na-na-na)

I got no one from the quiet life
No forced up smiles over tired eyes
Give me a taste of the riot life
'Cause I'd rather be a martyr than grow tomatoes
Keep the young between your teeth
Take the love, take the doves, take the self belief
Make your shoes look squeaky clean
But if you want to be a leader, stop being a cheater

So bounce if you had enough
Of the people you know
So bounce if you had enough
And just let go

All my friends will desert again
And I don't want to be a loner (Na-na-na)
In my head, I can sleep when I'm dead
Baby, don't let the hype delude ya (Na-na-na)

Now lock me up in a riot van
As I hold up my fingers to this old man
'Cause he makes sure my future plans
(Became a time bomb, sleep with the lights on)
Treating her better like a playground
Sugar coat distractions to cover up their shade now
Hey, now!
You better let me out!

All my friends will desert again
And I don't want to be a loner (Na-na-na)
In my head, I can sleep when I'm dead
Baby, don't let the hype delude ya (Na-na-na)

You know what I mean, yeah
You know what I mean, yeah
You know what I mean, yeah
Do you know what I mean, yeah?

You know what I mean, yeah
You know what I mean, yeah
You know what I mean, yeah
Do you know what I mean, yeah?

So bounce if you had enough
Of the people you know
So bounce if you had enough
Of the alter-ego
So bounce if you had enough
Of the people you know
So bounce if you had enough
And just let go

All my friends will desert again
And I don't want to be a loner
In my head, I can sleep when I'm dead
Baby, don't let a heart delude ya (Na-na-na)

All my friends will desert again
And I don't want to be a loner (Na-na-na)
In my head, I can sleep when I'm dead
Baby, don't let a heart delude ya (Na-na-na)
You know what I mean, yeah
You know what I mean, yeah
Do you know what I mean, yeah?

You know what I mean, yeah
You know what I mean, yeah
Do you know what I mean, yeah?

Oh woah, oh woah, oh, oh, oh
