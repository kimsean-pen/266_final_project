Going fast, going strong
Riding at the speed of light
Waiting the thunder to come down on us
Take us to another life
Going fast, going strong
That's the only way we know
Gather 'round the fire, legs are tired
Daylight comes when you go
I am gone for the long run
won't come by
It's calling out for you
