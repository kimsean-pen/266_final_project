You can tell by the way
She walks that she's my girl
You can tell by the way
She talks, she rules the world

You can see in her eyes
That no one is her chain
She's my girl, my supergirl

And then she'd say, "It's okay
I got lost on the way
But I'm a supergirl
And supergirls don't cry"

And then she'd say, "It's alright
I got home late last night
But I'm a supergirl
And supergirls just fly"

And then she'd say
That nothing can go wrong
When you're in love
What can go wrong?

Then she'd laugh
The night time into the day
Pushing her fear further along

And then she'd say, "It's okay
I got lost on the way
But I'm a supergirl
And supergirls don't cry"

And then she'd say, "It's alright
I got home late last night
But I'm a supergirl
And supergirls just fly"

And then she'd shout down the line
Tell me she's got no more time
'Cause she's a supergirl
And supergirls don't hide

And then she'd scream in my face
Tell me to leave, leave this place
'Cause she's a supergirl
And supergirls just fly

Yes, she's a supergirl, a supergirl
She's sewing seeds, she's burning trees
She's sewing seeds, she's burning trees
Yes, she's a supergirl, a supergirl
A supergirl, my supergirl
