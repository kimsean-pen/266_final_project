Shapes to melt into its own
looking down at scattered bones
I used to keep to send her home
till they spread her ghost on
till they spread her ghost on
I pulled the trigger by mistake
fired at the aftermath
slowly recognized escape
we will be ephemeral
we will be ephemeral

fact isn't what you see
no anymore what it used to be
fact isn't what you see
not what it used to be
through all the glamour
two hours of surgency
two hours of surgency
