When you kissed my hand and passed the note
I wondered how you wrote at all
My side of the bed won't rest, tonight
When you first walked in evening air
A lullaby went through my head
My side of the bed won't rest, tonight
Rest, tonight

But I can't stand
Another case of the brain that got away
It's in your hands, take a dip in the moonlight
And drink iced tea, tonight
Wallowing, wallowing
In my cell their ancient wisdom will try to kill you

Take care of yourself
Of yourself
Take care of yourself

Surgeons operate without their eyes
It's much simpler to see inside
the frozen shell of a body, now
So lick a stamp and post me off
So that I can ride the journey of
A nobleman
I'll sleep if I can

But I can't stand
Another case of the brain that got away
It's in your hands, take a dip in the moonlight
And drink iced tea, tonight
Wallowing, wallowing
In my cell their naked freedom will try to kill you

Take care of yourself
Of yourself
Take care of yourself
Of yourself
Take care of yourself
Take care of yourself

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah,

Take care of yourself
Take care of yourself
Take care of yourself
Take care of yourself
Take care of yourself
Take care of yourself

I can't stand
Another case of the brain that got away
It's in your hands, take a dip in the moonlight
And drink iced tea, tonight
Wallowing, wallowing
In my cell their naked freedom will try to kill you

Take care of yourself
