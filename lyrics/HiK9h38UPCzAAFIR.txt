I walk into an empty room
I thought there'd be at least balloons
Girl looks at me, says: Who the hell is she?
I think I'm having trouble adjusting

I leave your house at 10 a.m.
Shower and shave hairy armpits
I make some toast and go to work
Oh God, it hurts, trouble adjusting

How am I to do it again
If I can't recall how it was in the beginning?
I was over there, now I'm over here
Easy for you, I'm still adjusting

More everyday strain, no underwear
Went to the laundromat, but just stood and stared
I'm sorry, Mom, I've lived alone for so long
But I'm still having trouble adjusting

How am I to do it again
If I can't recall how it was in the beginning?
I was over there, now I'm over here
Easy for you, I'm still adjusting

Okay, they say it will be okay
Shit, this song is shit
They'll listen anyway

How am I to do it again
If I can't recall how it was in the beginning?
I was over there, now I'm over here
Easy for you, I'm still adjusting

How am I to do it again
If I can't recall how it was in the beginning?
