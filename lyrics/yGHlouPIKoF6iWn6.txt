THE RUSH! THE LIGHTS!
They draw you
EXCITED! DELIGHTED!
They form you
CREATING! DICTATING!
The new you
OUTDATING! PREVENTING!
That old you

The ending of time
3 steps and you're mine
Remembering those you left behind
It plays with your mind
It says you are fine...
Not needing the ones you left behind

PROTEST! DETEST!
Avoid them
IGNITE! FIERCE FIGHT!
Destroy them
IT'S HARD! I KNOW!
To live here
(But) WITH US! SECURE!
The old ways are near

The ending of time
3 steps and you're mine
Remembering those you left behind
It plays with your mind
It says you are fine...
Not needing the ones you left behind

THE RUSH! THE LIGHTS!
