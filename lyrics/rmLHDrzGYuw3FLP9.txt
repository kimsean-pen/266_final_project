Music floats in the sky, then it disappears (I don't know how)
So grateful you gave me time to bend your ears (But it's over now)
I wasn't trying to reinvent the wheel (The wheel was fine)
Only want you to know how I really feel (It's yours and mine)
See the marbles and rocks, all the galaxies far away
Draw the moon and the stars like an atlas, find my way
Never knowing where we're going
In a world insane
After all this madness passes
We'll rebuild our world fantastic, yeah
Saturday, Sunday fun (It's a Western sunset)
Suddenly, Monday come (And everyone knows it)
Saturday, Sunday fun (It's a Western sunset)
Suddenly, Monday come
Hear the morning alarm
"One More Time" is my wake-up song
But it's so hard to get up after staying out all night long
There's a doorway
It's a golden opportunity to go through
There's a party going on
And all we want is toast and coffee, yeah
Saturday, Sunday fun (It's a Western sunset)
Suddenly, Monday come (And everyone knows it)
Saturday, Sunday fun (It's a Western sunset)
Suddenly, Monday come
Saturday, Sunday fun (It's a Western sunset)
Suddenly, Monday come (And everyone knows it)
Saturday, Sunday fun (It's a Western sunset)
Suddenly, Monday come
