I'm bound to wonder where all of your glitters going
But I'm so far from knowing and none of my instincts are showing
Kicking, kicking, I'm screaming from my side and tell me where I've been
There's no way to return to where I've been
I think I've lost my way but that's just not news today

Because the stories of the black and white have gone to gray
The stories of the black and white have gone to gray
The stories of the black and white have gone to gray, and you were right
'Cause I finally lost my way

But I'm bound to wonder where all of your glitters going
But I'm so far from knowing and none of my instincts are showing
Kicking, kicking, I'm screaming from my side and tell me where I've been
There's no way to return to where I've been
I think I've lost my way but that's just not news today

Because the stories of the black and white have gone to gray
The stories of the black and white have gone to gray
The stories of the black and white have gone to gray, and you were right
'Cause I finally lost my way

Finally lost my way, yes, I finally lost my way
I finally lost my way, yes, I finally lost my way

The stories over the black and white have gone to gray and you were right
'Cause I finally lost my way

The stories over the black and white have gone to gray
The stories over the black and white have gone to gray
The stories over the black and white have gone to gray and you were right
'Cause I finally lost my way, yes, finally lost my way, I finally lost my way
Finally lost my way, yes, I finally lost my way
I finally lost my way, yes, I finally lost my way
