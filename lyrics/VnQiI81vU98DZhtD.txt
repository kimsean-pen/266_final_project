Her body is a torture weapon in disguise
From my view
She knows that she's a liar
Said she'd never give into desire

Darling, I am on fire
Don't you let me go, let me go, let me go

Her body's so dramatic
My heart is automatic
Come on over, give it to me

Come on come on
Why you fighting it?
Come on come on
There's no use hiding
'Cause I know you'll be coming back for more

Tear my lips right at the seam
Shut your eyes so you can't see me seething
It's easy just to let go of everything you keep
Your secret's safe with me
Trust me

I am on fire
Don't you let me go, let me go, let me go

Her body's so dramatic
My heart is automatic
Come on over, give it to me

Come on come on
Why you fighting it?
Come on come on
There's no use hiding
'Cause I know you'll be coming back for more

Dance with me, dance with me, come on baby
Won't you dance with me, dance with me?
Come on d-d-d-d-dance with me, dance with me, come on baby
Won't you dance with me, dance with me?
Come on and dance

Her body's so dramatic
My heart is automatic
Come on over, give it to me

Come on come on
Why you fighting it?
Come on come on
There's no use hiding
'Cause I know you'll be coming back, yeah
I know you'll be coming back for more
