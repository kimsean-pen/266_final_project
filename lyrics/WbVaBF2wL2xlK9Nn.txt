I put my fist through the door
I hate myself for you I love you
Suspicion rules my very soul
My knife is sharp, my thougths are cold
I love you I love you
Because I love you I can't talk,
I can't think
My feelings burn inside of me
I love you
I practice my knife, I feel the power
I look in the mirror and
I want to destroy her
I love you
I gave you my life, but what did I get?
Now its time to take it back
I love you
I love you
Because, I love you I hear a car, your footsteps outside
Knife in hand, love in heart
Sweating - I wait I love you
You screamed, you bled, you laid on the floor
But now I know you'll leave me no more
I love you I love you Because, I love you.
