You only give me what you don't want no more
Ask the questions that you don't know at all

Let's lie down for a while
You can smile
Lay your hair in the old
Old fashion

You know how it is, my friend
In the boxes of those picture frames
Hold your insides 'cause you're cold at night
Warm your heart now, 'cause you're by my side

Let's lie down for a while
You can smile
Lay your hair in the old
Old fashion

Lay your hand on me
Apple orchard
Take your time
You can settle down
Hold your breath
'Cause you're, you are nothing
Hold your hand on me
For a while
