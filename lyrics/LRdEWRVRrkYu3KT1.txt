When I was younger I thought of you only
I just want to be alone, but I'm just lonely
Oh, I still have your picture
Where I can see it every day
Not that I look much
I just can't throw it away

When I was younger I thought of you only
I just want to be alone, but I'm just lonely
Oh, I still have your picture
Where I can see it every day
Not that I look much
I just can't throw it away

Funny how time goes on but you won't leave me
Pictures of what once was flashing on repeat
Oh, you're so inconsistent
Don't know how much more I can take
Building resilience with every heartbreak

Why, why did I allow myself to sleep
Make excuses, rules, and many dates to keep
Why, why did I allow myself to cry
Why, why did I, did I, did I, did I

Who knows how to make love stay?
Who knows how to make love stay?
Who knows how to make love stay?
Who knows how?
Who knows how?
Who knows how?
Who knows how?

Who knows how?
Who knows how?
Who knows how?
Who knows how?
Who knows how?
Who knows how?
Who knows how?
Who knows how?
Who knows how?
