On the first day of class
you walked into the room
just a hot little thing
with a bad attitude
and I know, I knew
I knew you were trouble baby
I was saved by the bell
couldn't wait to get home
and tell my mama
about this boy I don't know
yeah I know, I knew
I knew it was complicated
Boy I know you're dangerous
you're not the one
I'm supposed to love
but this is more than
just a crush
tonight

Locked myself in my room
called you up on the phone
don't know why I hung up
as soon as you said hello
when it's true it's true
you got me trippin' babe
That night I couldn't sleep
rolled around in my bed
cause the boy of my dreams
is a nightmare instead
and it's true it's true
that nobody tried to save me
