I met a man
He was a good man
Sailing and shoring
Dancing the beta can-can
Making me foreign
Oh yeah

I want to live in Los Angeles
Not the one in Los Angeles
No not the one in South California
They got one in South Patagonia

I want to live in Los Angeles
Not the one in Los Angeles
They got a bunch down in Moleville
They got a bunch more still

I want to live in Los Angeles
Not the one in Los Angeles
They got one in twenty-five two five
Works just like a beehive

I want to live in Los Angeles
Not the one in Los Angeles
Counting helicopters on saturday night
The symphony of the fair light

I hear saying Los Angeles
In all the black and white movies
And if you think they Star-Spangled us
How come we say Los Angeleez?

I'll wait in Los Angeles
I'll wait in the pouring sun
No way
For not anyone
No way

I met a man
He was a good man
Sailing and shoring
He got a betatron man
Talking that foreign
Oh yeah

I'll wait in Los Angeles
I'll wait in the pouring sun
No way
For not anyone
No way
