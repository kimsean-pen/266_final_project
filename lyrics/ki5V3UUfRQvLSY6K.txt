I got a proposition if you want it
(If you want it)
Dare you to let me run some game on ya
(Game on ya)
Undress me with your eyes
Your in for a surprise
What's underneath my exteri-eri-eri-erior

You do your best to put your name on it
(Name on it)
But you could never put your claim on it
(Claim on it)
Create your fantasy
What you wanna be
Check the reflection in the mirror-irr-irr-or

I know you like it
The way I do it private
You cant denied it
Just wanna please you
Blow out you candle in my birthday suit
Surprise
Just let me make your night
I'll do you like you like
I'll fulfill your needs
Keep your tip this one on me

You know you want my strip tease
If you want it say please
You know you want my strip tease
If you want it say please
You know you want my strip tease
If you want it say please
You know you want my strip tease
If you want it say please
I can make it if you want it

You been real good and I can tell you on your best behavior
Slowly I remove all my articles-of-clothing and I

Let you come and sneak a peak
What's behind door number 3
Take off your blindfold to see clear-ar-ar-ar-ar-ar-ar-ar-ar

The walls are talking bout the things we doing
Flip me and try an acrobatic movement (flip it, flip it)
This is the center ring
Come on come on lets see
The main attraction like the Wrigley Brother-other-other

It's so erotic
Here's goes I got a pocket
Full of candy with you favorite flavors
You can have it now or later
Don't you wanna taste
Don't have no time to waste
I got some tasty cakes
My fillings so sweet
And its good enough to eat

You know you want my strip tease
If you want it say please
You know you want my strip tease
If you want it say please
You know you want my strip tease
If you want it say please
You know you want my strip tease
If you want it say please
I can make it if you want it

And I just cant stop my clothes from falling down
And we only got tonight so make it count
And I got you on the edge of your seat
Anticipating my strip tease

You know you want my strip tease
If you want it say please
You know you want my strip tease
If you want it say please
You know you want my strip tease
If you want it say please
You know you want my strip tease
If you want it say please
I can make it if you want it
