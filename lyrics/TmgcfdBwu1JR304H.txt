May I say something to you
To give you a true knowledge of yourself and life
Man in the full knowledge of himself
is a superb and supreme creature of creation
When man becomes possessor of the knowledge of himself
He becomes the master of his environment

I don't feel pain anymore
Guess what, baby? I feel free
Scoop!
Nothing hurts me anymore
Guess what, baby? I feel free

I'm so complete anymore
Guess what, baby? I feel free
And you know damn well
I felt the chains on me, locked in a cell (and now I'm free)
Ah! You should quit your job to this
Hold up, that'll politic
Ooh, one day they hate you
Next day they love you
I'm still yellin' "Fuck you!"
I could never trustâ€“ (free)

I feel free, I feel free
I feel free, I feel free

I don't feel pain anymore
Guess what, babe? I am free
Yeah, nothing hurts me anymore
Guess what, babe? I am free

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Feeling out of my past life
Died and came back twice
Now I'm free
I don't feel pain anymore
Hmm, guess what, babe? I am free

I feel free, I feel free
I feel free, I feel free
