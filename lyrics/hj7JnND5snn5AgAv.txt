Okay
Now the monster is awake
It won't
Rest until there's nothing left

Maybe ever and none
I forget about the pain
Someone bending light comes along
The flowers lean towards the sun

Some people fall in love and touch the sky
Some people fall in love and find quicksand
I hover somewhere in between I swear
I can't make up my mind.
