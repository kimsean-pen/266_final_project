Hello, are you home?
I need to kill some time
The world is ending and I want to come and say goodbye
Everybody needs a confidant for all that wreckage kept inside
We're just firewood
Too soon to burn but we can't wait
We're just firewood
Too lost to take the things we crave
I hide and I hide and I never show my face
Under the endless weight of my mistakes
We're just firewood
Too soon to burn but we can't wait
We're just firewood
Too lost to take the things we crave
And if you come with me
I will go with you
We're just firewood
Too soon to burn but we can't wait
We're just firewood
Too lost to take the things we crave
And if you come with me
I will go with you
