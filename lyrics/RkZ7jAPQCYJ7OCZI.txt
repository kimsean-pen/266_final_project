I'm 310, seven blocks from my apartment
Can we pretend we're back before this all started
My body's shaking from the alcohol that's
moving through my blood
My bones are breaking
from the pressure that you put me under, love

My body's shaking from the alcohol that's moving through my blood
My bones are breaking from the pressure that you put me under, love
My body's shaking from the alcohol that's moving through my blood
My bones are breaking from the pressure that you put me under, love
