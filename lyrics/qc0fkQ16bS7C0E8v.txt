Hi
Girl you just caught my eye
Thought I should give it try
And get your name & your number
Go grab some lunch & eat some cucumbers
Why did I say that?
I don't know why.
But you're smilin' & it's something' I like
On your face, yeah it suits you
Girl we connect like we have bluetooth

I don't know why
I'm drawn to you
Could you be the other one so we'd equal two?
And this is all based on a lucky chance
That you would rather add than subtract

You & I
Could be like Sonny & Cher
Honey & Bears
And You & I
Could be like Aladdin & Jasmine
Lets make it happen

La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

Hey
How've you been?
I know that it's been awhile.
Are you tired cause you've been on my mind
Runnin' thousand & thousands of miles
Sorry, I know that line's outta style
But you
You look so beautiful on this starry night
Loving the way the moonlight catches your eyes & your smile
I'm captivated
Your beauty is timeless never outdated

I don't know why
I'm drawn to you
Could you be the other one so we'd equal two?
And this is all based on a lucky chance
That you would rather add then subtract

You & I
Could be like Sonny & Cher
Honey & Bears
And You & I
Could be like Aladdin & Jasmine
Lets make it happen

Babe
It's been 5 years since that special day
When I asked you on our first date
I guess it's safe to say that

You & I
Are better than Sonny & Cher
Honey & Bears
And You & I
Are better than Aladdin & Jasmine
We've made it happen
Singing

La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

Let me say
You look beautiful on our wedding day
