I'm tired of just hiding away
Wrestling my instincts to keep it at bay
Cause forgetting you is like ignoring the weather
Or wanting you takes as long as forever
And I don't know how much longer I can keep it inside

Can we work it out?
Can we work it out?
Cause every fiber of my being's agreed
That what you want can become something you need
Can we work it out?
Go on and get out of my head

Or stay, tell me something instead
Tell me how we work this out
And what the struggle's about
You're asking me to give you all I have
Tell me how to change your mind

Can we work it out?
Can we work it out?
Cause every fiber of my being's agreed
That what you want can become something you need
Can we work it out?

Won't you just open your eyes?
And see that we are failing at our clever disguise
Can you pick a point that we can choose to rewind to
Or know there's better days ahead than behind you
Cause I can't see anything ahead of me now

Can we work it out?
Can we work it out?
Cause every fiber of my being's agreed
That what you want can become something you need
Can we work it out?
