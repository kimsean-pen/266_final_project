I can't pretend that we've never been friends
But I'm sure you say somethin' different
Won't stand how you spit on my name

I say, I'm really fed up about ya
I can't care less about anythin' you say about me, yeah
Like we were together

You say I was your best pleasure
Can't go on like this forever
No, never

I've been constantly reminded
For me you're more childish
'N' I'm caught in the drain

I don't listen to my neighbours
'N' I don't need to say more
It will never be us
It will never be us

Feels like I've been runnin' for years now
Round 'n' round like I'm stuck in a hamster wheel
Duckin', again from you (From you)

I'm really fed up about ya
I can't care less about anythin' you say about me, yeah
Like we were together

You say I was your best pleasure
Can't go on like this forever
No never

I've been constantly reminded
For me you're more childish
'N' I'm caught in the drain

I don't listen to my neighbours
'N' I don't need to say more
It will never be us
It will never be us

Try to get it in your head
Focus on yourself instead
We could never have been more
Your ache is covered by a pretense that you're mad, so mad

I've been constantly reminded
For me you're more childish
'N' I'm caught in the drain

I don't listen to my neighbours
'N' I don't need to say more
It will never be us

So mad
