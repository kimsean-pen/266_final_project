Hearing,
Is getting me down
Is getting me down to the disco floor

Hearing, is wearing me down
It's wearing down from my ears

All those evenings, spent disappointed on dancefloors
?, and learn one day

I want to get more from this
I want to get more from this
I want to get more from this, than you

Sometimes i'll put up with it, alright.
But i can't even dance the way i might
were it just me and you tonight

I want to get more from this
I want to get more from this
I want to get more from this
I want to get more from this, than you
