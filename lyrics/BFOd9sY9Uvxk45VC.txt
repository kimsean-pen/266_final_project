Last night, boy, I met you
Yeah, when I was asleep (sleep)
You're such a dream to me

Mmm, woah
And it was on a day like this
Yeah, if you can believe
If you can believe
If you can believe
(If you can believe)
You're such a dream to me

Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh
Wake up, wake up, wake up

Boy, you're such a dream
If you can believe, aye?
Boy, you're such a dream to me

"Excuse me, uhm, I love you"
I know this not the way to start a conversation, trouble
I'm watch them other girls, when they come and bug you
But I felt like I knew ya, so I just wanted to hug you
Plus you don't know your way around
You can stop your playing now
All you ever do is lay 'em down, shh, don't say it loud
Is this real, baby?

(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
You're like-
I love you
Who starts a conversation like that? Nobody but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up and hide you
I'll get you out my mind, hmm, I try to
But I just want to stay with you
I will never dare to tell
Think I heard some wedding bells, shh, keep it to yourself
Is this real?
(Is this real)

Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh no
Wake up, wake up, wake up

'Cause you're such a dream
If you can believe?
You're such a dream to me, mmm boy

I can buy you anything but I cannot buy you
Before you boy, guess not, I would never try to
You know I'm thinking to myself "What happened, why you?"
But when I see you in my dreams, shh, I knew
You know how to treat it,
you know how to eat it, you know how to keep it
I know how to treat it

Let's keep things well
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
I don't just wanna touch you
I'm tryna turn two single people into a couple
What's you're next month like? Tell me what you up to
We can leave right now, boy, you don't need a duffle
What about La Perla, you think you can keep a secret?
Bigger than your secret, if know you gonna peep it?

Ooh, before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
No I don't wanna-

'Cause you're such a dream
(Is this gon' end?)
If you can believe?
You're such a dream to me
To me, mmm, boy, to me
