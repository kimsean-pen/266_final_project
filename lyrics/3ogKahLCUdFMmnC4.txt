No one can love you
'Cause no one can free you
Lovers can't touch you
'Cause lovers might reach you, yeah
I'm so alone, so alone
But better than a wretched world
Better than a broken pearl
I'm so alone, so alone
But better than I ever was
Better than a just laid cause
Night may keep you sworn
May bring you storms
From chest to stern
The journey's blessed
The warnings circumspect
With dreams I've had
With dreams I've had

And still she's gone
And still she's gone

Night will fill your rest
Negate your best
With dreams I've had
With dreams I've had

Oh would I follow you
How could I have ever doubted you?
Sweet baby, nurture me
Sweet lady, if you please
Try the way on me
Try the way on me
Try the way on me
Try the way...

Skirt the cliffs of your illusion
Find the faith on me
My mistake as the last remaining soldier
Was to take the place of you
Love the way
Love the way and learn

Try the way
Cast off your indecision
Face to face we breathe
Try the way
Cast off your indecision
Face to face we breathe
