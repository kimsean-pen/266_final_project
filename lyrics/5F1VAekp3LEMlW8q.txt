You were the only face I'd ever known
I was the light from the lamp on the floor
And only as bright as you wanted me to be

But I am no gentleman, I can be a prick
And I do regret more than I admit
You have been followed back to the same place I
Sat with you drink for drink
Take the pain out of love and then love won't exist

Everything we had, everything we had
Everything we had, everything we had
Is no longer there

It was the only place I'd ever known
Turned off the light on my way out the door
I will be watching wherever you go
Through the eyes of a fly on the wall

You have been followed back to the same place I
Sat with you drink for drink
Take the pain out of love and then love won't exist

Everything we had, everything we had
Everything we had, everything we had
Is no longer there, longer there

Well, you saw for yourself, the way it played out
For you, I am blinded
For you, I am blinded
For you

I am no gentleman, I can be a prick
And I do regret more than I admit
You have been followed back to the same place I
Sat with you drink for drink
Take the pain out of love and then love won't exist

Everything we had, everything we had
Everything we had, everything we had
Everything we had, everything we had
Everything we had

I'll be with you wherever you go
Through the eyes of a fly on the wall
