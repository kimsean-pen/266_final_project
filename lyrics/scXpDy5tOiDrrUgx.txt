Shadows above the sand
I waited so long to hold your hand
Familiar rode, helpless, just acting stupid like kids
Was so distracted, yeah we've been careless
It's not too late

Baby open your eyes and hold on tight
Just keep running and we can stay up all night
Don't let go
Don't let go
Flying high as a kite no ground below
Got me up in the sky running don't let go
Don't let go
Don't let go

Sometimes the notions freight
Like tiny little heart breaks
Something that can't explain
Just writing stupid lie kids
I'm so impatient and yet so reckless
It's not too late

Baby open your eyes and hold on tight
Just keep running and we can stay up all night
Don't let go
Don't let go
Flying high as a kite no ground below
Got me up in the sky running don't let go
Don't let go
Don't let go

I know you pull, pull, pull on each other
Sometimes we spin spin out of control
But there's a string holding us together
Just gotta catch that and here we go

Baby open your eyes and hold on tight
Just keep running and we can stay up all night
Don't let go
Don't let go
Flying high as a kite no ground below
Got me up in the sky running don't let go
Don't let go
Don't let go

I know you pull, pull, pull on each other
Sometimes we spin spin, yeah
I know you pull, pull, pull on each other
Sometimes we spin spin, yeah
I know you pull, pull, pull on each other
Sometimes we spin spin, yeah
