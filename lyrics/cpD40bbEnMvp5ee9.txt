I know we carried on late
I know my head ain't on straight
I know you ain't gonna hear me babe
I know you ain't even awake
Hey but when I can see you love
Hey I can really believe in love
My beautiful boy

Honey this world ain't never fair
And hey there's trouble everywhere
But I see your body lying there
I see the moonlight in your hair
Hey you got nothing to doubt or fear
Hey not as long as I'm standing here
My beautiful boy

My beautiful boy
I couldn't fit it in these lines
My beautiful boy
I couldn't fit it in to rhyme
Hey when I can see you love
Hey I can really believe in love
My beautiful boy

They say that heaven ain't so bad
But for heaven's sake now ain't it sad?
Just what in heaven would I do?
Just walk around and look for you
And what if you wasn't there?
And what if I wasn't there
My beautiful boy

My beautiful boy
I couldn't fit it in these lines
My beautiful boy
I couldn't fit it in to rhyme
But when I can see you love
I can really believe in love
My beautiful boy
