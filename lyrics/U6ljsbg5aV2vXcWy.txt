I among the sleeping crown
Taking hand
You draw it out
There's a hunger in my being
Flooded by an emerald high

You are unearthed
I discover
Washing over
Holy other

Oh, it's surreal, it's surreal, it's surreal
Yeah
Oh, it's surreal, it's surreal, it's surreal
Yeah

Eye among the sleeping crown
Taking hand you draw it out
There's a hunger in my being
Flooded by an emerald high

You are unearthed
I discover
Washing over
Holy other

And is this my reality?
And is this really happening?
And is this my reality?
And is this really happening?
