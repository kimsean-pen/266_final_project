Sitting all alone now
I took my ticket to ride
Just a matter of time now
Till I'll be up in the sky

Coming up on me now
I'm king for a night
What's it gonna be now?
Powerful things are brewing inside
Do you think it's really the truth that you seek?
I've got my doubts
It's happened to me

Artificial energy
Is racing my mind
I've got a strange feeling
I'm going to die before my time
I'm coming down off amphetamine
And I'm in jail 'cause I killed the queen
