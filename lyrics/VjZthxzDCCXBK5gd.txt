Many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wandering I am lost as I travel along
The white cliffs of Dover
Many rivers to cross and it's only my will
That keeps me alive
I've been licked, washed up for years and
I merely survive because of my pride

And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's such a drag to be on your own
My woman left and she didn't say why
Well I guess I have to try
Many rivers to cross but just where to begin
I'm playing for time
There'll be times I find myself thinking
Of committing some dreadful crime

I've got many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wandering I am lost as I travel along
The white cliffs of Dover
Many rivers to cross and it's only my will
That keeps me alive
I've been licked, washed up for years and
I merely survive because of my pride
