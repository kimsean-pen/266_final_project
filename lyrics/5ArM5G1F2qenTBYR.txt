I've been so un afraid
to die alone
I know what i've done
I heard you talk
dust off your coat
the rain is coming back
a few months without it
it keeps happiness on track
you would never notice
stuck in that head of yours
INSTRUMENTAL
you say im in love
i say you're a fool
look away from me now
i'll look away too
INSTRUMENTAL
you say im in love
i say you're a fool
look away from me now
i'll look away too
