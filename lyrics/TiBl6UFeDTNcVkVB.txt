Ooh, put your hands all over me!
Do everything I like
Lift me up, I'm holding you tight!
Waste another moment with me,
It's a matter of courtesy
'Cause I'm really not feeling that bad
It's just part of the fantasy, you have to see
When you get to know me
You wont think twice to show me
Let me take our kisses into the light!
Put your hands all over me!
Do everything I like
Lift me up, I'm holding you tight
I'm never gonna change,
So just keep that in mind
When the tides are low, things you never show
Defeat me when there's nothing to hide
You say know me,
So it's not so hard to show me
Let you take these kisses into the light!
Put your hands all over me!
Do everything I like,
Lift me up, I'm holding you tight!
