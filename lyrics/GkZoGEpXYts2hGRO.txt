I walk around with a screwdriver
A pack of smokes and a Bic lighter
I stay out of your way if you stay out of my way
'Cause I don't wanna listen to your shit every day

I'm tired of walking away to lose you
I take my Adderall with milk and sugar
I'm gonna be okay, get the fuck out of my way
'Cause all it is is just a bunch of Kool-Aid

I wanna lose my mind and lose track of time
Won't somebody please just give me some alcohol?

Alcohol!
Alcohol!
Alcohol!
Alcohol!

I'm sure I've got it figured out but I really don't know
I love waking up in some random's home
And I'll pack a cone and hit it to the dome
And now I just wanna be alone

I wake up in the morning and I'm loose
And I chew a couple pills and I hit the juice
And I feel okay and get the fuck out my way
And did you think I wanna hear what you have to say?

Do you wanna stay inside
Or do you wanna go get some alcohol?

Alcohol!
Alcohol!
Alcohol!
Alcohol!

I'm sure I've got it figured out but I really don't know
I love waking up in some random's home
And I'll pack a cone and hit it to the dome
And now I just wanna be alone
And now I just wanna be alone
And now I just wanna be alone

With my alcohol

Alcohol!
Alcohol!
Alcohol!
Alcohol!

Alcohol!
Alcohol!
