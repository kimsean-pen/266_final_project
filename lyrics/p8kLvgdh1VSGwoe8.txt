(Intro)
And I said baby
And I said baby
And I said baby
And I said baby
And I said baby, I'm all alone
I need you now
Come stay with me so that we can meet somehow
Said baby, your hold me down is my design
Come stay with me so we can be much higher

(Verse)
I don't wanna be there tonight
You make me whole, you make me go
Make me harder than you
Wanna be the one that made me up
You made me love
Don't make me help and make me odder
And you don't wanna be like I'm the pain that
You never wanted be it
Fine, take that

(Bridge)
You wait for love, telling me to go, go, go
Don't ever leave me
You're feeling like you don't mind
Thinking that you want to go
Don't ever leave me
You're feeling like you don't mind
Thinking that you want to go
Don't ever leave me alone
And this is how you find
I'll make it and you'll know, know, know
Don't ever leave me
Never leave me out
Never leave me
Don't try to make me

(Chorus x6)
I just called you up to get that play by play by play by play
Don't ever leave me alone
I just called you up to get that play by play

(Outro)
Don't ever, don't ever, don't ever leave me alone
Don't ever leave me, don't ever
Don't ever leave me
That play by play, play by play
Don't ever leave me alone
