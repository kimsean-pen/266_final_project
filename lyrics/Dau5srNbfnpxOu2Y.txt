Words
They cut like a knife
Cut into my life
I don't want to hear your words
They always attack!
Please take them all back!
If they're yours I don't want anymore!

You think you're
So smart
You try to
Manipulate me
You try to
Humiliate with your words
You think you're
So chic
You write me
Beautiful letters, you think you're
So much better than me

But your actions
Speak louder than words and
They're only words unless they're true
Your actions
Speak louder than promises
You're inclined to make
And inclined to break

Words
They cut like a knife
Cut into my life
I don't want to hear your words
They always attack!
Please take them all back!
If they're yours I don't want anymore!

You think you're
So shrewd
You try to
Bring me low
You try to
Gain control with your words
But your actions
Speak louder than words and
They're only words unless they're true
Your actions
Speak louder than promises
You're inclined to make
And inclined to break

Words
They cut like a knife
Cut into my life
I don't want to hear your words
They always attack
Please take them all back
If they're yours I don't want anymore

Friends, they tried to warn me about you:
"He has good manners,
He's so romantic, but he'll only make you blue"

How can I explain to them?
How could they know...
I'm in love with your words?
Your... words

You think you're
So sly
I caught you
At your game
You will not
Bring me shame with your words

But your actions
Speak louder than words and
They're only words, unless they're true
Your actions
Speak louder than promises
You're inclined to make
And inclined to break

Words
They cut like a knife
Cut into my life
I don't want to hear your words
They always attack
Please take them all back
If they're yours I don't want anymore

Too much...
Blinding light
Your touch...
I've grown tired of your words
