Baby, when I think about you
Think about love...
Darlin' I don't live without you
And your love...

If I had those golden dreams of my yesterday (yesterday)

I would wrap you
In the heaven
Feel it dyin' (dyin', dyin') all the way

Feel like makin'
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you

Baby, if I think about you
Think about love...
Darlin' if I live without you
I live without love...

And if I had the sun and moon
They were shinin'...
I would give you both night and day
Love satisfyin'...

Feel like makin'
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you
And if I had those golden dreams of my yesterday (yesterday)
I would wrap you
In the heaven
Feel it dyin'(dyin', dyin) all the way

Feel like makin'
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you

Well, I feel like makin' love
Well, I feel like makin' love
Well, I feel like makin' love
