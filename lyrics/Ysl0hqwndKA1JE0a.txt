Sunday morning
On the bed two half-eaten croissants
Sunday morning
We'll soon be out on the boulevards

Monday morning
We have to fly back home again
While I'm sleeping
You paint a ring on my finger with your black marker-pen

I'm all about you, you're all about me
We're all about each other
I'm all about you, you're all about me
We're all about each other

You don't have to tell, 'cause I know so well
What we are all after
Likewise if uncertainty puts a spell on me
I have to zoom in your laughter, your laughter

Wednesday morning
We sleep over and we're late again
Let's skip breakfast
We need this precious time just to comprehend

I'm all about you, you're all about me
We're all about each other
I'm all about you, you're all about me
We're all about each other

I'm all about you, you're all about me
We're all about each other
I'm all about you, you're all about me
We're all about each other

Each other
Each other
Each other
Each other
