I hope this old train breaks down
then I could take a walk around
and, see what there is to see
time is just a melody
With all the people in the street
walking as fast as their feet can take them
I just roll through town
And though my windows got a view
Well the frame im looking through
seems to have no concern for me now
so for now I

I need this
old train to breakdown
oh please just
let me please breakdown

Well this engine screams out loud
Saying this beat gonna crawl westbound
so I dont even make a sound
Because its gunna sting me when I leave this town
And all the people in the street
that i'll never get to meet
if these tracks dont bend somehow
and I got no time
that I got to get to
where I dont need to be
So I

I need this
old train to breakdown
oh please just
let me please breakdown

I need this
old train to breakdown
oh please just
let me please breakdown

I want to break on down
but I cant stop now
let me break on down

But you cant stop nothing
if you got no control
of the thoughts in your mind
that you kept and you know
you dont know nothing
but you dont need to know
the wisdoms in the trees
not the glass windows
You cant stop wishing
If you dont let go
of the things that you find
and you lose, and you know
you keep on rolling
put the moment on hold
the frames too bright
so put the blinds down low

I need this
old train to breakdown
oh please just
let me please breakdown
I need this
old train to breakdown
oh please just
let me please breakdown
I got to break on down
but I cant stop now
