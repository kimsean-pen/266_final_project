"Watt Here! I'm downstairs from your window... if you're up...
pub 'phone booth... if you're up...(I get tense) "
"Thurston! Watt! Thurston! I think it's ten thirty, we're calling

from Providence, Rhode Island. Did you find your shit? You gotta
watch the motin' Thurston, your fuckin' memory just goes out tha window.
We couldn't find it in the van at all, we wonderin' if you looked in
that trash can. When we threw out that trash, man, was the bag in
your hand, did you dump it? Call later. Bye."
