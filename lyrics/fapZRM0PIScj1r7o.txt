I heard the sound of voices in the night
Spellbound there was someone calling
I looked around no one was in sight
Pulled down and I kept on falling
I've seen this place before
And you were standing by my side
I've seen your face before tonight
Maybe I just see what I want it to be
I know it's a mystery
Do you remember me
On the street of dreams
Running through my memory
On the street of dreams
There you stood a distant memory
So good like we never parted
Said to myself I knew you'd set me free
And here we are right back where we started
Something's come over me
And I don't know what to feel
Maybe this fantasy is real
Now I know I see what I want it to be
But it's still a mystery
Do you remember me
On the street of dreams
Running through my memory
On the street of dreams
You are in every face I see
On the street of dreams

Something's come over me
And I don't know what to feel
Maybe this fantasy is real
Now I know I see what I want it to be
But it's still a mystery
Do you remember me
On the street of dreams
Running through my memory
On the street of dreams
On the street of dreams
I know you have always been
On the street of dreams
Will we ever meet again, my friend
On the street of dreams
Do you know just what it means, to be
On the street of dreams
Never know just who you'll see, do ya
On the street of dreams
You can be who you want to be, oh no
On the street of dreams
I can hear you calling me
On the street of dreams
