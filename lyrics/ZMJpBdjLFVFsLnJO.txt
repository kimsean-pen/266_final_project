Nothing
Nothing
Nothing left inside

Love
Love
Nothing left inside

Pain in my heart
Pain hurts my heart
Nothing left inside

Lies
Your lies
Nothing left inside

I built it up
I broke it down
Nothing left inside

Leach
Drained me dry
Nothing left inside

Lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely, lonely boy
Nothing left inside

I want to see you
I want to see you
I want you to see my eyes
Nothing left inside

Nothing left inside
