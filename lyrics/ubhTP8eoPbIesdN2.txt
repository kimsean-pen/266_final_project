God lay dead in the heavens, angels sang the hymn of death
Mighty King had fallen, their wings were dripping, dripping with tears
That fell upon the earth and drowned all men in mournful rain
Looking to the heavens, but god would never rise again

God lay dead in the heavens, angels sang the hymn of war
Marching into battle, their swords were dripping, dripping with blood
That fell upon the earth and drowned all men in fearful rain
Looking to the heavens, but all they see is death and pain

Man's desire has cast the earth to drown in fire
The angels spread their wings with vengeful eyes
Now they're come to burn the lives of every soul
As you repent for the life that you stole

God has fallen and now our time has come
The angels are rising, this war has just begun
God has fallen and now our time has come
The angels are rising, this war has just begun

The skies of heaven burn with anger for their king
We've made our final sin, we can't repay
With fire they torch the earth and turn our lands to ash
No god to save us now, this is the end
