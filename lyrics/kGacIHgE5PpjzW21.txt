I don't wanna hold you if you wanna go
And I'm not gonna make you feel love if you don't
I would rather learn what it feels like to burn than feel nothing at all

Oh, I used to treat you sweetly I would pull you to my chest as you cried about the ocean slipping quickly through your hands
You were searching for one grain of sand along an endless beach
As I was building you a castle that you just refused to see

What do I say? What do I do?
To show all the ways my heart is slowly shattering for you
What do I say? What do I do?

I don't wanna hold you if you wanna go
And I'm not gonna make you feel love if you don't
I would rather learn what it feels like to burn than to feel nothing at all

You have faded my reality like leaves that turn to dust
Fell asleep inside a fantasy and woke up feeling lost
Now I'm terrified and restless but I just cannot escape
I wish you had words to cool this fever that is killing me

What do I say? What do I do?
To show you all the ways my heart is slowly shattering for you
What do I say? What do I do?

I don't wanna hold you if you wanna go and I'm not gonna make you feel love if you
Don't
I would rather learn what it feels like to burn than to feel nothing at all
I don't wanna hold you if you wanna go and I'm not gonna make you feel love if you
Don't
I would rather learn what it feels like to burn than to feel nothing at all

Oooh woah woah woah woah
Oooh woah woah woah woah
Oooh woah woah woah woah
Oooh woah woah woah woah

I don't wanna hold you if you wanna go
And I'm not gonna make you feel love if you don't
I would rather learn what it feels like to burn than feel nothing at all

I don't wanna hold you if you wanna go
And I'm not gonna make you feel love if you don't
I would rather learn what it feels like to burn than feel nothing at all

I don't wanna hold you if you wanna go
And I'm not gonna make you feel love if you don't
I would rather learn what it feels like to burn than feel nothing at all
