Do do do, do do do
Do do do, do do do

When boys are just eleven
They begin to grow in height at a fast rate than they have done before
They develop curiosity and start to fantasise
About the things they have never thought of doing before
These dreams are no more harmful than
The usual thoughts that boys have of becoming football stars or millionaires
As long as the distinction between fantasy and fiction remains
It's just a nature walk

It's just the facts of life
There's no master plan
Walk me home from school
I'll let you hold my hand
You're getting ideas
And when you sleep at night
They develop into sweet dreams
It's just the facts of life

A boy sits by the telephone, wanting to call a girl
But not daring to because she might say no
At last he summons up the courage phones
And discovers someone else has asked her first and she's said yes
Now's time to deal with the fear of being rejected
No-one gets through life without being hurt
At this point the boy who's listening to this song
Is probably saying it's easier said than done and it's true

It's just the facts of life
There's no master plan
Walk me home from school
I'll let you hold my hand
You're getting ideas
And when you sleep at night
They develop into sweet dreams
It's just the facts of life

Do do do, do do do
Do do do, do do do

Small-town dating differs from more urban situations
In particular if there's few places to go
Adolescents normally gather in a cafe or an arcade
If they have to almost anywhere will do
A family car, a disused coalmine
A rowing boat or a shed
Experimentation, familiarisation
It's all a nature walk

It's just the facts of life
There's no master plan
Walk me home from school
I'll let you hold my hand
You're getting ideas
And when you sleep at night
They develop into sweet dreams
It's just the facts of life

It's just the facts of life (Sweet dreams develop into ideas)
There's no master plan (Ideas develop into sweet dreams)
Walk me home from school (Sweet dreams develop into ideas)
I'll let you hold my hand (Let you hold my hand)
You're getting ideas (Sweet dreams develop into ideas)
And when you sleep at night (Ideas develop into sweet dreams)
They develop into sweet dreams (Sweet dreams develop into ideas)
It's just the facts of life

It's just the facts of life (Sweet dreams develop into ideas)
There's no master plan (Ideas develop into sweet dreams)
Walk me home from school (Sweet dreams develop into ideas)
I'll let you hold my hand (Let you hold my hand)
