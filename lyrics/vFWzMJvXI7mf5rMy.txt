I've got to tell you
It's that blood, blood on the floor
It's that blood, blood on the floor
It's that blood, blood on the floor
It's that blood, blood on the floor

At the little school I went out
I broke the rules
School bully with his
Crew cut and his big shoulders
Telling me I was a pansy
Just like always
Blood on the floor
Blood on the door, dooor
