I wanna love you like a lover should
Every time we say goodbye I wonder how I could
I wanna make the momentary last
I don't wanna reenact the glories of the past

Your eyes well up every time I fall down from the sky
Don't write me off

Are you dancing without me
Dancing with tears in your eyes
Reminisce
Cause I'm dancing without you
Dancing with tears in my eyes to this old song

I wanna be above this state of mind
Even though my hidden shame is now my greatest pride I wanna turn male privilege on its head
Even though without it I would probably be dead

Your eyes adjust every time I fall down from the sky
Our bodies ache

Are you dancing without me
Dancing with tears in your eyes
Reminisce
Cause I'm dancing without you
Dancing with tears in my eyes to this old song

The world's on fire
Every day the sky tears into shreds
My one concern

Are you dancing without me
Dancing with tears in your eyes
Reminisce
Cause I'm dancing without you
Dancing with tears in my eyes to this one
Are you dancing without me
Dancing with tears in your eyes to this old song
