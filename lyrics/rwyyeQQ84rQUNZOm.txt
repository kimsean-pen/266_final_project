Silence in a room with just the two of us
Afraid to speak, afraid to fuzz
Not so sure if I can tell you now
But I am falling in love with you somehow

I am falling in love...
I am falling in love...
I am falling in love...
I am falling in love...

Mysterious heat warms my heat
And I know it's just the start
My body numb - my mind about to strike
That's what love must feel like

I am falling in love...
I am falling in love...
