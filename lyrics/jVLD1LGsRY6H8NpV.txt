The more I want
The less I'm feelin'
The more I get
The less I need it

I've got this under control
I've got this under control
I've got this under control
I've got this under control

Your lips on lips
That taste salty skin

And her muscles tenses
As I tighten to my grip

When smooth means rough
And soft means hard

But she always wants more
Of what I've got to surprise

Your lips on lips
That taste salty skin

And her muscles tenses
As I tighten to my grip

When smooth means rough
And soft means hard

But she always wants more
Of what I've got to surprise

The more I want
The less I'm feelin'
The more I get
The less I need it

I've got this under control
I've got this under control
I've got this under control
I've got this under control

We're side by side
With her legs between mine
To feel her breathe for my skin
To change lanes
And then gears
Where two meets one
But it'll be twice as fun

But she always wants more
Of what I've got to surprise

To be always hungry
And never satisfied

To quench your thirst
From the top of the high

Where two meets one
But it'll be twice as fun

But she always wants more
Of what I've got to surprise

The more I want
The less I'm feelin'
The more I get
The less I need it

I've got this under control
I've got this under control
I've got this under control
I've got this under control

The more I want
The less I'm feelin'
The more I get
The less I need it

I've got this under control
I've got this under control
I've got this under control
I've got this under control

Your lips on lips
That taste salty skin

And her muscles tenses
As I tighten to my grip

When smooth means rough
And soft means hard

But she always wants more
Of what I've got to surprise
