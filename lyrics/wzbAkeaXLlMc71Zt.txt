Heart like a stone
Sinking into the sea
I'm drowning for you
Are you bleeding for me?
It cuts to the bone
Sinking deeper in me
I'm dying for you
Are you bleeding for me?

'Cause all my thoughts turn red
I can't get you outta my head, head, head
Now all my thoughts turn blue
With every glimpse of you, of you

Holding my breathe
I just want you to see
I'm falling for you
Are you reaching for me?
I call it my home
Night stars in my sea
But I'm drowning for you
Are you bleeding for me?

'Cause all my thoughts turn red
I can't get you outta my head, head, head
Now all my thoughts turn blue
With every glimpse of you, of you

'Cause all my thoughts turn red
I can't get you outta my head
Now all my thoughts turned blue
With every glimpse of you

Heart like a stone
Sinking into the sea
I'm drowning for you
Are you bleeding for me?

'Cause all my thoughts turn red
I can't get you outta my head, head, head
Now all my thoughts turn blue
With every glimpse of you, of you
