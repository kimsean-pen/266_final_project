When thoughts diverge into a search
With time lose sight of what is right
And with the tide new answers rise
Restlessly I listen

When answers merge and thoughts converge
With time, lose sight of what is right
And with the tide, new questions rise
Restlessly I listen

The endless hissing of the sea
Currents change constantly
The endless hissing of the sea
Currents change constantly
The endless hissing of the sea
Currents change constantly
The endless hissing of the sea
Currents change constantly
The endless hissing of the sea
Currents change constantly
The endless hissing of the sea
Currents change constantly
The endless hissing of the sea
Currents change constantly
The endless hissing of the sea
Currents change constantly
(The endless hissing of the sea
Currents change constantly
The endless hissing of the sea)
