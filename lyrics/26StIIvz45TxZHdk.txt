Dark blue sea
Calling me
Songs of waves
Keep me safe

Sky's so deep
There's no end
The moon still asleep
The bed of stars for me

How can I see through your eyes my destiny?
I fall apart
You bleed for me
How can I see through your eyes our worlds collide?
Open your heart, to close our great divide

Distant prayers
Carved in stone
The silent words
They will still be heard

How can I see through your eyes my destiny?
I fall apart
You bleed for me
How can I see through your eyes our worlds collide?
Open your heart, to close our great divide

How can I see through your eyes my destiny?
I fall apart
You bleed for me
So I just float with the tide through the night
I pass you by
Open my heart, to close our great divide
