Half past 9 quarter to 10
10: 15
And we're comin' around again
Hold off are we going soft?
Flushed my Zoloft
And we're comin' around again
Found out and I almost drowned
Walked back down
And we're comin' around again
If I could talk I'd tell you
If I could smile I'd let you know
You are far and away my most imaginary friend
If I could talk I'd tell you
When I can smile I'll let you know
If I could talk I'd tell you
Khmer Rouge genocide qua
Your place or Mein Kampf
Now I'm giving the dog a bone
Slight hunch without the vaguest clue
To keep the blood balance
Now we're comin' around again,
To 1/2 past 9 quarter to 2
10: 15
And we're comin' around again
If I could talk I'd tell you
If I could smile I'd let you know
You are far and away my most imaginary friend
If I could talk I'd tell you
When I can smile I'll let you know
If I could talk I'd tell you

If I could talk I'd tell you
If I could smile I'd let you know
You are far and away my most imaginary friend
If I could talk I'd tell you
When I can smile I'll let you know
You are far and away my most imaginary friend
