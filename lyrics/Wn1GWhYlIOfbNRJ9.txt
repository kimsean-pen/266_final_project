What have they done
You've done no harm
Red water runs
Through Fragile arms

I close my eyes
And believe that you are here
Wrong I have done
Please make it clear

Heaven will fall
As you hold him in your arms
Blood on our hands
We stand alone

My hate's immense
His name's in vain
Destroying God
Will cure my pain

I close my eyes
And believe that you are here
Wrong I have done
Please make it clear

Heaven will fall
As you hold him in your arms
Blood on our hands
We stand alone
