I used to find a little peace in the lay up line
When I start sweating I start to unwind
I used to find a little peace under the bright lights
When I start sweating I start to unwind
A lady came to me in 1985
We got in the car and started to drive
We headed West but over town behind
Dad was looking for the Hollywood sign

There was a time when I could only impress you
You can tell by now that I'm only guessing

They kept asking me to describe
The logic that was running through my mind
All he had for sale through hard times
But we'll run on this one, has to decline

There was a time when I could only impress you
You can tell by now that I'm only guessing
If you say that the clocks run down
And the red lights glowing
If your mind's made up
Then I'll get going

So turn all the lights down low (repeat)
