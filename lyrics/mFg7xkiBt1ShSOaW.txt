Your heart is broken to your surprise
You're sick of crying for blue eyes
So tired of living, misunderstood
Think hard woman, I think you should

Come, sorrow is so peculiar
Comes in a day, then it'll never leave you
You take a pill, wonder if it will fix you
They wonder why sorrow has never left you

I'm talkin' bout blue eyes, blue eyes
What's the matter, matter?
Blue eyes, blue eyes
What's the matter, matter?

So blind, so blind
What's the matter, matter?
Blue eyes, blue eyes
What's the matter with you?

Your heart got broken on the underground
Go find your spirit in "Lost and found"
Oh, I've been watching how you behave
Not much like a lover, more like a slave

Come, sorrow is so peculiar
Comes in a day, then it'll never leave you
You take a pill, wonder if it will fix you
They wonder why sorrow has never left you

I'm talkin' bout blue eyes, blue eyes
What's the matter, matter?
Blue eyes, blue eyes
What's the matter, matter?

So blind, so blind
What's the matter, matter?
Blue eyes, blue eyes
What's the matter with...

Blue eyes, blue eyes
What's the matter, matter?
Blue eyes, blue eyes
What's the matter matter?

So blind, so blind
What's the matter, matter?
Blue eyes, blue eyes
What's the matter with you?

What's the matter with you?
