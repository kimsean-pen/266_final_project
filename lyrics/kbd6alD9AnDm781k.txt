Clear morning (so) cold
You"re lying next to me

Through vertical blades
Rays breaking on your spine and hair

A fateful girl, you were
Deadly in the night
A fortress strong and far
Vulnerable now

A fateful girl, you were
Deadly in the night
A fortress strong and far
Vulnerable now

In this odd and colourless summer we drive, we drive
In this odd and colourless summer we drive, we drive

In this odd and colourless summer we drive, we drive
(In this odd and colourless summer)
