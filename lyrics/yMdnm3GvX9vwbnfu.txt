You told me, and I listened
If only, the distance
Wasn't on our mind that much
We would never bring this up

I think that its obvious (that I'm hella crazy about you)
You think that its obvious (that you feel the same way 'bout me too)
Whenever I'm over
We act like we always knew
And I already told ya (and you already told me too)

We should say it more
We should say it more (we should say it more) I want you to know
You want me to know (we should say it more) We should say it more
We should say it more (we should say it more) I want you to know
You want me to know (we should say it more)

We tried it, like we pictured
We fought it, like we misheard
Everything we wanted here
'Cause we were overcome by fear

And I think that's now obvious (that I'm hella crazy about you)
You think its now obvious (that you feel the same way 'bout me too)

We should say it more
We should say it more (we should say it more) I want you to know
You want me to know (we should say it more) We should say it more
We should say it more (we should say it
more) I want you to know (You want me to know)
