Turn it around
I'm fix to fix
Why you already made
Too many promises
To keep on like this

I'm fix to fix
To go on like this

Everyday
You shot you shot you shot
Everyday
Like a stranger to the earth

The big secret of
Dealing with people
You're such a sicko
Refrain
Refrain

Everyday
You shot you shot you shot
Everyday
Like a stranger to the earth
