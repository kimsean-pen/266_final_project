Why this uncertainty?
It's not clear to me
Would you rather be independent?
Have I lost your love?
Have you had enough?
Do you feel too much resentment?
How can I make you see
when you disagree
that you just can't leave?

One in a million men
could change the way you feel
One in a million men
Baby it's up to me

I won't stand in your way
I can't make you stay
though of course I'll feel rejected
You're a part of me
You're the family
I can't bear to leave

One in a million men
could change the way you feel
One in a million men
Baby it's up to me

Feel free to leave
if you think you're trapped
But please believe
I'll always want you back

One in a million men
could change the way you feel
One in a million men
Baby it's up to me
