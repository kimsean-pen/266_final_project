As I tried to say goodbye
You wouldn't let me
Kept holding me back
Now I see your face in the crowds
But it's never really you that I'm looking at

I've tried my luck, callin night and day
And now I'm stuck cos everything you throw away
I'd hold my breath and walk through fire for you
I've tried my best, but all my letters will not do

(Aye, aye, aye) I wanna tell you
(Aye, aye, aye) My love is so true
(Aye, aye, aye) You've got me holding on, yeah
(Aye, aye, aye) What was I thinking?
(Aye, aye, aye) I've started sinking
(Aye, aye, aye) Told you time and time again I was wrong

A hundred different ways I could say I'm sorry, oh
And every other day I try something new, oh
I'd write it out in blood if I thought you'd change but, oh
It's not enough for you

Remember how we laughed together
Said we'd be like this forever
I know so much has happened baby, oh
Why did I hurt you so?
Remember how we stayed up dreaming
Of all the things that we believed in
I know too much has happened baby, oh
And everyday I wonder why I let it go

(Aye, aye, aye) I wanna tell you
(Aye, aye, aye) My love is so true
(Aye, aye, aye) You've got me holding on, yeah
(Aye, aye, aye) What was I thinking?
(Aye, aye, aye) I've started sinking
(Aye, aye, aye) Told you time and time again I was wrong

A hundred different ways I could say I'm sorry, oh
And every other day I try something new, oh
I'd write it out in blood if I thought you'd change but, oh
It's not enough for you

A hundred different ways I could say I'm sorry, oh
And every other day I try something new, oh
I'd write it out in blood if I thought you'd change but, oh
It's not enough for you
