People say I'm the life of the party
'Cause I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughin' loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you, need you
Since you left me if you see me with another girl
Seemin' like I'm havin' fun
Although she may be cute
She's just a substitute
Because you're the permanent one
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look little bit closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you, need you
Outside, I'm masquerading
Inside, my hope is fading
Just a clown, ooh yeah
Since you put me down
My smile is my make up
I wear since my break up with you
Baby take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile, looks out of place
Yeah just a closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
Baby baby baby baby baby
Good look at my face
Yeah you'll see my smile, looks out of place
Look a little bit closer, it's easy to trace
Yeah the tracks of my tears
Oh yeah, baby baby
