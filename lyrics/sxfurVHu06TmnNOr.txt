Brighting
Your smile like a shining
Cause you live here
All in my head
All of my head now
Finally
We touched like a meant to be
Cause you live here
All of my head
All of my head now
Umm
Don't break my heart on this beat
I just can't figure it
Oh My
Baby Don't walk away
Don't walk away now
Just think about
Oh Take my mind I can't breathe
You know I want your kiss
Oh Now
Baby you're all my way
Don't turn it off
Like a Cigarette light
I want to get louder
So I want you feel same
Like a cigarette light
I want to get louder
Give more more oh
Like a cigarette light
Same Scenes
You love me so naturally
Cause you are the beautiful bad
Beautiful bad now
Umm
Don't break my heart on this beat
I just can't figure it
Oh My
Baby Don't walk away
Don't walk away now
Just think about
Oh Take my mind I can't breathe
You know I want your kiss
Oh Now
Baby you're all my way
Don't turn it off
Like a Cigarette light
I want to get louder
So I want you feel same
Like a cigarette light
I want to get louder
Give more more oh
Like a cigarette light
I want to get louder
So I want you feel same
Like a cigarette light
I want to get louder
Give more more oh
Like a cigarette light
Like a cigarette light
Like a cigarette light
Like a cigarette light
Don't turn it off
Like a Cigarette light
I want to get louder
So I want you feel same
Like a cigarette light
I want to get louder
Give more more oh
Like a cigarette light
I want to get louder
So I want you feel same
Like a cigarette light
I want to get louder
Give more more oh
Like a cigarette light
Like a cigarette light
Like a cigarette light
