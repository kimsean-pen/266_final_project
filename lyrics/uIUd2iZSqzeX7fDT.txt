It's very clear to me, just like it's in 3D
When total empathy sounds like it's ringing on my stereo
I'm bouncing off the wall, the way you turn me on
I think I like this song, sounds like it's ringing on my stereo

Deep in the scene like the music getting fascinating
Touching the screen like the view from my imagination
Ninety degrees, got me circulating, I've been waiting impatiently
Got me changing stations on occasion

What's your frequency? Can you connect with me?
If it's alright, your satellite can be my energy
Don't wanna be too bizarre but you're the key to my car
You're my electric guitar, sounds like it's ringing on my stereo

It's very clear to me, just like it's in 3D
When total empathy sounds like it's ringing on my stereo
I'm bouncing off the wall, the way you turn me on
I think I like this song, sounds like it's ringing on my stereo

Survive the people's faces, they're dancing from temptation
Her icky style is wasted, you don't need no invitation
Hey there cutie boys, making all that noise
It's getting hard up in here, you don't have a choice

What's your frequency? Can you connect with me?
If it's alright, your satellite can be my energy
Don't wanna be too bizarre but you're the key to my car
You're my electric guitar, sounds like it's ringing on my stereo

It's very clear to me, just like it's in 3D
When total empathy sounds like it's ringing on my stereo
I'm bouncing off the wall, the way you turn me on
I think I like this song, sounds like it's ringing on my stereo

To get all in my stereo the chance is slim
'Cause I get deep down and dirty AM or FM
I, that all it took was a rose, champagne, the lights dim and uh
It that many cats go all out but momma why bother?

I there ain't 'cause I
I must admit you got me on some
(Ooh why? Do why?)
Turn you on ma, I think, I
(Do why? Should why?)

Got a lot of women but you gotta respect it
If you ain't, I probably press the eject
I misbehave on your airways
Control frequencies, sexual tendencies

Specially for you and me
True MD, I and I
Hit me up, what?
Pretty Willie
