Your view was an understatement
You're just a kid in a family basement
Dirty tricks up your clean white sleeves
30 years til you knew what color you bleed

Didn't know what to do
You don't, you don't, you don't
I didn't know what to do
You don't, you don't, you don't

You look like you're feeling clever
Innate cover up behavior
Run fast from the small detail
And move past the ones that make you feel

I know you think it's insane
You're okay with everything

You're lying and nothing about you is safe
It's hard to say when you're not
It's okay we've all been caught crying
It's okay to be upfront

For sure you didn't know my story
Self-repair is mostly boring
Something's wrong and I want to fight
30 years and now I know I wasn't right

Didn't know what to do
You don't, you don't, you don't
I still don't know what to do
You don't, you don't, you don't

I know you think it's insane
You're okay with everything

You're lying and nothing about you is safe
It's hard to say when you're not
It's okay we've all been caught crying
It's okay to be upfront

But hey, why so mad?
If you say these things to me, that's fine
But the rest of them, they'll take you alive if they want
You don't understand
You don't know not anything
And I've loved more than you have breathed
And you can't quantify a single thing

I know you think it's insane
You're okay with everything

You're lying and nothing about you is safe
It's hard to say when you're not
It's okay we've all been caught crying
It's okay to be upfront

It's okay we've all been caught
Okay to be upfront
