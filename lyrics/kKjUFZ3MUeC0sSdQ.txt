Ohh ohh ohh, mm mm, baby, don't you want me to go
So honey, why don't you beg me to stay
For love and talk the way we used to talk
Till we both know what we've lost
Never say the words we did before
Till it was over

Love ain't here anymore
No, no, love ain't here anymore
It's gone away, to a town called yesterday
Love, ain't here anymore

Listen, oh, listen
I don't wanna let go (won't let go)
So baby, we can change the way we feel
For love, and open up the way we did before
Co's now is the right time and I'm sure
You never say the words you did before
When it was over

Love ain't here anymore
Love ain't here anymore
It's gone away to that town called yesterday
Love ain't here anymore

And when I find a place for me to keep my sweet love (keep my sweet love)
Then I will leave it there forever more, yeah
And when I find someone to share
I never gave up
I will hold that, believe that
This love leads to more

Love ain't here anymore
No no love ain't here anymore
No no love ain't here anymore
Don't you beg me to stay
No no no
Love ain't here anymore
It's gone away, to a town called yesterday
Love ain't here anymore
