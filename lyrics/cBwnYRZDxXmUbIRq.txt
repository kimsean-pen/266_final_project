Look at us, the picture of happiness
Not so long ago, ah not so very long ago
The pride of all our friends, the perfect couple were we
Is this how it will end, just a sad, sad story?

Living in a house divided with a love that's so one sided
There's no chance at all, the walls have got to fall
Living in a house divided with a love that's so one sided
There's no chance at all, the walls have got to fall, tumbling down

Look at us, the king and queen of emptiness
Living inside our castle of loneliness
Unable to make amends, such perfect strangers are we
Is this how it will end, just a sad story?

Living in a house divided with a love that's so one sided
There's no chance at all, the walls have got to fall
Living in a house divided with a love that's so one sided
There's no chance at all, the walls have got to fall, tumbling down

Living in a house divided with a love that's so one sided
There's no chance at all, the walls have got to fall
Living in a house divided with a love that's so one sided
There's no chance at all
