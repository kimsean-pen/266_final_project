I'll burn my name in your eyes
And I'll learn to play with your fire
Rather just be told I'm a liar

You told me that I need to atone
Coming from a broken home
You say I need to leave my love alone

You make sure I'm missing the point
I'll now just be kissing the ground
I'd rather just be kissing my life away

say I'm wrong
glad to have disagreed
do you really want to be under my [something] over the
you say you're gonna let me watch
you say you're gonna disappear
it really doesn't feel like trying
til I walk a mile and you're near
you listed all the games I've played
you tried to take the things we've made
and I'd rather just be dead on arrival

You make sure I'm missing the point
I'll now just be kissing the ground
I'd rather just be kissing my life away

You make sure I'm missing the point
I'll now just be kissing the ground
I'd rather just be kissing our lives away

You make sure I'm missing the point
I'll now just be kissing the ground
I'd rather just be dead on arrival

I'd rather just be dead on arrival
