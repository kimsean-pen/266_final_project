Well I sleep all day
And drink all night
Just give me one good reason
I'll turn out my light

Now I'm terrified
Now I'm terrified

And I've heard all the people
Calling my name
But they'll never see just
How I've changed

Now I'm terrified
Now I'm terrified

'Cause I don't wanna be your boy, I wanna be your man
But something's got me wrong inside
Now I'm looking for the answer I don't understand
And darling, I am terrified

I'm terrified that maybe
I wasn't cut out for this
You know, I'm terrified that maybe
I wasn't cut out for this

I know it's hard to explain how it got this way
And people only want to know why
Well I wish I had the answer that would make it okay
The truth is I'm just terrified

'Cause I don't wanna be your boy, I wanna be your man
But something's got me wrong inside
Now I'm looking for the answer I don't understand
And darling, I am terrified

I'm terrified that maybe
I wasn't cut out for this
You know, I'm terrified that maybe
I wasn't cut out for this

You know, you could come and save me
But you have to take a risk
'Cause I'm terrified that maybe
I wasn't cut out for this
I wasn't cut out for this
