Oh when it's cold
I get warm just thinking of you
When I'm alone
I stare at stars and hope dreams come true

You're probably not aware
That I'm even here
Well you might not know I exist
But I don't even care

Sweet talk
Everything you say
It sounds like
Sweet talk to my ears
You could yell
"Piss off! Won't you stay away?"
It'll still be
Sweet talk to my ears

Oh when you laugh
I forget that it's about me
But it's alright
Yeah, 'cause being your punchline
Still is something

Yeah well I'm not scared
I'm not going nowhere
Yeah, you might want me to drop dead
But I don't even care

Sweet talk
Everything you say
It sounds like
Sweet talk to my ears
You could yell
"Piss off! Won't you stay away?"
It'll still be
Sweet talk to my ears

Ooh, everything you say
It sounds like
Ooh, to my ears
Ooh, "Won't you stay away?"
It sounds like
Ooh, to my ears

Sweet talk
Everything you say
It sounds like
Sweet talk to my ears
You could yell
"Piss off! Won't you stay away?"
It'll still be
Sweet talk to my ears
