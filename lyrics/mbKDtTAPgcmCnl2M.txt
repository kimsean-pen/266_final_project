Every time she looks at me I can feel electric heat -
all right
all right.
Shiny sparkle in your eyes as she's moving in disguise -
all right
all right.

I am losing my control
may be time to take a hold -
tonight
all right.
Body spinning all around
don't know if I'm up or down -
I'm on fire.

Breaking up the night-shaking up the night-breaking up the night-
come on it's time to hit the floor

you can be sure you won't get bored.

People jumpin' in the air
going crazy everywhere -
all right
all right.
I keep starting at her face when the clock begins to race -
all night
all night.

I am losing my control
may be time to take a hold -
tonight
all right.
Body spinning all around
don't know if I'm up or down -
I'm on fire.
