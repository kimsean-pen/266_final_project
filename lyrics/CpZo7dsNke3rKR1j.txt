In the city of drag queens, there's a fine line between being shady and being a lady.
This is penny, which will she choose?
I just got off the bus
I don't drink or eat or cuss
You're new in town
it's time to knuckle down
Start swimming to the top before you drown
Who are you?
We are the pageant queens (oh, fancy) we're elegant machines
in gowns we strut
we don't need corny smut (what?)
let's hold back and see which way she leans
Who are you?
We are the comedy queens (oh cute.) humor always justifies the means
while she's there telling a joke (look!)
I'm right behind you poke (oh!)
so don't listen to them 'cause there just full of beans (literally!)
Who's that?
Wait! She's the shady queen horrid queen no one wants to see her
on her own all alone no one wants to be her
Listen up pretty pup
she's on her way to six feet underground
Yes and nothing nice nothing good ever goes her way so
miss "off the bus" stick with us even ru would say so
Who?
(Gasp)
Rupaul!
Oh!
Turn around
we are the better queens the safer queens the lighter queens the brighter queens
the wiser queens advisor queens the ones who you should stick with
Penny, you really wanna be a star?
Yeah I do!
No! Son't do it! don't girl! she's got testicles! I've seen them! she's a man with one eye no!
There's a hole in your heart there'a place in your soul a passion so strong it makes your blood boil
all your dreams come alive all your wishes will grow
if you take a swig of this fish oil
Drink for me
Oh, I'd really like to but I shouldn't I-
Drink for me!
But I do want to be a big, big star
Drink for me!
Don't do it! Don't do it!
Drink for me!
You'll lose it! You'll lose it!
Well I'm gonna be the greatest star
and nothing and no one's gonna keep me down
and you, and you, and all of you
I'll make you love me
Don't do it! Don't do it!
Oh I can't get it open
Here!
Don't do it! Don't do it!
Watch me be your star
All t all shade
Thanks to fish oil, our good little penny became one bad penny.
But, she got her fame
Because I'm the biggest star
and I'm going far
just a miracle in front of you
Oh, and if you don't believe
I will show you I'll teach you
I'll school you I'll beat you
And punch you and crunch you
I'll take you and make you thank me
When you love me
That's how you do it back rolls
Did you see what she said to me!
Back rolls! heard it!
Can you believe, can you believe she even said that
yes she really did
oh yes she really, really went there
Well I'm not gonna stick around and be a part of her show
but you have to!
Girl, the paycheck!
Oh, right mhmm
No, I'll never love anyone else like I love myself
oh no, no, no, no I'll never love anyone else
Ai dios mio! The's going down! too much fish oil!
Now's our chance!
Watch us rise to the top 'cause we're the fresh fish on the scene
we're the new girls in town we're stepping right over this queen
she's been throwing some shade and now we don't give a damn
take away her fish oil and there ain't nothing left there, man
Woo!
Center stage
another chapter time to turn the page
And finally I'm the star
no I'm the star!
No I'm the star! no girl! (mumbled fighting)
Oh the shade the shade of it all
Look at yourself shady ladies
you should be ashamed of what you've become oh,
I never thought that you would do this
so let me remind you of just one thing
Take each other's hands and come together cause
we are each other's family all
2, 603, 040 sisters
this is our land and we are the queens
Time to take a stand and come together (we come together)
cause we are each other's family (we're all family)
all 2, 603, 040 sisters (many queens)
this is our land and we are the queens
So even if you're a pageant queen
a comedy queen
a fishy queen
a shady queen or just a big damn girl
we are a family
Back rolls!
