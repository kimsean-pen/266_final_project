Close your eyes
Make a wish
That this could last forever
If only you could stay
With me now

So tell me what it is
That keeps us from each other now

Yeah it's coming to get me
You're under my skin
No I can't let you go
You're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss
And I don't wanna know
The reason why I

Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls
Cause I miss you
Take my hand
Take my life

Just don't take forever
And let me feel your pain

Kept inside (oh yeah)
There's gotta be a way
For you and I together now
Yeah it's coming to get me
You're under my skin
No I can't let you go
You're a part of me now

Caught by the taste of your kiss (ohh)
And I don't wanna know
The reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls
Cause I miss you

It's an illusion
How can I feel this way?
If I can't have you
It's an illusion
Nothing is real this way
If I can't have you
No I can't let you go
You're a part of me now (now)
Caught by the taste of your kiss (I don't wanna know)
And I don't wanna know
The reason why I
Can't stay forever like this (I'm climbing the walls)
Now I'm climbing the walls
Cause I miss
Ohhhh
I can't let you go no
And I don't wanna know
The reason why I
Can't stay forever like this (ohh ohh)
Now I'm climbing the walls
Cause I miss (I miss) you
