You're a polished diamond, now you're feeling kinda rough
Yes I know how long you been searching for the perfect touch
You better hear what I say
I can tell your eyes are just about to give you away

'Cause there's the girl that you were after
Feel your heart beating faster now
There's the girl that you were after
Can you say that you don't want her anymore?

Just take my word now 'cause you know it's true
She ain't good enough for the likes of you
You better hear what I say
I can tell your eyes are just about to give you away

'Cause there's the girl that you were after
Feel your heart beating faster now
There's the girl that you were after
And all the time you can't get past her

There's the girl that you were after
Broken glass, complete disaster
There's the girl that you were after
Can you say that you don't want her anymore?
Oh oh oh oh

I believed you once when you explained
That it wasn't so tough to forget her name

'Cause there's the girl that you were after
Feel your heart beating faster now
There's the girl that you were after
And all the time you can't get past her

There's the girl that you were after
Broken glass, complete disaster
There's the girl that you were after
Can you say that you don't want her anymore?
Oh oh oh oh oh

Oh there's the girl
