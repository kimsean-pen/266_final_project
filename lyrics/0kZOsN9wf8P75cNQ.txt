A temporary descent into the depths of the underworld
Ends up an odyssey through pale Gehinnom
Detached and stray, adrift, frail
No fire to flicker, no shadows to grow

Rite of passage gone wrong
Lost in liminal

Warped patterns, fractured truths
No shores in sight, no trail ahead

In radiance of a broken prism
Led through scorched earth
Forever in friction
Without purpose, no way there

No other world and no other truth
No other aim and no other path
No other will and no other fall
No other mind, no other heart

A blind communion
A dirge for the ego
Lost in liminal
