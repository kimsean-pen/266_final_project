Oh my, I didn't know what it means to believe
Oh my, I didn't know what it means to believe

But if I hold on tight, is it true?
Would You take care of all that I do?
Oh Lord, I'm getting ready to believe.

Oh my, I didn't know how hard it would be
Oh my, I didn't know how hard it would be

But if I hold on tight, is it true?
Would You take care of all that I do?
Oh Lord, I'm getting ready to believe.

Then we'll be waving hands singing freely
Singing standing tall it's now coming easy
Oh no more looking down honey
Can't you see?
Oh Lord, I'm getting ready to believe

Then we'll be waving hands singing freely
Singing standing tall it's now coming easy
Oh no more looking down honey
Can't you see me?

Oh Lord, I'm getting ready
Oh Lord, I'm getting ready
Oh Lord, I'm getting ready to believe
