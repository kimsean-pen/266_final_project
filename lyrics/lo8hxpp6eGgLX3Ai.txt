Something is wrong
My strength has gone
Thoughts are corrupting my mind

I can see, I perceive this ain't me

Something so strong
My mood has swung
I can't get it out of my head

I believe that my mind misleads me

(We confuse)
Is it a doubt you to try to hide? (tangle and abuse)
Just have an open look inside (we appear)
It's just a dreary memory stuck in your mind

Retrieve your balance
Use your senses to observe (the essence of silence)
Search for your essence
Find the silence within you (the essence is)

You're searching
And bursting

There seems to be no cure
When tension endures
Delusions corrupting my mind

I can see, I perceive this ain't me

There seems to be no way
When light fades to grey
To get them all out of my head

I believe that my mind misleads me

(We confuse)
Is it a doubt you to try to hide? (tangle and abuse)
Just have an open look inside (we appear)
It's just a dreary memory stuck in your mind

Retrieve your balance
Use your senses to observe (the essence of silence)
Search for your essence
Find the silence within you (the essence is)

Make a start
Explore your heart

When a persistent memory
Penetrates deep in your mind
Allow the silence to destroy
Your thoughts in every kind

(We confuse)
Is it a doubt you to try to hide? (tangle and abuse)
Just have an open look inside (we appear)
It's just a dreary memory stuck in your mind

Retrieve your balance
Use your senses to observe (the essence of silence)
Allow the silence
To wipe your thoughts away

Retrieve your balance
Use your senses to observe (the essence of silence)
Search for essence
Find the silence within you (the essence lies)

In silence
