I've been staring for weeks at the cold rusted sheets
And the broken down pillars of the years that have passed by
At the cold depths of rivers and the moons that have fallen
And risen as halves I've been star gazing

And whispering to myself in the night
And by the river at dawn I have discovered the light
I've been watching the tides and I've been feeling their flow
And its a humbling experience to watch as they grow

Down where the beauty of our dreams touches the beauty of the sky
And the stars in our oceans become the stars in our eyes
Where we reach out to forever for just one last grasp at hope
Where the tides ebb and flow is all our minds really know

They leave in short breaths returning to give and to hold and to steal
And its calming and it heals, and its softening it seems
To leave my past behind join the tide
And head out toward the seas

Down where the beauty of our dreams touches the beauty of the sky
And the stars in our oceans become the stars in our eyes
Where we reach out to forever for just one last grasp at hope
Where the tides ebb and flow is all our minds really know

I'm lost in the moment where the tide embraces me
Where I fall into the river and set sail toward the sea
I'm lost and I'm dreaming, I'm lost and I'm feeling
Like this has waited forever to finally take me

I'm lost in the moment where the tide embraces me
Where I fall into the river and set sail toward the sea
I'm lost and I'm dreaming, I'm lost and I'm feeling
Like this has waited forever to finally take me

Down where the beauty of our dreams touches the beauty of the sky
And the stars in our oceans become the stars in our eyes
Where we reach out to forever for just one last grasp at hope
Where the tides ebb and flow is all our minds really know
