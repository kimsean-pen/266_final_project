Have you felt a void numbing your soul
And lit a candle just to watch it burn?
The flame dances but outside of this stage
Shadows creep

Every day I fight to stay in the light
I endure the darkness
'Cause it shows me the stars
And I vow to keep on spreading the light
'Til the day I die

When I find myself in doubt I look within
And watch my virtues tame their own reverse
They're in balance but it's up to me
To tip the scale

Every day I fight to stay in the light
I endure the darkness
'Cause it shows me the stars
And I vow to keep on spreading the light
'Til the day I die

Every day I fight to stay in the light
I endure the darkness
'Cause it shows me the stars
Like a mirror I'm reflecting the light
To the world around

Being the hero is a choice
I believe it with all that I am
A spotless heart's not a gift
But a conquest that's worth striving for

(Candid heart bathed in light
Spotless heart choosing light
Faithful heart praising light
Lavish heart spreading light
Candid heart bathed in light
Spotless heart choosing light
Spreading light)

Every day I fight to stay in the light
I endure the darkness
'Cause it shows me the stars
And I vow to keep on spreading the light
'Til the day I die

Every day I fight to stay in the light
I endure the darkness
'Cause it shows me the stars
Like a mirror I'm reflecting the light
To the world around

Every day I find my path
And I fight to stay in the light
