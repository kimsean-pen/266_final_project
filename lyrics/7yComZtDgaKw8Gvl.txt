Like a silhouette, you never should have came
I saw you through the light, in a different way
The grass was turning blue, there was nothing I could do
You opened up the doors, my heart is yours

I fell into a love that vanished in the air
I failed to see the truth of a girl who didn't care
I should've known better, your heart wouldn't stay
But I didn't know the rain was coming today

I swear I didn't know
I swear I didn't know

Down on my luck, I suppose nothing's going right
I gave you all I had and everything inside
You tore me into two, there was nothing I could do
I got nothing left, I took it all to you

I fell into a love that vanished in the air
I failed to see the truth of a girl who didn't care
I should've known better, that your heart wouldn't stay
But I didn't know the rain was coming today

I gave you all I had, you tore me into two
I should've known better than to be your fool
I heard it from my friends who see it different ways
But I didn't know the rain was coming today

I swear I didn't know
I swear I didn't know
I swear I didn't know
Nobody told me
Nobody told me
Nobody told me

Fell into a love, vanished in the air
I failed to see the truth of a girl who didn't care
I should've known better, that your heart wouldn't stay
