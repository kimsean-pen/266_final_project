Other men's girls think I'm in love, think I'm in trouble
In a swimming pool, where other fools, dare to drown them
And I don't wear make up
And I don't wear make up

Find another canvas, to paint my dreams across, I look elsewhere
My spine tingles, as I know we're a well rehearsed disaster, here we go

Other men's girls think I'm in love, think I'm in trouble
In a swimming pool, where other girls, dare to drown them.
And I don't wear make up
And I don't wear make up
