Something about the way you taste
Makes me wanna clear my throat.
There's a message to your movements
That really gets my goat.

I looked for sniffy linings
But you're rotten to the core.
I've had about all I can take
You know I can't take it no more.

I got a gut feeling

Centered 'round long time ago
On your ability to torment.
Then you took your tongs of love
And stripped away my garment.
I looked for sniffy linings

Are we not men?

We are Devo

I got a gut fucking feeling
That you're rotten to the core
I've had about all I can take
You know I can't take it no more
