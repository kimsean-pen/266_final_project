Mmhmm
Why do you crash my party?
How do you always call me
Right when I start feeling like I'm strong enough to let it all go?
How do you always show up
Right at the perfect moment?
As soon as I'm forgetting all about you, you end up at my door

How do you know?
How do you? How do you?
How do you know?
How do you? How do you?
How do you know?
How do you? How do you?
How do you know

If you really love me then let me go now
Find somebody new and take 'em home now
I look at you, I miss you and I stop from starting over
So can we stop from starting
Something that we know that we can't handle?
Find somebody new, a different angle
I look at you, I miss you and I stop from starting over
And we need to start all over again
And again, and again, and again, and again

Why do you call me only
Just 'cause you can't be lonely?
Stop begging me, now, can't you see
I finally got back on my feet? (On my feet)
How do you find my weakness
Just when I think I'm free this?
As soon as I'm forgetting all about you, you end up at my door

How do you know?
How do you? How do you?
How do you know?
How do you? How do you?
How do you know?
How do you? How do you?
How do you know

If you really love me then let me go now
Find somebody new and take 'em home now
I look at you, I miss you and I stop from starting over
So can we stop from starting
Something that we know that we can't handle?
Find somebody new, a different angle
I look at you, I miss you and I stop from starting over
And we need to start all over again

Why do you crash my party?
(And again, and again, and again...)
Why do you always call me?
(And again, and again, and again...)
Why do you crash my party?
(And again, and again, and again...)
You need to let me go

If you really love me then let me go now
I look at you, I miss you and I stop from starting over

If you really love me then let me go now
Find somebody new and take 'em home now
I look at you, I miss you and I stop from starting over
So can we stop from starting
Something that we know that we can't handle?
Find somebody new, a different angle
I look at you, I miss you and I stop from starting over
And we need to start all over again
And again, and again, and again, and again
