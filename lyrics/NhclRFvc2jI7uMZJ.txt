I would never lie to you
But it's hard when the truth is such a shame
I never wanted to say "I'm sorry"
But 'sorry' is all I can say

Is it really all that bad when I dream
Yeah, I dream about you
You know that a lot of the things you say
About me, were never true

I've lost a few good friends lately
And I think it's my fault, not theirs
I was never a fake or phoney
I just needed a change, I guess
Why does it feel so good to be self-destructing again?

It's way too cold in the winter, baby
For you to be alone in your bed
I don't need to know when it happens
But just know that I'm still there

Is it really all that bad when I dream
Yeah, I dream about you
You know that a lot of the things you say
About me, were never true

I've lost a few good friends lately
And I think it's my fault, not theirs
I was never a fake or phoney
I just needed a change, I guess
Why does it feel so good to be self destructing-again?

I guess you're doing alright
I'm here for you like I used to do
I never really thought I'd get through it;
I'm still here, without you

I've lost a few good friends lately
And I think it's my fault, not theirs
I was never a fake or phoney
I just needed a change, I guess
Why does it feel so good to be self destructing-again?

Just self-destructing again
Just self-destructing again
