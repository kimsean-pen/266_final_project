Take a long hard look into my rear view mirror,
At the darkened path that left me broken and blind.

I'll never know where it went wrong, so I won't try again.
I'll surrender to the simple thought of losing everything.

She's the voice I hear when slipping out of reason,
She took from me the cause I thought I'd never deny.

I'll never know where it went wrong.
I'll never try again,
I've surrendered to the simple thought of losing everything.

I let you write into my dreams hoping you'd never walk away, and I blame you for it.
I'll never know, I'll never know...

I'll never try again,
I'll surrender to the simple thought of losing everything.
