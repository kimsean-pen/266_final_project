Early in the morning
Where there used to be a slough
There's a tiny business lake
Don't let the cattails fool you

Down in the bottom
Where nothin' is born
Sleeps a silver dollar
with your face thereon

I wish I could trace the frowning compass
Of your mouth
Drop a mercury dime down a roman drain
And summon mars

Last lion of Albion
They'll use you for centuries to come
They'll steal your patents for the sun
And you'll feel extinction
When you see your face on their money

Late in the heavens
That are already bought
Sleeps a red planet
In the galaxy of a lion's thoughts

On the surface every tendon
And intended machine
Is gonna buckle, knuckle, kneel
On a carpet of lion's tongues

I wish i could stand in the spray
At the cliff of your sleek revenge
Oceans of naked, serrated marble
Crushing in

Last lion of Albion
They'll use you for centuries to come
Your wound is the main road into London
You'll feel extinction
When you see your face on their money

Last lion of Albion
The last she-wolf to mother Rome
The last virgin to wash ashore
You'll feel extinction.

Last lion of Albion
The last of the mohican's gone
The last cedars of Lebanon
You'll feel extinction

Last lion of Albion
Last tiger of Tasmania
The last she-wolf to suckle Rome
When you see your face on their money
