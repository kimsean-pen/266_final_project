I'm not mining for gold
But insecurity
Fooled by a trick of the light
Are you there?
I'm not breaking the mould
I wouldn't fill it
Hold my life in your hands
If you dare

We wait, weighed down
We let it all escape
We let it go, let it go
We let it go

We let it go

We wait in line for nothingness
We wait in line for nothingness
This angel needs some tenderness
This angel needs some tenderness
We wait in line for nothingness
We wait in line for nothingness
This angel needs some tenderness
This angel needs some tenderness, tenderness

I'm not here for the show
I'm not buying it
Five steps back from the past
If you dare

We wait, weighed down
We let it all escape
We let it go, we let it go
We let it go

We wait in line for nothingness
We wait in line for nothingness
This angel needs some tenderness
This angel needs some tenderness
We wait in line for nothingness
We wait in line for nothingness
This angel needs some tenderness
This angel needs some tenderness, tenderness...

We wait in line for nothingness
We wait in line for nothingness
This angel needs some tenderness
This angel needs some tenderness
We wait in line for nothingness
We wait in line for nothingness
This angel needs some tenderness
This angel needs some tenderness, tenderness
