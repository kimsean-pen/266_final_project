I will leave behind all of my clothes
I wore when I was with you.
All I needs are my railroad boots
and my leather jacket.

As I say goodbye to Ruby's arms...
Although my heart is breaking
I will steal away out through your blinds
for soon you will be waking.

Morning light has washed your face
and everything is turning blue now.
I hold on to your pillow case.
There's nothing that I can do now.

As I say goodbye to Ruby's arms
you'll find another soldier.
And I swear to God by Christmas time
there'll be someone else to hold you.

The only thing I'm taking is
the scarf off of your clothesline.
I'll hurry past your chest of drawers
and your broken wind chimes.

As I say goodbye, I say goodbye
say goodbye to Ruby's arms.

I will feel my way down the darkened hall
and out into the morning.
The hobos in the freight yards
have kept their fires burning.
Said, "Jesus Christ, this god damn rain."
Will someone put me on a train?
I'll never kiss your lips again
or break your heart.
As I say goodbye, I say goodbye
say goodbye to Ruby's arms.
