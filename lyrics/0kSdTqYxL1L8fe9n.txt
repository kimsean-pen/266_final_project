As I sat down thinking for a while,
My mind spread a thousand miles.
Thinking about the sunshine,
That dry my clothes on the line.

Thinking about the rain,
That spilled better on my window pane.
And the sinfull people,
Who come a long way in vain.

My mind keeps going on, on and on and on,
As I sing my little song,
Thinking 'bout my girl who has left me and gone.

My mind keeps going on, on and on and on,
As I sing my little song,
Thinking 'bout my girl who has left me and gone.

(.)

Thinking 'bout my mother. and my father too!
Thinkign 'bout my sisters. and my brothers too!
Thinking 'bout my life. and my future wife.

My mind keeps going on, on and on and on,
As I sing my little song,
Thinking 'bout my girl who has left me and gone.

My mind straight on and on, on and on and on,
On and on and on.
