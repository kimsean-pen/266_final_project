One day I'll see the better part of me
The one who leads you
The one who wants to
And I'll look for you
I know where you'll be
Living easy, so easy

Oh cause, I'll be down and out
I know
I think I knew way too soon
You think he's in love with you
One day I'll feel oh I'll know when it's real
I've been waiting, anticipating
And I'll let you know you deserve to see

Don't be hard on me
Oh I'm trying yeah I'm trying

I think things
Have sunken
Beneath my skin
I think I
Should clear my
Head and think straight again
I'm sorry for falling asleep on your shoulder
When I'm older
I'll grow colder
