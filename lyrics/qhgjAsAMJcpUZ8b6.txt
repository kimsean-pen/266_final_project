I'm gonna take a stab at this

Sure you will be alright

Make a decision with a kiss
Maybe I have frostbite
And when I shuffled on back home

I'll make sure all of my tracks in the snow

Were gone

Tissue and bones, it was a tryst
This isn't a gunfight
Checking it off my list
Unable to rewrite
Five years, countless months and far alone

Hope I'm ready, able to make my own

Good home

They go, we go, I want you to know what I did, I did

They go, we go, I want you to know what I did, I did

They go, we go, I want you to know what I did, I did

They go, we go, I want you to know what I did, I did

They go, we go, I want you to know what I did, I did

They go, we go, I want you to know what I did, I did
