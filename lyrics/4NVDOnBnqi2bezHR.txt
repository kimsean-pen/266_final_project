How many times can they fill me with lies
And I listen, again
Twisting the truth
And they're playin' around with my head O.K.
The things they will do
And the things they will say
but they don't really understand
Tears fill my eyes when I hear all the cries
For the reason today

And they don't really know
Even what they're talkin' about
And I can't imagine what empty heads can achieve.

Leave me alone
Don't want your promises no more
'Cause rock'n'roll is my religion and my love
Won't ever change
May think it's strange
You can't kill rock'n'roll
It's here to stay.

Looking through eyes of time
Mirrors reflecting their
stories untrue
Promises promises
Telling me all of my glories overdue.
How many times have I heard it before
And I'll probably hear it again
King of a thousand knights
Pawn in a table fight Losing to you.

And they don't really know
Even what they're talkin' about
And I can't imagine what empty heads can achieve.

Leave me alone
Don't want your promises no more
'Cause rock'n'roll is my religion and my law
Won't ever change
May think it's strange
You can't kill rock'n'roll it's here to stay.

Even the rhymes that they give me in times of confession
ain't true
Outcome is obvious
All for them none for us meaning you too

The things they will do
And the things they will say
When they don't really understand
Fear of rejection I need their protection
I'm making a stand

And they don't really know
Even what they're talkin' about
And I can't imagine what empty heads can achieve.

Leave me alone
Don't want your promises no more
'Cause rock'n'roll is my religion and my law
Won't ever change
May think it's strange
You can't kill rock'n'roll it's here to stay
Leave me alone
Don't want your promises no more
'Cause rock'n'roll is my religion and my law
Won't ever change
May think it's strange
I'm forced to rock n role, guide me through the day
