Talk to me, I don't wanna be your enemy
Whatever happen to communication, conversation
Talk to me, I miss the way that it used to be
Now you hide behind the walls created, separated

Misery, you could use a little company
I always thought that we'd be sad together, sad forever
I confess, I'm only happy when I'm depressed
So don't forget me when you're feeling better
Whatever

Cry for help, I prefer to get high for help
You know that therapy is so expensive oh you're so defensive
Are you jaded? Well at least you got compensated
Do you really think your time was wasted? Man times are changing

Misery, you could use a little company
I always thought that we'd be sad together, sad forever
I confess, I'm only happy when I'm depressed
So don't forget me when you're feeling better
Whatever

The good good times are over
The good good times are over
You shoulda told me last October
I guess I'll go get sober again

Misery, you could use a little company
I always thought that we'd be sad together, sad forever
I confess, I'm only happy when I'm depressed
So don't forget me when you're feeling better
Whatever

Feeling better
Whatever
Feeling better
Whatever
