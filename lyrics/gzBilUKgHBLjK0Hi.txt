All of the wounded that need to be saved
Looked for a handout beyond the gates
And I need to know if their blood was worth it
As we live this inferno and burn down to the bone
All of the arrows that plunge into prey
Are their promises of better days
And I need to know if their blood was worth it

As we live this inferno, because I would rather...
Die on my shield, die on my shield
As love's war rages on
(All of our pain is worth it- together we fall apart)
