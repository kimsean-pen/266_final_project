If you could know
What I felt like the first time we met
If you could know
You made my blood flow again
Reminded me I'm alive
I can't stop buzzing for you
This real romance mistake
I can't stop looking at your sparkly eyes
Wondering how you dance
I did not know I do
I feel ignored but I don't know where we are
But it feels great to be alive

Where am I goin'?
Are we here?
My brain's overflowing
Is filling with fear
I am not ready
To feel something real
Is it out of my hands?
And out of my head?

If you knew me better
You'll know that I'm a strange girl in a strange world
If you could know
You make my blood flow again
Reminded me that I'm alive
I can't stop buzzing for you
This real romance mistake
I can't stop looking at your sparkly eyes
Wondering how you dance
I did not know I do
I feel ignored but I don't know where we are
But it feels great to be alive
