One last bullet
One last round
One single motto:
"Conquer or die!"
Our flag bleeding
On the ground
Our only hope is Werwolf!
Werwolf! Werwolf!

Werwolf,
Riding the end times!
Werwolf behind enemy lines!
Sudden flames greet
Muscle and bone
And all we need is Werwolf!
Werwolf! Werwolf!

Werwolf! Werwolf!

Last ditch warriors
Crawling like snakes
Poised to rise-up
In wolven shape
Nothing to conquer
Only to destroy
Our only hope is Werwolf!
Werwolf! Werwolf! Werwolf!

Werwolf,
Trap encirclement complete
A new dawn bursts as
We spurn defeat
Sudden flames greet
Muscle and bone
And all we have is Werwolf!
Werwolf!
Werwolf!
Werwolf!
Werwolf!
