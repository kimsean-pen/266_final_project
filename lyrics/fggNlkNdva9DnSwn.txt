Say, my love, I came to you with
Best intentions
You laid down and gave to me just
What I'm seeking
Love, you drive me to distraction

Hey my love do you believe that we
Might last a thousand years
Or more if not for this?
Our flesh and blood
It ties you and me right up
Tie me down

Celebrate we will
'Cause life is short but
Sweet for certain, hey
We climb on two by two
To be sure these days continue
Things we cannot change

Hey, my love, you came to me like
wine comes to this mouth
Grown tired of water all the time
You quench my heart and
You quench my mind

Celebrate we will
'Cause life is short but
Sweet for certain
We climb on two by two
To be sure these days continue
Things we cannot
Celebrate you and me
Climb two by two, to be sure
These days continue
Things we cannot change

Oh, my love I came to you
With best intentions
You laid down and gave to me
Just what I'm seeking

Celebrate we will
'Cause life is short
But sweet for certain hey
We climb two by two
To be sure these days continue
Things we cannot change
Things we cannot change
