We've all been told when we were little
We could grow up and live a fairy tale
But no one ever bothered telling us that
The story book ending never started out well
Why's there always gotta be a hero?
What if Cinderella had to save herself?
It's not like we don't need a little help
But maybe it's a good thing to go through little hell
Now I'm laying in bed tonight
With my best friend sleeping on my couch
She got kicked out of her house cause she finally came out and all the riches in the kingdom won't fix that

We'll walk through fire and ice
Come out the other side with diamonds in our eyes

So princess, hold your head high
Even if you have to cry
Don't let your crown fall
Don't let your crown fall
Your script is in the making
You can hold the aching but
Don't let your crown fall
Don't let your crown fall down
We've been dreaming the good life
While we're living the real life
We've been dreaming the good life
While we're living the real life

Supermodels lighten up the billboards
And tell her live like she's on the runway
She doesn't know she's not the only one having a hard time
Liven up, there's something some day
So keep your Chanel but it's not gonna be enough
And even looking like Jiselle, won't cover up the bruises
So wear your scars proud, we're screaming loud
Stop the abusing

We'll walk through fire and ice
Come out the other side with diamonds in our eyes

So princess, hold your head high
Even if you have to cry
Don't let your crown fall
Don't let your crown fall
Your script is in the making
You can hold the aching but
Don't let your crown fall
Don't let your crown fall down

Little girls always grow older
Your story is a long way from over
We're lost before we're found
We're lost before we're found
Gotta be weak to get stronger
Learn how to breathe under water
This is our battleground
This is our battleground

All the houses are quiet and the fences are white
The status and the pictures that they post are blind
But we're all going through it so why do we do it?
Why do we hide?

So princess, hold your head high
Even if you have to cry
Don't let your crown fall
Don't let your crown fall
Your script is in the making
You can hold the aching but
Don't let your crown fall
Don't let your crown fall down

Little girls always grow older
Your story is a long way from over
We're lost before we're found
We're lost before we're found
Gotta be weak to get stronger
Learn how to breathe under water
This is our battleground
This is our battleground

Why's there always gotta be a hero?
What if Cinderella had to save herself?
