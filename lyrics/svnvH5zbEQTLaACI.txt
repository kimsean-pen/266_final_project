It's over before it starts
Oh don't you know
So on your marks and stand by
Ready, go
From London to New York, Montreal to Tokyo
I see visions of her everywhere I go
What have I become?
Now that I'm all alone

I'm just looking for a way to break through these walls and
I'm just looking for a place that I can call my home and
Is anybody out there got a soul?
'Cuz I'm just looking for a girl
The girl with a heart of gold

She over turns once again count with her champagne case
She goes straight down the rathole with her
Total recklessness and
Tomorrow will come on through
And I got nothing but a sillouette girl
Met her in darkness
I say

What have I become?
Now that I'm all alone

I'm just looking for a way to break through these walls and
I'm just looking for a place that I can call my home and
Is anybody out there got a soul?
'Cuz I'm just looking for a girl
The girl with a heart of gold
I said I'm just looking for a girl
The girl with a heart of gold

Yeah I'm in the corner I start over
I start the whole slate clean
All the pain and heartache in all my years
I was always to blame
And I dream of this girl
Yeah an angelical ghost
I met her in my neighborhood
I'm a downtown member?
Don't let me be misunderstood
Oh, I'm a downtown member?
Don't let me be misunderstood

Heart of gold!

I'm just looking for a way to break through these walls and
I'm just looking for a place that I can call my home and
Is anybody out there got a soul
'Cuz I'm just looking for a girl
The girl with a heart of gold

I said I'm just looking for a girl
The girl with a heart of gold
