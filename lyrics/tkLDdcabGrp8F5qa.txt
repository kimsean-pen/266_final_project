Maybe we can wake the dogs tonight
Maybe we can see the morning light
Maybe everyone can go to hell
Maybe I don't need your calls for help
Again, I'm your friend

Oh I'm just waiting on a wild sun
Oh well I'm just waiting on a wild sun
And I saw my friends, and I saw my friends
Oh well I'm just waiting on a wild sun

Crash and tumble on through my mind
An eerie feeling running down my spine
Day slowly turning into night
My hands are shaky and I don't feel right
Again, my friend

Oh I'm just waiting on a wild sun
Oh well, I'm just waiting on a wild sun
And I saw my friends, and I saw my friends
Oh well I'm just waiting on a wild sun

Baby, all the lies they told us were all true
I don't know what to do
I don't know how to stop this night
Maybe all the dreams I had were never real
I don't know how to feel
I don't know how to feel this

Oh I'm just waiting on a wild sun
Oh well I'm just waiting on a wild sun
And I saw my friends, and I saw my friends
Oh well I'm just waiting on a wild sun

Oh well I'm just waiting on a wild sun
Oh well I'm just waiting on a wild sun
Oh well I'm just waiting on a wild sun
Oh well I'm just waiting on a wild sun
