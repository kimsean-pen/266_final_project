Ladies up in here tonight
No fighting
We got the refugees up in here (no fighting)
No fighting
Shakira, Shakira

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man want to speak Spanish
¿Cómo se llama? (sí), bonita (sí)
Mi casa, su casa (Shakira, Shakira)

Oh, baby, when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise (sí) and keep on (sí)
Reading the signs of my body

I'm on tonight, you know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see, baby? This is perfection

Hey, girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing

And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl
And everything's so unexpected
The way you right and left it
So you can keep on shaking it

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man want to speak Spanish
¿Cómo se llama? (sí), bonita (sí)
Mi casa, su casa (Shakira, Shakira)

Oh, baby, when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise (sí) and keep on (sí)
Reading the signs of my body

I'm on tonight, you know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you, boy
Come on, let's go, real slow
Don't you see, baby? Así es perfecto

Baby, I know I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see, baby? This is perfection

Oh, boy, I can see your body moving
Half animal, half man
I don't, don't really know what I'm doing
But you seem to have a plan

My will and self-restraint
Have come to fail now, fail now
See, I'm doing what I can, but I can't, so you know
That's a bit too hard to explain

Baila en la calle de noche
Baila en la calle de día
Baila en la calle de noche
Baila en la calle de día

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man want to speak Spanish
¿Cómo se llama? (sí), bonita (sí)
Mi casa, su casa (Shakira, Shakira)

Oh, baby, when you talk like that
You know you got me hypnotized
So be wise (sí) and keep on (sí)
Reading the signs of my body

Señorita, feel the conga
Let me see you move like you come from Colombia

Mira, en Barranquilla se baila así, say it!
En Barranquilla se baila así

Yeah, she's so sexy, every man's fantasy
A refugee like me back with the Fugees from a third world country
I go back like when Pac carried crates for Humpty Hump
We need a whole club dizzy
Why the CIA wanna watch us?
Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction
Boo-boop-so-boop, no more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas 'cause we own our own boats

I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you, boy
Come on, let's go, real slow
Baby, like this is perfecto

Oh, you know I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
The attraction, the tension
Baby, like this is perfection

No fighting
