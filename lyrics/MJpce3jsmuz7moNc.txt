Nothing's gonna be the way it was
I'm down here, you're high above
What happens when the body's gone?
Does the soul live on?

And I don't know how to lose somebody yet
I've got all these voices inside of my head

You gotta pray for me, pray for me
Never gonna feel as good, the way I know life should
I need some space from it, space from it
Feeling misunderstood, rust under my hood, yeah

And calls you wish that you had made
Always something in the way
It took some time to realise, this is real life
Closing time in paradise

And I don't know how to lose somebody yet
And I've got all these voices inside of my head

You gotta pray for me, pray for me
Never gonna feel as good, the way I know life should
I need some space from it, space from it
Feeling misunderstood, rust under my hood
Rust under my hood, my hood

And I don't know how to lose somebody yet
And I've got all these voices inside of my head

You gotta pray for me, pray for me
Never gonna feel as good, the way I know life should
I need some space from it, space from it
Feeling misunderstood, rust under my hood
Rust under my hood, my hood
Never gonna feel as good
Pray for me, pray for me
Pray for me, pray for me
