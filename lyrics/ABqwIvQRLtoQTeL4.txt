I could just reach out and touch your hair
ooooh but I wouldn't dare
leaning whisper that I care
ohhhhhhhh but I wouldn't dare
that would only break this spell
that I have learnt to love so well
and it wouldn't be fair
so I wouldn't dare
oh I could see us as a pair
humm but I wouldn't dare
we could have the sweet affair
hummmm but I wouldn't dare
no I'd be happy just to dance
with this illusion of romance
that I never would share
'cos I wouldn't dare

in these circumstances a heart that takes chances
has only itself to blame
but it would be tragic if I lost this magic
and didn't feel the same oooh

oh I could sit and I could stare euh euh
but I wouldn't dare
imagining the when and where
hummm but I wouldn't dare
for if you are to turn away
because of things that I might say
I just couldn't bear
so I wouldn't dare
that wouldn't be fair
so I wouldn't dare
I wouldn't dare
