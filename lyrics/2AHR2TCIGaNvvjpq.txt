Miles from nowhere
I guess I'll take my time
Oh yeah, to reach there

Look up at the mountain
I have to climb
Oh yeah, to reach there

Lord, my body
Has been a good friend

But I won't need it
When I reach the end
Miles from nowhere

Guess I'll take my time
Oh yeah, to reach there
Oh yeah
I creep through the valleys

And I grope through the woods
'Cause I know when I find it my honey
It's gonna make me feel good, yes
I love everything

So don't it make you feel sad
'Cause I'll drink to you, my baby
I'll think to that, I'll think to that

Miles from nowhere
Not a soul in sight
Oh yeah, but it's alright

I have my freedom
I can make my own rules

Oh yeah, the ones that I choose
Lord, my body
Has been a good friend
But I won't need it
When I reach the end
I love everything
So don't it make you feel sad
'Cause I'll drink to you, my baby
I'll think to that, yes, I'll think to that
Think to that, oh yeah
Miles from nowhere
Guess I'll take my time
Oh yeah, to reach there
