The first time you rode your bicycle down the streets, you fell on your hands,
(?) and bruises, the first time you dropped then you ran,

Scary but Fun, take a chance in life you have one/won,
A little bit scary, but fun, did you forget what it's like to be young?

I remembered I learned how to water-ski, and the road ran over my head,
Broke several bones in my body, I got right up and did it again

Scary but Fun take a chance in life you have one/won,
A little bit scary, but fun, did you forget what it's like to be young,

See you standing on the corner, watching lights as the action goes by,
Hearing music coming from the neighbour, as they sit in the silence, hear them cry,
Take to your wings, butterfly,

Scary, but fun, Crazy, but so much fun,
Scary, but fun, Crazy, but so much fun,
Scary but Fun, take a chance in life you have one/won,
Scary, little bit scary, but fun, did you forget what it's like to be young?
Fun! Fun! Fun! Young! Fun!

I'm a little bit scary, but I'm fun,
Just a little scary, but so much fun,

Fun.
