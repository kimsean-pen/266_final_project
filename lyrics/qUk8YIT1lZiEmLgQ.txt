The battle wages on as cruel as it can be
Swords slashing on the shields make sparks that fill the air
No holds barred here, I nearly lost my ring
My friends are on the ground, it's time for me to hit

My arms get stronger and stronger
With every breath I take
I feel the power of this sword
Through my veins

A god is growing inside me
It feeds my every cell
I feel the power of this sword
Through my veins

Oh, how he blows us away!
Oh, how he makes us fall!
We can't last for long
We are on our knees!

What a perfect chance for us to be
The glorious kings the world needs
Let's fight him back
Fight him 'til death!

Come on, show me what you've got!

King Rahed has lost his senses, Shena takes her turn
She thinks that killing Sendor will mend her broken heart
My rod's powerless, I don't know what to do
I hope that he won't hurt the woman he once loved

My arms get stronger and stronger
With every breath I take
I feel the power of this sword
Through my veins

A god is growing inside me
It feeds my every cell
I feel the power of this sword
Through my veins

Oh, how he blows us away!
Oh, how he makes us fall!
We can't last for long
We are on our knees!

What a perfect chance for us to be
The glorious kings the world needs
Let's fight him back
Fight him 'til death!

Come on, show me what you've got!

Sendor screaming out like a demon
Strikes them showing no mercy
Full of hatred and endless fury
He's turned into a monster
Scattered fragments of glass
Bodies lying on the stairs

The battle wages on as cruel as it can be
Swords slashing on the shields make sparks that fill the air
No holds barred here, I nearly lost my ring
My friends are on the ground, it's time for me to hit

My arms get stronger and stronger
With every breath I take
I feel the power of this sword
Through my veins

A god is growing inside me
It feeds my every cell
I feel the power of this sword
Through my veins

Oh, how he blows us away!
Oh, how he makes us fall!
We can't last for long
We are on our knees!

What a perfect chance for us to be
The glorious kings the world needs
Let's fight him back
Fight him 'til death!

Come on, show me what you've got!

Sendor screaming out like a demon
Strikes them showing no mercy
Full of hatred and endless fury
He's turned into a monster
