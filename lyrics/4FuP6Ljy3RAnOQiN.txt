Feel the ground shake
I came to set it off
To kick in these windows and these doors
Like a rebel with no pause
Ignite it like a boss
When it's on
I stand tall like King Kong
If you want me you'll find me in the eye of the storm

Like shots fired in the middle of Vegas
Roll tide in the middle of the streets
Like a dog fight in a clear blue sky
We fight with a different kind of dynamite
A different kind of dynamite
A different kind of dynamite

Don't underestimate me
I run with giants and no safeties
You can call me crazy but keep hating it don't phase me
Bring it on
Your whole empire versus my messiah
Facin' different types of Goliaths
Takin' it higher

Like shots fired in the middle of Vegas
Roll tide in the middle of the streets
Like a dog fight in a clear blue sky
We fight with a different kind of dynamite
A different kind of dynamite
A different kind of dynamite
A different kind of dynamite

And the shots ring out
Let the shots ring out
And the shots ring out
Let the shots ring out

Like shots fired in the middle of Vegas
Roll tide in the middle of the streets
Like a dog fight in a clear blue sky
We fight with a different kind of dynamite

Like shots fired in the middle of Vegas
Roll tide in the middle of the streets
Like a dog fight in a clear blue sky
We fight with a different kind of dynamite
A different kind of dynamite
A different kind of dynamite
