He makes me happy, but I wonder if I do
I throw a fit and it tears him in two
There's glass on the kitchen floor
The neighbours banging on my front door
Oh my

What makes you happy, my naked soul
What makes you happy, the mask that I stole

Go ahead and paint the town, I'll just be here smoking down
Go dance with the girl that you deserve, I'm too low for self worth
When you get back I'm just gonna hit the curb
Oh my

What makes you happy, my naked soul
What makes you happy, the mask that I stole

Ooh, am I the only one you love to come home to?
You're just a boy, I don't blame you
If you walk away but don't, just name it

What makes you happy, my tortured soul

What makes you happy, my naked soul
What makes you happy, the mask that I stole
