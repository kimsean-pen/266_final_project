There will be a morning, there will be a night
Hear the oceans talk of rising, don't you give a fuck
Close your eyes don't worry, as long as you repress
You won't lose your sleep tonight, coz this is not your fight

Why can't you see what you've done to yourself
Hiding away still the world has to end

Until the end - time will never stop you just have to pretend
Why can't you see - the mankind is wasting the world away

I'm not feeling sorry, mankind is acting bright
Running in the mace of life but you ain't getting out
Don't look back and hurry, the train is running fast
No one ever has enough and life is getting tough

Why can't you see what you've done to yourself
Hiding away still the world has to end

They're wasting the world away
