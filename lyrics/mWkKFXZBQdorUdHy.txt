I could see through him
his love for the living
he's gone cold â€“ I couldn't forgive him
he couldn't do this
a shade so aimless
still has all unfinished business
trouble from the start
ghost boy and his dead heart
see him late at night
such a sorry sight
he's see-through, silver and white
trouble from the start
ghost boy and his dead heart
