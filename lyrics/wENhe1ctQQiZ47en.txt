Honeyglow,
You tear me up
Leaving it all exposed,
Just so you know.

And all these chemicals
Become the only thing I really know
And I keep them close.

Ocean blue,
I'm swimming in the very midst of you.
You should try it too.

Come on and feel it out,
Tell me everything you think about
When we're not dreaming.

Be my only flame.

Caught me swimming in a daydream,
Caught me blocking out my past.
But take me back
And be my time machine,
Show me the sky from a new perspective.

Lay me down,
Feeling the world spin me all around,
Got to fight these demons.

As I'm coming down,
It slips away as your body drowns
Leaving me so empty.

Holding smoke,
Should I expect to see your holy ghost
And its voice of reason?

Honeyglow,
Don't tear me up and leave me all exposed
When we're only dreaming.

Be my only flame,
Clean me out
And lead me on to grace.

Caught me swimming in a daydream,
Caught me blocking out my past.
But take me back
And be my time machine,
Show me the sky from a new perspective.

Caught me swimming in a daydream,
Caught me blocking out my past.
But take me back
And be my time machine,
Show me the sky from a new perspective.

Dark, dark, dark,
I was walking in the dark,
I was carrying a message but I left it in the dark.

There's a light, light, light
And it's shining on my heart.
Lighting up my head and soon will tear me all apart.

And you say
That this is not about changing all my ways,
My sad ways.

Come back in May,
When the sun is always shining on your face
And my face.
