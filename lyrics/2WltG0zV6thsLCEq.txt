I sit and wonder
I often wonder
I sit and wonder about the things she does
I sit and wonder
I often wonder
I've been waiting for this moment to come

Yeah, she's the teacher, and I'm her pupil
But I ain't learning anything at all
Now I'm falling into the black hole
And I can barely feel the sun

Yeah, I sit and wonder
I fall to pieces
I've been waiting for her to come
No bed of roses
Her cheeks like peaches
Yeah, I ain't gonna wait no more

Lord, give me some light
Oh, give me the light
Yeah, give me some light
And give me some light

The rights of passage
We all must take them
Yeah, some are going to break in the storm
The door is open
And I am reaching
Yeah, it looks like the prodigal son

Yeah, give me some light
Give me the light
Yeah, give me some light
And give me some light

I've been having trouble in my head, Lord (oh, oh, oh, oh)
I've been having demons in my mind, Lord (oh, oh, oh, oh)

Lord, give me the light
Oh, give me the light
Yeah, give me some light
And give me some light

I've been having trouble in my head, Lord (oh, oh, oh, oh)
I've been having demons in my mind, Lord (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Something's going on inside my head, Lord (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Something's going on inside my head, Lord (oh, oh, oh, oh)

I could be searching all my life
Searching all my life

Keep that candle on at night, candle on at night
Keep that candle on at night, candle on at night
I could be hurting all the while, hurting all the while
Lord, give me the light
