Somewhere it's summer
I've been shed to you now
Someday I'll get there
However I can

I don't want to go home
I'm having too much fun
And I don't want to go home
So leave me alone

Take the drink and run
She's the one that jumped the gun

I don't want to go home
I'm having too much fun
And I don't want to go home
So leave me alone
I don't want to...
I don't want to go...
Don't want to go...

I don't want to go home
I'm having too much fun
And I don't want to go home
So leave me alone
I don't want to go home
I'm having too much fun
And I don't want to go home
So leave me alone
