You want to string me around
But you lead me nowhere
You want to see me drown
Claw the surface for air
But you're not there
You steal the dreams from my sleep
And leave the darkness to bear
What more do you need to keep
What more can't I share
It's not fair
You turn your eyes from mine
Glance if you dare
In the wintertime
The cold will freeze our stares
We won't care
