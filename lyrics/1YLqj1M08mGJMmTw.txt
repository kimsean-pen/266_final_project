After all that you put me through
You think I'd despise you
But in the end I wanna thank you
'Cause you've made me that much stronger

Well I thought I knew you
Thinking that you were true
Guess I, I couldn't trust, called your bluff, time is up
'Cause I've had enough
You were there, by my side
Always down for the ride
But your joy ride just came down in flames
'Cause your greed sold me out in shame, mhm

After all of the stealing and cheating
You probably think that I hold resentment for you
But uh uh, oh no, you're wrong
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do
I wouldn't know, just how capable
I am to pull through
So I wanna say thank you
'Cause it

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh

Never saw it coming
All of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in, on a good thing before I'd realized your game
I heard you're going 'round
Playin' the victim now
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame
'Cause you dug your own grave, mm

After all of the fights and the lies guess you're wanting to haunt me
But that won't work anymore
No more, uh uh, it's over
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now
And never back down
So I wanna say thank you
'Cause it

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

How could this man I thought I knew
Turn out to be unjust, so cruel?
Could only see the good in you
Pretended not to see the truth
You tried to hide your lies
Disguise yourself
Through living in denial
But in the end you'll see
You
Won't
Stop
Me

I am a fighter and I (I'm a fighter)
I ain't gonna stop (I ain't gonna stop)
There is no turning back
I've had enough

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

You thought I would forget
But I, I remember
(Ooohh) I remember
(Oooohhhh) remember
Thought I would forget
(Ooohh)I remember
(Oooohhhh)I remember
(Yeah) I'll remember

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter
