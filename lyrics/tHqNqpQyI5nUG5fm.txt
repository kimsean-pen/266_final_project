Come one, come all
See the kid who can't breathe
Attempt to explain why his voice has been failing
Pouring over bottles 'cause you wanted to
Follow father's model so the blame could fall on anyone except for you
You told me that you were finally happy
When you had your arm around me on New Year's Eve
I guess the words you said meant nothing
So this is how it's gonna go, sloppy drunk and through a telephone?
Clutching to a bottle and a plastic bowl
She was crying in the back, I guess you gotta go
Come one, come all
See the kid who can't breathe
Attempt to explain why his voice has been failing
Pouring over bottle 'cause you wanted to
Follow father's model so the blame could fall on anyone except for you
You used to be the reason I was happy everyday
I'm probably better off without you, but I wish you would have stayed
I hope there's a highlight reel of
nights we had on loop inside your brain
'Cause I still find your face in every memory I wish I could erase
Did you think you could write me off?
Get the pictures that you said you wanted, all of me
That your heart beats in time with aisle steps in your dreams
But your blood displacement says you just wanted someone to sleep with
So when my mother told me you were just using me
I always hoped you'd prove her
wrong, but you kept your tongue in check
So this is how it's gonna go, sloppy drunk and through a telephone?
While you were clutchin' to a bottle and a plastic bowl
She was laughin' in the back, I guess they let you go
Come one, come all
See the kid who can't breathe
Attempt to explain why his voice has been failing
