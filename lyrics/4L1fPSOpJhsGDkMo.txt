Can't help but look back
I'm lost in my memories
Caught up with nostalgia
Think of what we had
You've always been dear to me
So I stuck around you

But for so long it's you
My one true love
I stay hypnotized holding space for
What was once

Can't help but look back
I'm lost in my memories
Caught up with nostalgia
Look through colored glass
Creating a fantasy
To find eudaemonia

For so long it's you
My
One true love
I stay petrified dreaming of you
I hope that I don't
Waste my life away

After looking at us from the outside
You wonder if I'd be willing to work things out
Oh, I can't say no to that
No, I can't say no to that
No, I can't say no to that
No, I can't say no to that
No, I can't say no to that
Can't say no to that
No, I can't say no to that
Can't say no to that
No, I can't say no to that
