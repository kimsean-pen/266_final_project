I went out cattin
Pussyfootin around
Till the break of dawn
Found me knocked out flat on my head
Some feline beauty
Waved her tail my way
I just had to stay
I couldn't get the blood off my hands
She made my eyes bug out
Her tail stand up
And i ain't even in heat for a month
(meow)
House cat
You really got it made
Sleepin all night
And perfect delight of day
Some feline beauty
Waved her tail my way
I just had to stay
I couldn't get the blood off my bed
She made my eyes bug out
Her tail stand up
And i ain't even in heat for a month
(meow... mrreow... meow! meow! meow!)
Some bad cats from 4th street
Come down to our alley
Well we say that's cool
But just stay away from me and my boys
Eyes clash
And claws slash
And green-eyed fur goes flyin
Midnight
Catfight
Neckbite
Die
When you're a jet, you're a jet all the way
From your first cigarette, till your last dyin day
When you're a jet, let 'em do what they can
Little boy, you got friends, you're a family man
The jets are in gear
They're always well-respected
You're never alone
When company's expected
You're well-protected
Here come the jets
Like a bat out of hell
Somone gets in our way
Someone don't feel so well
When you're a jet
You - stay - a - jet
(pow!)
