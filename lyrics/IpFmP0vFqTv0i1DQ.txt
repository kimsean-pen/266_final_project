When They broke your body

They broke your mind

but with broken spirits you have always tried
I watch you sleep, I watch you fade

I will always keep the light on even though you can't stay

And you sing to me, you say

I don't want to be awake when It takes me
but I can't wait to see you smile on the Other Side

I can't wait to kiss the face of The Big Sky

Won't you stay here for a while with me, my Child

And you're losing your vision, and you're going blind

What starts out in the night time follows you in the morning light

I watch you sleep, I watch you fade

I will keep the light on as you change even though you can't stay

and you sing to me, you say

"I don't want to be awake when It takes me
I won't ever change my mind
I can't wait to kiss the face of The Big Sky
I don't want to say goodbye to you
My Child "
