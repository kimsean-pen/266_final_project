Took too many pills again
I took too many pills again
Blacked out for a week
Didn't eat, didn't sleep
Came to did it all again

She's probably gonna be pissed
She's probably gonna be pissed
Throw my shit in the yard or key my car
If I show up to her house like this

Oh it was a dark december
Not even angels came around
And I was too stoned to remember
I've come to far to turn back now
I've come to far to turn back now

I feel like I'm gonna fall down
I feel like I'm gonna fall down
I was born and raised in an earthquake state
So I'm better on a shaky ground

What the hell am I gonna do now
The hell am I gonna do now
Gotta half lit smoke
Good god I'm broke
But gotta make it back to germantown

Oh it was a dark december
Not even angels came around
And i was too stoned to remember
I've come to far to turn back now
I've come to far to turn back now

Baby won't you take me back
Baby won't you take me back
It ain't like I'm tricking on the corner for crack
Baby won't you take me back

Oh it was a dark december
In the city of angles I was coming down
And i was too stoned to remember
I've come to far to turn back now
Come to far to turnback now
