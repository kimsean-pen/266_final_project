I cut you into pieces
Searching for your imperfections
I had plans to make you whole

But all my threads couldn't stop the bleeding
There's nothing left, but I'm not leaving
When all I know is you

I've been looking for a way
To bring you back to life
And if I could find a way
Then I would bring you back tonight

I'd make you look, I'd make you lie
I'd take the coldness from your eyes
But you told me, if you love me
Let it die

Your eyes stare right through me
Ignoring my failed attempts to
Bring back life into your veins

But I cant start your cold heart beating
You're so far gone, but I'm not leaving
When all I know is you

I've been looking for a way
To bring you back to life
And if I could find a way
Then I would bring you back tonight

I'd make you look, I'd make you lie
I'd take the coldness from your eyes
But you told me, if you love me
Let it die

And you left me
More dead than you'll never know
When you left me alone

I've been looking for a way
To bring you back to life
And if I could find a way
Then I would bring you back tonight

I'd make you look, I'd make you lie
I'd take the coldness from your eyes
But you told me, if you love me
Let it die (Let it die)

Let it die (Let it die)
Let it die (Let it die)
Let it die
