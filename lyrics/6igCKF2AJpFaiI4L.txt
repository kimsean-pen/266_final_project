From Milwaukee to Memphis, Pittsburgh to Portland, Maine
I'm a little restless, feeling like I need a change
By way of Brooklyn and up to Boston
I'm disenchanted, considering every option

I'm thinking & thinking
That being around here has me sinking
And while home is always best
My neighborhood in the midwest

I want to get lost in you, Tokyo
I've got a lot to say to you, Tokyo
It's nostalgic and quiet, but louder than silence
I want to get lost in you, Tokyo

Tokyo

Here's to folks in Michigan, back and forth to Chicago
Along the lake, within the snow

I'm thinking & thinking
That being around here has me sinking
And while home is always best
My neighborhood in the midwest

I want to get lost in you, Tokyo
I've got a lot to say to you, Tokyo
It's nostalgic and quiet, but louder than silence
I want to get lost in you, Tokyo

I need more nights in Paris, more time in Stockholm
Some days I will be careless trying to feel known
I need more nights in Paris, more time in Stockholm
Some days I will be careless trying to feel known

I want to get lost in you, Tokyo
I've got a lot to say to you, Tokyo
It's nostalgic and quiet, but louder than silence
I want to get lost in you, Tokyo
Tokyo
