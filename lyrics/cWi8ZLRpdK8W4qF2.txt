Not saying you're here
Never alone yeah always near
Do you regret being used?
Are you used to it yet?

Don't throw me away
I want to be your toy forever
Don't throw me away
I want to be your toy forever

Alone in my room
Straight from the ones you knew
It's hard to relate
When I can't screw my head on straight

Don't throw me away
I want to be your toy forever
Don't throw me away
I want to be your toy forever

Don't throw me away
I want to be your toy forever
Don't throw me away
I want to be your toy forever

Don't throw me away
I want to be your toy forever
Don't throw me away
I want to be your toy forever
