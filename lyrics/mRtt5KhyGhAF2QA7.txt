It's 2:45, the baby takes his first breath
The mother never knew he only had a few left
And the father gets a call in the middle of the night
His breath gets short and chest gets tight
But he's 16, and he's driving too fast
Takes a turn to the left it would be his last
Nobody knows what happens if he turns to the right
Nobody in the car would have died that night
But he's 32 and invincible
The cancer he had it was visceral
He never saw it coming, thought he had his whole life
Sick in the morning and he died in the night

We're all so
We're on the run
We're all, we're all, oh
We're wasted, no, no, no
We're all wasted
We're wasted, no, no
We're all wasted

Seven years old, got his bat in his hand
He's looking for his father and he doesn't understand
'Cause dad's too busy, got some deals on the way
His son sits alone as the children play
And he's eighteen, couldn't wait to move out
His parents wonder what all the rush is about
They never bothered with his dreams, only thinking of theirs
Wonders why he doesn't call or why he doesn't care
But he's 32 and invincible
With everything he his based on principle
He never had a truly happy moment in his life
He didn't want the kids and he didn't want his wife

We're wasted, no, no, no
We're all wasted
We're wasted, no, no
We're all wasted
We're wasted
We're all wasted
We're all wasted, no, no
We're all wasted

23 now, got his life in his hands
He's looking all around and he doesn't understand
'Cause life's too busy, things get in the way
We all feel alone every single day
And I'm 18, couldn't wait to move out
It's been five years, and now I'm starting to doubt
Whether all my dreams are just aimless stares
Looking up to some place isn't there
When I'm 32 will I be miserable?
With everything around based on principle?
Will I have a clue?
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?
To never be alone in this wasted life

We're wasted, no, no, no
We're all wasted
We're wasted, no, no
We're all wasted
We're wasted
We're all wasted
We're all wasted, no, no
We're all wasted

We're wasted
We're wasted
We're wasted, no, no
All wasted
