When I got out of my car
I stopped myself and thought about
How unimportant locking the front door was seeming
The only reason that I turned the lock and key
Is to protect the only thing inside other than me
And I'm never gonna see it again
No, I'm never gonna see it...
When I watched the others waiting
It made me shuffle in my seat
And I felt like everyone around somehow related
Not knowing each others' names
We gathered here to see
If the ones we've been waiting for would continue to breathe
And I'm never gonna see it again
No, I'm never gonna see it again
No, I'm never gonna see it again
No, I'm never gonna see it...
And all this money doesn't matter
When the money only pays for
narcassistic medals
we would kill for yesterday
But this, it has no price tag.
Just a tag around the toe
That's slowly going back and forth
Warm and pretty cold
And I'm never gonna see it again
No, I'm never gonna see it again
No, I'm never gonna see it again
No, I'm never gonna see it...
Didn't mean to talk about blood
Didn't mean to bother both of ya.
Didn't really need to say much
Didn't mean to talk about blood
Didn't mean to talk about blood
Didn't mean to bother both of ya
Didn't really need to say much
Didn't mean to talk about blood
Didn't mean to talk about...
