When I found your girlfriend crying
I could have slapped you in the face
What lesson is she learning
With you acting this way?
You are a good boy
She's a killer tease
You are both so deserving
You are both keen to please

We're going to listen to Kokomo
Desert island dreaming
Go forth or be lured
You're a good, good, good, good boy
She's a killer tease
You are both discerning
You are both keen to please

So turn out the light
Just give in to the night
This is love (feels alright)
You're a star on this fine night

We could turn down the light
To give in to the night
This is love (it's alright)
You're a star on this fine night
On this fine night
On this fine night
On this fine night
