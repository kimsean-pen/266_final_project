Nothing's impossible
This life is a treat
You can leap from the sky
And land on your feet
God is irrelevant
You are who you are
I walk straight by normal days
Gazing at the stars

Well it works, it works
When you don't say goodbye
No I won't, I won't
Won't be home tonight
If I fall, if I fall
My knees touch the ground
Well I know, I know
This way you'll be around
This way you'll be around

Hollywood's fantasy pulls you to your knees
And I think we've all got the dreamer's disease
Everything's magic or everything's stone
Seven billion people but some are alone

Well it works, it works
When you don't say goodbye
No I won't, I won't
Won't be home tonight
If I fall, if I fall
My knees touch the ground
Well I know, I know
This way you'll be around

Well it works, it works
When you don't say goodbye
No I won't, I won't
Won't be home tonight
If I fall, if I fall
My knees touch the ground
Well I know, I know
This way you'll be around

Stop the lights
I lost the night, I
Stop the lights
I lost the night, I
Stop the lights
I lost the night, I
Stop the lights
I lost the night, I
Stop the lights
I lost the night, I

Well it works, it works
When you don't say goodbye
No I won't, I won't
Won't be home tonight
If I fall, if I fall
My knees touch the ground
Well I know, I know
This way you'll be around
