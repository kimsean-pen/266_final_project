I can see that you've been crying
You cant hide it with a lie
Whats the use in you denying
That what you have is wrong

I heard him promise you forever
But forevers come and gone
Baby, he would say whatever
It takes to keep you blind
To the truth between the lies

Oh, I will love you more than that
I won't say the words then take them back
Dont give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say
I will love you more than that

Baby, you deserve much better
Whats the use in holding on
Dont you see its now or never
Cause I just cant be friends
Baby knowing in the end that

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words then take them back
Dont give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say

Theres not a day that passes by
I dont wonder why we havent tried
Its not too late to change your mind
So take my hand, dont say goodbye

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words then take them back

Oh, I will love you more than that
I won't say the words then take them back
Dont give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say
I will love you more than that

Oh, I will love you more than that
I won't say the words then take them back
Dont give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say
I will love you more than that
