A bounded sphere of wisdom
Spinning to create the now
Upon it all will wonder who, what, where, and how
Liquid covers most of her features
Sunlight covers one side at a time
Breathes in to keep everything closer
So it's never far away from
"Earth"! That little planet on the hill

Turning out days to guide by
Each with its own display
Some with voltage spinning from the skytop
Some with light in a peaceful way
An appearance second to no other
Such a magnificent face
So broad and full of perspective
Known to everyone as...
"Earth"! That little planet on the hill

Seems Earth could last forever
But for us it's not the same
The neglect to protect the creation
Leaves us little chance to remain
All in all it seems to go around in circles
Like the path followed by the moon
Enhanced by the human evolution
The wisdom of the
"Earth"! That little planet on the hill
