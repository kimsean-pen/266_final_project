If you were cast out, what's your next move gonna be?
Will you return cold, or will you turn up the heat?
God, please, forgive those who doubt me

Did you really think the pain
Would send me to an early grave?
Did you think I couldn't break these chains
After all the hell I overcame?

God, please, forgive those who doubt me, forgot about me
Then throw them down into the flames

Well, I am back now and stronger than you think
'Cause when it's dark, the light gets easier to see
They say I sold out and bid my dignity
But the truth is, the Devil sold his soul to me

To me, to me
The Devil sold his soul to me
To me, to me
The Devil sold his soul to me

God, please, forgive those who doubt me, forgot about me
Then throw them down into the flames
God, please, forgive those who doubt me, forgot about me
Make sure they never forget my name

The greatest trick that the Devil did
Was convince the world he doesn't exist
The greatest trick that the Devil did
Was convince the world he doesn't exist

God, please, forgive those who doubt me, forgot about me
After all that hell I overcame

God, please, forgive those who doubt me, forgot about me
Then throw them down into the flames
God, please, forgive those who doubt me, forgot about me
Make them remember again

Did you really think the pain
Would send me to an early grave?
Did you think I couldn't break these chains
After all the hell I overcame?

The greatest trick that the Devil did
Was convince the world he doesn't exist
