The night sky had broken, the new year had spoken
I was beside myself, I stood out in the cold
In an empty parking lot, my breath was streaming hot
I willed the car to start to bring me home to you

Lead me back from the darkness like you do

Before I knew you, I lived in the rearview
To wish back an image of myself I thought was true
So now when colors fade and on that day of days
I needed you to say it wasn't one to rue

Oh and lead me back from the darkness like you do

Headlights and cold rain distorting the dark panes
Wipers clicking and my thoughts they followed suit
I felt like Willy Loman, the mighty plans I'd spoken
Guess they were illusions of a man who dreamed too big

But I remember you dancing in autumn when we met
You won't believe I saw it then so many years ago
There was something about you I struggled to forget
My blood was rushing down to you

You were leadin' me back from the darkness like you do
Leadin' me back from the darkness like you do
Leadin' me back from the darkness like you do
Leadin' me back from the darkness like you do
Leading me back like a horse to water knowing I'd refuse
'Cause you're a wanderer too
