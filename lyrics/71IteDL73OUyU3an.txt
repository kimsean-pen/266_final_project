Tears begin to fall
It's not safe to ignore
Your true North's magnetic pull
Pushed to the side
Trial by fire, suicide

So let the sky burn
We've hung our heads for too long

"Here's to the days": when we were young
"Here's to the nights" we came undone

So let the sky burn
We've been ashamed for too long

I believed in love, I believed in us
I believed in hate, I believed in trust
I believed, in nothing... for too long

So let the sky burn
Suicide
