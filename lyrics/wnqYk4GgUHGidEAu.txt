So tired, of being tired and drunk and lonely
And I hate myself in the morning
Yeah so much more in the morning

When the guilt swirls in my stomach
And my heart beats through my ears
And all the little things that I ignore, they seem to be more real

I held the gun but you pulled the trigger and we watched it all go
I held the gun but you pulled the trigger and we watched it all go

And all the records
I've been playing, they tell me to stay this way
And all the ones I love give up on me
They try their hardest and fail so miserably

I held the gun but you pulled the trigger and we watched it all go
I held the gun but you pulled the trigger and we watched it all go
My heart was fast but your hand was quicker and we watched it all go
I held the gun but you pulled the trigger and we watched it all go, it all go

My timeline is running out fast
My future will never be my past
And I still can't work out how to make my money last
And all the things I thought that I could be
Get less and less as each new day begins

I held the gun but you pulled the trigger and we watched it all go
I held the gun but you pulled the trigger and we watched it all go
My heart was fast but your hand was quicker and we watched it all go
I held the gun but you pulled the trigger and we watched it all go

I held the gun but you pulled the trigger and we watched it all go
