This one wicked road,
You gonna make it right
You found your way to go
You gonna take that right!
You gonna wait too long,
To run away tonight!
You gonna wait too long,
To run away tonight!
You gonna wait too long,
You run away tonight!
Was that the thing you heard?
Was that the thing you said?
I try to find the way
Then maybe you all go away!
The miles way to long
The... is way to right
You know them way too long

Don't need to fall
The way that you go on tonight
The light on me not...
The light on me...
The sun will make them dry
The sun will make them dry
The sun will make them dry
The sun will make them dry
This one wicked road,
You gonna make it right
You found your way to go
You gonna take that right!
You gonna wait too long,
To run away tonight!
You gonna wait too long,
To run away tonight!
You gonna wait too long,
You run away tonight!
