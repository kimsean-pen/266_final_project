You'll find me here
When I'm gone
Where I made
My surrender
From the flame

You'll find me here
When I'm gone
Where I made
My surrender
From the flame
I'll take my aim

Shaded windows
Can I make it shout out
The painful view
Cover up
Hide from here

Shed a tear
Say no more
Until you tell me when
Silent stabs
Are echoing again

You'll find me here
When I'm gone
Where I made
My surrender
From the flame
I'll take my aim

Find me here
When I'm gone
Where I made
My surrender
From the flame
I'll take my aim

Struggling to endure
I can't say more
Than I have said before
Searching to be found
When you're not around

No rest, no support
This has been my last resort
Hoping I am blind
Leaving me behind

You'll find me here
When I'm gone
Where I made
My surrender
From the flame
I'll take my aim

Find me here
When I'm gone
Where I made
My surrender
From the flame
I'll take my aim

You'll find me here
When I'm gone
Where I made
My surrender
From the flame
I'll take my aim
