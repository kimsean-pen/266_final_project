It's always better on the other side of it
Wanting what you'll never have
And it's a goddamn broken state of mind
Yeah, the one that we've been living in
It's never greener inside the mess we're in
Wanting what you'll never have
The less we are content the more we throw away
What little time we have left to grow
Separate mind from hate
Punch through the unknown
And it will leave the little time we have

Stop bleeding on the inside, we are alive
And it's more than enough to paint the walls that are white
Can we show the ones who are blind?

It's envy eating away at the core of us
Wanting what you'll never have
And isn't it the point of living to breathe?
Knowing this is all we get
It's never greener inside the mess we're in
Wanting what you'll never have
The less we are content the more we throw away
What little time we have left to grow
Separate mind from hate
Punch through the unknown
And it will leave the little time we have

Stop bleeding on the inside, we are alive
And it's more than enough to paint the walls that are white
Can we show the ones who are blind?
Stop bleeding on the inside, we are alive
And it's more than enough to paint the walls that are white
Can we show the ones who are blind? (Show them that we're not blind?)
Come on, show them that we're not blind
We're not blind

Stop bleeding on the inside, we are alive
And it's more than enough to paint the walls that are white
Can we show the ones who are blind?
Stop bleeding on the inside, we are alive
And it's more than enough to paint the walls that are white
Can we show the ones who are blind?

Fly past the withered trees
Ascend to holy air and breathe
Fly past the withered trees
Ascend to holy air and breathe

This want is menacing it will not leave us be
Can we purge this?
The bastard in our brain will chew until it bleeds
How did we get like this?
How did we get like this? (Can we purge this heart?)

Step out in the rain
Feel life in our veins
Step out in the rain
Feel life in our, feel life in our veins
How did we get like this? (Can we purge this?)
The bastard in our brain will chew until it bleeds
How did we get like this?
