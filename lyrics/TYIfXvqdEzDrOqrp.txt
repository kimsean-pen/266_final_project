I got knots all up in my chest
Just know, I'm trying my best
'Cause, when you look
When you laugh
When you smile
I'll bring you back
And now I'm sad
And I'm a mess
And now we high
That's, why I left
That's, why I left

Will your tongue still remember the taste of my lips?
Will your shadow remember the swing of my hips?
Will your lover caress you the way, that I did?
Will you notice my charm, if he slips up one bit?

'Cause I don't need to know
I just wanna make sure you're okay
I don't need to know
I just wanna make sure you're all safe
All safe, all safe

Will he play you those songs, just the way, that I did?
Will he play you so strong, just the way, that I did?
Will he treat you like shit, just the way, that I did?
'Cause I don't blame ya

'Cause I don't need to know
I just want to make sure you're okay
I don't need to know
I just want to make sure you're all safe
