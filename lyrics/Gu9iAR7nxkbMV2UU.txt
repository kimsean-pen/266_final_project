You feel yourself turning into someone
That you don't even know
You don't wanna be alone
With a stranger in your thoughts
But you've got no one to follow you home
Just going for a walk

Merry-go-round
Miracle to blame
Flowers on the ground
Marigold and gray
I wanted to lay down
In your place

I'm not afraid of changes
'Cause I don't know what the changes will prove
When it's time for me to leave
I hope that you'll be different
So that I can fall back to you
Just going for a walk

Merry-go-round
Merry-go-round
Merry-go-round
Merry-go-round
I don't wanna set the brightness
(Merry-go-round)
You don't wanna light the way
(Merry-go-round)
The artificial sweetener
(Merry-go-round)
The sugar at the gate

Merry-go-round
Miracle to play
Flowers on the ground
Marigold and gray
I wanted to lay down
In your place
I wanted to lay down
In your place
