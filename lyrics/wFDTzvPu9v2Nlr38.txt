Looking for something to waken my soul
It seems like its singing's stopped cold
I got used to being the star of the show
But I've seen the lights come and go

I heard a song playing, brought by the wind
I got myself lost, then I found you again
Tennessee, when I finally lay down to sleep, then
I'll rest in your ground, but these days
The world is against us
So keep me safe
With your fields & fences around me

I want to start living, I want to be brave
I want to find where I belong
'Cause I still remember the reasons I write
Things that I've dreamed for so long

I heard a song playing, brought by the wind
I got myself lost, then I found you again
Tennessee, when I finally lay down to sleep, then
I'll rest in your ground, but these days
The world is against us
So keep me safe
With your fields & fences around me
Around me

I don't have much that I can give to you, but
I know I love the way you make me feel like I am home
And I am not alone

I don't have much that I can give to you, but
I know I love the way you make me feel like I am home
And I am not alone

I don't have much that I can give to you, but
I know I love the way you make me feel like I am home
And I am not alone

I don't have much that I can give to you, but
I know I love the way you make me feel like I am home
And I am not alone
