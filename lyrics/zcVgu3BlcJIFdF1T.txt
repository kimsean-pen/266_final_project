Have you ever been in love before?
Have you ever made mistakes?
Like when you feel invincible, but you really should be careful
Don't forget your heart is on the line
There's a price to pay and stakes are high
Remember to be careful

Watch your step
Take it slow
Because you never know
If love hurts
Watch your back
Tread carefully
Follow your heart but think twice
'Cause love hurts

Everything felt so right
Now I just want my revenge
I'm telling myself that I'm not crying over you
Everything felt so good
Never thought you could pretend
I'm telling myself them I'm not crying over you
I'm not crying over over you
Crying over over you
I'm not crying over over you
Crying over over you

It's a constant battle
Between beginnings and endings
Yes, love hurts
Like the blood inside my heart
Is pumping on and on
I'll keep on fighting till the day I die

I knew it was too good to be true
But I'm not crying over you
Bittersweet I know, but it's over now
And I'm not crying over you
Crying over you
