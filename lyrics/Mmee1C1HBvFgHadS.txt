You say it used to be different, mmm mhm mhm
I know it's safe but won't you take me home
You know it could have been different, mmm mhm mhm
You say you wish that it was over
Oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh, oooh
Oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh, oooh

You hope it would have been different, mmm mhm mhm
Now you thinking about a brand new start
You say there won't be another chance, mmm mhm mhm
Now you're on your own, on the subway home
And there's a party going on somewhere near tonight
You say you wish you were younger, so you can make mistakes again

Oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh, oooh
It's not over
Oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh, oooh
It's not over, till it's over

And dots connected, our hearts redirected
I've done all I can, all I can
I cannot correct this
And it's strange to walk the corridors again
I know it's never going to ever change

x 2
Oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh, oooh
It's not over
Oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh, oooh
It's not over, till it's over

I cannot correct this
I cannot correct this
