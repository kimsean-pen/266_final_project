It was upon a foggy night, an abandoned road
In a twilight mirror mirage
With no indication
Of any kind of service station

Or an all night garage, I was misinformed
I was misdirected 'cause the interchange
Never intersected leaving me marooned
Beneath a bloodshot moon

All upon a foggy night, foggy night
All upon a foggy night, it's kind of an abandoned road
Blurred brocade collage
Is that a road motel? I can't really tell

You got to tell me is that a vacancy lodge
There's no consolation
What kind of situation
To be aimlessly skewed

Amidst a powder blue? No tell tail light clue
[Incomprehensible] is like a spell you spin
This precarious pandemonium
[Incomprehensible] I'm stranded, all upon a foggy night

Like a sweet thick [Incomprehensible] or a Broadway arcade
Heads you win, tails I loose and ramblin' and gamblin'
All upon a foggy night, foggy night
Foggy night, foggy night

You got to fight [Incomprehensible] on my personality
All upon a foggy night, all upon a foggy night
All upon a foggy night, on a foggy night
All upon a foggy, all upon a foggy night
