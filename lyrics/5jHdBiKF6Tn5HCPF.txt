High beams you and me,
Little back road barely see.
Right song radio,
Through it in low and drive slow.
I saw you and it lit me up,
A girl like you is just to much.
Kill the lights! Kill the lights!
You can take me there tonight.
We can make some sparks fly.
We can make the dark cry.
Feel the ride! Take me high!
Yellow moon in your eyes.
Lost in your slow stare.
In the middle of nowhere.
Skin on skin don't care where we been, pull me in and kill the lights.
We can feel our way through
Let me just hold onto you.
Baby trust my hands
Live it up while we still can and
Kill the lights! Kill the lights!
You can take me there tonight.
We can make some sparks fly.
We can make the dark cry.
Feel the ride! Take me high!
Yellow moon in your eyes.
Lost in your slow stare.
In the middle of nowhere.
Skin on skin don't care where we been, pull me in and kill the lights.
Don't it feel right, until the sun rise,
We can just go on what we know.
Can't help but wanna watch you,
You wanna do this don't you.
Come here Let me pull you closer
You reach over
And kill the lights! Kill the lights!
You can take me there tonight.
We can make some sparks fly.
We can make the dark cry.
Feel the ride! Take me high!
Yellow moon in your eyes.
Lost in your slow stare.
In the middle of nowhere.
Skin on skin don't care where we been,
Skin on skin don't care where we been, pull me in and kill the lights.
Kill the lights.
Baby you and me kill the lights.
Kill the lights.
