I can't think of getting old
It only makes me want to die
And I can't think of who I was
'Cause it just makes me want to cry, cry, cry
Can't look back, can't look too far ahead
I got the point, I got the message

I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
I try to keep going but it's not that simple
I think I'm a little bit caught in the middle
Gotta keep going or they'll call me a quitter
Yeah, I'm caught in the middle

I was dreaming life away
All the while just going blind
Can't see forest for the trees
Behind the lids of my own eyes
Nostalgia's cool, but it won't help me now
A dream is good, if you don't wear it out

I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
I try to keep going but it's not that simple
I think I'm a little bit caught in the middle
Gotta keep going or they'll call me a quitter
Yeah, I'm caught in the middle

No, I don't need no help
I can sabotage me by myself
Don't need no one else
I can sabotage me by myself
I don't need no help
I can sabotage me by myself
Don't need no one else
I can sabotage me by myself
I don't need no help
I can sabotage me by myself
Don't need no one else
I can sabotage me by myself
I don't need no help
I can sabotage me by myself
Don't need no one else
I can sabotage me by myself

I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
I try to keep going but it's not that simple
I think I'm a little bit caught in the middle
Gotta keep going or they'll call me a quitter
Yeah, I'm caught in the middle

I'm caught in the middle
