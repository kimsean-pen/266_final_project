Too damn high, whatchu' call that?
Sorry that I took my time to call back
I don't wanna spend time with your family
Cause I'm afraid I'll run my mouth and start rambling, wait

I know that your dad doesn't like me
High-key
Cocaine stains on my Nikes
Gucci on my neck's gold lightning
Just ignore that

Seven-headed snake, whatchu' call that?
Bleeding like an open scar
Lost a little money, made it all back
Luckily I'll work this out
Vision kinda blurry, whatchu call that?
I don't light the blunt too hot
I can't feel my god damn face
Get the way out if I drive too fast

Smile and see the gold teeth
Gold rings on my fingers make your face bleed
Caught up in the hills popping silk on these palm trees
To the landslide, then I lose my damn mind

I know that your brother wants to fight me
High-key
Bitching out cause, oh, I hit him lightly
If you wanna talk, do it nicely
On the call back
Tell me whatchu' call that

Seven-headed snake, whatchu' call that?
Bleeding like an open scar
Lost a little money, made it all back
Luckily I'll work this out
Vision kinda blurry, whatchu call that?
I don't light the blunt too hot
I can't feel my god damn face
Get the way out if I drive too fast

Vision kinda blurry, whatchu call that?
I don't light the blunt too hot
I can't feel my god damn face
Get the way out if I drive too fast

Seven-headed snake, whatchu' call that?

Get the way out if I drive too fast
