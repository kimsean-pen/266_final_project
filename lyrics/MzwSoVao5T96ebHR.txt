Time after time as we march side by side
Through the valleys of evil and the torturing souls
Night after night for the glory we fight
In a kingdom of madness
and the tales from the old
Death by our hand for the higher command
As the darkness surrounds us hear the cries as they fall
Fire burning steel and the tyrant will kneel
Hearts burning stronger with the power of the sword
Set sail for the glory, pray for the master of war

Sunlight will fall by the
wastelands, endless rise to the heroes before

Cry thunder
Sword in his hand
Titans of justice, fearless we stand

Cry thunder
Strong in command
Blessed by the union, freedom of man

Reckoning day for the demons we slay
With the force of a dragon we will conquer them all

Chaos still reigns devastation and flames
For the ultimate glory when the legacy calls
March on through the hellfire blazing from the darkness beyond
Nightmares return of the thousand
screaming, rise for the heroes once more

Cry thunder
Sword in his hand
Titans of justice, fearless we stand
Cry thunder
Strong in command
Blessed by the union, freedom of man

Unholy darkness in the eyes of broken dreams
Outside of the wasted and torn
A land of tears still remains
Soldiers of destiny calling
And the fallen will rise up again
Conquer the forces of evil and fight to the end

Cry thunder
Sword in his hand
Titans of justice, fearless we stand
Cry thunder
Strong in command
Savior of nations, freedom of man
Cry thunder
Sword in his hand
Warriors defending, one final stand
Cry thunder
Strong in command
Blessed by the union, freedom of man
Blessed by the union of man
Cry thunder
