Have a little love, as were fighting with each other
aint no use in crying like the others

there are fools in need, to foolish to believe

im gonna, uh somebody, uh somebody

it aint no use in trying to deceive
ive been fooled by the lover, fooled by the sinner, fooled myself into thinking i was living

im fighting just to breathe as i get back off my knees
help me somebody

im fighting just to breathe as i get back off my knees
im gonna, uh somebody, uh somebody, uh somebody, uh somebody
