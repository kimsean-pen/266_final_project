By the Rivers of Babylon
We slept and did not see
The Light That Is Leaving Us All
So now–consider the generation of witches
A thousand witches in the room
Whilst the birds are sweetly singing
A thousand witches
In the house in the fields
In your heart
Inside them all is Endor
A thousand witches in Lower Quinton
A thousand witches by Hagley Wood
Ann–Agnes–Anna–Hannah
Sixteen witches in Long Compton
And The Light Is Leaving Us All
And if he had his way he'd kill them all
So dog and mouse in the LightLess house
Alice–Christian–Christine–Christianne
Dog and the bird
And the swift swallows sing
Elizabeth–Eliza–Isobel, Isobella
Bella–Luebella–Betty
And the LORD put forth
His Hand against Ellen
And arise arise two thousand eyes
A thousand witches in the carnival sky
Helen–Alyne generate night
A thousand witches
In the breasts of the valley
A thousand witches in the carnival sky
Joan–Jane–Jean–Joanna
A thousand witches
In the fountains and plants
And the birds are sweetly singing
So–Margaret–Meg–Maggie–and Peggy
Fox and Wolf and Goat and Crow
And Marion–Mary–May–Maria
A thousand witches fingers and teeth
And claws and snow and Lord Low Moon
Huddles over the naked planets
With the birds so sweetly singing
The Light Is Leaving Us All
All the birds are sweetly singing
The Light Is Leaving Us All
All the birds are sweetly singing
The Light Is Leaving Us All
All the birds are sweetly singing
The Light Is Leaving Us All
