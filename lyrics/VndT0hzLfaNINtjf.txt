I'm cornered in fire so break out the secrets
I hope you know that you were worth it all along
I'm tired, you're angry, and everyone looks blurry
I love you. I'm leaving; so long

Hey, little one
I'm so scared of what this could have been
I know that today I lost my only friend
My little one

The places I took you, they seem so fucking empty
I have trouble going anywhere at all
Especially my own bedroom
And it stays awake to haunt me
So passed out, black out, drunk in another bathroom stall

Hey, little one
I'm so scared of what this could have been
I know that today I lost my only friend

How long must I justify my pain through these songs?
How long, how long?

Hey, little one
I'm so scared of what this could have been
I know that today I lost my only little one
(My little one)
I'm so scared of what this could have been
I know that today I lost my only friend

How long must I talk about my pain in these songs?
How long?

It's raining, It's sunny
It doesn't make a difference
I don't care about anything at all

It's raining, It's sunny
It doesn't make a difference
I don't care about anything at all
