I can hear the animals talking
I can hear the animals talking
But they ain't talking to me
Are they talking to you?
No, they ain't talking to me
Who they talking to?

I can hear electric lights talking
I can hear electric lights talking
But they ain't talking to me
Are they talking to you?
If they ain't talking to me
Who they talking to?

I'm listening
I'm listening
I'm listening in

I can hear the dead of night talking
I can hear the dead of night talking
But it ain't talking to me
Is it talking to you?
No, it ain't talking to me
Who is it talking to?

I'm listening
I'm listening
I'm listening in

I'm on fire
I'm under attack
And it's been a long, lonely winter
I just want you back
And I know I saw you up there in the window
In some shadow's arms
And I'm down here where the howling winds blow
'Cause I know...

I can hear the fear in me talking
I can hear the fear in me talking
And it's talking 'bout me
And it's talking 'bout you
Yeah, it's talking 'bout me
Can you hear it too?

I'm listening
I'm listening
I'm listening
Yeah, I'm listening in

Talking
Talking
Ahh
Talking
