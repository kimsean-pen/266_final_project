Well I've been sitting here for hours
As I wish for this to start
I set my standards high in hopes
They will not fall apart

It's almost like I fell asleep
My doubts have seemed to fade
Because I've opened up my eyes to see
I'm right where I plan to be
Today!
Today!

Cast your net, cast it out
And I hope to guide your scream and shout
It's everything you want and maybe more!

Anyone can dream through the night
But only some can dream with eyes wide
There lies, the fight inside
It resides, in everyone
They will proclaim you a fool
And it reminds you to do
Anything and everything to prove them a liar

It's almost like I fell asleep
My doubts have seemed to fade
Because I've opened up my eyes to see
I'm right where I plan to be
Today!
Today!

Cast your net, cast it out
And I hope to guide your scream and shout
It's everything you want and maybe more!
Doesn't seem out of reach
Hit the ground and run with both your feet
Here's a lesson that I hope to teach
Believe you'll be a dream catcher

Cry out loud and take the stage
And don't let skeptics ruin your phase
With every forwards step, you'll take away
Their breath away, their breath away
Believe, believe they'll spit their words
And some will say it seems absurd
But devour the cynics, dismiss the critics
And mark my words, I believe maybe you'll cast your net

Cast it out
And I hope to guide your scream and shout
It's everything you want and maybe more!
Today!
Today!

Cast your net, cast it out
And I hope to guide your scream and shout
It's everything you want and maybe more!
Doesn't seem out of reach
Hit the ground and run with both your feet
Here's a lesson I hope to teach
Believe you'll be a dream catcher
Please believe you'll be a dream catcher
Please believe you'll be a dream catcher
