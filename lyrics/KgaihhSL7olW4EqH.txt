I watched the proverbial sunrise
Coming up over the Pacific and
You might think I'm losing my mind
But I will shy away from the specifics

'Cause I don't want you to know where I am
'Cause then you'll see my heart
In the saddest state it's ever been
This is no place to try and live my life

Stop right there
That's exactly where I lost it
See that line?
Well I never should've crossed it
Stop right there
Well I never should've said that
It's the very moment that
I wish that I could take back

I'm sorry for the person I became
I'm sorry that it took so long for me to change
I'm ready to be sure I never become that way again
'Cause who I am hates who I've been
Who I am hates who I've been

I talk to absolutely no one
Couldn't keep to myself enough
And the things bottled inside have finally begun
To create so much pressure that I'll soon blow up and
I heard the reverberating footsteps
Syncing up to the beating of my heart
And I was positive that unless I got myself together
I would watch me fall apart

And I can't let that happen again
'Cause then you'll see my heart
In the saddest state it's ever been
This is no place to try and live my life

Stop right there
That's exactly where I lost it
See that line?
I never should've crossed it
Stop right there
I never should've said that
It's the very moment that
I wish that I could take back

Stop right there
That's exactly where I lost it
See that line?
Well I never should've crossed it
Stop right there
Well I never should've said that
It's the very moment that
I wish that I could take back

I'm sorry for the person I became
I'm sorry that it took so long for me to change
I'm ready to be sure I never become that way again
'Cause who I am hates who I've been
Who I am hates who I've been

Who I am hates who I've been
And who I am will take the second chance you gave me
Who I am hates who I've been
'Cause who I've been only ever made me

So sorry for the person I became
So sorry that it took so long for me to change
I'm ready to be sure I never become that way again
'Cause who I am hates who I've been
Who I am hates who I've been
