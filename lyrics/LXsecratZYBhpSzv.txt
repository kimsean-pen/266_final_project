The feeling lingers, ooh so gently after you leave
I know that no drug i can take will make me feel this way
I'd live all my days being broken down & built back up
If only it was by you not sure how much my heart can take,
but i'll get through it, you know, because i do it for you
Let me stay caught in your web tonight
I'll make you never wanna leave my side
I feel closest to death when you're not around
I'd live all my days being broken down & built back up
If only it was by you not sure how much my heart can take,
but i'll get through it, you know, because i do it for you
Not sure
Because i do it for you
