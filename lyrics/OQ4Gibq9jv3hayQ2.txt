Picture yourself by a rocket
Picture yourself in a glittering silver suit
Picture yourself getting on it
Saluting the news crews, you're the new recruit

Do you remember the numbers
Hung on the door of the house where you grew up
Do you remember the colours
Tied 'round the handles of last years?

Meanwhile, up in heaven
They're waiting for you
They're waiting for you
And if you believe them, you will see them when you
Meanwhile, up in heaven
They're waiting for you
They're waiting for you
And if you believe them, you will see them when you
Are ready to

Guided by love and a flashlight
Lead by consuming desire for good ideas
Lighting the clock on the dashboard
There's another ten years, but I know it's still here

Meanwhile, up in heaven
They're waiting for you
They're waiting for you
And if you believe them, you will see them when you
Meanwhile, up in heaven
They're waiting for you
They're waiting for you
And if you believe them, you will see them when you
Are ready to

Your mind
Is the key
It is the key that sets you free
Your mind
Is the key
It is the key that sets you free

Meanwhile, up in heaven
They're waiting for you
They're waiting for you
And if you believe them, you will see them when you
Are ready to
They're waiting for you
They're waiting for you
And if you believe them, you will see them when you
Are ready to
They're waiting for you
They're waiting for you
Are ready to
They're waiting for you
They're waiting for you
Are ready to
They're waiting for you
They're waiting for you
Are ready to
They're waiting for you
They're waiting for you
Are ready to
