Across fathomless gulfs
Where darkness has devoured all light
Lies a comatose universe
Enveloped in everlasting night

When the celestial candle burns out
And the watchers return to their outer planes
All life will expire
And only the void will remain

(Solo: Gargiulo)

A starless darkness reigns
In this realm of aeon's long death
Extinguishing the cosmic flame
In an ocean of emptiness

(Solo: Davidson)

Nothingness devouring infinity
Unmasking the fabric of reality

Vacuous realm
Forsaken dimension
All matter decays and dissolves away
