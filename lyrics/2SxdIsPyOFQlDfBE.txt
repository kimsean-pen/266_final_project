Just when things are getting complicated in the eye of the storm
She flicks a red-hot revelation off the tip of her tongue
It does a dozen somersaults and leaves you supercharged
Makes me wanna blow the candles out
Just to see if you glow in the dark

Shalalala, shalalala
Shalalala, shalalala

Home sweet home, home sweet home
Home sweet booby-trap
I took the batteries out my mysticism and put 'em in my thinking cap
She's got a telescopic hallelujah hanging up on her wall
For when it gets too complicated in the eye of the storm

Shalalala, shalalala
Shalalala, shalalala
Oh, oh-oh-oh

And in a hellcat spangled cavern
When your judgment's on the road
And you're acting like a stranger
'Cause you thought it looked like fun
And did you ever get the feeling
That these are things she's said before?
Her steady hands may well have done the devil's pedicure
What you waiting for? Sing another fucking

Shalalala, shalalala
Shalalala, shalalala
