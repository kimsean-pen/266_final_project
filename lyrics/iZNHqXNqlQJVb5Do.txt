Ah, damn it, how did it happen?
I'm in love again
Oh god, no, it's a disaster
I'm in love again
What the hell? Now I'm under her spell I'm in love again
She must be some kind of witch
To go and pull such a dirty trick
She did it, she made me fall in love again

It wasn't me, I was minding my own business
Can't you see? She was searching for a soul to steal
And she snatched me, and now I've got a funny feeling
Yeah, that nothing's gonna stop her
Nothing's gonna stop her
Nothing can stop her now

Watch out, it could be contagious
I'm in love again
It's a nightmare, somebody stop it
I'm in love again
It hurts, but I'm startin' to like it, yeah
I'm in love again
She's comin' on like a hurricane
Lightning strikes, and I can't be saved
She did it, she made me fall in love again

It wasn't me, I was minding my own business
Can't you see? She was searching for a soul to steal
And she snatched me, and now I've got a funny feeling
Yeah, that nothing's gonna stop her
Nothing's gonna stop her
Nothing can stop her now

Well, it's not my fault
I would've been lyin' at home in bed
And it's not my fault
I was gonna watch internet porn instead
But now my heart is filled with blood
She'll suck it out, she'll drink it up
Now my heart is filled with blood
Pumping with confusion, please don't make me do this, oh

It wasn't me, I was minding my own business
Can't you see? She was searching for a soul to steal
And she snatched me, and now I've got a funny feeling
Yeah, that nothing's gonna stop her
Nothing's gonna stop her
Nothing can stop her now

Ah, damn it, how did it happen?
II'm in love again
Oh god, no, it's a disaster
I'm in love again
What the hell? Now I'm under her spell I'm in love again
She must be some kind of witch
To go and pull such a dirty trick
She did it, she made me fall in love again
I'm possessed by her demon kiss
Somebody go and grab me a crucifix
She did it, she made me fall in love again

I thought my heart was too torn to mend
I wasn't lookin' for another friend
I did it, I went and fell in love again
