Dear mother, things are changing
Are you beginning to lose hope?
Approaching for so long, how will we stay afloat?
I've been holding on to my breath
But I'm starting to cave in
And you're starting to realize
That we're sick, that we're broken
We both act tough, but were so soft spoken
You thought we were stronger than you
I hope you know I could never, I could never blame you

But all my life have I been taught to run away?
To block out the pain

We don't have to fade away
Block out the pain

With anything, with everything
With all the pills you were swallowing
The endless times you'd drive away
Just hoping you'd forget the pain
But the same blood runs through my veins
But the same blood runs through my veins

But the same blood runs through my veins
And now I know, we don't have to fade away
