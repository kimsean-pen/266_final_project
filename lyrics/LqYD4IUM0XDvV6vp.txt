Oh man, I can't believe, that you did what they said, you did
And to this day I've still gotta say that my mind I question it
I wish I knew, what you had meant before you went and left me wondering to just an echo of your voice.
(Listen...)

Now I wait to take my turn to bleed like a kid playing with a razorblade

And wonder if I have the balls at all, or am I gonna be afraid, where are you? What do you think?

Cuz I'm not sure when knocking at death's door if I will be welcome in or be left alone outside

I hear the sound of a heart from the shadow in the dark waiting for the poison to hit it's mark

(Listen, my son)
I see the darkness surround, the shape on the ground
The killer straight up and a body face down
(Firstborn, last one)

I hear the din of the screams, sorrow in streams
The smell of farewell and gasoline
(Listen, my son)

I see a heart set free and my legacy
Hear a voice from a shadow that is beckoning me
(Firstborn, last one)

I guess there comes a point

When you think to yourself:
"This isn't worth it, it isn't worth it"

And now I feel what you felt, and now I feel what you felt inside brother.
And now I feel what you felt

This isn't worth it, it isn't worth it
I hear the sound of a heart from the shadow in the dark, waiting for the poison to hit it's mark

(Listen, my son)

I see the darkness surround, the shape on the ground
The killer straight up and a body face down
(Firstborn, last one)

I hear the din of the screams, sorrow in streams
The smell of farewell and gasoline
(Listen, my son)
I see a heart set free and my legacy

Hear a voice from a shadow that is beckoning me
(Firstborn, last one)
I wish it didn't,
I wish it didn't,
I wish it didn't,

I wish it didn't end this way
I wish it didn't,
I wish it didn't,
I wish it didn't,
I wish it didn't end this way
I wish it didn't,
I wish it didn't,
I wish it didn't,
I wish it didn't end this way
I wish it didn't,
I wish it didn't,
I wish it didn't,
I wish it didn't end this way
I wish it didn't,
I wish it didn't,
I wish it didn't,
I wish it didn't end this way
I wish it didn't,
I wish it didn't,
I wish it didn't,
I wish it didn't end this way

Live a life in hell through a mortal shell asphyxiating smell
For a crime lifetime, imagination locked in a cell
And to the other firstborn, I see the same scene that must play over in your mind and now

How much more I'm sure it's fucked with your head just like it's fucked up mine.
Listen my son - firstborn, last one.
The message you sent out to me.
I can not change what's meant to be
The message you sent out to me.
I can not change what's meant to be
(What am I supposed to do now?)
I hear the sound of a heart from the shadow in the dark, waiting for the poison to hit it's mark
I see the darkness surround, the shape on the ground
The killer straight up and a body face down
I hear the din of the screams, sorrow in streams
The smell of farewell and gasoline
(Listen)
I see a heart set free and my legacy
Hear a voice from a shadow that is beckoning me
(Listen)
I hear the sound of a heart from the shadow in the dark, waiting for the poison to hit it's mark
(Listen, my son)
I see the darkness surround, the shape on the ground
The killer straight up and a body face down
(Firstborn, last one)
I hear the din of the screams, sorrow in streams
The smell of farewell and gasoline
(Listen, my son)
I see a heart set free and my legacy
Hear a voice from a shadow that is beckoning me
(Firstborn, last one)
Firstborn...
You are the last one - firstborn.
