Him!

Here I am different in this normal world,
Why did you tease me, made me feel upset?
Fucking stereotypes feeding their heads,
I am ugly, please just go away.

Him!
I can see it's hard to fine.
This blessing in disguise.
Him!
Why you treat me this way?
Made the hate stay.

I sound like I can never seem to escape,
All the laughing, all the pain.
If you were me, what would you do?
Nothing, probably, you'd just throw me away.

I can see it's hard to fine.
Him!
This blessing in disguise.
Why you treat me this way?
Him!
Made to hate stay.
Faget!
Faget!
Faget!

I'm just a pretty boy, whatever you call it,
You wouldn't know a real man if you saw it,
It keeps going on day after day son,
You fake, if we don't want none.
I'm sick and tired of people treating me this way everyday.
Who gives a fuck, right now I got something to say.
To all the people that think I'm strange,
And I should be out here locked up in a cage.
You don't know what the hell is up now anyway,
You got this prettyboy feeling like I'm enslaved.
To a world that never appreciated shit,
You can suck my dick and fucking like it!

He had my gun but he had a body mighty, anysay!
He had my gun but he had a body mighty, anyway!
He had my gun but he had a body mighty, going to say!
He had my gun but he had a body mighty, anyway!
He had my gun but he had a body mighty, anysay!
He had my gun but he had a body mighty, not going away!

I'm just a pretty boy, I'm not supposed to fuck a girl.
I'm just a pretty boy, living in this fucked up world.
I'm just a pretty boy, I'm not supposed to fuck a girl.
I'm just a pretty boy, living in this fucked up world.
All my life, who am I?
All my life, who am I?
All my life, who am I?
All my life, who am I?
All my life, who am I?
All my life, who am I?
All my life, who am I?
All my life, who am I?
All my life, who am I?
All my life, who am I?
All my life, who am I?
All my life!

I'm just a faget!
I'm just a faget!
I'm just a faget!
I'm a faget!
I'm not a faget!
I'm not a faget!
I'm not a faget!
You motherfucking queers!
