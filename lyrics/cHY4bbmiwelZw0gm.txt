It's taken me a long time to see
What's beneath and between
I still can't tell when danger may come
I'm not above push comes to shove

The object was lost in no time at all
The meaning was fleeting
If I slow down and watch a bullet's path
One might enter and exit me
I can't take that risk, I wanna live

I'm the blue under the flame
I'm the red outside the vein
Let it in, let it be seen
I'm the fear in everything

It's a battle tooth and nail
When there is hell outside my door
I'll defend my right when it's compromised
It's the only way I know

I'm the blue under the flame
I'm the red outside the vein
Let it in, let it be seen
I'm the fear in everything

I only will return with flying colors
