Maybe I'm the ghost haunting your conscience or just an unfamiliar face
You built me up and broke me down and
I can't shake the fear that you were
Never mine I'll never change you
When you go I hope you know
That I'm still drawn to you like nicotine and
When you go I hope you know
That you're still bleeding into every thought across my head
Stained, I see your face everywhere
I can't escape you
I can't shake the fear that you were never mine
I'll never change you
When you go I hope you know
That I'm still drawn to you like nicotine and
When you go I hope you know
That you're still bleeding into every thought across my head
Tastes like nerds and cigarettes
Stained upon the lips that brought me here
I tried to chain you to my side
But the ink reads disappear
I prayed for your extinction
Just to wash your conscience clean
But before you go I hope you know
It wasn't good enough for me
When you go I hope you know
That I'm still drawn to you like nicotine and
When you go I hope you know
That you're still bleeding into every thought across my head
