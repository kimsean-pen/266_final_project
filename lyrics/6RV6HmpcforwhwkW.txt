Where are all the pretty places?
Where did they go?
Torn down by all the lonely faces
For something to hold

Flat and static paved in progress name
What will all our little children say?
When the only place to play
Is in the dirty rain

? Pours in river muddy water
? A dead man's
Plastic people stacked in towers
With nowhere to go

? Some will fill with ... and concrete grave
? Cold and dark ... the days and days
Till the only thing that remains
Is the dirty rain

Nothing's really ever gold anymore
Nothing shines like it did before
Nothing's really ever gold anymore
Nothing shines like it did before

Flat and static paved in progress name
What will all our little children say?
When the only place to play
Is in the dirty rain

The dirty rain
