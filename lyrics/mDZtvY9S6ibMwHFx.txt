When you first left me, I was wanting more
But you were fucking that girl next door
What'cha do that for?

When you first left me, I didn't know what to say
I never been on my own that way
Just sat by myself all day

I was so lost back then
But with a little help from my friends
I found a light in the tunnel at the end

Now you're calling me up on the phone
So you can have a little whine and a moan
And it's only because you're feeling alone

At first, when I see you cry
Yeah, it makes me smile
Yeah, it makes me smile

At worst, I feel bad for a while
But then I just smile
I go ahead and smile

Whenever you see me, you say that you want me back
And I tell you it don't mean jack
No, it don't mean jack

I couldn't stop laughing, no, I just couldn't help myself
See you messed up my mental health
I was quite unwell

I was so lost back then
But with a little help from my friends
I found a light in the tunnel at the end

Now you're calling me up on the phone
So you can have a little whine and a moan
And it's only because you're feeling alone

At first, when I see you cry
Yeah, it makes me smile
Yeah, it makes me smile

At worst, I feel bad for a while
But then I just smile
I go ahead and smile

La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la

At first when I see you cry
Yeah, it makes me smile
Yeah, it makes me smile

At worst, I feel bad for a while
But then I just smile
I go ahead and smile

At first when I see you cry
Yeah, it makes me smile
Yeah, it makes me smile

At worst, I feel bad for a while
But then I just smile
I go ahead and smile
