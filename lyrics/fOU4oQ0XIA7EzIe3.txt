I'm not ashamed of winning
But it wasn't that way in the beginning
It was this way
It was kiss me
Come kick me and diss me
I had to give it up
Now it's a way different feeling
You took my soul I had to steer it back
Now it's this way
Now it's with me
No Mistake, Just listen
I had to give a Fu(ck)

All of this pain you had given
It's just a reminder of livin
It was crazy, Had a baby
He's amazin, He saved me
And this time it's just us
You raised up, I can say that
I was too young, I'll never get that back
Now it's this way
Now it's flipped babe
I'm happy, Just listen
I had to give a Fu(ck)

I was super cool
But now I'm super strong
I had nothing to loose
But I was super wrong
It was the circumstance
I got the power from
I was super tough
But now I'm super strong
Super strong

I'm a Braveheart
I'm a Braveheart
I'm a Braveheart
So come and pin my purple heart
Come and pin my purple heart
Come and pin my purple heart
I didn't run

I was super cool
But now I'm super strong
I had nothing to loose
But I was super wrong
It was the circumstance
I got the power from
I was super tough
But now I'm super strong

I was super cool
But now I'm super strong
I had nothing to loose
But I was super wrong
It was the circumstance
I got the power from
I was super tough
But now I'm super strong

I was super cool
But now I'm super strong
I had nothing to loose
But I was super wrong
It was the circumstance
I got the power from
I was super tough
But now I'm super strong
