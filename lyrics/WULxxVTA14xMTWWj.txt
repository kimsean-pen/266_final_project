what did the storm wash away?
are you bailing out,
out of the plans
we already made?
it won't bother me now
and you know i'll be okay.
you gotta lead your life,
but you're not sure you know the way.
well, you want to walk in white;
you want to win but you're too shy,
so the candle just keeps burning down on me.
well, the cards are on the table.
i'm here tonight,
and i don't need anything from you.
down on the bowery
the changing lights
and i'll still be waiting here for you.

i saw that look on your face --
you don't need me now
and sometimes you wonder if it's all
just another mistake
and why don't you just walk away?
you gotta measure the cost:
what do you gain?
what have you lost?
well, i often wonder why
you wanna win but you won't fight,
so the candle just keeps burning down on me.
well, the cards are on the table.
i'm here tonight,
but i don't need anything from you.
down on the bowery
the changing lights
and i'll still be waiting here for you.
my cards are on the table.
i'm here tonight,
but i don't need anything from you.
down on the bowery
the changing lights
but i'll still be waiting here for you.

na na ni na --
la la di da --
la da da la-ah la-ah-ah-ahhh -- (&c &c)

i'll still be waiting here for you.
