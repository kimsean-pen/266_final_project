Those that fell today shall be
In solemn sculpture cast
Always held in reverence
In memory of the past

Named in tribute forevermore
The colours carved on the granite wall

Folded flags awarded
In the line of duty fallen
Draped upon the coffin lid
The banner never taken
The regimental crest
That still flies high
No colours lost, the epitaph
Attempt to take them and you shall die

Named in tribute forevermore
The colours carved on the granite wall

Carved upon the granite wall

Mankind on the brink of extinction
Few now left alive - the human race denied

Mourning
The tragic loss
Life cut short
This broken column
Immortal
Names shall be
Carved in stone
Upon the granite wall
