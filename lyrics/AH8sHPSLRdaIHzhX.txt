I come on
I come on
Oh, we just push on through
With a whole bunch of cigarettes
Jammed between 12 karat teeth
And a whiskey soaked
Collars and cuffs
And a whole heap of romantic notions
We set sail, always spill on the ocean
So click heels to a dance of devotion
So click heels

Oh, we take chances
With a whole bunch of cigarettes
Cracks shot from 2 twelve golden teeth
Smearing blood on our collars and cuffs
With a book full of great things to say
So we bull and
Forget about the...
We click heels to a dance 'neath the ocean
We click heels to a dance 'neath the ocean
A wishy-washy...
And under the waves and guess what?
Now, there's no one to save
Oh, come on
Oh, come on

Oh, we talk bitter
Oh, we talk bitter

And we spit at the sea
As he swallows us whole
And spits out the Bully Bones

So click heels
So click heels
So click heels
