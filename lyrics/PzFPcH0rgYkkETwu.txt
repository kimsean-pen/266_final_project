I can never tell what you want
Even with time
You'll never learn to move on
I'm trying my best to lift you up, to repair
But when I stop, you never seem to stay there

And I'm holding on, I'm holding on
I'll wait until you're really gone
And try to find another way
But I can not stay

I can do no right for doing wrong
I'll swallow my pride, I only want to belong
I'm trying my best to toughen up, for these days
And maybe I'll find another time for this place

And I'm holding on, I'm holding on
I'll wait until you're really gone
And try to find another way

But I can not stay
I'll try to find another way
But I can not stay
