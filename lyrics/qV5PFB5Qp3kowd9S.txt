Our love is alive, and so we begin
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table
Stumblin' In
Our love is a flame, burning within
Now and then firelight will catch us
Stumblin' In
Wherever you go, ooh, whatever you do
You know these reckless thoughts of mine are following you
Ooh, I'm falling for you, whatever you do
'Cause baby you've shown me so many things that I never knew
Whatever it takes, baby I'll do it for you
Our love is alive, and so we begin(so we begin)
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table
Stumblin' In
Our love is a flame, burning within
Now and then firelight will catch us
Stumblin' In, oh, oh

You were so young, and I was so free
I may been young, but baby that's not what I wanted to be
Well you were the one, oh why was it me
'Cause baby you've shown me so many things that I've never seen, oh
Whatever you need, baby you've got it from me
Our love is alive, and so we begin
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table
Stumblin' In
Our love is a flame, burning within
Now and then firelight will catch us
Stumblin' In
Stumblin' In
Stumblin' In
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table
Stumblin' In
Aagh, Stumblin' In
Mm, Stumblin' In
Now and then firelight will catch us
Stumblin' In
Oh, stumblin' In
I'm Stumblin' In
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table
Stumblin' In
Whoa, stumblin' in
Aagh, stumblin' in
I'm stumblin' In
