Rock me baby
Rock me all night long
Rock me baby
Honey, rock me all night long
I want you to rock me baby
Like my back ain't got no bones

Roll me baby
Like you roll a wagon wheel
Want you to roll me baby
Like you roll a wagon wheel
Want you to roll me baby
You don't know how it make me feel

Rock me baby
Honey rock me slow
Hey rock me pretty baby
Baby rock me slow
Want you to rock me baby
'Till I want no more
