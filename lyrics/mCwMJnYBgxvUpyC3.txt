Song About An Angel
So I say
Still away
Sleep close my eyes
An image of
Your face
Traced in white sand
Underneath
Undefined
I lay down
With arms outstreched
I embrace the fall
And all the time
I tried
To let you know
Discomfort comes clearly
Woh Sometimes you see right through me
Words, words
Your married to that
Your married to that
Your married to your pain Although you hit me hard
I come back
The earth cries
And I call
On the inside
Running behind
Which one will I face?
Running behind
Which one will I...
Thin comfort
In what I say
My back is turned
I halo my soul
For awhile
And all the time
I tried
To let you know
Discomfort
Comes clearly
When I shout
Woh Sometimes you see right through me
Words, words
Your married to that
Your married to that
Your married to your pain Although you hit me hard
I come back
The earth cries
And I fall
On the inside
Running behind
Which one will I face?
Running behind
Which one will I...
