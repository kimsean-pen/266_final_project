Hey
Hey I know I'm hot
And you not, hah
All these niggas say they hot, shit you must not heard of Glock
Mister pull up let it pop, mister don't play 'bout his guap
And ever since a tot I been playin' 'round with them blocks
Close your legs, ho give me top, and my coupe cruise like a yacht
Pipe down lil nigga, you ain't hot
I just left the lot, yeah you know I gets a lot
Very large amounts, yeah you know what I'm about
No we don't play around, get 'em in and get 'em out
Goddamn all this water got me drowning
VVS's, forty thousand my medallion
I been fly bitch, I don't need no pilot
Every time I'm Gucci'd down, I be styling
Racks for my shirt, belt, and shoes, I'm fresher than you
Just pulled up in the coupe, had the kids like ooh
No I don't wear no Trues, but my pockets on Buddha
My chopper got a cooler, pull up, we bust your medula
Goddamn Lil Glock, you too hot
How you rack your bands and get another drop?
How you put all of them diamonds in your watch?
Why the fuck you go and get another charm?
All these niggas say they hot, shit you must not heard of Glock
Mister pull up let it pop, mister don't play 'bout his guap
And ever since a tot I been playin' 'round with them blocks
Close your legs, ho give me top, and my coupe cruise like a yacht
Pipe down lil nigga, you ain't hot
I just left the lot, yeah you know I gets a lot
Very large amounts, yeah you know what I'm about
No we don't play around, get 'em in and get 'em out
Same young nigga riding 'round with them rounds
You just the same nigga riding 'round talking down
Naw we don't play around, turn your smile into a frown
Make my niggas clear the crowd
Run in when them guns sound (gang shit)
Ah shit, breaking news, he got hit with the tool
They came up on the block and then they popped him and got loose
They came up on the block and then they sweeped it like a broom
I came up off the block then turned all my rocks into jewels, bitch
All these niggas say they hot, shit you must not heard of Glock
Mister pull up let it pop, mister don't play 'bout his guap
And ever since a tot I been playin' 'round with them blocks
Close your legs, ho give me top, and my coupe cruise like a yacht
Pipe down lil nigga, you ain't hot
I just left the lot, yeah you know I gets a lot
Very large amounts, yeah you know what I'm about
No we don't play around, get 'em in and get 'em out
