I am ready to find
The lost day to vanishing days
I write words void of worth
In my youth I will always stay
But there is room for every lie
They put on my shoulders
I let it inside
Inseparable growth
Marks us still
Abundance won't come
Purge our will

Cut out and resign
Overtaken and left behind
It's in our racing hearts
The things we never let go of
They spill into my love

I'm thinking
If torpor had left my soul
Voices would sing
I would submit my heart
To the sentiment within
And let go of the night that is abiding here

Old songs lost their grace
Send some light back to this place
