Failing, falling, lost in forever
Will I find a way to keep it together?
Am I strong enough to last through the weather in the hurricane of my life?
Can it be a conscious decision?
Are the rightful ways to alter my vision?
Am I speeding towards another collision in the early breeze of my life?

Memories don't lie
You know better than
Memories don't lie
You know better than
Memories don't lie
You know better than
Those who have fallen
Memories don't lie
You know better than
Memories don't lie
You know better than
Memories don't lie
You know better than
Those who have fallen

And please believe me
Did my eyes deceive me?
Don't stand me up
Just leave me
I have fallen again
This is the end
Pain redefined

Shaking, burning up with the fever
In the realm of pain, I am the deceiver
That will let myself, so I can believer her
But she dissembles my life
I cannot dispel the illusion
All my hopes and dreams are drowned by confusion
Can I find a way to find a solution that will reconfigure my life?

Memories don't lie
You know better than
Memories don't lie
You know better than
Memories don't lie
You know better than
Those who have fallen
Memories don't lie
You know better than
Memories don't lie
You know better than
Memories don't lie
You know better than
Those who have fallen

And please believe me
Did my ears deceive me?
Don't stand me up
Just leave me
I have fallen again
This is the end
Pain redefined

And I know that stillness shatters
We have all been frightened by the
The sound of footsteps on the pavement of our lives

I stand and fight
I'm not afraid to die
Hypnotized
Bury me tonight

Please believe
When the world deceives me
Don't stand me up
Just leave me
I have fallen again
This is the end
Pain redefined
