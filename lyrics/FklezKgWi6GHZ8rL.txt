Out of all the mistakes you made, I still stayed
Even though it's the bed that you made, I still laid
Never wanted anything for being loyal to ya
Sworn (?) you was gonna love me, I see I was wrong

In the beginning it was hard to realize that we were ending
I was in denial all along, now it's time for me, to move on
I reached my limit, felt like I was the only one giving
Finally hit me that we're done, guess I found out the hard way
That I'm strong, oh

It's okay for me to be hurt but not for longer
Sometimes I might forget my word but not for long, yeah
I will remind myself that you gon' be mad when I bounce back, yeah
I know sometimes I put you first but not for long, yeah

And I made a 360 turn,
I don't get the same chills when you call no more
No in and out of my life,
like revolving doors, I'm no longer yours, no
Just a bad habit I had to break,
I learned from my love you're my last mistake, oh
I think it's safe to say that we have run our course

In the beginning it was hard to realize that we were ending
I was in denial all along, now it's time for me, to move on
I reached my limit, felt like I was the only one giving
Finally hit me that we're done, guess I found out the hard way
That I'm strong, oh

It's okay for me to be hurt but not for longer
Sometimes I might forget my word but not for long, yeah
I will remind myself that you gon' be mad when I bounce back, yeah
I know sometimes I put you first but not for long, yeah

At the end of the day I found out I'ma be okay
I realize I'm alright living life doing things my way
At the end of the day I found out I'ma be okay
I realize I'm alright living life doing things my way

It's okay for me to be hurt but not for longer
Sometimes I might forget my word but not for long, yeah
I will remind myself that you gon' be mad when I bounce back, yeah
I know sometimes I put you first but not for long, yeah
But not for long
