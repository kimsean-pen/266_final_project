Lost and broke, I feel like we can't get anywhere
Enough to feel like leaving
Hopeless, but I know that this can't be everything
We don't need this heartache

We could break away, if you really want to run
Hard to keep the pace, when you're staring at the sun
Let's hide away from it, try escape from it
Let's hide away, if you really want to run

With you, I see hope, when before I didn't care
Now, I know I need you
I need you, I need you
Now, I know I need you

We could break away, if you really want to run
Hard to keep the pace, when you're staring at the sun
Let's hide away from it, try escape from it
Let's hide away, if you really want to run

Maybe it's freedom
A chance to keep breathing
Maybe we're lonely

Maybe it's freedom
A chance to keep breathing
Maybe we're lonely

Maybe it's freedom
A chance to keep breathing
Maybe we're lonely

Maybe it's freedom
A chance to keep breathing
Maybe we're lonely, ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh

Maybe we could break away, if you really want to run
Hard to keep the pace, when you're staring at the sun
Let's hide away from it, try escape from it
Let's hide away, if you really want to run
