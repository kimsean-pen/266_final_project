I know what I'm looking for
And it takes some time to know for sure
We fight just to keep it alive
And I'm not mad if you're not mad

Give this one more try
Everything will fall in line
We can paint this town
If you're seeing what I see
There will be no disbelief
We're gonna paint this town

You know, it's been so clear to me
And it's obvious you've taken a piece
So tell me, why are you holding back?
If you're not mad and I'm not mad

'Cause you know, I can be the crazy one too
Can't do or make you see that I need you

Give this one more try
Everything will fall in line
We can paint this town
If you're seeing what I see
There will be no disbelief
We're gonna paint this town, paint this town

You and I, we're gonna paint this town, paint this town
You and I, we're gonna paint this town, paint this town
You and I, we're gonna paint this town, paint this town

Give this one more try
Everything will fall in line
We can paint this town
If you're seeing what I see
There will be no disbelief
And we can paint this town, paint this town

(You and I)
(Everything will fall in line)
(You and I)
(There will be no disbelief)
(You and I)
(Without you, there's no reason for my story)
(And when I'm with you, I can always act the same)
(You and I)
(Forever, yeah, if we're together)
(We can make it better)
(You and I)
