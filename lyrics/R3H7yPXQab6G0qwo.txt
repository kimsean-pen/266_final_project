I want out of this plane
Riding hard
For one too many a day
Elude at all cost
All meaning is lost

Hope dies last
My escape I forecast
Over the rainbow
And into the vast
Deep unknown
Alienated so alien I go

The plans came to me in a vision
Behold my hands
Guided by the supernatural
And the spiral it spirals
Plot the way trip away tip the scale
The stars align the fuel is fine
And we explode into oblivion
The Arcturian sign
