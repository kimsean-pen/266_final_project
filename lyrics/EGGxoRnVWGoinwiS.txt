I saw your eyes convincing
I saw everything that night
You were the quiet actress
A flawed masterpiece

So cold our darkest days
Sleepless our darkest nights
Line after line but love is...
Forever

A beauty bound in cold silver
Broken bottles and empty lockets
Exhaling bittersweet
Your words were laced in gold
A gilded memoir engraved
Into my soul
Do you remember that night you led me astray?
Do you recall tainting me with your apathy?

Encapsulating mutilated our malice
Our intoxicated advocating lust for a cause

It's raining sulfur tonight
An anti-climatic proccession
Yielding an undying uniformed prestige

So cold our darkest days
Sleepless our darkest nights
Line after line but love is...
Never

Encapsulating mutilated our malice
Our intoxicated advocating lust for a cause
As you walked away that night instilled virture
A fatal kiss my muse there's nothing I can do for you

A cordial gaze pierces
Sending chills down the nape of my porcelain neck
MY BLOOD RUNS COLD

Please don't forget me
Long live that sentiment
Please don't forget me...
These words are ALL I HAVE

Encapsulating mutilated our malice
Our intoxicated advocating lust for a cause
As you walked away that night instilled virture
A fatal kiss my muse there's nothing I can do for you
Blow the last candle out
Recoil finish what we've started
For you I'll take this to my grave...
Forever
Please, forgive me for wondering
If my love ever truly engraved
in your heart,
Like the finest poetry
on concrete.
