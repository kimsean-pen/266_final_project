I fall apart, I call her out
I follow her
I'm calling her

Happy now? (For me?)
Happy now? (Happy now)
And we shouldn't be awake, we shouldn't be awake...
But I am
(I am)

Ah!
Save our now
But are we happy now? (For me?)
Happy now?
Save our,
Save our,
Save our now

I fall away
I call at the world
I fall alone
I fall alone

Happy now? (For me?)
Happy now? (Happy now)
They say we shouldn't be awake, we shouldn't be awake
But I am
(I am)

Ah!
Save our now
But are we happy now? (For me?)
Happy now?
Save our,
Save our,
Save our now

I'll never know if the wonder in the wilderness
Is all I've ever wanted and is all I've ever known
Are we crying now?
