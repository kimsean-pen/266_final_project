I feel like I've been here before
Real life or dreaming, unsure
When all my travels could all unravel
In a heartbeat or a thought
And if my legacy's abolished
Then whatever we accomplished
Did it for the pedigree, I don't see an enemy
Then to me y'all are potentially accomplice
Cause some men rise above
Some men fight enough
Until there struggling becomes them and are defined as such
Who the fuck then divided us
It's like I'm born every morning, die every evening
War at my door reviving my demons
I'd rather die with my convictions than live a life with no meaning
So I hold court like the king of the mountain hall
Every one everything is accountable
Face the music and embrace the truth of all that makes us human
Then I think I'd be proud of y'all
If I am, all I said I am
And we are, all in together and
From where I stand I'm just trying to get a plan
To build a better man for this Neverland
Maybe a dreamer, make believer, try escape the ether
But the great deceiver lives inside to feed a basic need for
Identity of own,
set me in stone near my legacy to grow then I'll never be alone
It's the music that will ferry me to home

I'm not lost, I've been following my own path
Not blind, been looking at my future not past
Ain't done, staring into the abyss daily
Until that man in the mirror ain't me
I'm not lost, I've been following my own path
Not blind, been looking at my future not past
Ain't done, staring into the abyss daily
Until that man in the mirror ain't me

Feel like I've been here before, in the abyss
Looking up to the great expanse
Stars in the sky, stars in my eyes
Won't stop till their stars in my hands
Feel like I landed on Mars
I feel abandoned in fact
They're all on Dancing with Stars
Making fun of artists who actually rap
I lost my confidence
Till I got on my flex
Now can't tell me nothing, city all suffering
Tell God he got a Suffa complex
I'm draped in the belt of Orion
I'm praying the truth rings out
They're saying the loud things quiet
We're saying the quiet things loud
I wanna rock right now
Want every single rapper on the block wiped out
Everybody coming at the Hilltop, lights out
You're running down seconds on the clock, time out
What? Pipe down, we don't care what you think of us
We're the shit and you can't sit with us
You trying to fly by clinging to Icarus
I'm trying to drive by liquor and cigarettes
I'm trying to be a better man
Ask Eddie Vedder man, I'm trying to be Clark
I feel like Letterman, hiding my venom in
A coffee mug with a broken heart
Open bars probably going to kill me
If all this touring don't
From the heart sincerely
All I want really, is to watch my children grow

I'm not lost, I've been following my own path
Not blind, been looking at my future not past
Ain't done, staring into the abyss daily
Until that man in the mirror ain't me
I'm not lost, I've been following my own path
Not blind, been looking at my future not past
Ain't done, staring into the abyss daily
Until that man in the mirror ain't me
