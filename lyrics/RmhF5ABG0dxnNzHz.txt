I tried everything but nothing ever satisfies me
And I feel lowest when I'm higher than a satellite
Just gonna lie down and sleep here on the ocean floor
Found shelter in a dream

As I saw you there
Baby, go
Just go back where you came from
As I saw you there
Baby, go
Just go back where you came from

I find solace in just noticing the stars above me
Though it's only for a moment, it's all that I need
I just wanna lie down and sleep here on the ocean floor
Found shelter in a dream
In a dream

As I saw you there
Baby, go
Just go back where you came from
As I saw you there
Baby, go
Just go back where you came from
