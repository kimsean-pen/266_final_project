Youth should not be forgiven, it should be accused
At my midnight wedding salvation lives on
My rose is fading, it's near the dark
The fourth rose is in your hand

Who strikes out to be excellent in
Unravel the surface, see below
My rose is fading, it's near the dark
The fourth rose is in your hand

Red roses tell you of life as white as your corpse
No wolf will bloom there
My rose is fading, you're in the dark
The fourth rose is in your hand

The darkest secret in my heart is you
Let not the shadows gather and reveal
I can't buy peace of mind, it's something I'll never find
The darkest secret in my heart is you

Youth should not be forgiven, it should be accused
At my midnight wedding no traitor lives on
My rose is fading, it's near the dark
The fourth rose is in your hand

The darkest secret in my heart is you
Let not the shadows gather and reveal

I can't buy peace of mind, it's something I'll never find
The darkest secret in my heart is you.
