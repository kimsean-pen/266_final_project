yes i'm certain that a curtain needs some pulling cause it's hurting, it makes me think:
i'm uncertain that you're her friends and don't even try to pretend that you're all alone.
doesn't really matter
so you're hating and conspiring and i'm trying to defend her, you never said
why you hate her and you make her have intentions to make life worse, it never works.
what's the matter, it doesn't matter, nothing really matters, several different matters, entirely different matters,
entirely different.
