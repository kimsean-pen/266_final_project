Oh baby

It's better that it hurts
It's better that it feels this way to me
I can't be too comfortable
'Cause loving you is not my destiny

Said I'm concerned that I feel this pain
My heart is aching, breaking
Pain staking in this gambling thing
This ain't no parallel universe, parallel life you choose to

In one your living like love of my life
And in the other your the daddy of theirs
So I play Russian Roulette and put this phone to my ear
Just to say, just to say yo this is Ms. Stress

It's better that it hurts
It's better that it feels this way to me
I can't be too comfortable
'Cause loving you is not my destiny

See too much asked of me through his lips
So I attempted to be all that dreams suggest
To the ego and promise the soul
I tried to be all he had ever told

Of the interchangeable face and physicality
And mentality, she, she as closely
Now he summoned all my tears abandoned we
I lived alone for years no longer knowing who exactly is me

As I began the punishment for his perfection
My vision nearly lost the direction
My return to innocence was lost and his ID you see I forgot
And instead I saw protection through judgment
Now angels and devils look alike to me
Sometimes quiet sounds like lonely to me

My my angel, I'd stopped breathing for you
If my life was possible without end
To be sure of love I'm needing more than just a casual affair
But the pain runs deep, internally
But clearly seen when you're not there

It's better that it hurts
It's better that it feels this way to me
I can't be too comfortable
'Cause loving you is not my destiny

It's better that it hurts
It's better that it feels this way to me
I can't be too comfortable
'Cause loving you is not my destiny

It ain't my time to die right now
You to I means death of my heart, my visions, my dreams
It ain't my time to die right now
You to I means death of my heart, my visions, my dreams
It ain't my time to die right now
You to I means death of my heart, my visions, my dreams
