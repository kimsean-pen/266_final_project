I remember you
Slow down so I can follow you

Always I remember you
Slow down so I can follow you
And you, such a fearless soul
Disarmed me by truth, and broke my mold

Always I remember you
Slow down or try to tell the truth

And I know I'm just a coward when it comes to love
Disarmed by words, like an old wives' tale
Goodbye my deeper child
Time to take down your barricades
And follow your own path now

Always I remember you
Slow down, or try to tell the truth
Always I can recall you
Can you slow down so I can follow you?

Deep down you said I'm a coward when it comes to love
Deep down your words changed my mold
Deep down you said I'm a coward when it comes to love
Deep down your barricades changed my mold
Always

Always
Always
Always
Always

Goodbye my deeper child
It's time to take down the barricades
And follow your own path now
