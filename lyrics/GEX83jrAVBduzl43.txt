Divide and rule
Countdown to visitation
Inner spaces
Invaded, some say by alien races
They orbit our sun for thousands of years
Creating supersonic wind tunnels that funnel severe
Take-off weight
So aircrafts that pass the range
Become sacrificed in a mass of flames
Atmospheric oscillations cause extreme accelerations
The physical damage could devastate the
Electrical, chemical, biological surfaces
Smuggled by the government's officials to customers
Moving airstreams would cause ionization
Cosmic rays would then expose you to radiation
All this plays a part in the great invasion
A rectangular equation your game awakening
We land our plane on the plains of the land that struck?
Formulating the plan to stick
Oh, there's a chance for it

I'm gliding through the atoms
What is this loneliness I'm feeling?
It's all in your head
This loneliness I'm feeling

No need for panic, proceed with planning
Soon as they landed, blown off the planet
Aquatic space vessels flow like a wet dream
Conductor of the thought train, I authored a jet stream
When Mother Nature got out of line with Father Time
She was visited, now we gotta live with it
Reptilian amphibious man
Cause you kept chilling and
Just missed the plan
We unified humans, aliens, rebels
The earth's desert, sandstorms, and dust devils
There's no high-roll fallacy
The most glamorate conglamorous in this spiral galaxy
The possibility of extraterrestrial contact was all fact
Humans were the first stage of attack
Meant to further mutate to creatures named Zoanoids
Traveled to the earth before the legionaries were destroyed

I'm gliding through the atoms
What is this loneliness I'm feeling?
It's all in your head
This loneliness I'm feeling

The forerunners' structure was dug up from
The rim of the Milky Way galaxy systematically
Empires collapsed from higher a tax
I admire the aspiring acts
That my eyes were infatuated with final conflict
Interstellar civilizations came along with bombs and ships
Machines with artificial intelligence
telling us our existence is not relevant
Damn
Who would volunteer
To bounce extremely low frequency rhymes off the ionosphere
Tell all alien life I'm in here
So your vessel? It could get commandeered
Like your planet
Cause you taking it for granted
And everyone ran when they landed
There's a pentagon inside every pentagram
Do your geometry
It's in the center fam

I'm gliding through the atoms
What is this loneliness I'm feeling?
It's all in your head
This loneliness I'm feeling
