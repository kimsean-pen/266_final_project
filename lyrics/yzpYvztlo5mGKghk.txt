She rides in
On the devils back
Riding on that back
She brings the wind

Oh lord, that wind
Blows right through you
And through hope it blows
And leaves nothing behind

Oh, I turned to the sun
And it fled from the sky
From the sky it fell
To it's grave

Oh, three winters coming
And no summers between
No summers to warm
These weary old bones

I'm watching the storm coming down

I see thunder and lightning
Ripping up the sky
Yet I beg for no mercy
Just get me through the night

Oh, I faced the wolves
Staring eye to eye
In those cold cold eyes
I see storms abound

Oh, the wolves they chase
Both the sun and the moon
Soon the sun and moon
Will lay down and die

Oh, the oceans boil
And spill across the lands
Both the land and air
Is foul with poison

Oh, the mountains shake
And soon they'll crumble
They'll crumble and fall
And only dust remain
