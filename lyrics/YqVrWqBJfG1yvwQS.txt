Fire in my eyes, I know that you see it
Ain't no need in fighting
What you feel in your soul
Trouble on your mind
Why you tryna hide it?
There's no need in fighting
What you feel in your soul

Since we crossed that bridge
Ain't no turning back
I gave you my heart
I ain't seen it since
But I know, yeah
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I loved you once
I loved you twice
I don't care what it takes
Baby, it's my life
I know
I know, I know (Yeah)

Got knee deep inside
Unleashing your demons
There must be a reason
That you're stealing my soul
You make sure you got me good
'Cause I'm never leaving
Even though I got reasons
You're holding my soul

Since we crossed that bridge
Ain't no turning back
I gave you my heart
I ain't seen it since
But I know, yeah
Oh, I know, I know (Ooh)
Oh, I loved you once
I loved you twice
I don't care what it takes
Baby, it's my life
I know
I know, I know
