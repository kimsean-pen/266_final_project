Born into hell I had to fight to survive
I barely made it out of there alive
And when you tell me that's all in vain
I pray about it just to ease the pain

That step you're taking it could be your last
To be forgotten yeah it's just the past
I know it now that we could turn this tide
So this step right here will be my greatest stride

Last stand
We're getting over while we can
Last stand
We're getting over while we can
We're getting over while we can
We're getting over while we can
We're getting over while we can

Sweet velvet vision in the rising sun
Well I've come to say that you're the only one
And when you see me in the dead of night
Well all I ask is that you treat me right

Now hop aboard this is our exit train
And once we leave it's never quite the same
We're here to make it never going back
Let's never fake it let the shadows cast

Last stand
We're getting over while we can
Last stand
We're getting over while we can
We're getting over while we can
We're getting over while we can
We're getting over while we can

I turn my head I see you watching me
I gotta fight it gotta fight the need
We're gunna make it yeah we're gunna last
Just give me time I won't repeat the past

Last stand
We're getting over while we can
Last stand
We're getting over while we can.
