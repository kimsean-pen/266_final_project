Ghosts in the photograph never lie'd to me

I'd be all of that
I'd be all of that

A false memory
Would be everything
A denial my eliminent

What was that for?
What was that for?

What would you do if you saw spaceships over Glasgow?
Would you fear them?

Every aircraft
Every camera
Is a wish that wasn't granted
What was that for?
What was that for?
Try to be bad
Try to be bad
