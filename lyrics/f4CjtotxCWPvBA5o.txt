When you're out there on your own
Where your memories can find you
Like a circle goes around, you were lost until you found out
What it all comes down to
One by one, the lonely feelings gone

Day by day they slowly fade away
Ooh, the look was in her eyes
You never know what might be found there

She was dancing right in time, and the moves she made so fine
Like the music that surrounds her
Should I stay or go?
I really want to know
Would I lose or win?

If I try and love again
Oh o-o-o-oh, gonna try and love again
O-oh o-o-o-oh, I'm gonna try and love again
O-oh o-o-o-oh, gonna try and love
Right or wrong, what's done is done
It's only moments that you borrow
But the thoughts will linger on of the lady and her song

When the sun comes up tomorrow
Well it might take years to see through all these tears
Don't let go, when you find it you will know
Oh o-o-o-oh, gonna try and love again
O-oh o-o-o-oh, gonna try and love again
O-oh o-o-o-oh, gonna try and love again
O-oh o-o-o-oh,
O-oh o-o-o-oh,
Sometimes lose, sometimes win
Sometimes you need a friend
O-oh o-o-o-oh, o-oh o-o-oh
Gonna try
Gonna try
Gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try...
