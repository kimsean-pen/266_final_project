Upon by birth came close to death
I wore the night
Dark skies tucked me in
Stranded in the mire of sorrows
The lightless caves in ravines

The power rushed over me
The serpent ran me through
A moment stole my time
A might surged over me

My passage enchanted my the moon
The light with shadows blended
My delusion imprisoned me
My enemy destroyed me

A sword cleaved my skull
An arrow pieced my heart
A sword cleaved my skull
And the wind took my soul

Somebody broke my bones
Somebody tore my flesh
Somebody broke my bones
Somebody crushed my chest

The power rushed over me
The serpent ran me through
A moment stole my time
A might surged over me
