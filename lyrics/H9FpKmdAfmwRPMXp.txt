New York City, N.Y.C.
Pretty mean when it wants to be
Black leather, knee-hole pants
Can't play no high school dance

Fuzz tone, hear 'em go
Hear 'em on the radio
Misfits, twilight zone
R-A-M-O-N-E-S, R-A-M-O-N-E-S, Ramones!

Bad boy rock, bad boy roll
Gabba, gabba, see them go
C.J. now hit the gas
Hear Marky kick some ass

Go Johnny, go, go, go
Go Tommy o-way-o
Misfits, twilight zone
R-A-M-O-N-E-S, R-A-M-O-N-E-S, Ramones!

Bad boy then, bad boy now
Good buddies, mau-mau-mau
Keep it up, rock 'n' roll
Good music save your soul

Dee Dee, he left home
Joey called me on the phone
Misfits, twilight zone
R-A-M-O-N-E-S, R-A-M-O-N-E-S, Ramones!
