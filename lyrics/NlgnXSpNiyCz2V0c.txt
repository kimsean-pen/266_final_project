If I had wings like Noah's dove
I'd fly the river to the one I love
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well.

I've got a man, he is long and tall
She moved her body like a cannon ball.
Oh Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well.

Early this morning, drizzling rain
And in my heart, I felt an aching pain.
Oh Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee thee well.

Now one of these mornings, it won't be long
You'll call my name, and I'll be gone
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well.
If I had wings like Noah's dove
I'd fly the river to the one I love
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well.
