I am hanging in the bathroom at the biggest party of the fall
I could stay right here or disappear
and nobody'd even notice at all
I'm a creeper in a bathroom cause my buddy kinda left me alone
but I'd rather fake pee than stand awkwardly
and pretend to check a text on my phone
Everything felt fine
when I was half of a pair
and through no fault of mine
there's no other half there
Now I'm just
Michael in the bathroom
Michael in the bathroom at a party
Forget how long its been
I'm just Michael in the bathroom
Michael in the bathroom at a party
No, you can't come in
I'm waiting it out 'til it's time to leave
and picking at grout as I softly grieve
I'm just
Michael who you don't know
Michael flying solo
Michael in the bathroom by himself
All by himself
I am hiding,
but he's out there
Just ignoring all our history
Memories get erased
And I'll get replaced
with a newer cooler version of me
And I hear a drunk girl
Singing along to Whitney through the door
"I wanna dance with somebody!"
And my feelings sink
Cause it makes me think
Now there's no one to make fun of drunk girls with anymore
now it's just
Michael in the bathroom
Michael in the bathroom at a party
I half regret the beers
Michael in the bathroom
Michael in the bathroom at a party
As I choke back the tears
I'll wait as long as I need
'Til my face is dry
Or I'll just blame it on weed
Or something in my eye
I'm just Michael
Who you don't know
Michael flyin' solo
Michael in the bathroom by himself
Knock, knock, knock, knock
They're gonna start to shout soon
Knock, knock, knock, knock
Ah hell yeah I'll be out soon
Knock, knock, knock, knock
It sucks he left me here alone
Knock, knock, knock, knock
Here in this teenage battlezone
Clang, clang, clang, clang
I feel the pressure blowing up
Bang, bang, bang, bang
My big mistake was showing up
Splash, splash, splash, splash
I throw some water in my face
And I am in a better place
I go to open up the door
But I can't hear knocking
Anymore
And I can't help but yearn
For a different time
And then I look in the mirror
And the present is clear
And there's no denying
I'm just
... at a party
Is there a sadder sight
Mmmmmmmmm
Michael in the bathroom at a party
This is a heinous night
I wish I stayed at home instead
Watching cable porn
Or wish I offed myself instead
Wish I was never born
I'm just Michael
Who's a loner
So he must be a stoner
Rides a PT Cruiser
God, he's such a loser
Michael flying solo
Who you think that you know
Michael in the bathroom by himself
All by himself
All by himself
When all you know about me
is my name
Awesome party
I'm so glad I came
