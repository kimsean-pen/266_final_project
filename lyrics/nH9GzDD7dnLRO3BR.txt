In my head you're a love song,
in my head you're a love song
and i've been waiting for you so long,
cause in my head you're a love song

sweat on the walls, sweat on my skin,
the kick drum feels like it's breaking in
into my belly and on my spine,
'til my whole body is beating time
she calls attention like a heart attack!
she's at the bar i try to catch
her eye but she don't look my way,
so i play it cool, let the music play

in my head you're a love song,
in my head you're a love song
and i've been waiting for you so long,
what's your name and where you come from?

so beautiful she's a shining light,
it must be fate that she's here tonight
and i've got this song stuck in my head,
and i must've played 'til my fingers bled
a voice inside as i make my move says
"don't even try it, she's too good for you "
always my own worst enemy,
just play it cool, let the music play
just play it cool and let the music play

that perfect moment when your eyes meet mine, slide
time slows down, light and speed unwind
yeah, you got style, you got grace
you're a shining example of the human race
a shining example of the human race

in my head you're a love song,
in my head you're a love song
and i've been waiting for you so long,
what's your name and where you come from?
in my head you're a love song,
and i've been waiting for you so long
you blow my mind, where you come from?
girl you blow my brains, you make me kill me!
