Oh no no no no no
Oh no no no no no

Late night call your phone, yeah
Lately you have no time
You're looking out for you now
Finally prioritize

And I knew you were but
Could say something, and
Sometimes it's better when you yell than when you say nothing
But you're getting tired
Of explaining everything that you need
Oh, what a less stress, more sex, more carefree
Don't wanna hurt no more, not over me, 'cause
I'm not worth it and, this ain't workin' and
Runnin out of words again

And now that you know
You were better than I was ready for, oh
It's not like before, no
Tonight I'm making up for it all
For every time
I let you cry
I have to make your whole body smile

I know you've had to accept, and
Apologies and haven't got it yet
That makes things hard to forget (hard to forget)
I know, hope you aren't telling your friends
That you need, oh, what a less stress, more sex, less of me
Looking for someone more mature than me
Somebody else who can keep better habits and
You're not having it

'Cause now that you know, oh
You were better than I was ready for, oh
It's not like before, yeah
Tonight I'm making up for it all (for it all)
For every time
I let you cry, ooh ooh ooh
I have to make your whole body smile (oh oh)

Please don't say no (please don't say no, no, no)
Please just say yes
Please don't say no
Please just say yes (say it, say it, say it, say it)

'Cause now that you know (now that you know, now that you know)
You were better than I was ready for (yeah you)
It's not like before, no (before)
Tonight I'm making up for it all (making up for it all)
For every time
I let you cry (every time, I let you cry)
I have to make your whole body smile, oh oh oh

(I have to make your whole body)
(I have to make your whole body)
(I have to make your whole body)
(I have to make your whole body)
