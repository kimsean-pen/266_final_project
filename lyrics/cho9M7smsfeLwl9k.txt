I want to raise, a flower in my own garden
I want to watch it grow every day
I want to spend a warm night on the shores of an ocean
All around the world in a dream

I fly away, and leave the gray days behind
I fly away, and surf across the sky
I fly away, and leave the gray days behind
I fly away, and surf across the sky

I can't stop the flow of life, so let's make it part of my mission
I am here to be the queen of change
I am able to choose how to move, so flying is my decision
After years of walking it's still strange

I fly away, and leave the gray days behind
I fly away, and surf across the sky
I fly away, and leave the gray days behind
I fly away, and surf across the sky

I fly away, and leave the gray days behind
I fly away, and surf across the sky
I fly away, and leave the gray days behind
I fly away, and surf across the sky

I fly away, and leave the gray days behind
I fly away, and surf across the sky
I fly away, and leave the gray days behind
I fly
