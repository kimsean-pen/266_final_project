If you start to feel like there's no time to waste, baby try to let go
There's nothin' that strong, can't break your heart
Easy come easy go
And the only, only, only way to find it

Is if you're not diggin' too deep, though it's easier said than done
You've got to feel it in your blood
Play the game like you've already won
And you'll only, only, only own it when you say

Easy come easy go, this won't break my heart, don't you know?
Sometimes high, sometimes low, easy come, easy go, yeah!

You fell in the trap that won't let you win, you try again and again
You let the heat burn your feet
Baby try to understand
That you'll only, only, only own it when you say

Easy come easy go, this won't break my heart, don't you know?
Sometimes high, sometimes low, easy come easy go

So if you start to feel like there's no time to waste, baby try to let go
Oh there's nothin' so strong, can't break your heart
Sometimes high, sometimes low
And you'll only, only, only own it when you say

Easy come easy go, this won't break my heart, don't you know?
I said, sometimes high, sometimes low, easy come easy go
Sometimes high, sometimes low, easy come easy go, let's go!
Easy come easy go
If you're not diggin' too deep
Easy come, easy go
Easy come easy go
Easy come easy go
