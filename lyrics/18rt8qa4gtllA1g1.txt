Sick of being in my head and thinkin about my fate and worried about my health
Wanna waste away my days with a pretty young thing and blow through all my wealth

I made some mistakes, not so good with planning
But I got some skills in easy living
Cut my ties with desperation
And learned to live with a little sensation

Hey!
Just for the day we'll pretend I'm made of money
I'll be your sugar daddy
Hey!
Let's make a fool of ourselves and crash a party
Act like we own the place
Act like we own the place

Swinging back and forth
All my faults are peaking past the surface
Is it worth it to fall back down?

Please make way for the special invented armor
Mental protection if reality is ragin harder
Hello mister mime, hello medicine
I believe denial makes me hella intelligent

We're way too caught up in the race with time
It's getting hard to take it in

We're tryin hard to be the first in line
Just wanna be a kid again
A kid again

Sick of being in my head and thinkin about my fate and worried about my health
Wanna waste away my days with a pretty young thing and blow through all my wealth

Over- Overwhelmed Again
Sing out
Out
Bury it away

Hey!
Just for the day we'll pretend I'm made of money
I'll be your sugar daddy
Hey!
Let's make a fool of ourselves and crash a party
Act like we own the place
Act like we own the place

Killing all the flies
I'm not done swinging back and forth yet
Forgive me for what I will do

Please make way for the special invented armor
Mental protection if reality is ragin harder
Hello mister mime, hello medicine
I believe denial makes me hella intelligent

I know we trust each other
Don't fail the litmus
We all need partners for the pain of existence
My bedroom chemistry set ended up on your Pinterest
Fledging allegiance to a few common interest

Claw my way to the top of the centipede
The sum of its parts is prescribing me symmetry
Every bone picked and decision was orchestrated
Cut the head off and the legs'll call the action complacent
