EQUATORS

Im a sonic equator
A soulmate for later
A mad generator
A sinners prayer

And youll beg me for mercy
You cant really you hurt me
Can I try and turn me
But it ill happen again

Still ill go home, home alone
I go home, home alone

Im smooth a sailer
great as waiter
would never fail her
so safe and warm

Just tryin to reach out
Cant help but feel doubt
Try and turn me
But it ill happen again

still Ill go home, home alone
I go home, home alone

Im a sonic equator
A soulmate for later
A mad generator
A sinners prayer

And youll beg me for mercy
You cant really you hurt me
Can I try and turn me
But it ill happen again

still Ill go home, home alone
I go home, home alone
still ill go home, home alone
I go home, home alone

Stuck outside
With buried hands
You slowly drove, away

Ive tried so hard
so many times
There is no home for me
