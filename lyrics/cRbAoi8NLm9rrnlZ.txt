This is happiness, to be everything at once.
Be unblinded, be unlearned, be unbridled and unburned.

Heavy on our heels, the rocky ground we leave behind.
Tassels streaming from our necks, we cast a wake amidst the wind.
We're the roamers to the road, barebacked, spirit and in mind.
Oh, to be free like this.

This is happiness, to be everything at once.
Be unblinded, be unlearned, be unbridled and unburned.
This is happiness. I'm fearless and I'm free,
With the open road and the world beneath my feet.

With splinters in our teeth, we're driven from our parallels,
Our path a prison, bound to walk where countless feet already fell.
But there's a wildness in our heart, that we've forgotten in our march,
All to be free like this.

This is happiness, to be everything at once.
Be unblinded, be unlearned, be unbridled and unburned.
This is happiness. I'm fearless and I'm free,
With the open road and the world beneath my feet.

We're branded and we're burdened from the moment we are born.
We're domestic and we're discontent, and we're grinding our gums raw.
Forget your feet and where they fall,
Lift your head and carry on.

No fear, just faith, no bit, just break the path and let it lead you.
Unknown, unblind, run free, run wild and leave behind what holds you down.

Heavy on our heels, the rocky ground we leave behind.

This is happiness, to be everything at once.
Be unblinded, be unlearned, be unbridled and unburned.
This is happiness. I'm fearless and I'm free,
With the open road and the world beneath my feet.

Oh, to be free like this.
