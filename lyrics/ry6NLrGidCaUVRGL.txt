Give me the right time
I love it
It is not the same as inside
I feel our love
Maybe not for long cause when you work it then it's wrong
Until i'm talking in your voice
Right close to you feeling so nice
It's a [?] time
Did I say something wrong
Do I do it every time

So baby give up on it
I don't want you anymore
Yeah baby give up on it
I just don't feel and it's not something i could do
Baby give up on it
Cause I don't need it anymore
Yeah baby give up on it
I just don't feel and it's not something i could do

For many it's no-one
It's [?]
Everywhere you go I feel like no-one
And I don't feel it
Because that pressure I need it
I keep talking, more talking
Barely up and I'm back at sharking I want to if you do
Doesn't matter what I say to you tomorrow

So baby give up on it
I don't want you anymore
Yeah baby give up on it
I just don't feel and it's not something i could do
Baby give up on it
Cause I don't need it anymore
Yeah baby give up on it
I just don't feel and it's not something i could do
