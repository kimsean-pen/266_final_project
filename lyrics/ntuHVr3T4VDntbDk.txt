Oh January keep a secret for me
Only beside, who knows what I've seen
If you ask me she was never there
They ask how is it, I carry you everywhere
Everywhere

Heavy hands, she moved
Slowly, steadily
Pale legs
Straddling the seat
I bought a floating savior
What does country mean?
It was a proper Polish welcome
A proper Polish welcome

Shift off the table, a slip of the tongue
Silence and then a muffled Oh My God
I was the first to laugh, she followed suit
Rocking and hold, we came two by two
We came two by two

Heavy hands, she moved
Slowly, steadily
Pale legs
Straddling the seat
I bought a floating savior
What does language mean?
It was a proper Polish welcome
A proper Polish welcome

I wish I was the sea
I wish I was the sea
She was straddling the sea
I wish I was the sea

Heavy hands, she moves
Slowly, steadily
Pale legs
Straddling the seat
I bought a floating savior
What does language mean?
It was a proper Polish welcome
A proper Polish welcome
