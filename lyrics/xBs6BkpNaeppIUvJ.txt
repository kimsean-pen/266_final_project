Absolutely nothing's changed
This is my heart talking
It's time to face reality
This spell I'm under can't last much longer
Any fool can see
You come here with your promises
But I remember all the lies
I bought the laughter happy ever after
How could I be so blind so blind
Chorus
'cause absolutely nothing's changed
You play with my emotions
I'll live to fight another day
I m bruised but I ain t broken I ain't broken

Now you say you're sorry
For everything you put me through
You wanna make up I just gotta wake up
It's the same old you
The same old you

Chorus
'cause absolutely nothing's changed
You play with my emotions
I'll live to fight another day
I'm bruised but I ain't broken ain't broken

Ooh I've been dreaming but it's over now bad dreams are over now
I'm gonna rise up rise above all the troubles and tears I'm down but I ain't out
Play with my emotions I maybe bruised I ain't broken
'cause absolutely nothing's changed
At last my eyes are open
I'm gonna live to fight another day
I maybe bruised but I ain t broken ain't broken
'cause absolutely nothing's changed
Absolutely nothing
I'll live to fight another day
I maybe bruised but I ain t broken
'cause absolutely nothing's changed
Abolutely nothing
I'm gonna live to fight another day I maybe bruised but I ain t broken
'cause absolutely nothing's changed
