This will be for now and for ever the diverging of our paths...

Now that this night has turned into a dawn
I step aside from this path of grieving
Left with all these things I never had chance to say
Words wishful, filled with caring

You must stop your bleeding
Before you run yourself dry
You must let go of your wound
Because love it is crying for is gone

Now that this night has turned into a dawn
I give up this life I have been leading
Left with all these things I never meant to say
Words deceitful, double-dealing

As every breaking day fades away before the dusk
So does hate pause and resentment turn to reason
You've carried enough this burden meant only for me to bear
Now it's your time to straighten up, time for you to walk tall
Alone...
