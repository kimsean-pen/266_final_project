Outside gets inside
Ooh, through her skin
I've been out before
But this time it? s much safer in
Last night in the sky
Ooh, such a bright light
My radar send me danger
But my instincts tell me to keep
Breathing
(Out, in, out, in, out, in)

Breathing, breathing my mother in
(Out, in, out, in, out, in)
Breathing my beloved in
(Out, in, out, in, out, in)
Breathing, breathing her nicotine
(Out, in, out, in, out, in)
Breathing, breathing the fall

(Out, in, out, in, out, in)

Out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in
(Out, in, out, in, out, in)
We've lost our chance
We? re the first and last, ooh
After the blast, chips of plutonium
Are twinkling in every lung
I love my beloved, ooh

All and everywhere
Only the fools blew it

You and me knew, life itself is
Breathing
(Out, in, out, in, out, in)
Breathing, breathing my mother in
(Out, in, out, in, out, in)

Breathing my beloved in
(Out, in, out, in, out, in)
Breathing, breathing her nicotine

(Out, in, out, in, out, in)
Breathing, breathing the fall
(Out, in, out, in, out, in)
Out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in
Out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in
Out, out, out, out
{In point of fact, it is possible to tell the
Difference between a small nuclear explosion and
A large one by a very simple method the calling
Card of a nuclear bomb is the blinding flash that}
{Is far more dazzling than any light on earth brighter
Even than the sun itself and it is by the duration
Of this flash that we are able to determine the size of the weapon
(What are we going to do without?)}

{After the flash a fireball can be seen to rise
Sucking up under it the debris, dust and living things
Around the area of the explosion
And as this ascends, it soon becomes recognizable

As the familiar mushroom cloud}
{As a demonstration of the flash
Duration test let? s try and count the
Number of seconds for the flash emitted by a very
Small bomb then a more substantial, medium sized
Bomb and finally, one of our very powerful high yield bombs}
What are we going to do without?
(Ooh, please)
What are we going to do without?
(Oh, let me breathe)
What are we going to do without?
(Ooh, quick, breathe in deep)
We are all going to die without
(Oh, leave me something to breathe)
What are we going to do without?
(Oh, leave me something to breathe)
We are all going to die without
(Oh God, please leave us something to breathe)
What are we going to do without?
(Oh, life is)
