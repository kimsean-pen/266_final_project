The way that the world
Crushes down on my shoulders
I'm a big girl now
But I don't feel much older

And I think it's the end,
You place on mine all of the time
I wish that I had a friend
Who'll just tell me I'm fine
Tell me I'm fine
It's not that bad
And I have no reason to be sad
That I'll find a way
Almost everyday this day with

When will I change It's not that I want more
It's she said I want what I before
This feelings they are the cleaning
I just don't really got the meaning
Got the meaning
It's not that bad, I have no reason to be sad
That I'll find a way, almost every day this day with

When will I change Visions of hope, visions of love
More than before I want them become x4
