He called me a dyke
I called him an ambulance
I can make you famous too
But you tremble at the thought of that

I've seen more spine in jellyfish
That's in the vertebrae
Google that
I've been in the shadows long enough
I got nothing to lose
So I'm playing rough
So humdrum, so dumb
You picked a fight
With the wrong one
You brought a butter knife
To a tank fight
I'll put you on blast
And fucked your wife
Weapon system's activated
Your ego's been deflated
Oh so dumb you need a ventilator
She seems so sweet
I had to taste her
Let's get one thing straight
I'm not
Sex is an art
I'm a biscard
Love is love
It can't be stopped
So go fuck yourself Cause it's all you got
Go fuck yourself Cause it's all you got

Coming out, swinging

I am a prior
To every religion
It isn't a choice
But it is a decision
Come out of the closet
Break out of the prison
Love who you are
Let no one inhibit
Don't get in your way
Or make a mistake
Of living in fear
For the rest of your days
So tighten your fists
And firmly say
To follow the phrase

He called me a dyke
I called him an ambulance
I can make you famous too
But you tremble at the thought of that

He called me a dyke
I called him an ambulance
I can make you famous too
But you tremble at the thought of that

So go fuck yourself
Cause it's all you got

Last but not least
Let me finish the story
How I met a girl
And we fucked till the morning
She found religion in every position
Screaming "OH GOD" and singing in hymnals
Day for the day
Thus she claimed
But that's what these chicks always say
She's calling my home, texting my phone
Sending me snaps and begging for more
So say what you say
Do what you do
But I'll always get
More pussy than you
I'll always get
More pussy than you
