I had a couple beers
with one of my friends,
told him just how
our story ends.
I did all I could
to try to make it work,
but you drug my heart through the Alabama dirt.
I've been at your house, climbing them walls,
checking that calendar, x-ing days off,
hit another bar,
call another friend,
throw a few down tell the story again.
Hey hey what can I say,
I could just lie and say it's all okay.
Oohh oohh,
what can I do,
I'm going through hell getting over you.
But it don't hurt,
it don't hurt like it used to,
no it don't hurt,
it don't hurt like it used to.
We're finally getting out,
back into the world,
life is good,
I met me a girl,
she's got a beautiful heart, eyes of blue,
I don't hardly ever think about you.
Hey hey, what can I say?
I could just lie and say it's all okay,
Oohh oohh, what can I do?
Been going through hell getting over you.
But it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to.
No it don't hurt,
it don't hurt like it used to.
Sometimes I find
peace of mind in a bottle of wine,
sometimes,
I break down and cry.
Hey hey, what can I say?
I could just lie and say it's all okay,
Oohh oohh what can I do?
Been going through hell getting over you.
Hey hey, what can I say?
I could just lie and say it's all okay.
Oohh ooh, what can I do?
Been going through hell getting over you.
But it don't hurt,
it don't hurt like it used to.
No, It don't hurt,
it don't hurt like it used to.
Ooh it don't hurt,
it don't hurt like it used to.
It don't hurt,
it don't hurt like it used to.
