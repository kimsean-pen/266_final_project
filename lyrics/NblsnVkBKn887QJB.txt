It's a crime, it's a crime
It's a shame, it's a crime

I'm climbing the walls
Losing my mind
It's all your fault

I'm breaking the rules
Don't really care if I get caught
Can't you tell that I'm in love love love
Can't get enough of you
Need you night and day

When you're not around I'm tested
I could get arrested
Carrying on this way

I'm going crazy here by myself
I want you and no one else
Sending out a signal of distress
I confess, I'm obsessed

uh oh uh uh oh oh
It's a crime, it's a shame
Holding your love for me
uh oh uh uh oh oh
It's a crime, it's a shame
It's a crime

Oh, I'm obsessed~

No telling what I might do tonight
Waiting for you

I'm right on the edge
I'm crossing the line
Coming in blue

Can't you tell that I'm in love love love
Can't get enough of you
Need you night and day

When you're not around I'm tested
I could get arrested
Carrying on this way

I'm going crazy here by myself
I want you and no one else
Sending out a signal of distress
I confess, I'm obsessed

uh oh uh uh oh oh
It's a crime, it's a shame
Holding your love for me
uh oh uh uh oh oh
It's a crime, it's a shame
It's a crime

Got me going crazy
The way I want you baby
Can't even try to hide it
Don't even wanna fight it
I'm obsessed with you tonight
I'm obsessed with you tonight

I'm going crazy here by myself
I want you and no one else
Sending out a signal of distress
I confess, I'm obsessed

uh oh uh uh oh oh
uh oh uh uh oh oh~
