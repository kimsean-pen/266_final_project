Cold house, white light
Yellow lamps and black in the skies
Full holes in deep brown eyes
I sing you a song that I think you'll like
And we walk to places we always go
A million faces, I don't know
I say the words it always hopes that our heart are racing
(Even though)

I know what you told me
I know that it's all over and
I know I can't keep calling
Every time I run yeah
I keep on falling

I know what you told me
I know that it's all over and
I know I can't keep calling
Every time I run yeah
I keep on falling (on you)

On the way I stand
On the way I sway
The way your hair curls in the rain
The little lines that write on your face
On the winter nights, you come and stay
Oh the way you hit me when you wanna fight
The way I yawn, the way I cry
The way I love rose with the ties
But we know it won't make up every time

I know what you told me
I know that it's all over and
I know I can't keep calling
Every time I run yeah
I keep on falling

I know what you told me
I know that it's all over and
I know I can't keep calling
Every time I run yeah
I keep on falling (on you)

Oh you bring me all the things I need
I follow the rain to the rolling sea
I love you baby all the things I lay

I know what you told me
I know that it's all over and
I know I can't keep calling
Just every time I run
I keep on falling

I know what you told me
I know that it's all over and
I know I can't keep calling
Just every time I run
I keep on falling

And I know what you told me
I know that it's all over and
I know I can't keep calling
Every time I run yeah
I keep on falling

And I know what you told me
And I know that it's all over and
I know I can't keep calling
Every time I run yeah
I keep on falling (on you)
