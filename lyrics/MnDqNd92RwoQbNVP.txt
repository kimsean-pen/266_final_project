Standing on my own
It didn't mean that much to me
I thought I had it all
I didn't see the mystery

I stood the test of time
And took the step to find

I spoke a million words
They didn't mean that much to me
They rang around my head
Like empty tuneless harmonies
Love's great adventure's mine

Lying side by side
It didn't mean that much to me
I started to enjoy
The poetry and symphonies

I took it in my stride
I hailed the day I tried

A fool who couldn't see
It didn't mean that much to me
I couldn't understand
That's how the game is meant to be
Love's great adventure's mine

Love's great adventure, oh

Standing on my own
It didn't mean that much to me
I thought I had it all
I didn't see the mystery

I stood the test of time
I took the step to find
Love's great adventure's mine
