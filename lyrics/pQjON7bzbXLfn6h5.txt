So you gotta go
Need to be alone
I thought you were my forever home
You've changed
Every lock and password
So we didn't fit
Now i'm over it
I guess love had me a little bit deranged
When you free a caged bird
She's going to fly
Into the sky

I'm so gone never coming back
Moving on I am over that
And I hate to see you dressed in black
But you never did love anyone but yourself
You in front of me
With your list of things I'll never be
I was yours ha its funny see
How you lost me
Coz it was all about you
It was all about you ooo
It was all about you
You and yourself

All your misery
Faded history
Look real hard to find a piece of me
You won't
I was just your caged bird
Too scared to fly
But I'm flying tonight

I'm so gone never coming back
Moving on I am over that
And I hate to see you dressed in black
But you never did love anyone but yourself
You in front of me
With your list of things I'll never be
I was yours ha its funny see
How you lost me
Coz it was all about you
It was all about you ooo
It was all about you
You and yourself

You are what's on your mind
You take up all your time
You are the first in line

When you free a caged bird
She's going to fly
Into the sky

I'm so gone never coming back
Moving on I am over that
And I hate to see you dressed in black
But you never did love anyone but yourself
You in front of me
With your list of things I'll never be
I was yours ha its funny see
How you lost me
Coz it was all about you
It was all about you ooo
It was all about you
You and yourself
