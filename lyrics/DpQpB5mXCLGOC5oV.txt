Don't make me choose
Between my left hand and my right
Don't make me choose
Between my love and my life
Either way I lose
And that just ain't right
Don't make me...
If you really love me
You would never judge me
I would never do that to you
Don't make me...

Whenever I can, I'll be there
You've got a man who knows exactly what you need
And I got a plan, don't be scared
I know, I know right now it's hard to see

Trust me
I can compartmentalize
Don't wanna throw this balance
I'm in for the ride but

Don't make me choose
Between my left hand and my right
Don't make me choose
Between my love and my life
Either way I lose
And that just ain't right
Don't make me...
If you really love me
You would never judge me
I would never do that to you
Don't make me...

If you wanna talk, I'll listen
I'll be here on the line until you fall asleep
Gimme your time, gimme permission
To make it work, to put your mind at ease

I need you to trust me
I can compartmentalize
Don't want to throw this balance
I'm in for the ride but

Don't make me choose
Between my left hand and my right
Don't make me choose
Between my love and my life
Either way I lose
And that just ain't right
Don't make me...
If you really love me
You would never judge me
I would never do that to you
Don't make me choose

Cause I lose every time you push at me like this
So I'll find a way to show you these two words can more than co-exist

Don't make me choose
Between my left hand and my right
Don't make me choose
Between my love and my life
Either way I lose
And that just ain't right
Don't make me...
If you really love me
You would never judge me
I would never do that to you
Don't make me choose

Don't make me choose
Don't make me choose
If you really love me
You would never judge me
I would never do that to you
Don't make me...
