You can write the next line, baby you've been wasting time
We can make our bodies rhyme, our lives intertwine
And if you've gone cold, you don't let it show
There's a deeper place that we can both go
You tell me that I'm wide eyed, baby you're just being kind
Never going outside, we are working overtime
Yeah, I do like when I'm staying the night
With the temperature just right
We could write another duet
Or instead babe, we could just do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Let's do something that we might regret
Take your guard down, I can see through it
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
You call me by my real name, I will keep you entertained
Everybody speculate, we've got things to recreate
Can we do this without all of the lights? (They're awfully bright)
With the temperature just right
We could write another duet
Or instead babe, we could just do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Let's do something that we might regret
Take your guard down, I can see through it
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
And the road that I dream on
Is the road we're already on
And it feels like we are already strong
So I won't have to wait long
For a while now, we've been getting on
And it feels like if we could get it on
You'd be more than just someone
We could move things along
We could write another duet
Or instead babe, we could just do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Let's do something that we might regret
Take your guard down, I can see through it
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
We could write another duet
Or instead babe, we could just do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Let's do something that we might regret
Take your guard down, I can see through it
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
