Coming down fast like a waterfall
Pushed over until I can't stand no more
Talking shit smoking to quit we stayed up late
'till four fuck it I could be someone like I was before
To you

And for the first time
I'll say that I might
I cannot breathe out
Without exerting doubt
And I don't know what's considered to be right or what's regretful
It's hard
To say you'd risk it all

Coming down fast we don't have to fall
Take two, reused leaves you longing more
Pushed apart turned into two she could increase your
score I can't ever give it up though I want her more
It's cool
And for the first time
I'll say that I might
I cannot breathe out
Without exerting doubt
And I don't know what's considered to be right or what's regretful
It's hard
To say you'd risk it all

I don't know what to feel am I not OK?
Maybe that's why, that's why you're this way
I found a girl and I don't know what to say
Maybe she won't have to go away

I don't know what to feel am I not OK?
Maybe that's why, that's why you're this way
I found a girl and I don't know what to say
Maybe she don't ever have to go away
