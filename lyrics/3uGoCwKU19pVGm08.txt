I cannot remember
Anything you say
When the streets are talking
Yeah, they call my name
And I walk a little further
I could go all day
And the trees are reaching
Pointing out the way

I got all muddled up and journeyed to the edge of town
And then the road cracked open
Sucked me in, then I went down
Now standing face to face
With the king of the underground
Some things just don't add up
I'm upside down
I'm inside out

I came a little closer
To the truth that day
I heard it's call
In the alleyway
And the one resounding answer
That I could take
Is that I don't know nothing
And I got no way

I got all muddled up and journeyed to the edge of town
And then the road cracked open
Sucked me in, and I went down
Now standing face to face
With the king of the underground
Some things just don't add up
I'm upside down
I'm inside out

I got all muddled up and journeyed to the end of town
And then the road cracked open
Sucked me in, and I went down
Now standing face to face
With the king of the underground
Some things just don't add up
I'm upside down
I'm inside out

And I got something on my mind
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
