I felt insane on Lover's Lane
Wanted a cry on my daily drive
To the Park of Roses
I opposed every petal picking nice guy in the grass
I felt absurd as a lovebird
Wanted to die on my morning fly
To your apartment window
Where I would show my muscle and my melody off
But no on likes a chatterbox

I cannot win, I cannot win
I cannot win, win affection
Win affection

I started parting my hair like his, that's what I did
To subconsciously draw your attention
To the arbitrary aspect of attraction
And when at my teenage worst what I do
Is think of all the people in the world that aren't you
Oh, there's plenty, I usually only count to 20
Less dog with tail between its legs
More like my guts are on display
Food out on a tray, but I can't eat it
Doesn't that sound defeated

I cannot win, I cannot win
I cannot win, win affection
Win affection, win affection

I felt insane on Lover's Lane
