So forget about your day and let this record float you away
As your mind is winding, finding cause to be easy
And now you've got your space and the room filled up with haze
As you travel on I'll watch you pass me
by, but right now you got to keep rollin
Tire Eyes
And keep rockin
Tire Eyes

There ain't no shame in claiming time, no need to explain it
The sour powder is here to set you free
Just sit back and smile let it last for awhile
Let your mind caress your thoughts that rest inside
And roll them tire eyes

Tire eyes
Keep rolling tire eyes, baby keep rocking those tire eyes

Tire eyes
Tire eyes
