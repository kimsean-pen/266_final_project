Oooooh ooh ooh
Take a look around the room
Love comes wearing disguises.
How to go about and choose?
Break it down by shapes and sizes.
I'm a man who's got very specific taste.

You-you-you're just my type
Oh, you got a pulse and you are breathing
You-you-you're just my type
Ooh, I think it's time that we get leaving
You-you-you're just my type
Oooooh ooh ooh

When there's loving in the air
Don't fight it, just keep breathing.
I can't help myself but stare
Double check for double meanings.
I'm a man who's got very specific taste.

You-you-you're just my type
Oh, you got a pulse and you are breathing
You-you-you're just my type
Ooh, i think its time that we get leaving
You-you-you're just my type
Oooh ooh.

Oooooh ooh ooh
You-you-you're just my type
Oh, you got a pulse and you are breathing
You-you-you're just my type
Ooh, I think it's time that we get leaving
You-you-you're just my type
Oooooh ooh ooh
