Hmm Jason DeRulo
Oh Pixie

Oh no usually I'm always late
Tonight I'm gonna be on time
I'm coming home straight after work

So you can have me all to yourself
We'll be alone just me and you
Where no one interrupts what we do
You say where are you going?

In the night I'm awake
'Cause my body's not to close to you
But you don't call me
Out of respect you can bet that you'll be waiting home for me yeah

I'm out for the whole day
Try'na do it my way
Monday to Friday

Gotta make my baby understand
I do this for you boy, 'cause you deserve the time
I'm coming home straight after work
So you can have me all to yourself

We'll be alone just me and you

Where no one interrupts what we do
I'm coming home straight after work
So you can have me under your spell

All night, all day
So you can have me all to yourself

I'm coming home...
You're always complaining
In the morn' when I wake from my sleep

Brush my teeth and leave
And now that I'm famous
It's kinda hard making time for the one that means most to me yeah
I'm out for the whole day

Try'na do it my way
Monday to Friday
Gotta make my baby understand
I do it for you girl

'Cause you deserve the time
I'm coming home straight after work
So you can have me all to yourself
We'll be alone just me and you
Where no one interrupts what we do

I'm coming home straight after work
So you can have me under your spell
All night, all day
So you can have me all to yourself

When I'm away I miss my baby
Yeah I'm gone with half my heart

God knows I must be crazy
For loving from afar

But tonight it's gonna be different
'Cause I'm coming home
I'm coming home straight after work
So you can have me all to yourself
We'll be alone just me and you
Where no one interrupts what we do
I'm coming home straight after work
So you can have me under your spell
All night, all day
So you can have me all to yourself
I'm coming home straight after work
So you can have me all to yourself
We'll be alone just me and you
Where no one interrupts what we do
I'm coming home straight after work
So you can have me under your spell
All night, all day
So you can have me all to yourself
Have me all to yourself, all to yourself
