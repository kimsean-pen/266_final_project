QUE SERA, SERA
Doris Day

It was written by Jay Livingston
and Ray Evans for Alfred Hitchcock's
1956 re-make of his 1934 film
"The Man Who Knew Too Much" starring
Doris Day and

James Stewart.

When I was just a little girl,
I asked my mother, "What will I be?"
Will I be pretty?

Will I be rich?
Here's what she said to me:

"Que sera, sera,
Whatever will be, will be;

The future's not ours to see.
Que sera, sera,
What will be, will be
When I grew up and fell in love.
I asked my sweetheart, "What lies ahead?

Will we have rainbows
Day after day?"
Here's what my sweetheart said:
"Que sera, sera,
Whatever will be, will be;

The future's not ours to see.
Que sera, sera,
What will be, will be."
Now I have Children of my own.
They ask their mother, "What will I be?"

Will I be handsome?
Will I be rich?"
I tell them tenderly:
"Que sera, sera,
Whatever will be, will be;
The future's not ours to see.
Que sera, sera,
What will be, will be.
Que Sera, Sera!"
