The age of the old vision has passed away,
The birth of a new way
This is confrontation!

Struggle and pain of this life remains (Through the suffering we fight)
No end in sight (No end in sight)
The strength within our souls sustains (Until we see the light)
This determination, it feeds this fight (No end in sight)

No end in sight!

Seeing the world through hardened eyes,
A vision of hopelessness
Reaching for the truth amongst the lies

Burn down your deception (Burn down!)
There lies the way of the weak (The weak!)
Rise again conquering
Born from destruction

Through the suffering we fight, no end in sight
Until we see the light, no end in sight

Yeah!

Thrown into the endless flames
In a world of disarray
No longer numb to the pain,
Knowing that we fight to the grave
Wash away the fear of our ignorance,
I feel this bleeding

Through the suffering we fight, no end in sight
Until we see the light, no end in sight

They will see it in our eyes
Determined to leave behind our legacy,
Burned deep into our flesh to remind us
The memories and scars that define us,
We may suffer, but nothing will break our spirit

Seeing the world through opened eyes,
Separate from the ways of the world
Blinded to the suffering, the suffering

Through the suffering we fight, no end in sight
Until we see the light, there's no end in sight
