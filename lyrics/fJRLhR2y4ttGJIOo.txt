God of Heaven
Hear my cries of anguish
I'm in pain

I've suffered a thousand deaths
But I live on in vain

Death would greet with eternal sleep
My soul would come to peace

My life had ceased
The time was comed
Can no one hear my plead?

Lowered down in the moisty ground
Into the dark and cold

My heart's beat the only sound
Pain tears my limbs and soul

I scream for mercy
Hear my cries
Oh, Lord don't abandon me

I'm so tired
Grant me the eternal sleep

I tear at the lid
I suffer
In a cold and nameless grave

If Hell is what awaits me
I feel no fright

Buried and forgotten
In a cold and nameless grave
If there's a God in Heaven
Hear my call from the grave
Tear the lid I suffer
In a cold and nameless grave
If Hell is what awaits me
I feel no fright
Buried and forgotten
In a cold and nameless grave
If there's a God in Heaven
Hear my call from the grave
