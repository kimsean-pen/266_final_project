In 1966 i found my love
in 1967 i had all there was
and as my time went by i was satisfied
until that situation took me by surprise
now there's two trains runnin' - on that line
one train's me, and the other's a friend of mine
you know it would be all right, be just fine
if the woman took one train, and left the other behind

illusion it is just the same conclusion
i don't know how to play the game
of what it is or how it's going to be
when one train is my friend and the other train is me

easy, i say easy, i can't push or shove her
so i guess i really care
now i'm not one to hide my love behind a lock and key
but if things keep going the way they are there's no place left for me

there's two trains runnin' - on that line
one train's me, and the other's a friend of mine
you know it would be all right, be just fine
if the woman took one train, and left the other behind

two trains, two trains, two trains, two trains
