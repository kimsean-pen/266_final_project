Friday night and I just got paid
I'm out looking for some trouble
I know I'm about to spend it all
You're not looking for a lover

But I got eyes on you baby,
Don't see no one else
The way you move, way you move,
I can't help myself
Come on over here,
Fooling on me one more time
The way you shake it baby,
Shake it baby,
Makes me feel alright

You got me feeling
Like a million bucks
Makes me wanna fall in love
Baby when you pull it on me
You got me feeling
Like a million bucks
Makes me wanna fall in love
Baby when you pull it on me
Got me thinking
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one girl
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one girl
You got me feeling like a million bucks
Makes me wanna fall in love
Baby when you pull it on me (on me)

Friday night and she just got paid
She done got herself in trouble
And I done went and spend it all
But she already had a lover

But I got eyes on you baby,
Don't see no one else
The way you move,
Way you move, I can't help myself
Come on over here,
Fooling on me one more time
The way you shake it baby,
Shake it baby, makes me feel alright

You got me feeling like a million bucks
Makes me wanna fall in love
Baby when you pull it on me
You got me feeling like a million bucks
Makes me wanna fall in love
Baby when you pull it on me
Got me thinking
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one girl
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one girl
You got me feeling like a million bucks
Makes me wanna fall in love
Baby when you pull it on me
(Remember that)

You got me feeling
Like a million bucks
Makes me wanna fall in love
Baby when you pull it on me
You got me feeling
Like a million bucks
Makes me wanna fall in love
Baby when you pull it on me
Got me thinking
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one girl
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one girl
You got me feeling like a million bucks
Makes me wanna fall in love
Baby when you pull it on me
(Remember that)
