I got handed an Ayn Rand sandwich
Straight from a can it tasted so bland
I asked a lass to pass me a glass
Of Engel's Conditions of the Working Class

Right away they dragged me to the committee
To explain my un-American activity
They're gonna see they made a mistake
If they'd only let me play my mixtape

I'm not partial to the martial
Or the plutocrats in their beaver hats
And the fascists have the outfits
But I don't care for the outfits
What I care about is music
And the communists have the music

I hear a melody
And just as suddenly
I know who I'm
Supposed to be

I don't need a rationale
To sing the Internationale
I only need to plug in the headphone jack
So I can listen to my backing track

I'm not jealous of the zealous
Or anarchics with guitar picks
And the fascists have their outfits
But I don't care for the outfits
What I care about is music
And the communists have the music
Yes the communists have the music
Oh the communists have the music

I hear a melody
And just as suddenly
I know who I'm
Supposed to be

I'm not partial to the martial
Or the plutocrats in their beaver hats
And the fascists have the outfits
But I don't care for the outfits
What I care about is music
And the communists have the music
