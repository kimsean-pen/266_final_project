Heavy hung the canopy of blue
Shade my eyes and I can see you
White is the light that shines
Through the dress that you wore
She lay in the shadow of the wave
Hazy were the visions of her playing
Sunlight on her eyes but
Moonshine beat her blind everytime
Green is the colour of her kind
Quickness of the eye deceives the mind
Envy is the bond between the
Hopefull and the damned
