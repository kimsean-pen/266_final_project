Open up wide, swallow down deep
No spoonful of sugar could make it sweet
The cancer inside, stealing my sleep
Night after night, it keeps haunting me

The secrets I keep are tearing me up inside
I try to hide them, and I wonder why
I wonder why I'm still running
When I know there's no escaping

Come undone, surrender is stronger
I don't need to be the hero tonight
We all want love, we all want honor
Nobody wants to pay the asking price

Fall on my knees, fall on my pride
I'm tripping over all the times I've lied
I'm asking please, but I can see in your eyes
You don't need tears for alibis

It's true what they say, love must be blind
It's why You're still standing by this sinner's side
You're still by my side
When all the things I've done have left You bleeding

Come undone, surrender is stronger
I don't need to be the hero tonight
We all want love, we all want honor
Nobody wants to pay the asking price

I don't think I can drive it home tonight
I don't think I wanna be alone tonight

Come undone, surrender is stronger
I don't need to be the hero tonight
We all want love, we all want honor
Nobody wants to pay the asking price

Come undone, surrender is stronger
I don't need to be the hero tonight
We all want love, we all want honor
Nobody wants to pay the asking price

Come undone, surrender is stronger
I don't need to be the hero tonight
We all want love, we all want honor
Nobody wants to pay the asking price
Come undone, surrender is stronger
I don't need to be the hero tonight
We all want love, we all want honor
Nobody wants to pay the asking price
Come undone, surrender is stronger
I don't need to be the hero tonight
We all want love, we all want honor
Nobody wants to pay the asking price
