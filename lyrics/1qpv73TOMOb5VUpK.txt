Gimme that canvas let me paint some shit
Pass me some poison let me take a hit
I'm just embarrassed and comfortably numb
But failure is painful and lying is fun
Dress code, cocktails, looking so fancy
We feel like we're a little bit classy
Cheers to the fact that we're not dead
Swimming with the sharks, but we're still not dead yet

Psycho I go
Right to buy those
Optimistic, magic fix it pills
I'm so right though
That's my life bro
Underwater
Coughing with my gills

Don't let this moment go to waste you don't know when the feeling could happen again

Don't let this moment go to waste you don't know when the feeling could happen again

Touch me, taste me, tell me I'm not fading
Tell me that I look just like a man
Cause lately baby I've been going crazy
Trying not to be an embarrassment

Touch me, taste me, tell me I'm not fading
Tell me that I look just like a man
Cause lately baby I've been going crazy
Trying not to be an embarrassment

I'll go in cryo and return to life ho
And make a Bisque, some tomato basil shit
Riding a rhino pico de gallo
Roosters beak, I'll sleep when I leap that jeep

Don't close your eyes tonight
Perfect melodies are hard to find
I got a feeling we could touch the sky
Let's live in this delusion that we don't live in perpetual confusion and there's meaning to our lives

Hades arc
Golden tarp
Black hole
Slack is for
Slack is for cutting me more
Mountain
Fountain
Shrieking
Preaching
Slack is for
Slack is for cutting me
Slack is for cutting me more

For every little bit of sunshine I call freedom
White 21 is the maximum fun
