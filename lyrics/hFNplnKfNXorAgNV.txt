There are just too many times that people have tried to look inside of me
Wondering what I think of you and I protect you out of courtesy
Too many times that I've held on what I needed to push away
Afraid to say what was on my mind afraid to say what I need to say

Too many things that you said about me when I'm not around
You think having the upper hand means you gotta keep putting me down
But I've had too many standoffs with you it's about
As much as I can stand so I'm waiting until the upper hand is mine

(One minute you're on top)
Next you're not watch you drop
(Making your heart stop)
Just before you hit the floor
(One minute you're on top)
Next you're not missed a shot
(Making you're heart stop)
You think you've won and then it's all gone

So many people like me put so much trust in all your lies
So concerned with what you think to just say what we feel inside
So many people like me walk on eggshells all day long
All I know is that all I want is to feel like I'm not stepped on

There are so many things you say that make me feel you crossed the line
What goes up will surely fall and I'm counting down the time
'Cause I've had so many standoffs with you it's about
As much as I can stand so I'm waiting until the upper hand is mine

(One minute you're on top)
Next you're not watch you drop
(Making your heart stop)
Just before you hit the floor
(One minute you're on top)
Next you're not missed a shot
(Making you're heart stop)
You think you've won and then it's all gone

And then it's all gone
And then it's all gone
And then it's all gone
Now it's all gone

I know I'll never trust a single thing you say
You knew your lies would divide us but you lied anyway
And all the lies have got you floating up above us all
But what goes up has got to fall

(One minute you're on top)
Next you're not watch you drop
(Making your heart stop)
Just before you hit the floor
(One minute you're on top)
Next you're not missed a shot
(Making you're heart stop)
You think you've won and then it's all gone

And then it's all gone
And then it's all gone
And then it's all gone
Now it's all gone
