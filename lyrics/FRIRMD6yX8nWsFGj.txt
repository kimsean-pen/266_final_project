Drop every pretense
Drown every sense you own
For the girl that you love

Girl you loathe
Insistent pretext
So what does that make good
To the girl that you love

Girl you loathe

The girl that you love

Girl that you love
Girl that you love
Knows you don't

Denominations surrender all control
To the girl that you love
All control

Our indignation to every tainted soul
And the girl you love
All control

Girl that you love
Girl that you love
Girl that you love

Knows you don't

Girl that you love
Girl that you love
Girl that you love
Knows you don't
Followed her
Followed her
Followed her
Followed her home

Girl that you love
Girl that you love
