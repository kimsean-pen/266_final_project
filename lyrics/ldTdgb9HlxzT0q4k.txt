Infinite silence
Flowing right in with the dawn
This is wrong, this is wrong
And I cannot sleep without the radio on
And how could anyone?

You are in my dreams
Half human, half machine
You with someone else that I have felt and seen
I cannot rest, or my consciousness contest
Looking right through the lens
From winter brings the spring again

And infinite silence
Flowing right in with the dawn
This is wrong, this is wrong
And I cannot sleep without the radio on

And we fall asleep again with ties to mend
So please let the cleaning begin with evolution

Hold my breath 'til communication is only just a test
Hold my breath 'til communication is only just a test
Hold my breath 'til communication is only just a test

You are in my dreams
Half human, half machine

Looking right through the lens
From winter brings the spring again

And infinite silence
Flowing right in with the dawn
This is wrong, this is wrong
And I cannot sleep without the radio on

Infinite silence
Flowing right in with the dawn
This is wrong, this is wrong
And I cannot sleep without the radio
