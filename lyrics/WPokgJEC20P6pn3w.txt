Way down in a not so distant place
Your ghost is lingering
Still frames remembering the way we were
Way down see reflections in the well
A distant haunting bell
Resounding every time I touch you in my mind
Helpless, prayers cannot speed the time
Nor ever change the mind
Left to our wrong device we set this bridge alive
One day, you may not know it yet
This you won't forget
I was the one who came running back again
I'm gonna wait, I'm gonna wait, I'm gonna wait, I wanna
I'm gonna wait, I'm gonna wait, I'm gonna wait, I wanna
I'm gonna wait, I'm gonna wait, I'm gonna wait, I wanna
I'm gonna wait, I'm gonna wait, I'm gonna wait for you
My arms are reaching out for you
Each time I think of you
Flood gates open and I'm left drowning
And although, it lingers in my sleep
May you return to me
Not to possess but to hold you in my keep
And so the last page shall remain
Empty until you write the rest
Yes, some may say that I'm a fool
A fool for waiting for you
I'll be your fool, a fool who waited for you
When you come falling, I'll be here still waiting for you
