Mr. Know It All
Well you you think you know it all
But you don't know a thing at all ain't it
Ain't it something y'all
When somebody tells you something about you
Think that they know you more than you do
So you take it down, another pill to swallow

Mr. Bring Me Down
Well you like to bring me down, don't you
But I ain't laying down
Baby I ain't going down
Can't nobody tell me how it's gonna be
Nobody's gonna make a fool out of me
Baby you should know that I lead not follow

Oh you think that you know me, know me
that's why I'm leaving you lonely, lonely
'Cause baby you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me

Mr. Play Your Games
Only got yourself to blame
When you want me back again
But I ain't falling back again
'Cause I'm living my truth without your lies
Let's be clear baby, this is goodbye
I ain't comin' back tomorrow

Oh you think that you know me, know me
that's why I'm leaving you lonely, lonley
'Cause baby you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me

You ain't got the right to tell me
When and where, no right to tell me
Acting like you own me lately
Yeah baby you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me

So what you've got the world at your feet
And you know everything about everything
But you don't
You still think I'm coming back but baby you'll see

Oh you think that you know me, know me
that's why I'm leaving you lonely, lonely
'Cause baby you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me

You ain't got the right to tell me
When and where, no right to tell me
Acting like you own me lately
Yeah baby you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me

Mr. Know It All
Well you you think you know it all
But you don't know a thing at all
Yeah baby you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me
