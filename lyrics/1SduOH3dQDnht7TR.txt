Hail hail hail the mystery!
Uthark - code of secrecy
Frey, Frey - god of ecstasy
rise, rise from ginnugagap

Enter the path of Runa
and drink from the well of Urd
Taste the fruits of Iduna
Decipher the signs from the north

Hail, Frey, your prosperity
Come forth from the depth of Ur
Rise, rise from eternity
