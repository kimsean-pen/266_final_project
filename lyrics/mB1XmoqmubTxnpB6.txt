Am I crazy or am I half blind
Someone told me I'm out my mind oh oh oh
Someone told me a girl I like

Fell in love and all I did was cry oh oh oh
Someone hold me I am done with this game
Said I'm sorry but I'm not to blame

What a shame oh oh oh
Tried to break from this lonely pain
Someone told me I'm just insane oh oh oh

Broke my heart when I knew
That I could never be with you oh oh oh
Someone loved me but not today

Will you show me, show me a way
How to love oh oh oh
Someone told me a girl I like
Fell in love and all I did was cry oh oh oh
