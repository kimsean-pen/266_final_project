you've got rain in your eyes
and a head full of stars
all the tears you can hold in your hand
and a room full of sleep
and a promise to keep
isn't it just like love
in a world made of law
you're just losing the game
they give you these words
but they've taken your name
now you're out in the cold
now ain't that a shame
isn't it just like love
you can have anything
you can hold in your hand
and a hero is always alone
at the end of the day
it's a price that you pay
with your pieces of love
all your pieces of love
and it's my time
to turn you around
and it's my time
to hold out a hand
and it's my time
to turn on a light for you
my time
it's my time
there's a world at the door
with her heart in her sleeve
and there's nowhere to turn
there is you
there's a deal to be made
and a price to be paid
isn't it just like love
you can have anything
you can hold in your hand
and a hero is always alone
at the end of the day
it's a price that you pay
with your pieces of love
all your pieces of love
and it's my time
to turn you around
and it's my time
to hold out a hand
and it's my time
to turn on a light for you
my time it's my time
so we stand in the dark
and the sun never shows
and you're whispering secrets
that everyone knows
so we know that they told you
they just want to hold you
use you and take you
and lose you and fake you
you have everything
you can hold in your hand
but a hero is always alone
at the end of the day
it's a price that you pay
with your pieces of love
all your pieces of love
it's my time
to turn you around
and it's my time
to hold out a hand
and it's my time
to turn on a light for you
my time it's my time
you can have anything
you can hold in your hand
and a hero is always alone
at the end of the day
it's a price that you pay
with your pieces of love
all your pieces of love
it's my time
to turn you around
and it's my time
to hold out a hand
and it's my time
to turn on a light for you
my time it's my time
