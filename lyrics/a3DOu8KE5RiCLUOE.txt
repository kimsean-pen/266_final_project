Whoa, it came out of the sky
Landed just a little south of Moline
Jody fell out of his tractor
Couldn't b'lieve what he seen, oh

Laid on the ground shook
Fearin' for his life
Then he ran all the way to town
Screamin' "It came out of the sky"

Well, a crowd gathered 'round
And a scientist said it was marsh gas
Spiro came to make a speech
About raisin' the Mars tax

Vatican said "Woe, the Lord has come"
Hollywood rushed out an epic film
Ronnie the Populist said
It was a communist plot

Whoa-oh

Oh, the newspapers came
And made Jody a national hero
Walter and Eric said they'd put him
On a network TV show

White House said "Put the thing in the Blue Room"
The Vatican said "No, it belongs in Rome"
Jody said "It's mine
But you can have it for seventeen million"

Whoa, it came out of the sky
Landed just a little south of Moline
Jody fell out of his tractor
Couldn't b'lieve what he seen, oh

Laid on the ground a-shakin'
Fearin' for his life
And then he ran all the way to town
Screamin' "It came out of the sky"

Whoa
