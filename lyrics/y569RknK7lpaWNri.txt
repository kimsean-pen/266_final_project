Through the rails I spied
Your ponytail. I tried
With sugar cubes - And they're O.K.
But I don't think
I'll catch you that way
I hate myself 'cause you're so cool
With your mocking eyes
"Won't you look at the old fool"

Wild horses - I want to have
Wild horses - I want to have
Wild horses - I want to have
Wild horses - I want to

Look at you - Unflawed.
Now look at me - Plain overawed
Grace and looks take no credit for
Girl you're young
And they're part of the score
Like the chemicals at war in me
'Til I'm a wolf with an eye for the ponies

Wild horses - I want to have
Wild horses - I want to have
Wild horses - I want to have
Wild horses - I want to

I want extra time to play,
Afternoons in the hay
It's a sorry way for a man to feel
But sentimental is part of the deal
I hate myself because it shows how
I'm a fool for your rodeo

Wild horses - I want to have
Wild horses - I want to have
Wild horses - I want to have
Wild horses

Wild horses - I want to have
Wild horses - I want to have
Wild horses - I want to have you
