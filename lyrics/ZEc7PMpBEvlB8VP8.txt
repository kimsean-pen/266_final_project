I'm in love with the unlovable
You're all in with the cruel world
There's something that's missing
But there's something about you
I'm all eyes for the coldest star
You would do the unthinkable for me

I can't believe sometimes
I let down the one today
I can't believe sometimes
I lost the one who cared

So I'm putting all my love on the one
The one who's always there
And I'm sending down my love to her
Yeah, I'm putting all my love on the one
The one who's always there
And I'm staring down my love, yeah, the one
The one who's always there

I'm in love with my memories
You're alone with my stuttering heart
There's something that's missing
But there's something about you
I'm all eyes for the coldest star
You would do the unthinkable for me

I can't believe sometimes
I let down the one today
I can't believe sometimes
I lost the one who cared

So I'm putting all my love on the one
The one who's always there
And I'm sending down my love to her
Yeah, I'm putting all my love on the one
The one who's always there
And I'm sending all my love to the one
The one who's always there
