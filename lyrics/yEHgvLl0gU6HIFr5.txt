I've been hurtful
You've been hoping
These four walls
Haven't spoken for you

If I don't go
Where I'm wanted
I'd be lost
I'd be haunted
By you

And my love is a ribbon
I can't tie around you
In my head, there's a vision
I can't figure out
And it's only for the broken

Only for the broken-hearted
Only for the broken-hearted, baby
Only for the broken-hearted
Only for the broken-hearted, baby

You dream of sunshine
I dream of rain
You dream our past
Would just go away
I'll think of you
On tragic days
When coming back to you
Comes too late

Only for the broken

And my love is a ribbon
I can't tie around you
In my head, there's a vision
I can't figure out
And it's only for the broken

Only for the broken-hearted
Only for the broken-hearted, baby
Only for the broken-hearted
Only for the broken-hearted, baby

And my love is a ribbon
I can't tie around you
In my head, there's a vision
I can't figure out
And it's only for the broken

Only for the broken-hearted
Only for the broken-hearted, baby
Only for the broken-hearted
Only for the broken-hearted, baby
