Look my way, washed out in space
Know you will never be alone
We are never coming home
Everything and everyone

I've been hiding out
In the chrome black hole in time
When I look into your eyes
You can fall in love without ever waking up

Dreamless dream, I dove too deep
When every touch is medical
And the world is all you know
I can be your lithium, my neon black flamingo

I've been hiding out
In the chrome black hole in time
When I look into your eyes
You can fall in love without ever waking up

Way outside the walls of this apathetic mind
Will you bring me back to life?

I've been hiding out
In the chrome black hole in time
When I look into your eyes
You can fall in love without ever waking up
