On television Kings and Queens
Live the lifes of people's dream
You and I are human being
Living, breathing, beings
There are rules that i'm in to break
You could call this a great mistake
We can alwaus plau it safe but that's no fun
We could Run
We could runx2
Hold me close and hols me fast
I'd never thought you ever rest
Some moment were meant to last and this ain't one
We could run
We could run
We could run
We could run
We could run
We could run
We could run
We could run
This is the last time I mean it
The final dance of the evening
They couldn't call the final ball
We could run
We could run
We could run
We could run
We could run
We could run
We could run
