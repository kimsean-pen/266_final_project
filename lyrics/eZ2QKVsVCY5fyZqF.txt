Love
It was enough to recognize
To see
I was the reason you feel sick inside

Fall in need
I let you bleed
Cause you were fallin, I'm sorry, baby
Cause you were fallin, I'm sorry

Love
It cut a hole into your eyes
You couldn't see
You were the car I crashed
Now you're burning alive

Fall in need
I let you bleed
Cause you were fallin, I'm sorry, baby
Cause you were fallin, I'm sorry

Babe
The night has swallowed my soul
Could it be that I fell apart
It shows
The lines on the face ate away my smile
Could it be that I fell apart

Fall in need
I let you bleed
Cause you were fallin, I'm sorry, baby
Fall in need
I let you bleed
Cause you were fallin, I'm sorry, baby
Fall in need
