Oh, pretty baby, you're my motivator
Got me changing my words and my behavior
Pretty lady, you're my operator
Got me dialing your number just to hear ya

Tell me the things that you want
I give you all that I've got
Open your eyes then you will see

It's just you and me, only
Throwing at the keys, just, living in a dream
It's just you and me, only
Listen to you breathe, just, living in a dream
It's just you and me

My disaster, you're my only answer
You got me thinking that I could be a master
Pretty baby, you're my heavy ocean
Weigh me down and give me your devotion

Tell me the things that you want (you want)
I give you all that I've got (I've got)
Open your eyes then you will see

It's just you and me, only
Throwing out the keys, just, living in a dream
It's just you and me, only
Listen to you breathe, just, living in a dream
It's just you and me

Take, take me over
Yeah, take me over I don't want to wake up
(It's just you and me)

Take, take me over
Yeah take me over I don't want to wake up
It's just you and me

Dream... world...
Dream... world... (Take, take me over, oh take me over)
(I don't want to wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up)

Listen to you breathe, just, living in a dream
It's just you and me, only
Throwing at the keys, just, living in a dream
It's just you and me

Dream... world...
It's just you and me
Dream... world...
Only
