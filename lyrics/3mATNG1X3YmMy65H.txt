Outside just killing time and making noise
And outside the daylight comes, the daylight goes and weightless
If its weightless it makes no stairways to stairs that go nowhere
and don't dream, that is a dream it is what it seems

Climbing from over stimulated states to hearing
Cold radio and licenses plates but don't dream,
That is a dream it is what it seems
That is a dream it is what it seems

Behind every desire is another one waiting to be liberated when the first ones sated

Water skiing, the waters hot, the waters soft
You act nice, a black birthday card I threw it away

Correct life, is like eating steel or flying a plane
It's too bright, it's too bright

Outside just killing time and making noise
And outside the daylight comes, the daylight goes and weightless
If its weightless it makes no stairways to stairs that go nowhere
Climbing from over stimulated states to hearing
Cold radio and licenses plates but don't dream,
That is a dream it is what it seems
That is a dream it is what it seems

Why do black hats hide behind each others backs all the time?
Behind every desire is another one waiting to be liberated when the first ones sated
