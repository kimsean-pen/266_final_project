You can cut the tension, and you don't need a knife
Let's cut to the chase, I'll push you deeper into the night
'Cause I got a feeling, you'll show me something I've never seen
There's something about you I thought that I would never believe
Oh no

(Blinded the night) Oh no
(Oh but wrong feels right)

You've made me a true believer
I'm in between her
On my knees and sinking deeper
Underneath her
You've made me a true believer

We can cut the chit-chat and get on with the show
I've got a confession, but I think you already know
So how could you blame me for the guilty pleasures I wanna do?
There's something about you
There's something about you

(Blinded the night) There's something about you
(Oh but wrong feels right) There's something about you

You've made me a true believer
I'm in between her
On my knees and sinking deeper
Underneath her
You've made me a true believer

(Resurrect me)
Making me come, make me come alive
You're in control of me for the night
(Gast and guilty)
But it feels good, everything is right
From the shadows you look like the light
I think I've seen the light
You can cut the tension and you don't need a knife
Let's cut to the chase, I'll push you deeper into the night

You've made me a true believer
I'm in between her
On my knees and sinking deeper
Underneath her
You've made me a true believer

There's something about you
There's something about you
Now show me something I've never seen
There's something about you
