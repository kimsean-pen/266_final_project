Look at what we did, came a long way from Dirty Ghetto Kids (Uh, yeah)

You know what it is (Haha, uh, uh, come on)
When the cops didn't find him for grindin' though
They kinda blew the vibe, figured it was time to go
Plus, he had to be at home a long time ago
And he had made like ten dollars off the sign he wrote
It read: "A little hungry, and need a little money, it's for my little sister, and her little tummy."
Wasn't lyin' though didn't go buy hydro
Went to the restaurant and bought two gyros
'Cause he knew they wasn't cooking where he lived
Da-kook-akook-akook's now took him to the crib
A little hurt from the rail he took into the ribs
Right past the pushers who couldn't underdig
"What's the use of pushin' you ain't pushin' none of this"
If I kick it with y'all I'm just pushin' for a bit
But, what was on his mind had pushed him to the lid
They best customer wasn't cooking for a kid
Yes sir

So he kick, push
Over his shoulders he swore he'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothin' back there but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive (Yeah, uh)
And so he kick, push

You see his mom was a crackhead and his father couldn't be contacted
He lived with being different, was combatted
Amongst the other things on his young, black head
And see, his girl was a white girl
But, just cause she was white, see her life wasn't light-world
She, too had the drama thick
Had a daddy and a momma, but her daddy used to momma hit
Daddy caught something, chasing fatties made her momma sick
Couldn't afford the medicine, pimped it to the pharmacist
As suicidal feelings would rise, switch over to transitions, helped her conquer it
Pays for her momma's pills with a sponsership
A cell phone bill and a Honda kit Uh-huh
And that's why she skates with he
Someone to feel her pain and her place to be

That's why, that's why, that's why she kick, push
Over her shoulders she swore she'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothin' back there but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive (Yeah, uh)
That's why she kick, push
Over his shoulders she swore she'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothin' back there but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive (yeah)

A traveling band of misfits and outcasts
Knock their heads from Misfits to Outkast
A lot of scars, they did this without pads
A lot of hearts, who did this without dads
One's father was filthy rich, two was middle class, and one was homeless
Add in a paralyzed girl in a wheelchair who just liked to watch it, that was the whole clique
I think about it everytime I see this old flick
That was taken in the park, in front of this old bench
They wrote on the back, "You thank for push, kick, hope you make a video, the beat is so sick."
Well, I did, I hope you seen it, It's on MTV, Soundtrakk's a genius
Love from Tony Hawk, beat from the Ice Creamer's
Before we out it out had to pay the fillipinas
Just to show 'em how...

You kick, push
Over your shoulders you swore you'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothin' back there but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive (Yeah, uh)
That's why you kick, push
Over your shoulders you swore you'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothin' back there but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive (yeah)
