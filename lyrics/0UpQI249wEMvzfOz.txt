We should not expect
The worst from ourselves
Or it's all we'll receive
We should not descend
Below our own selves
We'll get trapped underneath

We lie in suffrage
We're treated as mistakes
Feeling defeated
With crippled spirits
But we refuse to break
Our hearts not depleted

No control
We're unsustainable
On the ropes
Fighting and capable
Standing at the edge
Are we still worth it
No control
We're non-retainable
Lost in smoke
But we're not replaceable
Clinching to our pledge
We are not worthless

We lie in suffrage
We're treated as mistakes
Feeling defeated
With crippled spirits
But we refuse to break
Our hearts not depleted

No control
We're unsustainable
On the ropes
Fighting and capable

We lie in suffrage
We're treated as mistakes
Feeling defeated

Weakness overwhelms us all

Weakness overwhelms us all
Tranquil thoughts will overcome
