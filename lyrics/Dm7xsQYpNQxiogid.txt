How can you be sitting there
Telling me that you care
That you care
When everytime I look around
The people suffer in suffering
In everyway. In everywhere

Na-na-na-na-na
We're the survivors; yes, the black survival

I tell you what
Some people got everything
Some poeple got nothing
Some people got hopes and dreams
Some people got ways and means

Na-na-na-na-na
We're the survivors; yes, the black survival
Yes we're the survivors like
Daniel out of the lions' den, survivors, survivors

So my brethren, my sisthren
Which way will we choose
We better hurry, oh hurry woe now
'Cause we got no time to lose

Some people got facts and claims
Some peole got pride and shame
Some people got the plots and schemes
Some people got no aim it seems

Na-na-na-na-na
We're the survivors; yes, the black survival
We're the survivors; yes, the black survival
We're the survivors like shadrach, meshach and abednego
Thrown in the fire but never get burn

So my brethren, my sisthren
The preaching and talking is done
We gotta live up woe now, woe now
'Cause the father's time has come
Some people put the best outside
Some people keep the best inside
Some people can't stand up strong
Some people won't wait for long

Na-na-na-na-na
We're the survivors; a black survival
In this age of technological inhumanity
We're the survivors black survival
Scientific atrocity, we're the survivors
Atomic mis-philosophy, we're the survivors
Nuclear mis-energy
It's a world that forces lifelong insecurity
All together now we're the survivors
Yes, the black survival
A good man is never honoured in his own country, black survival
Nothing change, nothing strange
Nothing change, nothing strange
We got to survive, we've got to survive
But to live as one equal in the eyes of the almighty
