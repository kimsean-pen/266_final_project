Holding hands over time
And I thought of, and I thought of
The dissemblance of our minds
We were part of a new start for me
Four letter words, same line
What it means when love is a dream
All is fair when you see life in color

Children try, we wear it best
That's enough for ya, lies a man
All that's leaning from those lips

Oh yeah, yeah
You are the one, the one
One, one
You are the one
You are the, you are the, you are the one
One, one, one
Are the one, oh woah

Joy is on the hills
When misters are vivid
Can I get on wheel up, wheel up, wheel up?
Is it vivid enough, vivid enough?
Ooh, haffi making shine
So it shines like diamonds on ice
The scales out
Oh or get beat, woah, oh

Children try, we wear it best
That's enough for ya, lies a man
All that's leaning from those lips

Oh yeah, yeah
You are the one, the one
One, oh yeah, yeah, yeah one
You are the one
You are the, you are the, you are the one
One, one, oh yeah, yeah, yeah one
Are the one

Can I have it like that, baby?
You're so inspiring, I feel like you are the one
No one's ever made me feel so good
You're so inspiring

Oh yeah, yeah
You are the one, the one
One, one
You are the one
You are the, you are the, you are the one
One, are the one, are the one, one
Are the one, are the one (one)
You are the one
You are the, you are the, you are the one
Baby, you are the one
Oh, woah, you are the one
Oh, woah
