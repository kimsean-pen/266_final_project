i couldn't love you more
if time was running out
couldn't love you more
oh right now baby

take me by the hand come on
be my darling be the one
i wouldn't want to lay or ever love with another
if everyone in the world
could give me what i wanted
i wouldn't want for more than i have
i couldn't love you more if i tried

i couldn't love you more boy
i couldn't love you more boy

'cos darling i'm on your side
i really am on your side
my love i'm on your side
oh right now baby

i couldn't love you more boy
stay exactly how your are
i couldn't love you more boy
couldn't love you more
i couldn't love you more boy
stay exactly how your are
i couldn't love you more boy
couldn't love you more

if everyone in the world
would give me their treasure
i would not want for more
than i have right now
