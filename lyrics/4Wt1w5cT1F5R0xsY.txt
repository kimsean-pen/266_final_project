Dusting off your savior
You were always my favorite

Always my man, all in a hand
To celebrate you is greater

Now that I can, always my man
Now you see what I came for

No one here is to blame for
Misunderstand, all in a hand
Just like you 'cause you made me
All that I am, all in a hand

A butterfly that flaps its wings
Affecting almost everything
The more I hear the orchestra

The more I have something to bring
And now I see you in a beautiful
And different light

He's just a man and any damage done
Will be all right
Call out my name
Call and I came
Dusting off your savior
Forgiving any behavior
He's just a man, all in a hand

Your hero's destined to waver
Anyone can, always my man

I would never betray you
Look at me who could raise you
Face in the sand, safe in your hand
You were always my favorite
Always my man, all in a hand
We are the red hots and

We're loving up the love me nots
The flowers in your flower pots
Are dancing on the table tops
And now I see you in a beautiful
And different light
He's just a man and everything he does
Will be all right
Call out my name
Call and I came
Dusting off your savior
The life that you have narrated
You were my man.
