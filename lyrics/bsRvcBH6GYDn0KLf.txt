I'm gettin' tired of waitin' around
I feel like I'm always trackin' you down
I don't wanna point my finger at you
But there's somethin' you're forgettin'
Here's what you better do

You better think of me
I know you want to, baby, think of me
It won't be long before you, think of me
'Cause I'll be gone and then you'll think of me, oh yeah

You walk in and you see me cryin'
You apologize say you lost track of time
I'm not gonna cry anymore
You're gonna lose me too if you don't know
What's good for you

Think of me
I know you want to, baby, think of me
It won't be long before you, think of me
'Cause I'll be gone and then you'll think of me, oh yeah

Tell me what I did to you
To make you treat me so badly
If you wanna see me anymore
If you don't wanna see me walking out the door

You better think of me
I know you want to, baby, think of me
It won't be long before you, think of me
'Cause I'll be gone and then you'll think of me, oh yeah

You better think of me, think, think, think of me
You know you're drivin' me crazy
You better, you better, you better think of me, oh yeah

Think, stop wastin' all my time
Think, you know it could have been so fine
Think, hey boy, I'm waitin' on a sign
Don't you know there's someone else
Stop thinkin' of yourself

You better think of me
I know you want to, baby, think
You know you're drivin' me crazy, think
Think, think, think of me

You better think of me
Think, think, think of me
Think, stop wastin' all my time
Think, you know it could have been so fine
You better, you better, think

You better think of me
I know you want to, baby, think
You know you're drivin' me crazy, think
Think, think, think, think of me
You better, you better, you better think of me

Think, stop wastin' all my time
Think, you know it could have been so fine
Think, hey boy, I'm waitin' on a sign
