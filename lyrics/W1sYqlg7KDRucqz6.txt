Some things last
Sometimes you never get over
Living the past you find out it's hard to stay sober
I see through skin like pure faith
Lost and then found, flaunt you
For all that I wouldn't trade

You never know
A long time ago you were frowning
Thinking it over

It's raining down, it's somehow
You know it reminds me why you've been carrying me more
You can find me riding in the dumps of the soul
Rising through the radiophone

People will change, sometimes you lead how it ought to be
Find a new way, become clean and let it wash over me

I see through heart of pure faith
Peace for your ground
Watch out, and throw all the love and pain

You never know
A long time ago you were crawling
Thinking it over

It's raining down, it's somehow
You know it reminds me why you've been carrying me more
You can find me riding in the dumps of the soul
Rising through the radiophone

Left me here so all alone
Only for me to find
Hear your voice always will grow
Echoes inside my mind
If somebody's just a trace
What it was like, then?
With you here, we share space
It's always half empty

Grinding, grinding it all
Always half empty
Grinding, grinding it all
Always half empty
I am!

So we can laugh, it's inside
Never hear me complain
I see through sea of cellophane

You never know
A long time ago you were drowning
Thinking it over

It's raining down, it's somehow
You know it reminds me why you've been carrying me more
You can find me riding in the dumps of the soul
Rising through the radiophone

Reminds me why you've been carrying me more
You can find me riding in the dumps of the soul
Rising through the radiophone
