Keep thinking it was a dream
That I hit you when you're down
I keep changing apathy
From the river to the town
Was it a dream?
Or something sinister?
Was it a dream
Or something sinister?
I got a better half
To celebrate martyrdom.
Keep thinking it was a dream
That you're never gonna wake
The time we spent
In a box in my own town
It's true I lost you
Stumbling from room to room
Hoping I wake up somehow next to you
It's true that I lost a year,
Stronger, but don't know what to do
Hoping I wake up somehow next to you
Eyes on the mirror looking through
It's the same wall, but everything is new!
