The darkest night
Can't close my eyes
Sleep is weak
I'm hypnotized
It's do or die
I feel your heat
I think it's time to tear through these chains

We're gonna fall into the flames
And everglow
Yeah we're gonna fall into the flames
I feel the smoke
Breathe it in
We can't stop, there's no running
Can't stop, almost burning
Fall into the flames
And everglow, you're my everglow

I see the fire spread
Two silhouettes
Sinking deep, inside my chest is a world below
They say we're self-destructing
But hell we gotta do something
Nothing oh nothing
Doing nothing
Is never gonna break through these chains

We're gonna fall into the flames
And everglow
Yeah we're gonna fall into the flames
I feel the smoke
Breathe it in
We can't stop, there's no running
Can't stop, almost burning
Fall into the flames
And everglow, you're my everglow

Tonight we're raging inside
All we know, all we know tonight
Is that we're raging inside
Inside, inside

The darkest night
Can't close my eyes
Sleep is weak

We're gonna fall into the flames
And everglow
Yeah we're gonna fall into the flames
I feel the smoke
Breathe it in
We can't stop, there's no running
Can't stop, almost burning
Fall into the flames
And everglow, you're my everglow

We're gonna fall into the flames
And everglow
Yeah we're gonna fall into the flames
I feel the smoke
Breathe it in
We can't stop, there's no running
Can't stop, almost burning
Fall into the flames
And everglow, you're my everglow
