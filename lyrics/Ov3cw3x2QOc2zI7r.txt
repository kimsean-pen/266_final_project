Mind is blown but her body's still in shock
Can't see nothing as she's staring at the kitchen clock
Feels so bland in the eye of the storm it's a bedroom day
We should switch we should pass ourselves around
Meet me at the corner tear your dream home down
It's a goddamn shit-show out here now
Something to tell you 'bout that someone told me 'bout
I know I'm weak and this weekend you'll find out
Yes, I sleep at that fucking whore's house now
But it's cinematic, cinematic fades to black
Every day is a rodeo, man

No one's gonna change, nobody ever does
No one's gonna change, no one is changing for you
No one's gonna change, nobody ever does
And I'm never gonna do what you want me to

Sitting here speaking Greek to a college blog
Every sentence is the same it's just talk, talk, talk
I am one, I admit it, of a million
Who has it out for these soapbox idiots
The click clack of your high heels you're away
Downstairs on a tic-tac stripper's break
Every dancer trying to sync to the beat
Every motherfucker in this place tells me the same shit
This whole world's got to buy you a drink, man
Got to take you to the edge and watch you throw it up
Every morning I could give a damn what you did last night
Just tell me how far to kick this can

No one's gonna change, nobody ever does
No one's gonna change, no one is changing for you
No one's gonna change, nobody ever does
And I'm never gonna do what you want me to

I don't wanna feel so jaded
Getting on a plane to work things out
When I'm alone, you're all I think about
But I'm never alone very long

They say you got to love yourself first, that's a trip
I've been hating myself since I was a little kid
I know it's sad that the game's rained out
And all the bleachers emptied out and the turnstiles spin
All the good ones in the world they keep dropping dead
Everybody's got a bullet flying at their head
I seen it coming, man, I seen it coming
I seen it coming, no

No one's gonna change, hey, and that's the truth
No one's gonna change, oh, baby not for you
No one's gonna change, hey, and that's the truth
And I'm never gonna do what you want me to
