Licorice and nuts
There are no if's and
There aren't any buts
He was just there
He was just standing there

He was on an island
In the North Atlantic Ocean
Just minding his own
He was just doing his thing
And in that moment
Everything changed

Is he strange
Or is it you, who never
Saw the light?
Decades of everything wrong
Give way to everything right
But that don't mean that it will stick
He's not some flower you can pick

Purples, reds and blues
You act like you have
Never read the news
Now you must choose
What are you going to do?

It's just good to know that
You can love while you are
Letting Go, look at the snow
Look at it swirl and blow
And you never thought
That tree would grow

Is he strange
Or is it you, who never
Saw the light?
Decades of everything wrong
Give way to everything right
But that don't mean that it will stick
He's not some flower you can pick

Brown Norwegian cheese
Don't worry who you do
And do not please
At the very least
You've got other dead horses to beat

You can't win or lose
You simply are, and that's how
He is too, and you're never
Through, nobody said that
It would be smooth
Now close your eyes
And concentrate on this
Groove

Is he strange
Or is it you, who never
Saw the light?
Decades of everything wrong
Give way to everything right

Baby you're not strange
You are the only one
Who's ever been right
I'm just sorry that I let you down
And that's what keeps me up at night

And I only hope that you can see
That you've transformed
This heart inside of me
