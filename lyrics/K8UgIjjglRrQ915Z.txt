I like my town
With a little drop of poison
Nobody knows
They're linin' up to go insane

I'm all alone
I smoke my friends down to the filter
But I feel much cleaner
After it rains

And she left in the fall
That's her picture on the wall
She always had that little drop of poison

Did the Devil
Make the World
While God was sleeping
You'll never get a wish from a bone

Another long goodbye
And a hundred sailors
That deep blue sky
Is my home

And she left in the fall
That's her picture on the wall
She always had that little drop of poison

Well a rat
Always knows
When he's in with weasels
Here you lose a little everyday

Well I remember
When a million was a million
They all have ways
To make you pay
And she left in the fall
That's her picture on the wall
She always had that little drop of poison
And she left in the fall
That's her picture on the wall
She always had that little drop of poison
