Surrounded by a shear
Eye getting blear
While I cling
While I'll bring me down

Fireless and fleet
Fireless and fleet
In danger eat
In danger eat

Fireless and fleet
Fireless and fleet
In danger eat
In danger eat

Surrounded
Surrounded
Surrounded

Desire
Desire
Desire
Desire

Surrounded by a shear
I filled with tears
With mines
