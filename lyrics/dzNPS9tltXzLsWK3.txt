He's in a rush run
He has to hurry dash
He's in a rat race
Never at a slow pace
Forever dangerous
And never serious
Up on your energy
Expect no sympathy

Appreciation is overrated
Resting is for fools

He wants his blood boil
Always in turmoil
Blasting his everyway
Throughout the shortest day
Forever dangerous and never serious
Swimming against the stream
And steal all of your dreams

Aggravation is appreciated
He'll use you like a tool
Association is overrated
Friends are for fools

He's in a rush
Fever on his eyes
I do not dare and cross him
He'll smooch you with his lies
Ever so dangerous
He'll haunt you seriously
I wouldn't go within a mile
Radius of him

Aggravation is appreciated
He'll use you like a tool
Association is overrated
Friends are for fools
