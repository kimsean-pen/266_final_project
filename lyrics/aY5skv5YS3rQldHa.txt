Serpentine love's thighs wrap around me
In search for death
Drenched in blood, the adored and beloved
Will give in to

Love in cold blood
Breathe me in sweet suffering
Love in cold blood

Love's feline eyes in darkness
Shine on her web
Demonised with divine insight
We draw our last breath

Love in cold blood
Breathe me in sweet suffering
Love in cold blood
Put me out of my misery

Love in cold blood
Breathe me in sweet suffering
Love in cold blood

Darling take me home
To the castle made of skulls and bones
Sing me a song to remind me where I belong
In your arms, my love in cold blood

Love in cold blood
Breathe me in sweet suffering
Love in cold blood
Put me out of my misery

Love in cold blood
Breathe me in sweet suffering
Love in cold blood

Darling, take me home
To the castle made of skulls and bones
Sing me a song to remind me where I belong
In your arms, my love in cold blood
