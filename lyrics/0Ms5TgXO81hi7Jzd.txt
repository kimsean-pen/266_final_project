I was cursing your name, I've been dealt in your dream
I was thinking in symmetry
Tiger found you there cause I kept you there
Seeing double, believe me
Take you down low if you put on that ring
And the centers are racists but they do you no favors
Look up in the scene, you're a delicate thing

You're gonna jump from there to Detroit
In front of all of these people
Oh, how sorry life is
Like a Hollywood sequel
You think you'll land on your feet
But you'll die in the streets
Look away, look away,
Oh, just go back to sleep

We were in the kitchen and the neighbors couldn't see
Thanks for the memories and all the memories
When it's dead in the water, let's throw the dice
Thanks for the memories and all the memories
Never trust a tiger can't be tamed
Feeling under the weather, can you keep it together?
So your sister's Beretta cause you're light as a feather

You're gonna jump from there to Detroit
In front of all of these people
Oh, how sorry life is
Like a Hollywood sequel
You think you'll land on your feet
But you'll die in the streets
Look away, look away,
Oh, just go back to sleep

Know that just the tiger can't be tamed
Know that just the tiger can't be tamed
Know that just the tiger can't be tamed
So make like a banana and split
