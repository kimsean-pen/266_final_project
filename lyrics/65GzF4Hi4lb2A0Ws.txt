You waste your days away
Dreaming of saying the words
Tell her the many ways
You will love her if you could

The center of your world
She is there making it turn
Folding your hands to pray
Wishing you were holding hers

Well you're dangled in the strings of a web
And on her you place your whole happiness
But she'll never be able to confess
She returns the same thoughts you posess

When you want what you can't have
Do you love what won't love back
Aya ayo
Aya ayo

She smiles for everyone
Tell yourself that it's for you
When she's here the pain is gone
And the sun kisses the moon

High praise and lifted hands
You can't help yourself, I understand
It's a strange kind of power she holds on you
And it seems every hour it's growing too

But you're dangled in the strings of a web
And on her you place your whole happiness
But she'll never be able to confess
She returns the same thoughts you posess

When you want
What you can't have
Do you love?
What won't love back
Aya ayo
Aya ayo

Holding on, you're holding on
To nothing more and nothing less
Holding on, you're holding on
To all those empty promises

When you want
What you can't have
Do you love?
What won't love back
When you want
What you can't have
Do you love?
What won't love back
Aya ayo
Ayo ayo
Holding on, you're holding on
