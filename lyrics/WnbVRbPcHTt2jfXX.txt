Born into Nixon and I was raised in Hell
A welfare child where the teamsters dwelled
The last one born and the first one to run
My town was blind from refinery sun

My generation is zero
I never made it as a working class hero

Twenty first century breakdown
I once was lost but never was found
I think, I am losing what's left of my mind
To the twentieth century deadline

I was made of poison and blood
Condemnation is what I understood
Video games to the tower's fall
Homeland security could kill us all

My generation is zero
I never made it as a working class hero

Twenty first century breakdown
I once was lost but never was found
I think, I am losing what's left of my mind
To the twentieth century deadline

We are the class of the class of thirteen
Born in the era of humility
We are the desperate in the decline
Raised by the bastards of 1969

My name is no one, the long lost son
Born on the fourth of July
Raised in the era of heroes and cons
That left me for dead or alive

I am a nation, a worker of pride
My debt to the status quo
The scars on my hands and the means to an end
Is all that I have to show

I swallowed my pride, and I choked on my faith
I've given my heart and my soul
I've broken my fingers and lied through my teeth
The pillar of damage control

I've been to the edge and I've thrown the bouquet
Of flowers left over from the grave
I sat in the waiting room wasting my time
And waiting for Judgment Day

I praise liberty, the "freedom to obey"
Is the song that strangles me?
Well, don't cross the line

Oh, dream, America, dream
I can't even sleep from the light's early dawn
Oh, scream, America, scream
Believe what you see from heroes and cons
