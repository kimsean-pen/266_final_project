Callous always builds from pain
Shelter only protects from the rain

Give me a reason,
Give me a reason not to fail
I'm trying to claw my way up
From despair

If i drown
Trying to come up for air,
Tell them i fought
But only made it halfway there

Hollowed out
From within
Breach the surface,
Drowning me

All around,
Something calls
Follow it down again

I cannot give in
This is treason
This is not how we're meant to live
