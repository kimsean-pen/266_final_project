Karen's moving out
out into the sky
Karen trips on a cloud
Sets down w stars in her eyes
She's alone in a room
She's deep inside of her mind
Karen's leaving for the snow
Somewhere to somewhere... blind
She cut the silver lining in my soul
I was tethered to her for a time
are we still together?
will she stay forever?
(will she stay?... beside...
flashlight... Karen stay... etc.)
A LOVE SUPREME
Karen, yr hanging on the line
wraps yr coat tight around
Karen, yr eyes are on the prize
i'll catch you on my way down
