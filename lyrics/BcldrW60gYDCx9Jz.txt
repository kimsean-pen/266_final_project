Clean sheets mean a lot to a guy who sleeps on the floor
I whited your love, and a shelf in your dresser drawer
You tucked me in, stopped my tossing and turning
But I turned back the covers and saw those sheets are dirty

Even thought you'll never come clean you know it's true
Those sheets are dirty
And so are you

The warmth of a bed to a guy who sleeps on the floor
Was enough to perpetuate all the lies I heard before
I want to hold you, I'll hold my pillow instead
Cause my pillow will never lie or be with a stranger in my bed
Even thought you'll never come clean
You know it's true
Those sheets are dirty
And so are you
Where's the love I was looking for
It's out the door
I'm afraid to see you anymore
So it's back on the floor
Cause those sheets are dirty

Woke up this morning alone on the floor
Thinking about those clean sheets and the way it was before
When I looked in the mirror, I saw your face and thought of the past
But now I know how dirty you are, I took my fist and smashed the glass
Even thought you'll never come clean You know it's true
Those sheets are dirty
And so are you
Those sheets are dirty
Those sheets are dirty
Those sheets are dirty
