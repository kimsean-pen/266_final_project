My heart is telling me that you were gonna change
But I know, my heart is lying right to my face, yeah
My heart is making up excuses for your ways
But I wish that my heart knew when I should walk away

It lets me down, it helps me as I get back up
Off the ground, while telling me that this is love
But I found, it wasn't really on my side
Now, I think it's time

I tell my heart to just butt out
Keep its opinion to itself
I should just listen to my head
'Cause it's the one who knows what's best
It tells me not to love you
But my heart says, just forgive you
Oh, but it's not thinking clearly
I wish that I could leave my heart out of this
Leave my heart out of this...

I'm done feeling like a stranger to myself
So I know, I've got to put all my feelings on a shelf, yeah

It lets me down, it helps me as I get back up
Off the ground, while telling me that this is love
But I found, it wasn't really on my side
Now, I think it's time

I tell my heart to just butt out
Keep its opinion to itself
I should just listen to my head
'Cause it's the one who knows what's best
It tells me not to love you
But my heart says, just forgive you
Oh, but it's not thinking clearly
I wish that I could leave my heart out of this
Leave my heart out of this...

Sometimes I wish you'd just shut up and let me think
I've had enough, I need to just make up my mind (make up my mind)
So that's why...

It tells me not to love you
But my heart says, just forgive you
Oh, but it's not thinking clearly
I wish that I could leave my, leave my... heart out of this
Leave my heart out of this...

L-l-l-leave my heart
L-l-l-leave my heart
No, oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, whoa
