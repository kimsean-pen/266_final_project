Broken hearts and last goodbyes
Restless nights but lullabies
Helps to make this pain go away
I realize I let you down
Told you that I'd be around
Buildin' up the strength just to say,

I'm sorry
For breakin' all the promises that I wasn't around to keep
It's all me
This time is the last time I will ever beg you to stay
But you're already on your way

Filled with sorrow, filled with pain
Knowing that I am to blame
For leavin' your heart out in the rain
And I know you're gunna walk away
Leave me with the price to pay
Before you go I wanted to say
Yeah

That I'm sorry
For breakin' all the promises that I wasn't around to keep
It's all me
This time is the last time I will ever beg you to stay
But you're already on your way

I can't make it alive on my own
But if you have to go, then please girl
Just leave me alone
'Cause I don't wanna see you and me goin' our separate ways
I'm begging you to stay
If it isn't too late

I'm sorry
For breakin' all the promises that I wasn't around to keep
It's all me
This time is the last time I will ever beg you to stay
But you're already on your way
But you're already on your way
