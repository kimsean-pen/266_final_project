Hey dudes are you ready to
Understand why some of your friends are true.
These ones that would follow you
Anywhere and through anything you'd do.
Revelation of a friendship on your tattoos
A salvation...

And you need them by your side
To feel stronger, to get better.
Friendship never ends if you trust in your tribe
Stay forever with your brothers.
They will never let you down.

Hey dudes are you ready to
Defend your mates in case they need you.
One mind leads you and your crew.
This kind of friendship makes you
Feel the real power.
You can do anything with your brothers.
(No trouble anymore)

And you need them by your side
To feel stronger, to get better.
Friendship never ends if you trust in your tribe
Stay forever with your brothers.

Can you imagine
Everything you can do with your team.
You have never felt so strong
All your guys sing along
A melody that means everything to you and to me.
Your mates sing the same song
These are my friends!
