All I want is to have cleanskin wine
And watch Mulholland Drive with you
But in the morning through your sleepy eyes
You tell me that I'm not for you
It's not that easy when there's nothing wrong
While everything is falling through
You say it's not to do with me
But I really want to know the truth

If you can't help it
Then why doesn't this count?
You're staying over
Long after my lights go out
It's taking so long
For you to figure out
If it's serious
And what's it really all about

You don't think you like people like me
I know, I've heard this one before
Maybe I'm the one exception that can last forever
But that can only happen if you let us be together
You don't think you like people like me

You come on over just to leave me here
Exactly where I was before
If you're in two minds, you know mine's a third
There isn't room for any more
The conversation goes around and round and round
It's all been said before
Like a tornado when it loses speed
These words are gonna hit the floor
If you can't help it
Then why doesn't this count?
You're staying over
Long after my lights go out

You don't think you like people like me
I know, I've heard this one before
Maybe I'm the one exception that can last forever
But that can only happen if you let us be together
You don't think you like people like me

What's that look on your typeface, honey?
I'm getting tired, don't find this funny
Can't be pick it up from where we started?
Even if it leaves me brokenhearted

What's that look on your typeface, honey?
I'm getting tired, don't find this funny
You and I
You and I
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
You don't think you like people like me
I know, I've heard this one before
Maybe I'm the one exception that can last forever
But that can only happen if you let us be together
You don't think you like people like me
