Rise thy horns
For I'm at one with the dark
Divine presence ascends
Touching the forehead ov god

Hark! I was not, I have become
In rapture, in vengeance, in blood
From word into flesh
From man into god

"Strive ever to more"
So spake the wisdom ov snake
"Hold up thyself"
Sayeth the law ov the brave

Beyond all I am
Let it be known
Within my blood fire stirs
Thee I invoke, The Unspoken One

As the wolf among sheep yet cower I do not
Victorious, glorious, constantly thirsting
And as the anger fuels my heart and will
No longer fear that which feeble men fear

"No rest for conquerors!", Legions of Typhon Seth await
Conquering child ov Mars breathes out war formula
"Ain Soph Aur
Protect my ways
Enlighten my paths
Consume me with thy rays"

I, the heart ov Tiphareth is waiting
The centre and secret ov the Sun
I invoke the Sothis rites, as day and night I'm reborn
...We shall all be one with the flames, from above...
