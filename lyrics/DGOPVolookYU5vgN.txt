Dream, a little dream
All about the basement scene
I don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna wake up, no

If you've seen the light turn gold
Come out tonight
And we'll get stoned
I don't wanna get old
I don't wanna get old
I don't wanna get old, no

Dream, a little dream
About your friends
And their endings
Now I wanna wake up
I wanna wake up
I don't wanna wake up now

It could be the death of me
Knowing that my friends
Will not remember me
I wanna get old
I wanna get old
I wanna get old

In the bluffs they know my name
In the bluffs they know
In the bluffs they know my name
In the bluffs they know

In the bluffs they know my name
In the bluffs they know
In the bluffs they know my name
