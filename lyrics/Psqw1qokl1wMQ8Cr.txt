I? m in the hallway on the floor, I cannot stand the Dark no more
Oh I? m lighting candles everywhere
I try to keep the darkness out of here

Inside my mind nightmares are turning real
Oh inside my mind I can? t control how I feel

Now I? m on the second floor, I cannot stand the Dark no more
Still I? m lighting candles everywhere
I try to stay awake out of fear

Inside my mind nightmares are turning real
Oh inside my mind I can? t control how I feel?

? Or what is real
For the pictures in red, they are still in my head
How can I believe in all of the things I see
When there? s a Floating Head outside watching me

[Solo: Mike]

The Floating Head has disappeared, I got to get some water in my face
I turn towards the mirror on the wall
The little sink is filling up, the water? s cold

Inside my mind nightmares are turning real
Oh inside my mind I can? t control how I feel?

? Or what is real
For behind me is the wrinkled head of a woman who? s dead
No body, just the head, strong hands around my neck
Forcing me under water, I? m drowning
Ah? Ah? Ah? I got to breathe
Ah? Ah? Ah? Got to break free

[Solo: Andy]

Inside my mind nightmares are turning real
Oh inside my mind I can? t control how I feel?

? Or what is real

[Chorus]
