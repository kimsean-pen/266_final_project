Like venom it surges through heart and soul
Driven and guided by the fears of men
A product of worlds so far apart
A destiny failure, a kingdom of ghosts

No emotions, no though, no fear
Into the darkness with fanatical lust

Raised for dying, a martyr's path
Eyes are open but never see
Filled with contempt for all the world
Daggers of tyranny to the throat of mankind

Twisted beliefs, numbed by lies
A radical hatred consumes and devours
A God of love, a God of war
The Gods will tear us down
Passions flow, released in fury
Diabolical plans unfold
Expendable lives, forfeit their souls
Thrown into the storm

A rise to glory, rapturous pride
A fall from grace, into the abyss
