Does anybody see him?
Another set up for the fall
Does anybody hear him?
He's screaming at the same blank wall

And everyone can't be right
But everyone will decide

I'm not afraid of the price I pay
I won't lie down as you walk away
I'm not afraid of the price I pay
I won't lie down as you walk away

I'm sure you must have seen him
I know you must have heard it all
I know you used to be him
Did anybody care at all?

And everyone can't be right
But everyone will decide

I'm not afraid of the price I pay
I won't lie down as you walk away
I'm not afraid of the price I pay
I won't lie down as you walk away

And everyone can't be right
But everyone will decide

I'm not afraid of the price I pay
I won't lie down as you walk away
I'm not afraid of the price I pay
I won't lie down as you walk away

I'm not afraid of the price I pay
I won't lie down as you walk away
I'm not afraid of the price I pay
I won't lie down as you walk away
