breathe your air
cut my teeth
bones of a hypocrite that look like me
ashes stain
windowsill
punk rock dream in a dimebag world
free your family
lose your mind
think about the valley from time to time
bittersweet things i've never been
happy that we left but i would leave again for you

back to your heart
back to your heart
back to your heart

you are the only one
sharing song
i'll wait for you
breathe your air
tend to me
tell me what you want and i'll try to be
everywhere
all the time
think about the future let the past unwind
you are the shining sun
the summer comes
i leave again
for you

back to your heart
back to your heart
back to your heart
