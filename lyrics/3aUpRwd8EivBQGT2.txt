I'm not angry anymore
Well, sometimes I am
I don't think badly of you
Well, sometimes I do
It depends on the day
The extent of all my worthless rage
I'm not angry anymore
I'm not bitter anymore
I'm syrupy sweet
I'll rot your teeth down to their core
If I'm really happy
It depends on the day
If I wake up in a giddy haze
Well I'm not angry
I'm not totally angry
I'm not all that angry anymore
