She got eyes that cuts you like a knife
And lips that taste like sweet red wine
And pretty legs go to heaven every time
She got a gentle way that puts me at ease
When she walks in the room I can hardly breathe
Got a devastatin' smile knock a grown man to his knees

She got whatever it is, It blows me away
She's everything I wanted to say to a woman
but I couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is

I don't know what to do
And every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out "I love you"
You got whatever it is
You know I've never been the type that would ever wanna stay
Bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day

But that all changed when she walked into my life
And people askin' why it is
I tell 'em I don't know
Just somethin' about the woman makes my heart go haywire
And she's gonna be my wife

She got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I want to say to a woman
but I couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is

I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out "I love you"
You got whatever it is

When she loves me
Girl that's how I feel
When she loves me I'm on top of the world
When she loves me I can live forever
And when she loves me I am untouchable

She got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I wanted to say to a woman
but I couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out "I love you, I do"
You got whatever it is
Ooh, you got whatever it is
