There's one thing I can tell you for certain
Lately, I been searchin' for my purpose
Will you show me where the earth ends?
Will you show me where the earth ends?
One thing I can tell you for certain
Lately, I been searchin' for my purpose
Will you show me where the earth ends? (will you?)
Will you show me where the earth ends?
One thing I can tell you for certain (one thing)
Lately, I been searchin' for my purpose (purpose)
Will you show me where the earth ends? (will you)
Will you show me where the earth ends? (show me)

I built a hundred likes, flew a hundred skies
Wasn't fitted size, my chains shine like fireflies
I smoke that inside, I smoke to come alive, huh
Everything is do or die
When you cross that line, no time to decide
Step up in my mind, you might lose your life
Live in paradise, open up your mind
Open up your eyes, trip to paradise
Shawty never lies, you gon' roll the dice
Trip to paradise, trip to paradise

There's one thing I can tell you for certain
Lately, I been searchin' for my purpose
Will you show me where the earth ends? (will you?)
Will you show me where the earth ends?
One thing I can tell you for certain (one thing)
Lately, I been searchin' for my purpose (purpose)
Will you show me where the earth ends? (will you?)
Will you show me where the earth ends? (show me)

Trip to paradise
