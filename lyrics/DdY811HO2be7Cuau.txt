Slowly I heal the love that's found it's way
Onto another path in times of change
Crossing a bridge unknown
Hoping our strength will hold
Should they both let go then let me lay
Let me lay
Show me a sign
To a light that shines
One direction into another
Sheltered peace of mind
Somewhere I lost a piece of memory
Somehow I know my legs will carry me
Searchin' for circles end
Hoping the wounds will mend
Should this scar, then it was meant to be
Show me a sign
To a light that shines
One direction into another
Sheltered peace of mind
Show me a sign
To a light that shines
One direction into another
Sheltered peace of mind
Show me a sign
To a light that shines
One direction into another
Sheltered peace of mind
