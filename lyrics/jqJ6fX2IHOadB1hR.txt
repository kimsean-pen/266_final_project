Know
My only goal is to see
When I'm only fast asleep
It takes more than strength to find
This piece of mind

So I'll hold, hold, hold, hold it close
To my heart beating with every step
Hold, hold, hold it close

He sleeps alone
He needs no army where he's headed cause he knows
That they're just ghosts
And they can't hurt him if he can see them, oh
And I may go
To places I have never been to just to find
The deepest desires in my mind

We
We only know, what we see
Cause we're always fast asleep
Is it so hard not to believe
That we'll never know

Oh hold, hold, hold, hold me close
I've never been this far from home
Hold, hold, hold me close

He sleeps alone
He needs no army where he's headed cause he knows
That they're just ghosts
And they can't hurt him if he can see them, oh
And I may go
To places I have never been to just to find
The deepest desires in my mind

It's in my head
And I have said
That I must be like him, oh
He sleeps alone
He sleeps alone
And one last chance
To make sense
Of what has long escaped us.
He sleeps alone
I sleep alone

He sleeps alone
He needs no army where he's headed cause he knows
That they're just ghosts
And they can't hurt him if he can see them, oh
And I don't know
If in the morning I will be here and if so
Let it be known
That I was worthy
I was worthy
I was worthy
I was...
