I see the signs of a lifetime, you 'til I die
And I'm swiftly out, I wish goodbye

What if it's not meant for me?
Love
What if it's not meant for me?
Love

I'd like to get to know you, I'd like to take you out
We'll go to the Hail Mary, and afterwards make out
Instead I'm typing you a message that I know I'll never send
Rewriting old excuses, delete the kisses at the end
When I see you, the whole world reduces to just that room
And then I remember and I'm shy, that gossip's eye will look too soon
And then I'm trapped, overthinking and yeah, probably self-doubt
You tell me to get over it and to take you out
But I can't, I'm too scared
And there's the night-bus, I have to go
And the doors are closing and you were waving
And I like you, and I'll never let it show
And you won't wait and maybe I won't mind
I work better on my own
And you were, well, a bit drunk
And then I ask myself

What if it's not meant for me?
Love
What if it's not meant for me?
Love

A few days pass since I last saw you and you have taken over my mind
And I'm telling jokes you made that made me laugh, pretending that they're mine
I wanna tell the whole world about you, I think that that's a sign
I'm losing self control and it's you, it really is, one thousand times
I look at your picture and I smile
How awful's that? I'm like a teenage girl
I might as well write a note in my notebook
That you 'rock my world!'
You do, you really do
You've turned me upside down
And that's okay, I wanna help him
'Cause I like having you around
I'm a love-trick, a romantic cliche and they really are all true
And we catch eyes in a stupid party, I know exactly what to do
I'll take your hand, and we will leave, a French exit for me and you
You know I'm home, and a bit drunk, some things don't change
And I know now

Me and you were meant to be in love
Me and you were meant to be in love
Me and you

I see the signs of a lifetime, you 'til I die
