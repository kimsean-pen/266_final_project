No you don't need it
As much as you used to, do you?
You didn't think that I noticed it, did you?
But I did, yeah
Your loving has a way, has a way
You're pulling me apart as it seams
And I don't believe that you're leaving, 'cause

Remember when it was me
That held you high when you're lonely
The guy you call when you're down
Remember when it was only me
You want on the line
The one I trusted to know me
The one I can't tell a lie
And if I keep it repeating

Maybe I believe I'm fine
Maybe I believe I'm alright
Maybe I believe I'm fine
Maybe I believe I'm alright
Maybe I believe I'm fine
Maybe I believe I'm alright
Maybe I believe I'm fine
Maybe I believe I'm alright
Right, right, yeah

Believe it, I need your love
Believe it, you used to have
Believe it, I need your love
Oh, you don't remember my love

You never answer the questions I ask you
That's on you
And I never question the answers you give me
But I should
Yeah, your loving has a way, has a way
Which makes me forget all my senses
That I don't believe that you're leaving, 'cause

Remember when it was me
That held you high when you're lonely
The guy you call when you're down
Remember when it was only me
You want on the line
The one I trusted to know me
The one I can't tell a lie
And if I keep it repeating

Maybe I believe I'm fine
Maybe I believe I'm alright
Maybe I believe I'm fine
Maybe I believe I'm alright
Maybe I believe I'm fine
Maybe I believe I'm alright
Maybe I believe I'm fine
Maybe I believe I'm alright
Right, right, yeah

Believe it, I need your love
Believe it, you used to have
Believe it, I need your love
You don't remember my love

Where did you go when you're gone
And I need you?
I need your love
You don't remember my love
Like you used to
You used to have
Where did you go when you're gone
And I need you?
I need your
You don't remember my love

Remember when it was me
That held you high when you're lonely
The guy you call when you're down
Remember when it was only me
You want on the line
The one I trusted to know me
The one I can't tell a lie
And if I keep it repeating

Maybe I believe I'm fine

Believe it, I need your love
Believe it, you used to have
Believe it, I need your love
You don't remember my love
