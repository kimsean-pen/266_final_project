You want to be more than just another number,
But It looks like all the contemplation,
It goes on and on, it goes on and on again
Much more
Now the pressures starting to get to ya
All you want to do now is surrender
It goes on and on, it goes on and on again

When you think you've had enough
But it just aint adding it up
I will keep you safe inside
Shelter from the rising tide
Wow yeah

Now you're free to give yourself permission,
All your fears have gone into the mission
We go on and on, we go on and on again
Yea
So much
What's already lost you left behind ya
So when you were down let me remind ya
We go on and on we go on and on again (yea yea)

When you think you've had enough, but it just aint adding it up

I will keep you safe inside, shelter from the rising tide wow yea
