Are you aching for the blade?
That's okay, we're insured
Are you aching for the grave?
That's okay, we're insured

Getting away with it, all messed up
Getting away with it, all messed up
That's the living
Daniel's saving Grace
She's out in deep water
I hope he's a good swimmer

Daniel's plays his Ace
Deep inside his temple
He knows how to serve her
Getting away with it, all messed up
Getting away with it, all messed up
That's the living

Getting away with it, all messed up
Getting away with it, all messed up
That's the living

Daniel drinks his weight
Drinks like Richard Burton

Dance like John Travolta, now
Daniel's saving Grace
He was all but drowning
Now they live like dolphins
Getting away with it, all messed up
Getting away with it, all messed up

That's the living
Getting away with it, all messed up
Getting away with it, all messed up
That's the living
We're getting away with it, all messed up
Getting away with it, all messed up

That's the living
Getting away with it, all messed up
Getting away with it, all messed up
That's the living
Oh, we're getting away with it, all messed up
Getting away with it, all messed up
That's the living
We're getting away with it, we're getting away with it
That's the living
That's the living
