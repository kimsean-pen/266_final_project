Everything's always about you
I worry that you'll end up alone
If I said that I never doubt you
Then I can tell you, baby, I was wrong
When I see you
Every step of the way I'm falling
Every step of the way I'm stumbling, baby (When I see you)
Every step of the way I'm falling
This love is complicated, I think it's overrated
'Cause I feel better on my own, on my own
It's way too complicated, I think it's overrated
'Cause I feel better on my own, on my own
When I see you
Every step of the way I'm falling
Every step of the way I'm stumbling (When I see you)
Every step of the way I'm falling
Every day is better without you
Bad enough that I'm on my own
All you did is make me feel different
When I think about it, you were wrong
This love is complicated, I think it's overrated
'Cause I feel better on my own, on my own
It's way too complicated, I think it's overrated
'Cause I feel better on my own, on my own
When I see you
Every step of the way I'm falling
'Cause every step of the way I'm stumbling (When I see you)
Every step of the way I'm falling
Every step of the way I'm falling
Every step of the way I'm stumbling
Every step of the way I'm falling (Yeah)
When I see you
Every step of the way I'm falling
Every step of the way I'm stumbling
Every step of the way I'm falling
That's why I know I have to let you go away
If I don't then I will never know
That's how I know I should let you go away
If I don't then I will never know
