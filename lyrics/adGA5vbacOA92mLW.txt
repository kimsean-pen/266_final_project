(I wanna go home)
(I wanna go home)

My heart is on the ground
It's been there for too long
Cheap words slip through my mouth
I'd rather show you that I can be strong

Oh, I think I want to go home
Where I belong (I belong)
Singin', moon river movin' west on the 84
Death be callin' my name
Since the day I was born
Only this time I'm not afraid anymore

I been running like the wind
Packing up again
Singin' like my life depends on it
Yeah I'm running like the wind
Never settled in
Funny how my life depends on it
'Cause my heart beat's from the ground
You can listen if you learn my song
(You can listen
You can listen if you learn my song)

I think I want to go home
Where I belong (I belong)
Singin', good vibrations movin' south down the 101
Death be callin' my name since the day I was born
Only this time I'm not afraid anymore

I think I wanna go home
Where the trees get tall lookin'
Out from my bedroom window
Wanna go home
Where my dad works hard
And my mom is a hero
I wanna go home
Back to pick up games and
Anything playing on the radio
Where do I go?
Where do I go?

I think I want to go
Have laugh in the cul-de-sac
Where I learned to skate
I wanna go
Playing air guitar by the lake
And there were no mistakes
No mistakes
