Oil remove shred and tear radiation vapour air
It's the fear so unclear man in motion going nowhere
In our homes stuck in the face spread the word to the populace
Yellow journal yellow journal set the pace feel the rage
Manifestations of a sort so insidious off the point
Simple solution never confusion sport a gun kill a cop
Crazy world of weary thought so receive me had enough

Lock me up
Lock me up
Rot and assimilate
So hot to annihilate

Deviation tonic mess prolonged existence innocence
Is he who speaks isn't weak wheelchair virtue so to speak
Bubonic plague the truth of aids immunity avoid decay
In the trench of pestilence the bible screams announce your faith
Mutterings of death to bring suffocate a newborn thing
Degradation of an age venereal it's all sensation
Protect design the moral plan infallible as propaganda
Completely black with no steps back

Hot to assimilate
We'll rot or annihilate

Agony profusely stains the inner thinking of the brain
Accusations clanking chains experiments with the groans of pain
All prefer no one blames the terror in an animal's screams
In cages our future - the answers insane
