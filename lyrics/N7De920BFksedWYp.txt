Come around to my way of thinkin'
Don't you want to, want to get along?
Everyday just like a vacation with you
When I'm watchin' you and Fidel Castro in the sand, kissin'!

Girl, you got to roll
Sister Havana
Overthrow
Sister Havana

She's comin' on like a bicycle army
Everybody's waitin' for the man to come down from the tower
Every day is just like a vacation with you layin' right here now
I'm watchin you and Fidel Castro in the sand, assassin!

Girl, you got to roll
Sister Havana
Overthrow
Sister Havana
Sister Havana
Sister Havana
Sister Havana

Sister Havana

(There's no time to lose)
I don't care what they say, now
(There's no time to lose)
We could have a holiday, yeah
But there's no time (There's no time to lose)
For hesitation
There's no time (There's no time to lose)
No time for waitin'
There's no time (There's no time to lose)
So let's take the time and get it on today

Girl, you got to roll
Sister Havana
Overthrow
Sister Havana
Sister Havana (sister Havana)
Sister Havana (sister Havana)
Sister Havana

Come around to my way of thinkin'
Come around to my way of thinkin'
Come around to my way of thinkin'
Come around, sister
