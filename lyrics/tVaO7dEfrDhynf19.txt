Are you the one, from my side of town?
Maybe, maybe
It's hard breathing in, it's hard breathing out
Lately, Lately

Louder, harder, better
Oh
As good as it ever gets

Are you the one, from my side of town?
Maybe, maybe
It's something you want, as wrong as it is
Lately, lately, lately, lately

Oh
Louder, harder, better
Oh
As good as it ever gets, better
Oh
Wilder, deeper, better
Oh
As good as it ever gets

Oh

Oh
Louder, harder, better

As good as it ever gets

Are you the one, from my side of town
Maybe, maybe
It's hard breathing in, its hard breathing out
Lately, lately, lately, lately, lately, lately, lately, lately, lately
As good as it ever gets
Oh
Oh
Louder, harder, better
Oh
As good as it ever gets
