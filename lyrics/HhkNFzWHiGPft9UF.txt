Well, I paint a design
On the side for you, mister
I paint a design
Pretty good
I paint a white horse
Or a fire breathin' dragon
I paint a design
On your weddin'

I've been around I think
Workin' this town
Till that's some line of work
Goin' down
Best kind of
Women I find
Can never bring you a pen
Won't let you down, Lordy

I paint a design
On the side for you, mister
I paint a design
Pretty good
I paint a white horse
Or a fire breathin' dragon
I paint a design
On your wedding

The sweetest thing that
I ever seen
Was just where she
Looked at me
And in them eyes I thought
Ever seen
And I can't paint a picture
Of sweet mercy, well

I paint a design
On the side for you, mister
I paint a design
Pretty good
I paint a white horse
Or a fire breathin' dragon
I paint a design
On your wedding

Back when they had that LA
Big earthquake
I paint the bridge and the
Cable break
I pay for mercy and crime
Oh, heaven say
And I can paint a picture
Of your heart when it break real

I paint a design
On the side for you, mister
I paint a design
Pretty good
I paint a white horse
Or a fire breathin' dragon
I paint a design
On your wedding

The crazy mama that I
Used to know
She followed me
Wherever I go
Name I remember but the
Logger gone
She never had no number
For very long, well

I paint a design
On the side for you, mister
I paint a design
Pretty good
I paint a white horse
Or a fire breathin' dragon
I paint a design
On your wedding
