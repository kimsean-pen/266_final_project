Look out the window can you see the sky
What color is it can you see the light
And is it raining yet down in the street
And do you talk to everyone you meet

In the light you can disappear without a trace
In the night every shadow seems to burn your face

Sometimes you think that I can be your friend
But then you know I can't go back again
And yes I'm sorry that I've come so far
But being caustic we forget we are

In the light you can disappear without a trace
In the night every shadow seems to burn your face
