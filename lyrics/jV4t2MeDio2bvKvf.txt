Stay with you together

Yeah, a feelin' that our love will grow
You're my heart, you're my soul
That is the only thing I really know

Let's close the door and believe my burnin' heart
Feeling all right come on, open up your heart
I'll keep the candles burning
Let your body melt in mine
I'm livin' in my, livin' in my dreams

You're my heart, you're my soul
I keep it shining everywhere I go
You're my heart, you're my soul
I'll be holding you forever
Stay with you together
