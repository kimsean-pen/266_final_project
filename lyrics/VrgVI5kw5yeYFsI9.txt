Come closer, you seem so far away
There is something I know you need to say
I feel your emotions when I look in your eyes

Your silence whispering misunderstandings
There's so much you need to realize
You'll feel my emotions if you look in my eyes

Hey darlin', I know you think my love is slipping away
But baby, it's all in your mind, yes
Don't worry, hold on tight and hear me when I say
Baby, it's all in your mind

Believe me, I believe in you
There's nothing this feeling couldn't do
Move closer my darling, feel the love in my eyes, yes

Hey darlin', I know you think my love is slipping away
But baby, it's all in your mind, yes
Don't worry, hold on tight and hear me when I say
Baby, it's all in your mind

I know, know feel my love in you mind

Hey darlin', I know you think my love is slipping away
But baby, it's all in your mind, yes
So don't worry, hold on tight and hear me when I say
Baby, it's all in your mind

Baby, it's all in your mind
Baby, it's all in your mind
Baby, it's all in your mind
Baby, it's all in your mind

Baby, it's all in your mind
Baby, it's all in your mind
Baby, it's all in your mind
Baby, it's all in your mind

Baby, it's all in your mind
Baby, it's all in your mind
