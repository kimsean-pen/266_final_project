Cold finger on the trigger
Behind the line drawn in the sand

Anger rise!
We fight a war
With much at stake
The rights of birth
That no one can take

Overflowing with anger
Soon to be awakening
Will be martyrs on to glory
Dawn finds us in this rage

My finger on the button
With what's so foreign in my sights

Anger rise!
We wage a war... our nature to preserve
By any means... our enemies be gone

No longer can we wait
As an enemy drains our future
As the light of a new day shines
Our anger fuels our march this dawn

As it must be
Dawn of the mad

Call of duty now... all the minutemen rise and shine
Call of duty now... only sovereigns stand the test of time

My finger is on the trigger
Behind the line drawn in the sand

My finger is on this button
With what's so foreign in my sights

Anger rise!
We wage a war... our nature to preserve
By any means... our enemies be gone
No longer can we wait
As an enemy drains our future
As the light of a new day shines
Our anger fuels our march this dawn

As it must be
This dawn of the mad
