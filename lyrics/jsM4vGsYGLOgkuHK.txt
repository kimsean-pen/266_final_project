Come a little closer now
let me tell you what you need
A snake-tongued devil by your side

I will creep right through your mind
And swim right through your veins
Let your blood flow over me

I want to dine in your mind
Trust me... we'll take it from here

Let's all hold these dreams in our broken hands of filth
Replace, begin, forget it all
Shut it off, now, all of it
I'll make you understand
That they are really here and gone

I want to dine in your mind

Collapse on you
The inner rot
We are the Voice of Trespass

Voice of Trespass

We hang you out to dry
Dollar signs in your eyes
Crooked steps by design

You're going somewhere fast
It will never last
Disembowel your formal aim

I'll start slithering
My pockets are getting big
The dollars are in my eyes
The Voice of Trespass

(One, two, three)

We hang you out to dry
Dollar signs in your eyes
Crooked steps by design
You're going somewhere fast
It will never last
Disembowel your formal aim

Voice of Trespass

Voice of Trespass

The lizard tongue snaps at its prey
Clinking glass of celebration
Another puppet is lost in our world
Jolted out of their reverie
Break out, break free
The lizard tongue snaps at its prey

This is not perfection
This is not perfection
This is not perfection
Find yourself

Wake up
Wake up
Wake up

We are hollow
Condemned to the gallows
We are hollow
Condemned to the gallows
We are hollow
Condemned to the gallows
We are hollow
Condemned to the gallows
We are hollow
Condemned to the gallows
We are hollow
Condemned to the gallows
