Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Girls say, boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Hey baby, baby

I'm the kind of girl that hangs with the guys
Like a fly on the wall with my secret eyes
Takin' it in, try to be feminine
With my make-up bag watching all the sin
Misfit, I sit
Lit up, wicked
Everybody else surrounded by the girls
With the tank tops and the flirty words
I'm just sipping on chamomile
Watching boys and girls and their sex appeal
With a stranger in my face who says he knows my mom
And went to my high school

All the boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Girls say, girls say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!

Hey baby, baby
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Boys say, boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
All the boys get the girls in the back

I'm the one they feed upon
Give a bit a star is born
And if you're hot enough you'll get the pass
So you can tell your friends how you made it back
No matter what they say I'm still the same
Somehow everybody knows my name
And all the girls wanna get with the boys
And the boys really like it

All the boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Girls say, girls say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Hey baby, baby
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Boys say, boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
All the boys get the girls in the back

Check it out, it's Bounty Killer, and No Doubt
Jump on the stage watch me going crazy
After wit' myself and one of them gorgeous lady
There is no need to be acting shady
C'mon baby, hey hey baby
Jump on the stage watch me going crazy
After wit' myself and one of them gorgeous lady
There is no need to be acting shady
C'mon baby, hey hey baby
When you rock your hips you know that it amaze me
Got me off the hook and nothing else don't phase me
Can you be my one and only sunshine lady
Now, if now maybe (hey baby)

I'm just sipping on chamomile
Watching boys and girls and their sex appeal
With a stranger in my face who says he knows my mom
And went to my high school (that's right!)

All the boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Girls say, girls say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Hey baby, baby
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Boys say, boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Can you be my one and only sunshine lady
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Girls say, girls say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
When you rock your hips, you know that it amaze me
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Boys say, boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
All the boys get the girls in the back
