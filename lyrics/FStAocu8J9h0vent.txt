People, they don't mean a thing to you
They move right through you, just like your breath
But sometimes I still think of you
And I just wanted you to know
My old friends

I swear I never meant for this
I never meant

Don't look at me that way
It was an honest mistake
Don't look at me that way
It was an honest mistake
An honest mistake

Sometimes I forget I'm still awake
I fuck up and say these things out loud
My old friends

I swear I never meant for this
I never meant

Don't look at me that way
It was an honest mistake
Don't look at me that way
It was an honest mistake
An honest

Don't look at me that way
It was an honest mistake
Don't look at me that way
It was an honest mistake
An honest mistake
