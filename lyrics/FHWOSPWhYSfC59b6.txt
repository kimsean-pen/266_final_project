There you are so gracefully
Putting on a show
Speaking into silence and
You've bottled up your cold
Take me to a foreign place
One without a turn
I'm thinking 'bout the future
As we hold the lakeshore

And I don't wanna go home
I don't wanna go
And I don't wanna go home
I don't wanna go

Said you had your soulmate
How's that looking now?
Collared up your neck
With him, you left that frown
Take me to a quiet place
One without a turn
We'll talk about the future
As we hold the lakeshore

And I don't wanna go home
I don't wanna go
And I don't wanna go home
I don't wanna go

And if that fire's to fade
I won't leave you in the blue
And if that feeling dies
Don't lose sight, you felt it, too
You say it's rapture now
I don't like feeling so used
And when those choirs fade
I'll keep standing up for you

And I don't wanna go home
I don't wanna go (I don't wanna go home)
And I don't wanna go home
I don't wanna go

Oh, I don't wanna go home, home, home
