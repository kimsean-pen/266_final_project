There is a game that men will play
When their good faithful woman's away
They mess around, then make a rude sound
They think that she'll never ever find out

Oh I've been there
Don't want to scare
I had a woman who loved me

Well you can try to be smart
But you will get caught
If you're fooling around
Well you can hide from the Moon
But you'll see it real soon
'Cause the Sun's coming down

Oh she was tall, she had it all
And I lost it all when I heard nature's call
Well I'm not dumb, I've had my fun
And I turn pretty girls on the run, hoo yeah

Oh yeah, I've been there
And I don't easily scare but I

Well you can try to be smart
But you will get caught
If you're fooling around
Well you can hide from the Moon
But you'll see it real soon
'Cause the Sun's coming down

And I'm still waiting for her to this day
The pain it never never never ever go away
Ah, come on!

*barks*

Well you can try to be smart
But you will get caught
If you're fooling around
Well you can hide from the Moon
But you'll see it real soon
'Cause the Sun's coming down

Awoooooo
