You should have seen by the look in my eyes, baby
There was something missin'
You should have known by the tone of my voice maybe
But you didn't listen
You played dead
But you never bled
Instead you laid still in the grass
All coiled up and hissin'
You know I know all about those men
Still I don't remember
'Cause it was us baby, way before them
And we're still together

And I meant every word I said
When I said that I loved you I meant that I love you forever

And i'm gonna keep on lovin' you
'Cause it's the only thing I wanna do
I don't wanna sleep
I just wanna keep on lovin' you

And I meant every word I said
When I said that I love you I meant that I love you forever

And I'm gonna keep on lovin' you
'Cause it's the only thing I wanna do
I don't wanna sleep
I just wanna keep on lovin' you

Baby, I'm gonna keep on lovin' you
'Cause it's the only thing I wanna do
I don't wanna sleep
I just wanna keep on lovin' you
