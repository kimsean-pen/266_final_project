(Breathe in, Breathe out)

Board up your windows but I'm telling you
That it's not gonna do a thing.
It always finds you, but it all depends
On how you battle with the pressure.
You take a left and it's standing in the way
You try to shake it off, but it seems to wanna stay
Your poker face could make them melt
Just sit back and deal with the hand you're dealt.

Face Facts, it won't be easy this time.
Sticks like a tack in the back of my mind.
Hurts so deep when I think too much
And breathing gets harder.

Take a look at me
From one side I seem to be
So calm, so cool, collected
And on the other side, I'm melting down

Stop and think about it
You only have one life
So why mistake it
As something negative?
I am my own worst enemy
Paranoid, can't avoid this killing spree.
I am a victim, but I choose to be
My favorite weapon, lies behind my teeth.
I strive to solve myself
So chin up and deal with the hand you're dealt.

Face Facts, it won't be easy this time.
Sticks like a tack in the back of my mind.
Hurts so deep when I think too much
And breathing gets harder.

Take a look at me, from one side I seem to be
So calm, so cool, collected
And on the other side
I'm melting down. Until then, I will choose to display
All these feelings that I hate
You think you know me but you don't
So look who's laughing now.

Ladies and Gentlemen! Boys & Girls!
Lend me your eyes and ears
I have something to tell you!
Please listen up, right now.

Don't you dare close it off
I can never get enough
When they close cold eyes
Is when I will give it up.
Don't you dare close it off
I can never get enough.

Don't you dare close it off
I can never get enough
When they close cold eyes
Is when I will give it up.
Don't you dare close it off
I can never get enough, get enough.

Take a look at me, from one side I seem to be
So calm, so cool, collected
And on the other side
I'm melting down. Until then, I will choose to display
All these feelings that I hate
You think you know me but you don't.
