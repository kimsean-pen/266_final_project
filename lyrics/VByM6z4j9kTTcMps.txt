I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me
Funny but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh, is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid

If there's a cloud above
And it must rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it
I'm in the mood for love
