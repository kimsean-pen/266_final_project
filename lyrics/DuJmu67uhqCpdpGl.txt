I walk alone again
The streets they have a friend
I walk away
Again I run to my pet town

The evening treats me kind
I get more than I find
In my pet town
I feel so free and I get around

While my house of sand is burning down

Say what you say and go where you go
And you cannot tell what I already know
And it's time for me to shape my heart back with glue
Here in pet town
Say what you say and go where you go
And you cannot tell what I already know
And it's time for me to shape my heart back with glue
Here in pet town

I walk alone again
The streets they have a friend
I walk away
Again I run to my pet town

While my house of sand is burning down

Say what you say and go where you go
And you cannot tell what I already know
And it's time for me to shape my heart back with glue
Here in pet town
Say what you say and go where you go
And you cannot tell what I already know
And it's time for me to shape my heart back with glue
Here in pet town
