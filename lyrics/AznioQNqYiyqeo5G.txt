Kill me if you dare
Hold my head up everywhere
Keep myself right on this train
I'm the Underdog
Live my life on a lullaby

Keep myself riding on this train
Keep myself riding on this train
Life in technicolour
Sprayed out on walls

Well I've been pounding at the pavement
Until there's nothing at all
I got my cloak and dagger
In a bar room brawl

See the local loves a fighter
Loves a winner to fall
Feels like I'm lost in a moment
I'm always losing to win
Can't get away from the moment

Seems like it's time to begin
Kill me if you dare
Hold my head up everywhere
Keep myself right on this train

I'm the Underdog
Live my life on a lullaby
Keep myself riding on this train
Keep myself riding on this train

It don't matter
I won't do what you say
You've got the money and the power
I won't go your way

I can't take for the people
They don't matter at all
I'll be waiting in the shadows
Until the day that you fall
Feels like I'm lost in a moment
I'm always losing to win
Can't get away from the moment
Seems like it's time to begin
Kill me if you dare
Hold my head up everywhere
Keep myself right on this train
I'm the Underdog
Live my life on a lullaby
Keep myself riding on this train
Tell me if you're down
Throw your weapons to the ground
Keep myself right on this train
Hey bud on the wire
Sold yourself for another one
Keep myself riding on this train
Keep myself riding on this train
