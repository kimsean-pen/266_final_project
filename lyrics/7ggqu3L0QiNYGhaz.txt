I've hoped for change
It gets better everyday
I've hoped for change
But still I feel the same
There's something wrong
'Cause everybody knows
That we can't do this on our own
And we got everybody singing
Whoa whoa oh whoa whoa oh
And we got everybody singing
Whoa whoa oh whoa whoa oh
Were doing fine
And it gets better every time
Were doing fine
But I'll let you decide
There's something wrong
'Cause everybody knows
That we can do this all alone
And we got everybody singing
Whoa whoa oh whoa whoa oh
And we got everybody singing
Whoa whoa oh whoa whoa oh
And I'll confess
That I can be a little selfish
Yeah I'll admit
I don't want you to help me through this
I don't want to start over again
And we got everybody singing
And we got everybody singing
Whoa whoa oh whoa whoa oh
And we got everybody singing
Whoa whoa oh whoa whoa oh
And I'll confess
That I can be a little selfish
I can I can
Yeah I'll admit
I don't want you to get me through this
I don't want to start over again
