I know it's hard but
You've gotta deal with it
Why don't you look around
Show me what you're made of
Don't turn around
Go get your gun ready
Everyday there's a way to do it just right

Don't wanna take it and just say it as I saw
You'd never know, just where you gotta go
Don't wanna take it and just say it as I saw
You'd never know, just where you gotta go
Don't run away 'cause that's the deal with it
You gotta turn around, never let your guard down
I'll see you but I know it's gonna save you baby
You always run around breaking the rules with it

I know you tried so hard, but you can't even win
You gotta try a little harder, you're the comeback kid
I know you tried so hard, but you can't even win
You gotta try a little harder, you're the comeback kid

You're gone away but you'll come back someday
You're gone away but you'll come back someday
I know its hard
But you've gotta deal with it
Why don't you look around
Show me what you're made of
Don't turn around
Go get your gun ready
Everyday there's a way to do it just right

I wanna take it and just say it as I saw
You never know, just where you gotta go
I wanna take it and just say it as I saw
You never know, just where you gotta go

You're gone away, but you'll come back someday
You're gone away, but you'll come back someday
I know you tried so hard, but you can't even win
You gotta try a little harder, you're the comeback kid
I know you tried so hard, but you can't even win
You gotta try a little harder, you're the comeback kid

You're gone away, but you'll come back someday
You're gone away, but you'll come back someday
