My earrings cost a half a ticket
I don't hear the same shit y'all niggas hear
On God

Pockets on Cheez-Its, heavy
On the cheddar (Cheddar)
Run off with your money
Savage a.k.a. Jerry Heller (Heller)
Too much drip, I'm rainin'
Bought a Gucci umbrella (Umbrella)
Why you always trippin' bitch?
You must look up to Ella (Ella)
It's only the first night and
She keep tryna snuggle (Snuggle)
I slept on my back just so
I ain't have to cuddle (Cuddle)
Nothing 'bout me average
Hit her with a Fendi rubber (Straight up)
Feel like a magician
All these bitches that I juggle (Straight up)
'Rari red, Bentley black
Got a Demon and a Cat
Check the stats, all facts
Rap made me a lot of racks
Down back, caught a flat
Change his tire, he got jacked
Ass fat, waist snatched
Can I get some of that pussycat?

Hop in the Lambo, brains open (Skrr)
My chain soakin', codeine in my vein

This Patek right here a trophy (Patek)
Passed out on the Herm√®s sofa (Hey)
Straight face, this a game of poker (Game)

Got to flippin' the bitch in the wrist
Just ask your bitch (Ask her)

Don't touch me, don't get frisked
Let's get lit (Lit)
