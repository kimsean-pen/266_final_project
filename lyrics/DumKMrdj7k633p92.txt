All of us girls
We're in and out of love
We're vulnerable
Oh, but we'll tell you that we're tough

Some of these guys
Never think that they'll get caught
Think that we're blind
But they're forgetting that we talk
(Sing it with me)

If he never calls when he says he will
If he always tells you to keep it chill
If you see him out with another girl
Baby, then you know he was never real

If he never wants you to meet his friends
If he ain't tagging you on the 'Gram
Take your heart and turn around while you still can

And tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him
I got somewhere else to be
And I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
Lose my head for nobody

Yeah, If you have to question
Is he loyal to me?
Well then, he's probably not
And you should probably leave

Says he's online
But he told you he's asleep
You stay inside
Like he never wants you to be seen

Ain't got a job, no
Says he 'models on the side'
Swears you're the one
But he's not the label type
(Sing it with me)

If he never calls when he says he will
If he always tells you to keep it chill
If you see him out with another girl
Baby, then you know he was never real

Hope you never let those pictures send
He'll only go show them to his friends
Take your heart and turn around while you still can

And tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him
I got somewhere else to be
And I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
Lose my head for nobody

Yeah, if you have to question
Is he loyal to me?
Well then he's probably not
And you should probably leave

Tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him
I got somewhere else to be
That I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
Lose my head for nobody

Yeah, if you have to question
Is he loyal to me?
Well then he's probably not
And you should probably leave

Yeah, he's probably not
And you should probably leave
