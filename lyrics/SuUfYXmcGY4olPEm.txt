Hmm there she goes uh huh
She moving fast
Like a train
Somebody say babe
Where you going baby
She ran out of patience
Fed up with my lies uh huh
Now she's leaving with no luggage
And a broken heart to the train station
I want her to know
If she come back home I'll be waiting

There she goes (there she goes)
There she goes (there she goes)
There she goes
There she goes
There she goes

There she goes
There she goes

While I was sleeping
She slipped out the back door uh huh
Didn't even even bother
Bother to leave a note uh huh
I want her to know
If she come back home I'll be waiting now

There she goes (there she goes)
There she goes (there she goes)
There she goes
There she goes
There she goes
There she goes
There she goes

Sent ten white letters
In the mail on the fly uh huh
To my baby
Spent ten months still no reply uh huh
I want her to know
If she come back home I'll be waiting now

There she goes (there she goes)
There she goes (there she goes)
There she goes
There she goes
There she goes
There she goes
There she goes

There's no way to change her mind
She's rolling (rolling) uh
Down onto the next town
She going

There she goes (there she goes)
There she goes (there she goes)
There she goes
There she goes
There she goes
There she goes
There she goes
There she goes
