I want the whole world to celebrate (Lets' go!)

I wanna come home
To the only place I know
Where the trees I planted grow
I wanna come home

Once I get up I feel better and I pull myself together
I remember those two letters, it will be OK
Everyone says now or never, I say only if it's better
Be a night like this forever, but we know better

I want the whole world to celebrate
I want the whole world to celebrate
I want the whole world to celebrate
I want the whole world to celebrate

I'll be just fine
When I see you at the finish line
Doesn't matter if I take my time
I'm coming home

Once I get up I feel better and I pull myself together
I remember those two letters, it will be OK
Everyone says now or never, I say only if it's better
Be a night like this forever, but we know better

I want the whole world to celebrate
I want the whole world to celebrate
I want the whole world to celebrate
I want the whole world to celebrate

I'm not mad at you at all
But, I want the whole world to celebrate, yeah, mmh

Right about now it's time for everybody to stand up, stand up, stand up
And have fun, fun, fun, 'cause we just begun

I want the whole world to celebrate (Lets' go!)

Once I get up I feel better and I pull myself together
I remember those two letters, it will be OK
Everyone says now or never, I say only if it's better
Be a night like this forever

I wanna go home (I want the whole world to celebrate)
I wanna go home (I want the whole world to celebrate)
I wanna go home (I want the whole world to celebrate)
I wanna go home (I want the whole world to celebrate)

To celebrate
I'll get the whole world to celebrate
I want the whole world to celebrate
I want the whole world to celebrate
