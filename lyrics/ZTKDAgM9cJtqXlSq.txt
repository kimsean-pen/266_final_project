We, we are in love
And we forever
We not gonna stop
We'll be forever

And all the stars in the sky
And all the flowers in the fields
And all the power in the earth
Could never take you from my heart

And it's forever, baby it's forever
And it's forever, baby it's forever
And let me run till the end of time
Until our hearts are aligned into the sky
Run till the end of time
Until our hearts are aligned into the sky

We, we are the ones
When we're together
We, we are the young
We live forever

And all the stars in the sky
And all the flowers in the fields
And all the power in the earth
Could never take you from my heart

And it's forever, baby it's forever
And it's forever, baby it's forever
And let me run till the end of time
Until our hearts are aligned into the sky
Run till the end of time
Until our hearts are aligned into the sky

Forever ... and ever and amen (repeat)

And it's forever, baby it's forever
And it's forever, baby it's forever
And let me run till the end of time
Until our hearts are aligned in the sky
Run till the end of time
Until our hearts are aligned in the sky
