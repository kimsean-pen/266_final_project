My roadside cross is slate grey
I don't believe in demons
I battle my compulsions

So buy the grave
Don't delay
Don't mourn me
Put my body in the ground

How many people are destroyed
By their need to be loved?
For me it's easy
There's nowhere to sink
I'm at the bottom of the ocean

It's gonna cost more than money
To be buried at the church
I'll never come around
Put my body in the ground

How many people are destroyed
By their need to be loved?
For me it's easy
There's nowhere to sink
I'm at the bottom of the ocean
