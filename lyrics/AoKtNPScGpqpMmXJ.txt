You don't remember what to say
You don't remember what to do
You don't remember where you've been
And you don't remember who to choose

You wheel
And you steal
But you feel
When you kneel down
Down... down... down
Down... down... down

All the stony people
Walking 'round in christian licorice clothes
Lord, I can't hesitate
I know I can't wait
For Pleasant Street
For Pleasant Street

The sunshine reminds you of concreted skies
You thought you were flying
But you opened your eyes
And you found yourself falling
Back down to yesterday's lies
Hello, Pleasant Street
You know she's back again

You wheel
You steal
You feel
You kneel down
Down... down... down
Down... down... down

All the stony people
Walking 'round in christian licorice clothes
Lord, I can't hesitate
I know I can't wait
For Pleasant Street
My little Pleasant Street

At twilight, your lover comes to your room
He's gonna spin you, darling
He's gonna weave you 'round
All around his emerald loom
Oh, but softly he'll whisper
All around your ear
"Sweet lover
Lord, I love my Pleasant Street
Lord, I wheel
And Lord, I steal
Lord, I feel my way down to kneel"
