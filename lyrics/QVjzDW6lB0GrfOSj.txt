A pain seeking, strange feelings takin' over me
Please don't judge me, I am acting, acting differently
And you know me, you know, know what's inside

Please always love me even though
I lo-, I lo-, I lost my mi-ind

Wake up, survive
I will get better, yeah, one day at a time
Something ain't ri-ight, I lost my mi-ind
But I could get better, one day at a time

I'm afraid I'll fail ya, but
Damn I always try
Even if I lose some days, I'll never lose my fight
And you know me, you know, know what's inside

Please always love me even though
I lo-, I lo-, I lost my mi-ind

Wake up, survive
I will get better, yeah, one day at a time
Something ain't ri-ight, I lost my mi-ind
But I could get better, one day at a time

This is my sad soul
Rocking the down fall
Rocking the beat flow
This is my, this is my sad soul
Yeah, this is my sad soul

Please always love me even though
I lo-, I lo-, I lost my mi-ind

Wake up, survive
I will get better, yeah, one day at a time
Something ain't ri-ight, I lost my mi-ind
But I could get better, one day at a time

I lo-, I lost my mi-ind
Wake up, survive
I will get better, yeah, one day at a time
Something ain't ri-ight, I lost my mi-ind
But I could get better, one day at a time
