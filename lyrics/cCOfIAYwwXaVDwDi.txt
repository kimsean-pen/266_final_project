There rides the rainbow demon
on his horse of crimson fire.
Black shadows are following closely
on the heels of his desire.
Riding on in the mist of morning
noone dared to stand in his way.
Posessed by some distant calling.
Riding on through night and day.
Rainbow demon - Pick up your heart and run.
Rainbow demon - Looks for his sword and is gone.
Riding on in the mist of morning
noone dared to stand in his way.
Posessed by some distant calling.
Riding on through night and day.
Rainbow demon - Pick up your heart and run.
Rainbow demon - Looks for his soul and is gone.
(Repeat and fade)
