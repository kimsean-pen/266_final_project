If I was to listen
I'd turn back
Give up all my reasons
Forgive up the past

You think
I'd swallow that
Bear away the ceilings
Just to stop and ask

Of fluorescein
Fluorescein
Fluorescein
Thorazine

They give you this
They take away that
Thorazine
There will be no rallies

There will be no long lost friends
Empty all the insides
Empty of the last pretends
You stand by your feeling of an end

So many lives, lights
Runaway life
So many lights

When they locked you up
They shut me out
And gave me the keys
So I could show you 'round

But we were not allowed
Omens of a daydream
A cottage you're bound

By thorazine
Fluorescein
Fluorescein
Thorazine

They give you this
They take away that
Fluorescein

There will be no rallies
There will be no long lost friends
Caught in on the spotlight
Running out of present tense

Ha-ha ha-ha ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
No one will get that until the book
(Or this blog)
Fixed on a feeling of an end

So many lights
Runaway

Please come back
Please come back
Please come back
Pale horse

Please come back
Please come back
Please come back
Pale horse

Please come back
Please come back
Please come back
Pale horse

Please come back
Please come back
Please come back
Pale horse

After all the craic I told you
About the neon black light world
Level, floor of the tripping house

'Flourescein' is a smile
Especially since you produced
The black light tinged affair
For 'glow' after being told about it
