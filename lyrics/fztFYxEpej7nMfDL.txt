I will keep you alive

Dark clouds above you
Soaring on the sky like the breath of our dying days
I know this world can spin you around
Faster than your heart can stand its ground
You always had the world on your shoulders
And above you carried the clouds
But you can't keep your head under water
And still expect us to hear your despair
Hear my voice through the discord

Breathe in, breathe out
Even though it hurts on the inside
I know that here at the end of the road
Your love will shine on
Chin up, stay strong
Never let the world tell you wrong
I know that here at the end of the road
Your spark will shine through

The fluid in your lungs weigh you down like an anchor of death
You must reach up for the surface
I know this world has darkened you
Carry on the light in your eyes, I will guide you back
You are not alone
The sound of your innocence drowns tonight
Let it immerse to the discord
The surface of life will reflect our lights
It's the essence for bringing you back

As the water fills your lung with despair, you sink to a bottomless hole of depression
The choirs of chastity sings your name, but beneath the surface, you cannot hear
And I know it's hard to look up when the world stares you back
But if you follow the sound of absolution, you will find your feet on a solid ground
And I will sweep my arms around you and keep you safe for as long as you need me to
And as your heavy heart sinks to the bottom, I know that life will lead the way
Life will guide you home

Breathe in, breathe out
Even though it hurts on the inside
I know that here at the end of the road
Your love will shine on
Chin up, stay strong
Never let the world tell you wrong
I know that here at the end of the road
Your spark will shine through

Don't speak a word of you letting go
'Cause I know you will make it through
Don't close the light that will carry you
'Cause I know you will make it through
Breathe in, breathe out
