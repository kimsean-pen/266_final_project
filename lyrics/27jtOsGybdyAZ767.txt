Send us a blindfold
Send us a blade
Tell the survivors
"Help is on the way"

I was a blindfold
Never complained
All the survivors
Singing in the rain

I was the one with
The world at my feet
Got us a battle
Leave it up to me

Find us a trapdoor
Find us a plane
Tell the survivors
"Help is on the way"

I was a blindfold
Who never complained
All the survivors
Singing in the rain

I was the one with
The world at my feet
Got us a battle
Leave it up to me

What it is and where it stops
Nobody knows
You gave me a life
I never chose
I wanna leave but the world
Won't let me go
Wanna leave but the world
Won't let me go

What it is and where it stops
Nobody knows
You gave me a life
I never chose
I wanna leave but the world
Won't let me go
Wanna leave but the world
Won't let me go

What it is and where it stops
Nobody knows
You gave me a life
I never chose
I wanna leave but the world
Won't let me go
Wanna leave but the world
Won't let me go

What it is and where it stops
Nobody knows
You gave me a life
I never chose

I was the one with
The world at my feet
Got us a battle
Leave it up to me

Leave it up to me
Leave it up to me
