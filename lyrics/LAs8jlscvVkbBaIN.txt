When I learned - feel alive
And you know you were fine
Sharing knives, cut and go
I just hoped that you were home

It was faintest cry, in a sorry place
In the faintest times, I will never forget why... I always liked you and I

It was a dead holiday
I just lost my head, I couldn't stay
When you find that you were lost in the fray
I will hold my breath another day

It was faintest cry, in a sorry place
In the faintest times, I will never forget why... I always liked you and I

You and I
