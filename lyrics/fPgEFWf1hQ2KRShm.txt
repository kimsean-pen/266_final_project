Still, I think of you baby
And how I grew old with you then
In the summer
You'll go maybe
And act as if we were old friends
You'd say, "How are you, baby?"
I'd say, "It's raining in Athens"
It's raining in Athens
And to this day I miss the fever
That spoiled my poor heart
And I've mastered
The art of dealing
Slipping away
Without falling apart
So in the summer
You'll call maybe
And ask how I've been
I can be honest
And answer plainly
"Since November it's been raining."
It's raining in Athens
