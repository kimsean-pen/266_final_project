You can study 'til it makes you sick
It won't change it
The tempo is still at your side
It keeps you up at night

My arms are full of rage
Most days, all I do is pace
Mouthing mantras to keep me calm
I've exhausted

You can study 'til it makes you sick
You won't change it

My arms are full of rage
Most days, all I do is pace
Mouthing mantras to keep me calm
I've exhausted

My arms are full of rage
Most days, all I do is pace
Mouthing mantras to keep me calm
I've exhausted

You can keep the past away
You can keep the past away
Mouthing mantras to make me calm
Look at what I've done

You can keep the past away
You can keep the past away
Mouthing mantras to make me calm
Look at what I've done

I've a floating head
Between trash and frustration
I've a floating head
Between trash and frustration

I'm not coming back
I'm not coming back
I'm not coming back
I'm not coming back

Knowing what I want is not a want
Is wanting not
Is floating
Knowing what I've become is never done
Will come along
Is floating

I'm not coming back
I'm not coming back
I'm not coming back
I'm not coming back

You can keep the past away
You can keep the past away
Mouthing mantras to make me calm
Look at what I've done

You can keep the past away
You can keep the past away
Mouthing mantras to make me calm
Look at what I've done
