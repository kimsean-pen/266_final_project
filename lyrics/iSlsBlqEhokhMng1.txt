You make me feel like I'm losin' my virginity
The first time, every time when you're touchin' me
I'll make you bloom like a flower that you never seen
Under the sun, we are one bosomed energy

Let's pollinate to create a family tree
This evolution with you comes naturally
Some call it science (science), we call it chemistry
This is the story of the birds and the bees

And even when seasons change
Our love still stays the same

You give me the hummingbird heartbeat
You spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me the hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Oh oh, hummingbird heartbeat
Oh oh, hummingbird heartbeat
I've flown a million miles just to find the magic seed

Oh, white flower with the power to bring life to me
You're so exotic, my whole body fluttering
Constantly craving for a taste of your sticky-sweet
Always on the brink of a heart attack

You give me life and keep me comin' back
I see the sunrise in your eyes, your eyes

We've got a future full of blue skies, blue skies
Even the seasons change
Our love still stays the same
You give me the hummingbird heartbeat

Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me the hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat

Oh oh, hummingbird heartbeat
Oh oh, hummingbird heartbeat
You love me, you love me
Never love me not, not, oh no
When we hear a perfect harmony
You make me sound like, like a symphony, oh
Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
You give me the hummingbird heartbeat
Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Oh oh, hummingbird heartbeat
Oh oh, hummingbird heartbeat
Oh oh, hummingbird heartbeat
Oh oh, hummingbird heartbeat
