Living's too short, you are the watch while time is ticking
I forgot how fast we move, let's be efficient
Before I've got to go
Before I've got to go

And when I get back,
we'll make up all the time that we've been missing
If you're in a slump, you better fix that posture, won't be long
Before I've got to go
Before I've got to go

You better wait, better wait, better wait for me
You better wait, better wait, better wait for me

When I'm away, you'll be all I ever think about
When I come home, you'll be all I ever talk about
When I'm away, you'll sing this song as you think of me
When I'm away, I'm away, will you wait for me?

If you believe, if you believe, if you believe then show
Don't be afraid, I'm more than a shot in the dark
But baby I've got to know
Before I've got to go

If you believe, if you believe, if you believe then show
Don't be short-sighted, blindsided, before I get up, get up and go
'Cause I've got to know
Before I've got to go

You better wait, better wait, better wait for me
You better wait, better wait, better wait for me

When I'm away, you'll be all I ever think about
When I come home, you'll be all I ever talk about
When I'm away, you'll sing this song as you think of me
When I'm away, I'm away, will you wait for me?

Will you wait for me?
Will you wait for me?

When I'm away, you'll be all I ever think about
When I come home, you'll be all I ever talk about
When I'm away, you'll sing this song as you think of me
When I'm away, I'm away, will you wait for me?
