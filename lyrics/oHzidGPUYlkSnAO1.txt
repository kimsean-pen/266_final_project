She's gone away
Flying out on a jet plane
Told me, she won't be back again
And Talullah, Talullah is her name

Well, I got this thing, girl
I wanted to say to you
Talullah, I'm still missing you
Baby, can't you stop that plane
Turn it around, I still love you, babe
Tell the captain that I'm to blame
I'm to blame

There's ink stained with tears
All these letters from my heavy heart
This is what I always feared
That these sparks would fly
And we would break apart

But I got this thing, girl
I wanted to say to you
Talullah, I'm still missing you
I miss you so
Baby, can't you stop that plane
Turn it around, I still love you, babe
Tell the captain that I'm to blame
I'm to blame

You gotta stop that plane
Turn it around, turn it around
You gotta stop it
You gotta stop it now
And turn it around
You're my magic star
Don't you fly too far from me
From me, from me
Can't you see

There's a hole in my soul
And I'm losing control
And it's not to late for you
to be my magic star
Cannot see now babe I'm so solitaire
I think I'm your midnight hare
It's still the same
'cause you're round my brain
Gotta stop that way to
Come and see my baby

She's Ooooh gone away
Flying out on a jet plane
Told me, she won't be back again
And Talullah, Talullah is her name

I curl up tight
So alone, I can't sleep at night
Return to sender, that's me tonight
I really think I'm lost in space
I shut my eyes, I still see your face
Reach out touching your soft embrace

You gotta stop that plane

Now there's a hole in my soul
And I'm losing control
I'm not, you're my magic star
But you've gone away
And flown too far this time
As Talullah, Talullah, Talullah la la la la la

Stop that plane, turn it around, baby
You got to come and see me
Stop that plane, turn it around, baby
I know you don't need me to stop that plane
And turn it around
Turn it around
I need to see you, babe
I need to see you, baby and you
You're my magic star
Don't you fly too far
Stop that plane
Turn it around, turn it around
