Sitting in the back, baby, park it or drive
Breathing out the cracks just to stay alive
Earthquake, body shake, joke is all on me
I remember when, I remember the time
Didn't have to take just to feel alive
Eyes black, head back, joke is all on me

Blame all your life on me
Blame all your life on me
I gave it all for free
Blame all your life on me
All on me, oh

Everything I wanted was in my hand
I gave it all up for a better man
Who beat me down but on the ground I stand
Sitting in the back, baby, hardly alive
If I'm about to crack, kick the pedal and drive
All this time the joke was all on me

Blame all your life on me
Just blame all your life on me
I gave it all for free
Blame all your life on me

Hit me with the wind again
Hit me with the wind I know
I have lost a friend again
I have lost a friend
I know how the story goes

Blame all your life on me
You blame all your life on me
Cause I gave it all for free
So blame all your life on me
All on me, oh
