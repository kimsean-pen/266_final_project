I lost connection with all of my best friends.
I wanted to feel the sensation of cutting the cord.
Regrets they present from the past inside of my head.
I can only imagine a breath of fresh air.
Life has too many entrances & exits,
Well, maybe, they not so different after all!

Brown eyes, blue dress.
(Tell me off!)
I need a sweet voice to in front in my situation.

Brown eyes, blue dress.
Tell me off!
I need a sweet voice, need sweet voice!

(Tell me off!)
I strain my voice too many times,
(Tell me off!)
Forever saying our goodbyes.

(Tell me off!)
I strain my voice too many times,
(Tell me off!)
Forever saying our goodbyes.
(Tell me off!)
