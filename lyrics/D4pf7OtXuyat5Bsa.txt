When I feel like I'm loving kissing and hugging
I think about you
When my heart starts to burn and I get that crazy and mean
I think about you
When that feel comes all over me it's true
I want to see nobody but you
When I need to satisfy me without revving
Oh yeah I think about you
I think about you
You
You
Oh I think about you
I think about
You
You
Oh I think about you
When my body starts to sweat
you can say that I think about you
When I start to pass of through
all that I can't hey hey no no I think about you
I think about you
You
You
You
Oh I think about you
I think about you
You
You
Have a feeling, a different thing
Comes all over me again and again
You are the one who'd be
When my love comes down
Wishing always
Wishing always
Wishing always
Be around
When I feel like I'm loving kissing and hugging
and stuff, I think about you
When my heart starts to burn
and I get that crazy and then I think about you
I think about you
You
You
Oh I think about you
I think about you
You
You
You
Oh I think about you
Have a feeling, a different thing
Comes all over me again and again
You are the one who'd be
When my love comes down
Wishing always
Wishing always
Wishing always
Be around
Be around
Be around
Be around
Be around
Be around
