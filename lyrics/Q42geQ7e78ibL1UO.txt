Waitin' on my true love
Waitin' on my true love
Waitin' on my true love
Waitin' on my true love

And I get so tired of people
Wonderin' what I'm doin'
But I'm waitin' for you
And girl I waste my time
And spend it on my wishes
Just wishin' that you're waitin' too

Waitin' on my true love
(Yes you know I'm waitin')
Waitin' on my true love
(Oh you know I'm waiting)
Waitin' on my true love
(Girl you know I)
Waitin' on my true love

Can't sugar coat it, I'm devoted
To the notion of me and you
And I'm hopin' that you open
Up your heart 'cause you feel it too

On my mother you done wrapped
Me in the feelings that I feel
And my father well he told me
Boy those feelings they are real
So I'm waitin' for you girl
Come and find me
So I can leave this lonely world
Behind me, oh

(You know I'm waiting ya)
Waitin' on my true love
(Yes you know I'm waiting)
Waitin' on my true love
(And oh I get so tired)
Waitin' on my true love
(Yes you know I'm waiting ya)
Waitin' on my true love

You know I get so tired
Sittin' here at night
Wishin' and wonderin' and dreamin'
When you'd be by my side
You know I get so tired
Sittin' here alone
Wondering why you ain't
Never come alone, oh baby

Waitin' on my true love
(Yes you know I'm waiting, oh yeah)
Waitin' on my true love
(And oh I get so tired oh)
Waitin' on my true love
