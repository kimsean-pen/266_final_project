Little blue houses
Sitting high on the mountainside
Little blue houses
Sitting high on the mountainside

Oh, want to be high
On the mountainside
Want to be high
(To be high, to be high)
On the mountainside

Maybe all the wolves could lose my scent
And I could stay here for a while

Little safe houses
Sitting high on the mountainside
Little safe houses
Sitting high on the mountainside

Oh, want to be safe
On the mountainside
Want to be safe
(To be safe, to be safe)
On the mountainside

Maybe all the wolves could lose my scent
And I could stay here for a while

Little blue houses
Sitting high on the mountainside
Little blue houses
Sitting high on the mountainside

Oh, want to be high
On the mountainside
Want to be high
(To be high, to be high)
On the mountainside

Maybe all the wolves could lose my scent
And I could stay here for a while
