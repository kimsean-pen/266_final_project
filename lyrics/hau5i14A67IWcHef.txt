Night falls
We're covered over now
We're covered over now
Daylight
Sometimes it ends too soon
And I don't want to sleep

Til I remember lending softer ears to my lungs
Til I remember lending softer ears to my lungs
And maybe if I hold you now, would you hold me now?
And maybe if I hold you now, would you hold me now?

Night falls
And we're getting older too
We're getting older too
Life
Sometimes it ends too soon
Sometimes it ends too soon

Til I remember lending softer ears to my lungs
Til I remember lending softer ears to my lungs
And maybe if I hold you now, would you hold me now?
And maybe if I hold you now, would you hold me now?

We're getting older
We're getting older too

We're getting older
We're getting older too
