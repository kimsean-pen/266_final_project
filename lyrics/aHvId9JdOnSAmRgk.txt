I woke up late this morning
How did I get that bad
It's the same old lonesome song
And all, all my faith is gone
Oh Why, oh hurtin' so bad

I got teardrops, I got teardrops on my camera
Thinking 'bout the good times, that we had
My friends all, all say be strong
You just got to carry one
I, Oh I hurtin' so bad

You know I got me,
I got me two arms free wrapped up in love
But that don't feel any good
I believe it takes a good woman
To mellow bad bad man if you try
I believe you really could

Your lovin' ways, so warm and tender
Your worst was the best I ever had
So come on back home
It's so hard to live alone
I, Oh I hurtin' so bad

Yeah I, I got me
Two or three times of love
But that don't do me no good
You know it takes a good woman
To love a bad bad man if you try
I know you really could ooooh

Your lovin' ways, so warm and tender
Your worst was the best I ever had
So come on back home
It's so hard to live alone
I, Oh I hurtin' so bad
Hey yeah you know I love you so bad
Sometime I feel like I, I
Sometime I gotta sit down and I
Every once in a while
Every once in a while
I gotta talk to you baby
I gotta talk to you baby
