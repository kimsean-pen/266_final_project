I learned that hunger is a symptom
of adopting bad behavior
I bit my tongue last night
Woke up with blood on my pillow
I woke up thirsty

Words makes less sense to me these days
Faces looks flat and unfamiliar
Do you wanna rest forever?
Underwater it gets better

When I get better
I'll treat you like I used to
I'll do the things you want me to

Sometimes I feel like I'm a seahorse
Sometimes I think that I'm a horseshoe crab
I don't have anything in common
With myself, except that I came from the sea
Just like everyone else did
But it is so unfamiliar now
Everything is so unfamiliar now

I learned that hunger is the same thing
As adopting bad behavior
I bit my tongue last night
Woke up with blood on my pillow
I woke up thirsty

Words makes less sense to me these days
Faces looks flat and unfamiliar
Do you wanna rest forever?
Underwater it gets better

When I get better
I'll treat you like I used to
I'll do the things you want me to

Sometimes I feel like I'm a seahorse
Sometimes I think that I'm a horseshoe crab
I don't have anything in common
With myself, except that I came from the sea
Just like everyone else did
But it is so unfamiliar now
Everything is so unfamiliar now
