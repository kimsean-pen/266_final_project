I know that it's late, and maybe I shouldn't be so into you
It's just that tonight, I am so taken I'm fallen for you
When I look in your eyes, I can see a million possibilities
And I know you'll be leaving me soon, but tonight

Come a little bit closer, let me hold you baby
I will be good to you, and we can try

To forget tomorrow, make it last forever, tonight

So if you must go, know that I'll be missing you wishing you closer
So let's make the most of these moments together we'll never forget
And it's breaking my heart because I know
That tomorrow you'll be miles away
And I catch myself wanting so much more, tonight come closer
Come a little bit closer
Let me hold you baby
I will be good to you
And we can try
To forget tomorrow
And make it last forever tonight
So if you're leaving me now
Baby I don't know how
I will ever get over you
Because you opened my eyes
To this love that's inside
Oh baby, don't ever, ever leave me
Come a little bit closer
Let me hold you baby
I will be good to you
And we can try
To forget tomorrow
And make it last forever tonight
