A fire of unknown origin took my baby away.
Fire of unknown origin took my baby away.
Swept her up and off my wavelength.
Swallowed her up like the ocean in a fire thick and gray.
Death comes sweeping thru the hallway like a ladies' dress.
Death comes riding down the hallway in its Sunday best.
Death comes driving; death comes creeping; death comes I can't do nothing.
Death goes, there must be something that remains.
Death, it made me sick and crazy 'cause that fire took my baby away.
