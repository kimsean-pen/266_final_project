Re-ignition translation begin
Cosmopolitan reflection well thin.
When our action cause reaction what starts
a transmission of a love in one heart.

Re-ignition
Re-ignition

I came down to make you overstand
that this gross sphere is not Jah land.
Apart-outside, who can escape.
Our destiny confirmed in fate.

Re-igniton cancellation can't win
No celesty ever resting begin
When grace melts inside your hand and my heart
Is the glory that much closer or apart.

Re-ignition
Re-ignition

We hope to make you overstand
that this gross sphere is not Jah land,
apart-outside who can escape
our destiny confirmed in fate.

Always and forever near or far.
Safe in your bosom here we are.
Pain does not mean feel no joy.
Re-ignition for girl and for boy.

We come to make you overstand
that this gross sphere is not Jah land
Apart-outside who can escape
Millenium confirmed in fate.
