Strewn, laid out flat and cold
Give up all your remnants of silver
Sandstone and clay, we'll never be reluctant
Through the famine and fame, we'll always be the same

You made your move when I wasn't ready yet
Look out at what you did with your tunnel vision
You left your mark, heartless without a key
Move fast and step aside, should be nothing to it

Flume fade out, sad and old
Seal up all your desired simplicity
Sandstone and clay, we'll never be reluctant
Through the famine and fame, we'll always be the same

You made your move when I wasn't ready yet
Look out at what you did with your tunnel vision
You left your mark, heartless without a key
Move fast and step aside, should be nothing to it
