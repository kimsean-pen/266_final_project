Johnny, Johnny

I thought you were my real ride or die
You told me you'd always be by my side
We had kids and a fridge with the sauces inside (we had the sauces)
But it turns out that you were telling lies (telling lies)
All I ever wanted is to be a dad (be a dad)
But you took that away and gave it right to Chad
He's so ripped and so hot
How can I compete with that
I'm Humpty Dumpty 'cause you shattered me, now let's together sad

Johnny Johnny, do you miss me? (Yes, Papa!)
Johnny Johnny, have you moved on yet? (No, Papa!)
Promise me you won't forget me (Forget me!)
If you ever wanna see me just don't eat your broccoli, oh
Johnny Johnny, do you miss me? (Yes, Papa!)
Johnny Johnny, have you moved on yet? (No, Papa!)
Promise me you won't forget me (Forget me!)
If you ever wanna see me just don't eat your broccoli, oh

You were my everything and now we're done (Done)
I bought you ball ice cream and fun (Fun)
Come Johnny, just slide and come
Back into my life 'cause I miss my son, yeah
And now I know why it's called "Billion Surprise Toys" (ay)
Cause you've been running around with billion surprise boys (yeah)
Shoulda known when you was acting kind of distant
Copyright claiming shit like I never existed

Johnny Johnny, do you miss me? (Yes, Papa!)
Johnny Johnny, have you moved on yet? (No, Papa!)
Promise me you won't forget me (Forget me!)
If you ever wanna see me just don't eat your broccoli, oh
Johnny Johnny, do you miss me? (Yes, Papa!)
Johnny Johnny, have you moved on yet? (No, Papa!)
Promise me you won't forget me (Forget me!)
If you ever wanna see me just don't eat your broccoli, oh

Johnny, Johnny
