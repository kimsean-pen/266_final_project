Go fuck yourself 'til you bleed
Move

I don't give a fuck, I'll take what I want
I've been waiting years
Fuck this, I'm done
Feeling like I threw my fucking life away
Feeling like I threw my fucking life away
Make me release all the stress that I package
Pressing me under the debts that I managed
Energy comes to me in avalanches
Wipe out my enemies, I run around them

Easy bro
Watch your tone
I'm insane we don't really know
Easy bro
Easy bro
I finessed life, it's on easy mode

All of my problems, I solve, yeah
I set the pace then I go, yeah
Watch out for me, I'ma glow, uh
Stone on my wrist, Hublot
If I start cutting you off
Nigga, you're making me slow
Why would I fake floss?

These niggas act rich and they're broke
Stunting for the fam, ain't sick no more
Gotta let me in when I kick that door
When I run around this industry
Don't wanna hear you run your jaw
And it's terrible how they're not memorable
Still, I'm so sick, I might vomit and let it go
I am a general, never comparable

Took off the mask because niggas was wearing them, oh
Trapped in my brain, I'm connected to flows
Thinking of business and making it grow
DXXM on my face and my name on my fist
Now you know why I'm not taking a joke
I don't give a fuck no more
Gonna snap all day 'til I'm dead or bored
I'ma live past phases and out live more
Ahh, I'm a fucking legend (Ahh)

I'm a living legend (Legend)
I'm a living legend (Ahh)
I'm a living legend (Ayy)
You're a walking corpse (Break)
I'm a living legend (Legend)
I'm a living legend (Legend)
I'm a living legend (Legend)
You're a walking corpse (Ayy)

Easy bro
Watch your tone
I'm insane we don't really know
Easy bro
Easy bro
I finessed life, it's on easy mode
Easy bro
Watch your tone
I'm insane we don't really know
Easy bro
Easy bro
I finessed life, it's on easy mode

I've been working on my craft
I've been bouncing on my toes
Sipping liquor, there's a drought
I won't ever overdose
Still buying shit cash
We don't ever need a quote
I've been drowning in cheques
I should buy a fucking boat

Go fuck yourself â€˜til you bleed
Move
I don't give a fuck
I'll take what I want
I've been waiting years
Fuck this, I'm done
Feeling like I threw my fucking life away
Feeling like I threw my fucking life away
I don't give a fuck
I'll take what I want
I've been waiting years
Fuck this I'm done
Feeling like I threw my fucking life away
Feeling like I threw my fucking life away
Yeah
