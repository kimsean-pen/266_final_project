It's 10 to 5, you probably should start walking,
Or else you won't get home before it gets light,

So if the Earth should spin right off its axis
And roll out into space you'd be wrapped up tight,

So if it all came tumbling down,
You wouldn't be aware, you wouldn't hear a sound,
And when the walls come crashing in,
Leaving pock marks where our houses should have been,

I could have been more cautious,
I could have been less kind,
I should have held my tongue until I knew that it was right,
I could have been more careful,
I wonder if you tried,
To brace yourself from falling, to compete with my high,
But there's no happy ending,
Won't be a big surprise,
We were a roman candle, we burned out in the night,
This is fact not fiction,
Should have held them in your lungs,
The words I said are spinning, reeling,
The way that you'd use wait a turn,

I could have been more cautious,
I could have been less kind,
I should have held my tongue until I knew that it was right,
I could have been more careful,
I wonder if you tried,
To brace yourself from falling, to compete with my high,
But there's no happy ending,
Won't be a big surprise,
We were a roman candle, we burned out in the night,
This is fact not fiction,
Should have held them in your lungs,
The words I said are spinning, reeling,
The way that you'd use wait a turn,

Words,
Mean,
Say,

Only fools rush in,
And I'm no fool.
