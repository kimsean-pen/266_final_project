You know we don't care at all
Let, let me see you up, up against the wall

Two step

I was just doin' my thing
Hanging out at the spot you know the place we go
The music sure plays hot and everybody was feeling the DJ
Smoke cleared and I saw a beautiful lady
The lights went low and the disco ball came down
She walked up to me so and you know what happens now
The girl was fine and she knew she had game
What more do I have to say

She took my hand
We never said a word at all we started grinding
Shorty had me up against the wall
Ask me about tomorrow you know that I don't care at all
I just got caught up when she had me up against the wall
You know we don't care at all
(Just get caught up when you're up against the wall)
We don't, we don't care at all
(You know we don't care at all, let, let me see you up, up against the wall)

It's almost 2 o'clock it's time to make my move
The after hours spot is where I'm going to
'Cause I gotta have some more
Looking for somebody to hit the dance floor
And lucky for me I see a fine young lady's eyeing me
The lights are low and her friends were all around
I walked up to her so and you know what happens now
She turned around and she worked it the worst way
What more do I have to say

She took my hand we never said a word at all
We started grinding shorty had me up against the wall
Ask me about tomorrow you know that I don't care at all
I just got caught up when she had me up against the wall
She already had me up against the wall

Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the cutest one you saw?
She's underneath the disco ball, the disco ball? the disco ball
Standing next to strobe lights, dancin' hot, lookin' tight
The freaks sure do come out at night, out at night, night, night, night
What more (whoo) do I have to say?

Two step

She took my hand we never said a word at all
We started grinding shorty had me up against the wall
Ask me about tomorrow you know that I don't care at all
I just got caught up when she had me up against the wall (x2)

We don't, we don't care at all
You know we don't care at all
Just get caught up when you're up against the wall
We don't, we don't care at all
You know we don't care at all
That that we see you up, up against the wall
We don't, we don't care at all
You know we don't care at all
Just get caught up when you're up against the wall
We don't, we don't care at all
You know we don't care at all
That that we see you up, up against the wall
