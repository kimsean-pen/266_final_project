I will do your interview
Try to explain what I'm going through
Give you something to read into
In a million different ways
A sick version of telephone starts at the clip of the microphone
A game we thought we had all outgrown, but still everybody plays

Ignoring all of the remedies, believing all of the rumors
With their endless database
I wanna sit with my enemies and say
We should have done this sooner
While I look them in the face
Maybe that would crack the case

I got a friend who's been thinking
About finally kicking her husband out
His second life as a talent scout, finally got him caught
While she was throwing out all his clothes
She heard a voice from beyond the throes
Punish him for the life he chose
But forgive the past that he did not!

It's really hard to hate anyone
When you know what they've lived through
And once they've given you a taste
She said
This is for you to overcome
But I will always love you
In her perfect state of grace
Maybe that would crack the case

Now that we're through with formalities
What is it you wanna ask of me?
I'll answer open and honestly
Whatever that means
Findin' out that we occupy
Somebody else's opposin' side
On the banks of some great divide
Two versions of a dream

Countless revisions of history
Tryin' to tell us the future
Between each commercial break
I wanna call off the cavalry
Declare no winners or losers
And forgive our shared mistakes
You can pick the time and place
Maybe that would crack the case
