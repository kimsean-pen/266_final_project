Can you stay here next to me?
We'll just keep drivin'
Because of you I see a light
The Buick's a Century, a '73 like you
Some strange religion
I get my hands on some money momma, and a shot in the night
Stared down the past and just scarred my eyes
Now I know there's no easy ride
She's been the kind who would take it in stride
Some jack of diamonds kicked her heart around
Did they know they were walking on holy ground?
Almost called it a day so many times
Didn't know what it felt like to be alive
'Til you been a friend to me, like nobody else could be
Keep my hands on the wheel now momma
Gonna honestly try
She looked past the scars and the burned out eyes
You could see I'm no easy ride
She's just the kind who might get you to buy
Some strange religion
This jack of diamonds kicked her heart around
Shoulda known they were walking on holy ground
This life might eventually just be the end of me, will I still be with you
Get in next to me, just keep driving
Cause of you I been alive
And this Buick's a Century, '73 like you
Some strange religion
The Buick's a Century, '73 like you
Some strange religion
