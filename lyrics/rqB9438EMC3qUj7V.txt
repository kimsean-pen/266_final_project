And now, for my next number
I'd like to return to the classics

Growing up, I had a dream in my mind
Then it came true, now it got me losing my mind
I don't wanna seem ungrateful so I keep it inside
Got me reminiscing, thinking of a simpler time
Like me and Lopez used to skate down the block
Passing time, spitting rhymes at the old parking lot
I can't even drive past all the spots that I love
'Cause they're nothing even close to anything like it was
But when I see a group of kids in the spot
I wanna shake 'em, wanna tell 'em they don't know what they got
Wish that I could travel back and try to tell me to stop
'Cause I had everything, I never needed a lot

It's like I woke up one day and suddenly I grew up
I can't remember what had happened, it was all too abrupt
Drive around my old town, it's pathetic, I know
The only time that I was happy and I can't let it go

Was it all really better then?
Or am I just getting in my head?
And I just wanna go back
I wish that I could just go back
Was it all really better then?
Or am I just getting in my head?
And I just wanna go back
I wish that I could just go back

I would never trade a friend for the fame
But I been on the road touring and it isn't the same
Losing touch with all the ones that I love
How many calls I gotta miss 'til they stop giving a fuck?
Been feeling down so I hit up my mom
She told me everything will pass so put it all in a song
I know my family can see I got a lot on my plate
Seems like every time I'm home it's only just for the day
So I been putting all my thoughts in this verse
And I don't know that if it's helping or it's making it worse
I just know its been a while since I felt like I'm fine
I've been trying to learn to live my life one day at a time

It's like I woke up one day and suddenly I grew up
I can't remember what had happened, it was all too abrupt
Drive around my old town, it's pathetic, I know
The only time that I was happy and I can't let it go

Was it all really better then?
Or am I just getting in my head?
And I just wanna go back
I wish that I could just go back
Was it all really better then?
Or am I just getting in my head?
And I just wanna go back
I wish that I could just go back

Go back
