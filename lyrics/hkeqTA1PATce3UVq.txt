You were born
in a southern fall
It might have been sunday
but I can't recall
All the birthdays
I must have missed
Your first steps
and your first kiss
I don't even know
if you know my name
but you should hear the truth
before it's too late
so I hope this finds you
on some highway
'cause I'm an old time rambler
I call the road my home
Forgive my indiscretion
It's the only way I know
A million miles from Kentucky
but I will always be around
So turn the radio up
When your heart breaks down
I played for tips
and I played for less
I played a pretty southern girl
right out of her dress
She danced until the lights came on
There's a reason she's here
instead of being at home
She said the songs you sang
made the whole room cry
And that night I told
a young man's lie
When I said I would call her
and I said I'd write
'cause I'm an old time rambler
I call the road my home
Forgive my indiscretion
It's the only way I know
A million miles from Kentucky
But I will always be around
So turn the radio up
When your heart breaks down
Turn the radio up
When your heart breaks down
I'm sorry for the tears
I made you cry
I'm sorry for the promises
that turned to lies
If I could turn back
the hands of time
I'd take it back and try, try, try
to make you understand
that this is who I am
I met the devil in an old motel
It seems I ain't got much of a soul to sell
My glass is empty
My hands are blue
and the doctor gave me
about a month or two
Well, I thought I would make it
to you this year
So forgive me one last time my dear
And tell your mother
I won't be coming home
'cause I'm an old time rambler
I call the road my home
Forgive my indiscretion
It's the only way I know
A million miles from Kentucky
but I will always be around
So turn the radio up
When your heart breaks down
Turn the radio up
When your heart breaks down
