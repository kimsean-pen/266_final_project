Seems like you never really knew me
seems like you never understood me
seems like you never really knew how to feel
but electricity it drew you near to me
what you needed was to be rid of me

there were times you really made me smile
and there were times you really made me cry
and there were times i never really knew how to feel
but electricity it drew you near to me
what you needed was to be rid of me
and the fear it made you so unsure of me
what you needed was to be rid of me.

but electricity it drew you near to me
what you needed was to be rid of me
and the fear made you so unsure of me
what you needed was to be rid of me.
