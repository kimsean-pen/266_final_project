Maybe I've been the problem, maybe I'm the one to blame
But even when I turn it off and blame myself, the outcome feels the same
I've been thinkin' maybe I've been partly cloudy, maybe I'm the chance of rain
And maybe I'm overcast, and maybe all my lucks washed down the drain

I've been thinking 'bout everyone, everyone
You look so lonely

But when I look at the stars
When I look at the stars
When I look at the stars
I see someone else
When I look at the stars
The stars, I feel like myself

Stars lookin' at our planet, watching entropy and pain
And maybe start to wonder how the chaos in our lives could pass as sane
I've been thinking 'bout the meaning of resistance, of a hope beyond my own
And suddenly the infinite and penitent begin to look like home

I've been thinking 'bout everyone, everyone
You look so empty

But when I look at the stars
When I look at the stars
When I look at the stars
I see someone else
When I look at the stars
The stars, I feel like myself, yeah

Stars...
Stars...

Everyone, everyone
We feel so lonely
Everyone, yeah, everyone
We feel so empty

When I look at the stars
When I look at the stars
When I look at the stars
I feel like myself
When I look at the stars
The stars, I see someone
