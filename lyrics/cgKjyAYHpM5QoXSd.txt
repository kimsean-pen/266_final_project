Wasn't looking for trouble
But it came looking for me
I tried to say no, but I can't fight it she was looking lovely
She kinda reminds me
Of a girl I know
This pretty young thing that I got waiting for me back at home
She's got my engines turning
This happens every time
I see a pretty girl and
I wanna make her mine
They send my rocket to the sky
I want them
But should I go for them
I'm like Houston
I think we got a problem

Girls, girls, girls I just can't say no
Never see them coming I just watch them go
Girls, girls, girls I just can't say no
Never see them coming I just wa-wa-wa-wa-watch them go
Take control, making me sweat girl run that show
It's them girls, girls, girls I just can't say no

Houston, I think we got a problem

Some girls are naughty
Some girls are sweet
One thing they got in common, they all got a hold on me
Meet them at the party
Meet them in the street
Getting me in so much trouble but that's alright with me
They got my engines turning
This happens every time
I see a pretty girl and
I wanna make her mine
They send my rocket to the sky
I want them
But should I go for them

I'm like houston
I think we got a problem

Girls, girls, girls I just can't say no
Never see them coming I just watch them go
Girls, girls, girls I just can't say no
Never see them coming I just wa-wa-wa-wa-watch them go

Take control, making me sweat girl run that show
It's them girls, girls, girls I just can't say no
Houston, I think we got a problem

Looking like a model making me stare
All them pretty girls are standing right there
Doing that thing it's just not fair
How come all the pretty girls are up in here
