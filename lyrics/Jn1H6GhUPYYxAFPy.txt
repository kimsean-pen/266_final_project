Nights chasing ghosts, asleep in the pews
Naked and still, your arm in a noose
Pillar of salt, we can never look back
The lives we have lead, we are cursed in our past

We're cursed in our past, we're cursed in our death

A penance paid for in blood, the guilt set in my hands
Lover stolen from me, demon father be damned
No mercy on me, my selfish sins I detest
Devil lying in wait, collecting his debts
No hope, no hope

Communion of saints, a bread of body and wine
Quiet and still, drinking me dry
Got left here long ago, heavy lies and thorn crown
In pride and in smite, no face to be found

We're cursed in our past
We're cursed in our death

A penance paid for in blood, the guilt set in my hands
Lover stolen from me, demon father be damned
No mercy on me, myself sins I detest
Devil lying in wait, collecting his debts
Collecting his debts
(Collecting his debts)

No mercy on me, myself sins I contest
Devil lying in wait, collect his debts
Collect his debts

No hope
