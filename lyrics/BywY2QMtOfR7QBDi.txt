Please save me now
I'm never gonna leave this town
I'll hang around
'Til all the buildings crumble down
Stacking up my dreams inside
I watch another train go by
Can't find my ticket to ride

He was a good guy, bad lie, king of con artists
I think of those days with my heart in the harness
And you can presume that he was groomed to bloom
Assumed his doom, and lacked in the cash to move
He was my broken, catty daddy, stranger danger savvy
Killed my innocent first love when it ended badly
Three years in the grand finale
He called me drunk one night from his bachelor party
Said, "I get married tomorrow. How are you doing?"
Said, "I'm packing my baggage because my dreams are pursuing"
He said, "I'm glad that you're happy. I'm starting a family
And maybe someday we could hook up in Miami"

Please save me now
I'm never gonna leave this town
I'll hang around
'Til all the buildings crumble down
Stacking up my dreams inside
I watch another train go by
Can't find my ticket to ride

Sometimes the wrong feels right, and damn, that shit's vicious
A minute there I thought love was fictitious
Like he was the one, I thought my life was done
I dropped the gun, broke out and began to run
I had no friends to carry me, my family scaring me
I felt the call of the city was daring me
To let it all go and forget the face
They probably tuned in from my rise to fame
He could be polishing tractors, I'm x-ing my factors
He could've come with if he had the adapters
I wish that I could've saved him, I made my amends
But I don't really need it, don't read it if you know how it ends

Please save me now
I'm never gonna leave this town
I'll hang around
'Til all the buildings crumble down
Stacking up my dreams inside
I watch another train go by
Can't find my ticket to ride

When the train come 'round don't skip the tracks
Don't let nobody hold you back
Just ride, ride

When the train come 'round don't skip the tracks
Don't let nobody hold you back
Just ride, ride

Please save me now
I'm never gonna leave this town
I'll hang around
'Til all the buildings crumble down
Stacking up my dreams inside
I watch another train go by
Can't find my ticket to ride
