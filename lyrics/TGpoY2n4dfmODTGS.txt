Criminal soulless
Criminal silence
Tearing the seams like criminal violence
And the silence that we train to the sorrow that remains
Songbirds describing refrains
I can't see, I can't speak
I can't walk, I can't talk
I can see how it's falling apart
There was a time when we were held above
Into the falling when we're dying for love

Oh, it's the last of goodbyes
Oh, it's the last of goodbyes

Grace me
Praise me
Fall to pieces as this wanting wastes me
It crazes me
It praises me
Lift me down, let it save me
With no sight I can't accept what I see
With no grace I can't accept what I'll be
Back to a time when we were held from above
Into to the falling when we're dying for love

Oh, it's the last of goodbyes
Oh, it's the last of goodbyes
