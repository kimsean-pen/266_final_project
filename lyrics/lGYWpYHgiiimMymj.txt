don't give up on us, baby
don't make the wrong seem right
the future isn't just one night
it's written in the moonlight
painted on the stars
we can't change ours

don't give up on us, baby
we're still worth one more try
I know we put a last one by
just for a rainy evening
when maybe stars are few
don't give up on us, I know
we can still come through

I really lost my head last night
you've got a right to start believin'
there's still a little love left even so

don't give up on us, baby
Lord knows we've come this far
can't we stay the way we are?
the angel and the dreamer
who sometimes plays a fool
don't give up on us, I know
we can still come through...

it's written in the moonlight
painted on the stars
we can't change ours

don't give up on us, baby
we're still worth one more try
I know we put a last one by
just for a rainy evening
when maybe stars are few
don't give up on us, I know
we can still come through...

don't give up on us, baby
don't give up on us, baby
