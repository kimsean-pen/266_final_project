There's nothing that can shock me anymore:
from actions to reactions, I want more.
What is it you want to hear? That I'm doing great?
Well, I'm lying.
We're just a parody of ourselves.
I'm wasting all my time.
I'll go to Morrissey to answer my questions,
'cause Ian Curtis has left me hanging.
With our intentions at our worst,
we give away all our worth, and I am spent.
