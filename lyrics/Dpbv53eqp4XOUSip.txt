Hell has opened its Mouth,
Hear the Sound of Rumbling Skies,
My Skin turns Cold,
As the Darkness Falls,
The presence of the End,
Above the Blazing Stars,
Rising from the Depths,
The Beast of Darkness awakens,
Raise the damned Storms,
Across the Land and Skies,
The Horizon Expands,
And the Skies turned Black.

The Darkness has returned.
The Darkness has returned.

You Who with the Death,
Abstracted all the Hope,
You Who with the Sins,
Unchained the Man,
You Who with the Light,
Blinded the Fools,
You Who with the Fire,
Cleansed the fucking Herd.

Fires of the Pit arise,
They open the Sky wide,
The Dark inverted Star,
Nightmare enters the World,
Blackness fills the Void,
From the seventh Circle of Hell,
He has come, to answer My call,
Hail to the Lord of the Skies,
The Grand Nuclear Beast Arise,
With Horns on his Head,
The Great Tormentor unleashed.

The Darkness has returned.
The Darkness has returned.
