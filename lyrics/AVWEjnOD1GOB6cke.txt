Ain't no modern love gonna set me free
Like the kinda love that you give to me
I'm coming home to be with you
I'm coming home to be with you

Something about your love, oh
Something about your love
Something about your love, oh
Something about your love

This whole wide world goes in and out of style
All I want is to see you smile
I'm coming home to be with you
I'm coming home to be with you

Something about your love, oh
Something about your love
Something about your love, oh
Something about your love

As all the shiny things in the window fade
All that's real is the love we made
I'm coming home to be with you
I'm coming home to be with you

Something about your love, oh
Something about your love
Something about your love, oh
Something about your love
