Your dusty, your dusty eyes
They leave me pale and wondering
Have I swam too far this time
To make it back on my dime

The city, the city lights
The lampposts burn the night
But they don't come close
No, they don't come close

To the way I feel about you now
To the way I feel about you now

Someday, someday, maybe soon
You'll tell her about all I've given to you
But it's all the same
Yeah, it's all the same
When you're high

You could have been some other guy
You could have been some other guy

Oh, the way that I feel about you now
Oh, the way that I feel about you now
Oh, the way that I feel about you now
Oh, the way that I feel about you now
