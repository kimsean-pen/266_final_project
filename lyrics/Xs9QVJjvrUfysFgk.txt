I think, I think I am
Therefore I am, I think

Of course you are my bright little star
I've miles and miles of files
Pretty files of your forefather's fruit
And now to suit our great computer
You're magnetic ink

I'm more than that
I know I am
At least, I think I must be

There you go man
Keep as cool as you can
Face piles of trials with smiles
It riles them to believe
That you perceive the web they weave
And keep on thinking free
