true.
tell everyone you know.
it's all we ask.
if it were all up to me, i would say
come up to these truths instead.

you dig your own grave.
you dig your own grave.

buried in masculine pain all the time.
envy all less, we know.
crazy. basic.
in your own breath, you cough.

ooh, in your own breath.
ooh, in your own breath.

take on yourself.
it's the only way i will breathe.
temples... temples...
in your own breath.

ooh, in your own breath.
ooh, in your own breath for me.
