I feel her slipping away
I've done the best that I can
There's nothing more left to say
Well, it's over

I call her friend for advice
She says, "I'm sorry"
I ask what she means
She says she told her we broke up

Why am I the last to know my fate?
I take a deep breath and call her
I can no longer wait
But it goes straight to message
And I'm deep in the zone
'Cause it's 12: 45 and you said you were home

I don't know why you'd hide from me
All those times you said you'd die for me

Don't go turning your back on me
Don't go walking away
Maybe you and I weren't meant to be
But don't go walking away

I'll make it easy for you
And say the things that you can't
I know we're growing apart
And it's alright

Told you that this day would come
And you'd go off on your own
So don't you get second thoughts
'Cause the deal's done

I try to be the bigger man and let go
But suddenly I start to wonder if there's more to the story
It doesn't matter either way in the end
Because you'll fall in love again
And there were others before me

Still it's so hard to say goodbye
But it's even worse to live a lie

Don't go turning your back on me
Don't go walking away
Maybe you and I weren't meant to be
But don't go walking away

Don't go turning your back on me
Don't go walking away
Maybe you and I weren't meant to be
But don't go walking away

Don't go walking away
Don't go walking away
