The time is now
Please tell me how
Set ablaze...
Crying,
Remembering how it used to be
Scarred for eternity
Was it meant to be?
A life in harmony...

Bleeding, regretting...

Solitary life
Committing suicide
Seeking sanctuary
From this world, contrary

Stand Ablaze
Screaming
As the flames caress my face
Stand Ablaze...
