Baby, baby
I'm gonna bring it on home to you

I done bought my ticket, I got my load
Conductor done hollered, "All, aboard"
Take my seat and ride way back
And watch this train move down the track

Baby, baby
I'm gonna bring it on home to you

I think about the good times I once have had
Soul got happy now, my heart got glad
I think about the way you love me too
You can bet your life, I'm comin home to you

I'm goin home
I'm gonna bring it on home, now
I'm gonna bring it on home, now
I'm gonna bring it on home, now
Gonna bring it on home
Bring it on home to you
