I'm sick and tired of hearin' things
From uptight, short-sighted, narrow-minded hypocritics
All I want is the truth
Just gimme some truth

I've had enough of readin' things
By neurotic, psychotic, pig-headed politicians
All I want is the truth
Just gimme some truth

No short-haired, yellow-bellied, son of Tricky Dick
Is gonna mother hubbard soft soap me
With just a pocketful of hope
Money for dope
Money for rope

Woo-oo-hoo

No short-haired, yellow-bellied, son of Tricky Dick
Is gonna mother hubbard soft soap me
With just a pocketful of soap
Money for dope
Money for rope

I'm sick to death of seein' things
From tight-lipped, condescendin', mama's little chauvinists
All I want is the truth
Just gimme some truth now

I've had enough of watchin' scenes
Of schizophrenic, ego-centric, paranoiac, prima donnas
All I want is the truth now, now
Just gimme some truth

No short-haired, yellow-bellied, son of Tricky Dick
Is gonna mother hubbard soft soap me
With just a pocketful of soap
It's money for dope
Money for rope

Ah, I'm sick to death of hearin' things
From uptight, short-sighted, narrow-minded hypocrites
All I want is the truth now
Just gimme some truth now

I've had enough of readin' things
By neurotic, psychotic, pig-headed politicians
All I want is the truth now
Just gimme some truth now

All I want is the truth now
Just gimme some truth now
All I want is the truth
Just gimme some truth
All I want is the truth
Just gimme some truth
