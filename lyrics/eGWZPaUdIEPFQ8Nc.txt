Once I missed a beat - only missed a beat
Once I missed a beat I only missed a beat
Once I missed a beat - only missed a beat
Once I missed a beat I only missed a beat

Latent gun beamed for my head
It's a wonder that I tread
Over worn ground through my youth
Making all my dreams come true

Once I missed a beat - only missed a beat
Once I missed a beat I only missed a beat
Once I missed a beat - only missed a beat
Once I missed a beat I only missed a beat

Happy days seem so absurd
Lightning that's unlikely heard
Nova sunshine while I nap
Making all my dreams so sad

Once I missed a beat - only missed a beat
Once I missed a beat I only missed a beat
Once I missed a beat - only missed a beat
Once I missed a beat I only missed a beat

Don't miss the bar, we play here
Already ringing in my ears
Don't miss the bar, it's right here
Only a beat disappears

Once I missed a beat - only missed a beat
Once I missed a beat I only missed a beat
Once I missed a beat - only missed a beat
Once I missed a beat I only missed a beat

Once I missed a beat - only missed a beat
Once I missed a beat I only missed a beat
Once I missed a beat - only missed a beat
Once I missed a beat I only missed a beat

Only missed a beat
Only missed a beat
Only missed a beat

Once I missed a beat - only missed a beat
Once I missed a beat I only missed a beat
Once I missed a beat - only missed a beat
Once I missed a beat I only missed a beat
