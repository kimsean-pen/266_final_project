Come out to this party with me on the west side
Put on your makeup but there's nothing really inside
Go get your Gucci at the second hand store
Tell them you're with me
When you show up at the door
Through the haze I see your face lit by the phone line
Follow for a follow, you don't want my number right?
Walk away when I see that blank stare
Why the fuck did I even come here?

I see through it
I see through it
I see through it
I see through it, it, it

Fix your hair
We're taking pictures by the pool side
Stand up straight
Hold your breath and give 'em dead eyes
Making sure it'll never show
You're just a girl from you don't even know
Do you got any pretty friends that you can invite?
It's getting late, I don't really know, I'm not their type
Even though I caught a buzz
I'm sneaking out the back because

I see through it
I see through it
I see through it
I see through it, it, it
I see through it
I see through it
I see through it
I see through it, it, it
I see through it

Can you walk the walk like you talk the talk?
(No, you'll never be free
If you're following dreams that nobody believes)
Can you walk the walk like you talk the talk?
(No you'll never be free
If you're following dreams, yeah)

'Cause I see through it
I see through it
I see through it
I see through it, it, it
I see through it
('Cause I see through it)
I see through it
I see through it
I see through it, it, it

Can you walk the walk like you talk the talk?
Can you walk the walk?
Can you walk the walk like you talk the talk?
Can you walk the walk?
