And then the seasons get you down
I'll come running to tuck you in
Out the window looks like all of the colors
All of them melting down
Been escaping, barely keeps him awake, shivering in cold
Frosty glasses cracking into the shades,
Tryin' to forget you yet

Hello, hello
You always seem to call and nothing's on
Proceed to memory
Hello, hello
You always seem t forget before we leave the information's in
You're awfully calm and dull
Hello, hello
You're awfully calm, is all
Hello, hello

And then the seasons get you down
I'll come running to tuck you in
And out the window looks like all of the colors, all of them melting down
I hate escaá¹—ing, barely keeps you awake, shivering in your clothes
My frosty glasses cracking into the shades,
Tryin' to forget you, no

Word, fire, wind, hey, eh-oh
And soon, all you'll have is the memory
And then you won't even have that memory
Oh-oh-oh
And soon, all you'll have is the memory
Oh-oh-oh
And then you won't even have that memory
Oh-oh-oh
Until all you'll have is the memory
Oh-oh-oh
And then you won't even have that memory
