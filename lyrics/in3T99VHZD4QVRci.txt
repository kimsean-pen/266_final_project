Do you mind if I take take my time
And show you all the things that I've been thinking of,
Its better when the curtains come undone.
I know sometimes you feel uninvited in my space
I pull away, still we get tangled up
But that's what happens when your in love

(Pre)
There's nobody else I'd rather be stuck with
You are the seams to all of my dreams and nonsense (nonsense)
I swear if you're the ledge then I'm jumping
Don't catch me if I fall just let me plummet, (just let me plummet)

Cause oh baby I wanna dive right into you, right into you
Its a love suicide.
Foot on the gas let me drive right into you, right into you
It's a love suicide.

We're surrounded, no way around this barricade
Its too big to ever fade away
Boy you know you fill my empty place
Like a river that overflows sometimes it gets too hard
To hold in everything we own
But I'm never letting go

(Pre)
Cause there's nobody else I'd rather be stuck with
You are the seams to all of my dreams and nonsense (nonsense)
I swear if you're the ledge then I'm jumping
Don't catch me if I fall just let me plummet, (just let me plummet)

Cause oh baby I wanna dive right into you, right into you
Its a love suicide.
Foot on the gas let me drive right into you, right into you
It's a love suicide.

All my cares you undress
No need to stress cause you love me the best
You reach me at my depths
You are my strength so different from the rest.

Cause oh baby I wanna dive right into you, right into you
Its a love suicide.
Foot on the gas let me drive right into you, right into you
It's a love suicide.
