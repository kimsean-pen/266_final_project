I've been through so many changes in my life woman
It's a wonder I ain't lost my mind
And I ain't never said how much I need You Sugar
But I should need you by my side

My Love, just thinking about You Baby just blows my mind
My love
Just thinking about you Baby just blows my mind all the time
Life with me I know for sure it ain't be easy

But you stayed with me anyway
Even though you ain't gonna lose too much by leaving
I'm so glad you stayed
My Love, just thinking about You Baby just blows my mind

My Love
Just thinking about you Baby, just blows my mind all the time
You've been my Friend and You've been my Lover, Oh Lord
Honey You're everything I need

You've made my Love so strong now I know where I belong
Girl you'll never have to worry
Oh Baby any more
Any more
My Love, just thinking about You Baby just blows my mind
My Love, just thinking about You Baby just blows my mind all the time
My Love, just thinking about You Baby just blows my mind
My Love, just thinking about You Baby just blows my mind oh ya all the time
All the time All the time
My Love My Love My Love My... My Love
Just thinking about You Baby just blows my mind My
Oh Ya Oh Ya Woo
My Love My Love Ya
