I walked into the room
Imagine my surprise
you were sitting close to him
staring in each other's eyes

Each of you looked up
but no one said a word
I felt I should apologise
for what I hadn't heard

A silence filled the room
awkward as an elephant
In the crowded court of your love
I was now a supplicant

And clumsy as I felt
at stumbling on this theft
to save further embarrassment
I made my excuses and left

So long ago
I felt like such a fool
for crying
All that I know
is when you feel inside
you're dying
it all begins again
defying
your excuses
