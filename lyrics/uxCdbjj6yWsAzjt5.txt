I keep wandering through the storm
Burdened by the oaths I've sworn
I assure you it's a tragic life form
I'm a wanderer in the dark
Here's no light, not even a spark
And the darkness got a grip on my heart

This is the call
This is the wall
This is the fall

Deep inside
A blizzard is storming
My heart is in mourning
Feel the night
Darken my feelings
My soul's shattered and bleeding

Onwards and onwards I go
But to where I do not know
I keep on making my way
Through the snow
There's no shelter here to find
No shred of hope left on my mind
And my guardian angel left me behind

This is the call
This is the wall
This is the fall

Deep inside
A blizzard is storming
My heart is in mourning
Feel the night
Darken my feelings
My soul's shattered and bleeding

Here comes the storm
My heart's outworn
My soul is frozen to the core
A burned our life
All dead inside
An endless night of frost and strife

Deep inside
A blizzard is storming
My heart is in mourning
Feel the night
Darken my feelings
My soul's shattered and bleeding
