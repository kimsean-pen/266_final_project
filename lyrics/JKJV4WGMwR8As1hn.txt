I lie awake
Hesitate
Between love and hate
I know you've been feeding
My infatuation
I can see
You and me
Doing things we shouldn't be
I can't seem to stop
My imagination

I can feel your eyes
All over my body
I can read the signs
They're sexual
I can read your mind
I can see you want me
Something in your eyes is sensual

You make me feel naked
Undressing me with your eyes
You make me feel naked
Ohhh, hypnotised
(oooooh hypnotised)

I feel naked baby

In between
You and me
There is
Sensuality
I can feel your eyes
I can feel the tension
Hurling me
To the ground
Turning me
Upside down
I can lose myself
Without redemption

I can feel your eyes
All over my body
I can read the signs
They're sexual
I can read your mind
I can see you want me
Something in your eyes is senusal

You make me feel naked
Undressing me with your eyes
You make me feel naked
Ohhh, hypnotised
(oooooh hypnotised)

Naked
Mmmmmm hmmmm hmmm hmm yeah
Naked
Ohhhh huh huh huh huh
Naked
So naked
(oooooh hypnotised)

I feel your lips
Your fingerips
Get inside
Play with my mind
I feel myself
Begin to melt
Don't look at me
Don't stop

I can feel your eyes
All over my body
I can read the signs
They're sexual
I can read you mind
I can see you want me
Something in your eyes is sensual

You make me feel naked
Undressing me with your eyes
You make me feel naked
Ohhh, hypnotised
(oooooh hypnotised)

Naked
Naked
Oooooooh ooh
Hypnotised
