The cold wind starts to change the leaves
I start to see you in my dreams
You carved some words into a stone
After you left for the great unknown
You really hoped it would mean something
That it means something
Smoking another cigarette
I read the auburn epitaphs
I pause to feel the gravity
That permeates a part of me

So I press my pen into the page
Pretending that these words can change
Feigning that they have some meaning
That they have meaning
