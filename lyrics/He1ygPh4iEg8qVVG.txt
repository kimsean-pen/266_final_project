My parents are asleep
(Sneak, sneak
Not, not)
Rebel, because I fell, fell, fell
Family is family but
Love is love
Fantasies came alive
Young minds, the blind (?)

You might think my guy is a trick
But we're good, we're great
The (unintelligble) day by day
So poor or not I'm still his girl
Like it or not
Maybe a Soulja Boy is just that trick
Yah trick!
(Shh shh!) Rebel because I fell, fell, fell
Family is family but
Love is love
My parents are sleep
Is this love
Really worth it?
(Sneak, sneak)
(Not, not)
