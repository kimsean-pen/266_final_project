You keep throwing your dishes
Funny how we make this last
You think we would've learned our lesson
Running over broken glass

Maybe you're a little too lonely
Maybe I'm a little too late
It's raining in the heart of our city
We could let it wash away

All the fights we should have never fought
All the times we thought we called it off
All the nights we lost
Nobody's fault, nobody's fault

All the pain we caused we're better off
They can't hold us down we're strong enough
If it's foolish love that we're both guilty of

Then call me a fool, call me the fool

Call it what you want a confession
Love me like you're out of control
I spent every last cent of my savings
Anything to get you back home

All the fights we should have never fought
All the times we thought we called it off
All the nights we lost
Nobody's fault, nobody's fault

All the pain we caused we're better off
They can't hold us down we're strong enough
If it's foolish love that we're both guilty of

Then call me a fool, call me the fool
Then call me a fool, call me the fool

(Break)

Then call me a fool, call me the fool
Then call me a fool, call me the fool
