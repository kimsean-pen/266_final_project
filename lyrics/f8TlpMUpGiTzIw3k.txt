Ooo-oh, ooo-oh
But now I'm working on this way of life
Ooo-woah-oh
Damn

I wish I had more time in the day, uh
Just know if I had it my way, yeah
You would be priority, not sacrifice
But right now I'm caught up in this
way of life, way of life, way of life
To make sure that my future right, future right, future right
Hold me down and pay off coming, ooo-woah, yeah, yeah, uh

Why I always feel like I'm on a time limit
Fuckin' moonlight all my bidness
Studio, I spend a night in it
Only thing seem to keep my attention
Poppa kidney, still workin' backwards
Wish I was doctor, fuck a rapper
Thought he was good when he beat the cancer
He was sick afterwards, I thought that was standard
Sometimes I wonder the fuck am I prayin' for?
My momma hate, I question the lord
There's a higher power, I believe in that
I question where he put that evil at
Why I be tragedy, where all my people at?
When we the main ones in the churches
Tithes and offerin' on your car payment,
while the pastor's Mercedes Benz swervin', damn

But maybe I think too much, uh
Maybe I close my eyes and I dream too much
I just can't be gullible, girl I've seen too much
But I don't wanna lose you though 'cause you mean too much

I wish I had more time in the day
Just know if I had it my way, yeah
You would be priority, not sacrifice
But right now I'm working on this
way of life, way of life, way of life
To make sure that my future right, future right, future right
Just hold me down, the pay off coming
The pay off coming

3 years, it's been up and down
First I'm here then I'm not around
At your house and I'm on the road
In your bed and then in my mode
In my head I spend hella time
Hella time you be on my mind
Wish I could strengthen what we develop
But I sacrifice for that bottom line
It be push and pull on the balance beam
Tight rope, but I don't slip
Finish line like a million miles
I just hope you down for the road trip
I love your patience (I love your patience)
It's workin' on me now, it's contagious (on me it's contagious, yeah)
Might go to Cuba and take a vacation
Get a lil' private beach so you can be naked (we can be naked)
I would do that no hesitation, oh-woah-woah
Wish I could give you everything in your imagination
Wouldn't that be amazing

But maybe I think too much, uh
Maybe I close my eyes and I dream too much
I just can't be gullible, girl I've seen too much
But I don't wanna lose you though 'cause you mean too much

I wish I had more time in the day
Just know if I had it my way, uh
You would priority, not sacrifice
But right now I'm caught up in this
way of life, way of life, way of life
To make sure that my future right, future right, future right
Just hold me down, the pay off coming
The pay off coming

I'm caught up in this way of life, way of life, way of life
To make sure that my future right, future right, future right
