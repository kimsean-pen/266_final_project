She said I don't wanna go out chasing
I kinda wanna go out dancing
Forget about the guys
Cause it doesn't feel right
So he left
Drinking with the boys in convoy
Flirting with the girls who play it coy
Doubt he even knows that it doesn't feel right

It started off with her hair
Cause every night has gotta start somewhere
Another badly combed frown
Cause mirrors always seem to bring her down
Going through the motions of
Strange ways here we come and teenage love
Can see there's something inside
Her voice is telling her to stay behind
So as friends approached her
She looked over her shoulder and

She said I don't wanna go out chasing
I kinda wanna go out dancing
Forget about the guys
Cause it doesn't feel right
So he left
Drinking with the boys in convoy
Flirting with the girls who play it coy
Doubt he even knows that it doesn't feel right

Acting like he doesn't care
But he's really the most self-aware
He taught his heart how to be cool
Because everyone loves a criminal
Nothing like a drink or two
She's on his mind at least he thinks its true
But ain't it funny how we're never certain 'bout the way we are
Another youth is wasted and eternity tainted

She said I don't wanna go out chasing
I kinda wanna go out dancing
Forget about the guys
Cause it doesn't feel right
So he left
Drinking with the boys in convoy
Flirting with the girls who play it coy
Doubt he even knows that it doesn't feel right

She said I don't wanna go out chasing
I kinda wanna go out dancing
Forget about the guys
Cause it doesn't feel right
So he left
Drinking with the boys in convoy
Flirting with the girls who play it coy
Doubt he even knows that it doesn't feel right

She said I don't wanna go out chasing
I kinda wanna go out dancing
Forget about the guys
Cause it doesn't feel right
So he left
Drinking with the boys in convoy
Flirting with the girls who play it coy
Doubt he even knows that it doesn't feel right
