I could take every fuckin' word she said
Throw it in her face
Would she even care?
I still remember when she looked at me
A frown upon her face
Trying to be sincere
Well I gathered all those little things she said
Kept them close to me
Trying to make this real
This cloud will always hover over me
I'm leaving you today

'Cuz now I see
Suffocate, you suffocate
That you lie
(I don't lie)
That you're fake

(I'm not a fake)
Suffocate, you suffocate
You always take
(I don't take)
What you can
(What I can)
I could take every fuckin' game you played
Blow it all away
Would you even care?

I could take all those lies you said to me
Never go away, never disappear
This cloud will always hover over me
I'm leavin' you today
'Cuz now I see

Suffocate, you suffocate
That you lie
(I don't lie)
That you're fake
(I'm not a fake)

Suffocate, you suffocate

You always take
(I don't take)
What you can
(What I can)

Suffocate, you suffocate
That you lie

(I don't lie)
That you're fake
(I'm not a fake)

Oh now I'm far away from you
I'll never bring back yesterday

You're such a fake, it's true
I can't believe the words you say
I'm far away from you
I'll never bring back yesterday
Suffocate, you suffocate
That you lie
(I don't lie)
That you're fake
(I'm not a fake)
Suffocate, you suffocate
You always take
(I don't take)
What you can
(What I can)
I always take
What I can
(That you lie)
(I don't lie)
That you're fake
(I'm not a fake)
I always take
What I can
(That you lie)
(I don't lie)
That you're fake
(I'm not a fake)
