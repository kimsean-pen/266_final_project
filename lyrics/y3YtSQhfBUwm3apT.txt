Wanna love me 'cause I'm famous
Wanna try me 'cause I'm famous
Whole world knowin' what my name is
Run up on me could be dangerous
Hear em whisperin' 'cause I'm famous
Taking pictures 'cause I'm famous
I ain't budging I ain't changing
It don't matter that I'm famous

They don't tell me no (no)
No red lights I'm on go (on go)
Anything that I want (I want)
I can get it pronto (I get it)
I ain't got no friends (no friends)
Everyone's on payroll
Charge it all to the game (game)
Stay strong won't fold
They love me then they hate me then they love me again (haters)
First, they diss my career then beg
For a verse in DM's (why you comin' back)
First a Bentley then a coupe then I
Went back to the Benz (back to the Benz)
The internet it want me gone
Because of all my old sins (all of my sins)

It's controversy (controversy)
Over every single thing that I say (everything that I say)
Wanted me to stay in a child's place
But I just put the payment down on my
Own place (fuck is you sayin' Lil' bitch)

Everywhere that I go they screaming Bhad Bhabie
If I see a hating ho she a mad baby
See yo bitch I know she a fan
Runnin' up 'bouta get these hands
See the guap in between the bands
See this Porsche in between the Benz
I don't wanna take a pic sometimes
Let me do me sometimes
Got my name all in fake news
Wanna know who I'm talking to
Wanna know if my mom bought a crib
Ask if she got a P.O. too
They follow my every move
What that shit gotta do with you?
