Another cold dark night, left alone
Your arrogance will lead to the death of you
I'll be the one to pull your head back down
Remove your hollow Crown
So far from the truth you hide away
I'll be the one to pull your head back down
Remove your hollow crown
I'll die happy knowing that I will never be anything like you
What gives you the right to silence me?
All my life I've wanted just to fell like this
You came, you conquered you gave it away
And how does it feel staring down on your idol's grave
The one you once looked up to has fallen into dust
The one you once looked up to has fallen away
What's left for you in this fickle world?
Remove your crown
