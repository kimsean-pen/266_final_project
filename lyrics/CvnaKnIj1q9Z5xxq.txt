Why do we keep repeating,
When evil is unhealthy?
My body aches without you
Look again my hands are shaking
With you I'm terrified but follow
Me without you it's got me horrified
'cause if we're being accused. well our
Limits are never satisfied.

Chemical love! I can feel you in my bones
Chemical love! can you feel me in your
Soul? nothing you can do to save me
I am on my own!

This situation's clockwork, always rising
Up from the dirt, only to repeat disaster
The way that we would. can you hide for
Me? I'm drowning in your eyes. I must
Be under a spell you've got me
Hypnotized. 'cause we're running away
But there's no ending you're always
My mind

Chemical love! I can feel you in my bones!
Chemical love! can you feel me in your
Soul? nothing you can do to save me
I am on my own!

Chemical love! I can feel you in my bones!
Chemical love! can you feel me in your
Soul? nothing you can do to save me
I am on my own!

Chemical love!
Chemical love!
Chemical love!
Chemical love!
Chemical love!
