Once upon a time I knew everything
When I stop to think back on everything
It all runs away like a memory (like a memory)
Once there was a picture of a happy place

But I always keep thinking
What a great place to leave

(Chorus)

I'd trade it all
To have you all here with me

Father, when you coming by?
Mother, leave the light on again
Sister, with someone, somewhere, somewhere
Brother, brother, brother

(Chorus)

Trailer park heaven was a dream to me
'Cause we had it figured out
Simple and not jaded
There was a promise of a brighter day
But soon it would all fade out

(Chorus)

I'd trade it all
To have you all here with me

Father, when you coming by?
Mother, leave the light on again
Sister, with someone, somewhere, somewhere
Brother, brother, brother

When it's something we love that keeps us away,
Well it costs even more and it's so much to pay

To have you all here with me

Father, when you coming by?
Mother, leave the light on again.
Sister, with someone somewhere somewhere
Brother, brother, brother
Brother, brother, brother
Brother, brother, brother
