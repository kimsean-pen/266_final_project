I got to this party
With no ambition, I want to leave
Well my mind starts burning, my teeth start shifting
The neighbours have to call my grammy

Well, I'm feeling antisocial
Misnanthropic all around us
Really over being anywhere at all
But I'm scared of drinking alone
'Cause it feels like we're chewing this dog's last bone
And I'm desperate and glued to my phone

Well, you and I, you and I
You and I are the only ghosts who don't have fun
You and I are the only voice

Let the rumours of the new wave
Pull all the lonely ghosts inside of their room
And we howl, and we howl
'Cause the radio don't sound how we sound

Because we're feeling antisocial
Misanthropic all around
Just fucking over being anyone at all
But we're scared of drinking alone
'Cause it feels like we're chewing this dog's last bone
And we're desperate and glued to our phones

You and I, you and I
You and I are the only ghosts who don't have fun
You and I are the only voice

(Well me and my best friend's ghost, we have a good time)
(Your mommy was a communist
She wrote two books about teenage sex
Your mommy was a communist
She wrote two books about teenage sex)

But we're scared of drinking alone
'Cause it feels like we're chewing this dog's last bone
And we're desperate and glued to our phones

You and I, you and I
You and I are the only ghosts who don't have fun
You and I are the only voice
You and I, you and I
You and I are the only ghosts who don't have fun
You and I are the only voice
