Feel so good
Words can't explain
It's got to be the sweetest pain
When I'm in your arms
Hold me tight
Turn out the light
Turn out the light
and when you kiss me
I can't keep still
I love the way you make me feel
Do what you want
Do what you need
To satisfy the need in me

When I look into your eyes
I get lost in paradise
Paradise
Only you can set me free
from this yearning misery
Misery
Misery

Oooo
I love you so bad it hurts me
It hurts so good inside
Ooo
I love you so good it hurts me
It hurts so good inside
Ooo
I love you so good it hurts me
It hurts so good inside

Feels so good
Words can't explain
its got to be the sweetest pain
When you touch me,
my body chills,
and then the fire starts to build.
Rock me baby
Love me baby
and give me everything you've got.
Love the way you make love to me,
no don't stop, don't you ever stop.

When I look into your eyes,
I get lost in paradise
Paradise
Only you can set me free
From this yearning misery

Ooo
I love you so good it hurts me
It hurts so good inside
Ooo
I love you so good it hurts me
It hurts so good inside
Ooo
I love you so good it hurts me
It hurts so good inside
Ooo
I love you so good it hurts me
It hurts so good inside
Ooo

Feels so good
Words cant explain
its got to be the sweetest pain
Love me baby
Love me baby
It's got to be the sweetest pain
Sweetest pain
Its got to be the sweetest pain
Baby Yeah
Its got to be the sweetest pain
Its got to be the sweetest pain
