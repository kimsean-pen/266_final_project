i said that i could
i said that i would
if you want
if you want
to give me a chance with you

i still cannot hope
all the real soul that you have
all the time
all the world
that you can do is
somewhere without you

i said that you took
i can't believe all
that you want
to become
is all seen without you

i'll crash into
you once
i want to
be nothing
that you can
alone with the wave too
