Flashback from the night before
Was it the other day, I couldn't say
It's all coming in pieces
But before you know they just fade away

Goddamn! What did I hear, what'd I do?
Where did I go and how'd I get here?
I know... I'm too far gone
A deadbeat, a travesty so what's my next strategy?

Fuck me, there's blood on my hands
That's nothing new but now they're shaking too
Everything's soaked in sweat
Here comes the "forgive and forget"

Who should I forgive? Forget that plan
I really don't give a damn
Just need my fix, I'm dying
So break out the bottle and stop crying

And the calm washes over
My soul drying my tears
Under the grass and clover
A new sense of hope appears

Choking, breathing, exhaust
Hard to keep an even keel
Shot boiling mercury
It burns so bad yet I can't feel

Choking, breathing, exhaust
Hard to keep an even keel
Sweating, boiling mercury
It burns so bad yet I can't feel

Walking in a mine field
Hard to keep my eyes peeled
Shot to hell and fried
No heaven, evermore denied

And the calm washes over
My soul drying my tears
Under the grass and clover
A new sense of hope appears.
