This isn't over yet and we've only just begun to create this
I thought I lost it all
Not wrapped between the sheets
Trust in me, you will see
Believe in me and let the others have their way with you
Your life forgotten, empires erased
Trust in me, you will see this victory
We stop defeat, this offering it must remain
Catastrophe in this city, on this day catastrophe
It's not over yet
There's something left for the taking
Forces of nature ruler and judge when the heaves open up
Give me a reaction
Give it all up
This is the only way we can obey
This is something that we will never win
Hope for defeat
