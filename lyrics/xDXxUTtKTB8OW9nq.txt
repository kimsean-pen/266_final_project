There was a sense of disappointment as we left the mall,
All the young people looked the same,
Wearing their masks of cool and indifference,
Commerce dressed up as rebellion.

Because we're so handsome and we're so bored,
So entertain us, tell me a joke,
Make it long, make it last,
Make it cruel, just make me laugh,
We can't be hurt.X2

Drink to forget your blues on the weekend,
Think about more things to buy.
The TV taught me how to sulk and to love nothing.
And how to grow my hair long.

Because we're so handsome and we're so bored,
So entertain us, tell me a joke,
Make it long, make it last,
Make it cruel, just make me laugh,
We can't be hurt.X3

So why do you go picking fights that you'll lose?
(When you have entertainment, when you have things to pass the time)
So why do you have to go thinking thoughts that are above you?
(You can be happy, just play dumb x2)

Well I was brave
And unique,
Intelligent,
A snowflake,
I could have been a hero.
No-one can be trusted over the age of 14.

Tattoo our arms,
Converse shoes,
Cynical,
But we still do it,
We tell ourselves that we're different,
I've gotten so good at lying to myself.

All, all my pain and honor is used up,
oh, oh, oh,
All my guns are rusted.

So when are you going to realize those are not your wrongs to right,
Have another line, have another drink.

I am a martyr I just need a motive,
I am a martyr I just need a cause,
I'm a believer I just need a moment,
I'm a believer I just need a cause.

We're finding it hard to break the mold,
We are finding it so hard to be alone,
We're finding it hard to have time by ourselves,
We have nothing at all to say.

There was a sense of disappointment as we left them all
All the young people looked the same
