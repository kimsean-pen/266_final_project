I can feel you all around
In the silence I hear the sound
Of your foot steps on the ground
And my heart slows down
So now I'm

I'm waiting for the moonlight
So I can find you in this perfect dream
Don't think that you can hide there in the shadows
Girl you're not invisible
You're all that I can see

Somethings changing deep inside
All my hopes are coming alive
As were fading into the night
I can see your eyes
So I keep on

Waiting for the moonlight
So I can find you in this perfect dream
Don't think that you can hide there in the shadows
Girl youre not invisible
You're all that I can

See in the darkness
Believe we can make this
All we want it to be
We can stay here forever
'Cause we were together
Stuck in this fantasy
I don't wanna leave...

And I'll keep waiting for the moonlight
So I can find you in this perfect dream
Don't think that you can hide there in the shadows
Girl you're not invisible

I'm waiting for the moonlight
So I can find you in this perfect dream
Don't think that you can hide there in the shadows
Girl you're not invisible
Girl you're not invisible
You're all that I can see
And my heart slows down.
