What a shame, what a shame we all remain
Such fragile broken things
A beauty half betrayed
Butterflies with punctured wings

Still there are darkened places deep in my heart
Where once was blazing light, now
There's a tiny spark

Oh Glory
Come and find me
Oh Glory
Come and find me

Dancing all alone
To the sound of an enemy's song
I'll be lost until you find me

Fighting on my own
In a war that's already been won
I'll be lost until you come and find me here
Oh Glory

What a mess, what a mystery we've made
Of love and other simple things
Learning to forgive
Even when it wasn't our mistake

I question every human
Who won't look in my eyes
Scars left on my heart formed patterns in my mind.

Oh Glory
You will find me

Dancing all alone
To the sound of an enemy's song
I'll be lost until you find me

Fighting on my own,
In a war that's already been won
I'll be lost until you come and find me here
Oh Glory

(I'll be lost until)

Like the moon, we borrow our light
I am nothing but a shadow in the night

So if you let me I will catch fire
To let your glory and mercy shine
