I'm sure we killed a family
Keep your killing clean my love
Just keep your killing clean

I'm sure we killed a family
Keep your killing clean my love
Just keep your killing clean

Come out quick and name the dead
I'm sure we got a scrabble score
Keep your killing clean my love
Just keep your killing clean
Come out quick and name the dead
I'm sure we got a scrabble score
Keep your killing clean my love
Just keep your killing clean
