The sun is up and I'm coming down
It's been a while but I'm burning out
Flipping my fingers on the 5" screen
Novocain pictures, comfortably numb to the scene
Tap it twice, if you like it
Tap it twice, if you like it
Think twice, you might not like it
Like it or not
Let you see the good if you know me
Show you all the bad if you love me
But oh who oh, Only I know the ugly
Let you see the good if you know me
Show you all the bad if you love me
But oh who oh, Only I know the ugly
La la la la
Fractured and broken scales
Makes me tip back when I inhale
Flying dishes turn to falling tears
Novocain pictures, selfies with my teddy bear
Tap it twice, if you like it
Tap it twice, if you like it
Think twice, you might not like it
Like it or not
Let you see the good if you know me
Show you all the bad if you love me
But oh who oh, Only I know the ugly
Let you see the good if you know me
Show you all the bad if you love me
But oh who oh, Only I know the ugly
I paint pretty on my face
But I'll fight, I scream, I'll misbehave
Got secrets you won't see on stage
And that's what you call beautiful
I paint pretty on my face
But I'll fight, I scream, I'll misbehave
Got secrets you won't see on stage
And that's what you call beautiful
Let you see the good if you know me
Show you all the bad if you love me
But oh who oh, Only I know the ugly
Let you see the good if you know me
Show you all the bad if you love me
But oh who oh, Only I know the ugly
