I'll meet you at the divide
To break the spell
A point where two worlds collide
Yeah, we'll rebel

And we run, And we run, And we run
And we run, And we run, And we run
And we run
Until we break through

If I get high enough
If I get high enough
Will I see you again?

I feel my lungs every night
Not long to wait
And if I do this thing right
I dream of our escape

And we run, And we run, And we run
And we run, And we run, And we run
And we run
Until we break through

If I get high enough
If I get high enough
Will I see you again?
Will I see you again?

If I get high
If I get high
If I get high

And we run, And we run, And we run
And we run, And we run, And we run
And we run
Until we break through
And we run, And we run, And we run
And we run, And we run, And we run
And we run
