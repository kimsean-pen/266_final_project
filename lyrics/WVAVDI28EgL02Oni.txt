I've done everything as you say
I've followed your rules without question
I thought it would help me see things clearly
But instead of helping me to see
I look around and it's like I'm blinded

I'm spinning out of control, out of control
I'm spinning out of control, out of control

(Go) Where should I go?
(Do) What should I do?
I don't understand what you want from me
(Know) 'Cause I don't know
(You) If I can trust you
I don't understand what you want from me

I feel like I'm spinning out of control
Try to focus but everything's twisted
And all alone I thought you would be there
(Thought you would be there)
To let me know I'm not alone
But in fact that's exactly what I was

I'm spinning out of control, out of control
I'm spinning out of control, out of control

(Go) Where should I go?
(Do) What should I do?
I don't understand what you want from me
(Know) 'Cause I don't know
(You) If I can trust you
Or all of the things you've said to me

And I may never know
The answer to this endless mystery

(Go) Where should I go?
(Do) What should I do?
I don't understand what you want from me

Is it a mystery?
Is it a mystery?

I'm spinning out of control, out of control
I'm spinning out of control, out of control
I'm spinning out of control, out of control
I'm spinning out of control, out of control

Spinning out of control, out of control
I'm spinning out of control, out of control
I'm spinning out of control, out of control
I'm spinning out of control

(Go) Where should I go?
(Do) What should I do?
I don't understand what you want from me
(Know) 'Cause I don't know
(You) If I can trust you
Or all of the things you've said to me

And I may never know
The answer to this endless mystery

(Go) Where should I go?
(Do) What should I do?
I don't understand what you want from me

I'm spinning out of control, out of control
I'm spinning out of control, out of control
