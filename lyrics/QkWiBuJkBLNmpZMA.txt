Well, it seems to be some people think
I am just a dreamer
Well, listen close and you will find
I am a believer
The stubborn word is thick as mud
And this I can guarantee, yeah

Once I lost my way
All that I would say:

"Please take me home
To the place
I belong
I wanna die where I was born
Bury me beneath the family tree
Yeah, no one ever really want me to leave

Home
Baby, don't you know?
I'm finally home!"

Well, in this life I have found
Folks can be deceiving
They only smile for dollar signs
But I'll tell you their secret
They got no love, at least not for us
But I can't say the same
Ain't gonna be no fuss

Once I lost my way
All that I would say:

"Please take me home
To the place
I belong
I wanna die where I was born
Bury me beneath the family tree
Yeah, no one ever really wanted to leave

Home
Baby, don't you know?
I'm finally home!"

So take me home
To the place
I belong
I wanna die where I was born
Bury me beneath the family tree
Yeah, no one ever really wanted to leave

Home
Baby, don't you know?
I'm finally home!

Baby, don't you know? Yeah!
