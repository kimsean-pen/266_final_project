Sometimes it's true
Life can be so beautiful
These days you send
Wish they would never end
We've come this far
How beautiful you are...
Look back this far
How beautiful you are...

Sometimes I don't know where to go
Just pictures, looking, dreams you know
Sometimes I look out at the sky
And I don't feel the need to try

These days are full
Life can be so beautiful
We've come this far
How beautiful you are...
We've come this far
How beautiful you are...
Look back this far
How beautiful you are...
