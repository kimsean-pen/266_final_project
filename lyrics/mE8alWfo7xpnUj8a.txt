I hope you're down
'Cause I'm coming to see you
And I don't care where we're going
I wanna get lost tonight

I wanna bounce
To the beat of your breathing
I wanna move to your rhythm
And celebrate being alive

Don't need forever-er-er-er-er-er
I wanna be here and now
Let's come together-er-er-er-er-er
I wanna be here and now

No, I wouldn't wanna be
Anywhere but here
Anywhere-ere

I wouldn't wanna be
Anywhere but here
Here and now

No, I wouldn't wanna be
Anywhere but here
Anywhere-ere

I wouldn't wanna be
Anywhere but here
Here and now

Dance
As if no one is watching
And I am losing myself in the million rays of light

I wanna fly
As if I couldn't be falling
And we are not gonna worry
Baby, let's own the night

Here and now

No, I wouldn't wanna be
Anywhere but here
Anywhere-ere

I wouldn't wanna be
Anywhere but here
Here and now

No, I wouldn't wanna be
Anywhere but here
Anywhere-ere

I wouldn't wanna be
Anywhere but here
Here and now

Here and now
Here and now

Anywhere-ere

Here and now

No, I wouldn't wanna be
Anywhere but here
Anywhere-ere

I wouldn't wanna be
Anywhere but here
Here and now

No, I wouldn't wanna be
Anywhere but here
Anywhere-ere

I wouldn't wanna be
Anywhere but here
Here and now
