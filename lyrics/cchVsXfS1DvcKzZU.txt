Three years gone
I'm still searching for the future of the broken young
This isn't living it's surviving without hope
(Hold on)
Protect everything that you love and know

We are all victims of our own evolution
We suffer together but we all die alone
We shame our nation while it's on its knees
Stretched to breaking point with new disease
Won't you sing this with me?

We've strayed too far to be saved

I've been told
The fastest growing sickness lives inside of me
Cut or suffer beg or differ
Can't you see?
It's in the minds of the weak who think they're better than the shit we're living in

Black our eyes
Take our tongues
We're paying for the way shit should've been done
(Fuck it)
We're paying for the way shit should've been done
And still we beg
But still we beg
With our head in our hands
To a myth with a message but no escape plan

Suffering show us what we should've done
We're overdosed, we're overrun
Our pride our triumph
Trophies of violence
Always deceived by a false allegiance
To feed the ones that give in
Tear down our idols
Trophies of the violence

We're back to set the record straight
We're rage romantic and we're full of hatred
Some inspiration right now would suffice
This whole world's dreaming of a better fucking life

Thirsty parasites
We're dead behind the eyes
Of mindless genocide
Cannot stomach our vile pride
It tastes like shit
But most of us don't care
And the rest will never hear this
The flatline criticals
We clot the bleed and cauterise just to get by
Predisposed and true to form we rape the world of all it holds
We gut the earth of all it has
Call it hell when it can't give back

We are a living abortion
A vile creation
But let's make the best of a bad situation
Let's make the best of a bad situation

Black our eyes
Take our tongues
We're paying for the way shit should've been done
(Fuck it)
We're paying for the way shit should've been done
(You think we're nothing like these creatures)
Suffering show us what we should've done
We're overdosed, we're overrun
Our pride our triumph
Trophies of violence
Always deceived by a false allegiance
To feed the ones that give in
Tear down our idols
Trophies of the violence

But it's not the end of the worldâ€¦ yet
