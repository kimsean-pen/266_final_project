Tell me all your secrets
And I swear I'll keep them safe
I'm a fucking nightmare
But you love me just the same
But then something changed
'Cause the way that you say my name's not the same
And it's all my fault, I swear I know my grave
I wanna feel something again
I wanna feel anything at all

Marykate, I'm sorry that I let you down again
Marykate, I'm sorry that I let you down

And I'm trying to be
The person that you want me to be
But I'm not, sure if I can meet those needs
And I, I wish that I was anyone but me
Like on the TV screen or in the magazines

Marykate, I'm sorry that I let you down again
Marykate, I'm sorry that I let you down
