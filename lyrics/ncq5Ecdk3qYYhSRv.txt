Take a knife and carve it in
Want to see your faults as a part of your pretty skin
Everyone has a tragedy
I want you to wear yours in pain

Oblivion can no longer shade you
Reminded by the tattered tissue
Bleak silence, errors stigmatized in you
A weak worn out friend, there's nothing left for me

Again and again, your face reminds me of a bleak future
Despite the absence of hope
I give you this sacrifice

You're so far behind, be my hero
Drift away
Save yourself
Don't end up zero
'Cause I'll look the other way

I'll crawl into your vault
Pass snakes and old rotten thoughts
Leaving a hotbed of virulence
Your world inside slowly redesigned

Again and again, your face reminds me of a bleak future
Despite the absence of hope
I give you this sacrifice

You're so far behind, be my hero
Drift away
Save yourself
Don't end up zero
'Cause I'll look the other way

Again and again, your face reminds me of a bleak future
Despite the absence of hope
I give you this sacrifice

You're so far behind, be my hero
Drift away
Save yourself
Don't end up zero
'Cause I'll look the other way
You're so far behind, be my hero
Drift away
Save yourself
Don't end up zero
'Cause I'll look the other way (save yourself)
