Could fill spoons full of diamonds
Could fill spoons full of gold
Just a little spoon of your precious love
Will satisfy my soul

Men lies about it
Some of them cries about it
Some of them dies about it
Everything's a-fightin' about the spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful

Could fill spoons full of coffee
Could fill spoons full of tea
Just a little spoon of your precious love
Is that enough for me?

Men lies about it
Some of them cries about it
Some of them dies about it
Everything's a-fightin' about the spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, yeah

Could fill spoons full of water
Take them from the desert sands
But a little spoon of your forty-five
Saved you from another man

Men lies
Some of them cries about it
Some of them dies
Everything's a-fightin' about it
Everything's a-cryin' about it
Everything's-a everything's a-dyin' about it
Everything's a-cryin' about it
Everything's a-lyin' about it
In your home, in all

Spoonful, spoonful, yeah!
Here I am, dyin' about it
Ah-ah, yes, cryin' about it
That spoon, that spoon, that
Little old spoon, little old spoon, little old
Little old spoon, little old spoon, little old spoon

That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful, yeah
Ah, yeah

Everything's a-dyin' about it
Yeah! Alright
