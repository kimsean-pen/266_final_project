Do what you feel
Don't wait for the beginning
Choose what you want
Over what you were given

If your heart can't dance
You got no defense
This time
Don't leave it up to fate

Lose what you have
you don't really need it
Choose what you doubt
over what you believed in

If your heart can't dance
You don't stand a chance
This time

I'll wait for you
To leave it all behind

Night falls
The night falls
The night falls
The night falls
The night falls
The night falls
Night falls again
I'm here waiting for you

Do what you feel
Don't ask for their permission

Choose what you think over
All inhibitions

If your heart can't dance
You don't stand a chance
This time
Don't let the moment fade

Surrender it all
I'm here waiting for you
Surrender it all
Surrender

Night falls
The night falls
The night falls
The night falls
The night falls
The night falls
Night falls again
I'm here waiting for you

Night falls
The night falls
The night falls
The night falls
The night falls
The night falls
Night falls again
I'm here waiting for you

If the feeling dies
I'll be by your side
I can change your mind
If you let me try

The night falls
