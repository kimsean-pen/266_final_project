If I don't have an angel watching me
My nightmare will become reality
I'm afraid to fall back into sleep
I can see the demon, right in front of me

I can see the demon, right in front of me

If I don't have an angel watching me
My nightmare will become reality
I'm afraid to fall back into sleep
I can feel the demon, deep inside of me
Deep inside of me

Deep inside of me
