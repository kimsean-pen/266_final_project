I wanna get it
But I got bad brains
I'm what they like to call a special case
I am a coal mine in a classroom

I got detention cause I made a face
Nobody believed me that it's stuck that way
I am a stoner in the bathroom

Back in school
Back in place
Back in school
Back in chains
Back in school
Back in my cage

Back in school
Back in place
Back in school
Back in chains
Back in school
Back in my cage

I gave an apple to my playground crush
She told me that the apple wasn't bad enough
Aw shucks
So young to be so cruel

Back in school
Back in place
Back in school
Back in chains
Back in school
Back in my cage

Back in school
Back in place
Back in school
Back in chains
Back in school
Back in my cage

No, they don't teach the soul how to love

No, they don't teach the soul how to love

Back in school
Back in place
Back in school
Back in chains
Back in school
Back in chains

Back in school
Back in place
Back in school
Back in chains
Back in school
Back in chains

I wanna get it
But I got bad brains
I'm a what they call a special case
Back in school
Back in my cage
I got detention cause I made a face
Nobody believed me that it's stuck that way

Back in school
Back in my cage
Back in school
Back in my cage
