Draw names deep in the sand, holding onto each other's hands
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know

Telling lies, it's a big surprise, gazing deep into each other's eyes
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know

It's a mystery to me, how much you really love me
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know

And though I see ya' every night I never wanna leave your sight
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know

It's alarming how charming you can be
And though I know it's wrong I've done it all along
But now it's time to say:

Baby goodbye
Baby goodbye

I saw you out just the other day, I didn't have a clue what to say
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know

I miss the way you held me tight, I even miss our stupid fights
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know

It's alarming how charming you can be
And though I know its wrong I've done it all along
But now it's time to say:

Baby goodbye
Baby goodbye

You can have me everyday or we can go our separate ways You can have me everyday

Baby goodbye
Baby goodbye
Baby goodbye
Baby goodbye
Baby goodbye
Baby goodbye
Baby goodbye
Baby goodbye
