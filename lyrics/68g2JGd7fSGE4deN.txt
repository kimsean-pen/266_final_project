How can you call yourself a daughter?
You must have got it from your mother
You're blaming her for damage
I blamed you for mine
there must be something in the water

You passed it down a generation
I've seen that years of pain I'm facing
so it has to end with me, I have to make a promise
I swear to all my future daughters

I will not abandon you
I will always tell the truth
even if it's killing me
even if it pains I'll set it free.

All the love and all the love
All the love and all the love
All the love and all the love
All the love and all the love

I'm on a ledge in life I'm leaping
The ground is softer down below
From now on I'm in charge, from now on I'm the parent
I swear to you I'll be transparent.

I will not abandon you
I will always tell the truth
even if it's killing me
even if it pains I'll set it free.

I'll make sure you're well prepared
know the only thing to fear is fear
and all the love in all the world
can't replace your mother's, baby girl.

All the love and all the love
All the love and all the love
All the love and all the love
All the love and all the love

I will not abandon you
I will always tell the truth
even if it's killing me
even if it pains I'll set it free.

All the love and all the love
All the love and all the love
All the love and all the love
All the love and all the love
All the love and all the love
All the love and all the love
All the love and all the love
All the love and all the love

How can you call yourself a daughter?
You must have got it from your mother.
so it has to end with me, I have to make a promise
I swear to all my future daughters
