I am the new hell on earth
The lord of agony divine
Domination, intimidation lives within these eyes
Reign of power
Remorseless anarchy
I am arrogance in the flesh
Unleashed intensity

Step aside for the nightmare
Pure destruction stands before you
No escape as the psycho brings you misery
The line starts here
The line starts here

I am brutality, the face of everlasting pain
Annihilation, obliteration pulses in these veins
Sheer defiance drives my hostility
I am merciless to the core
Chaotic fury breeds

Step aside for the nightmare
Pure destruction stands before you
No escape as the psycho brings you misery
The line starts here
The line starts here

Bring it all on, come and take on what you fear
I'm the storm that towers overhead
Ticking time bomb with an infinite charge
Bringer of torture, the master is here
Everyone falls
Everyone falls

Here comes the pain
You're no different from the rest
Victim is your name in my vicious wasteland
Here comes the pain
Your destruction manifests
Lying there broken looking up as I still stand

Bring it all on, come and take on what you fear
I'm the storm that towers overhead
Ticking time bomb with an infinite charge
Bringer of torture, the master is here
Everyone falls
Everyone falls
