Ella:
Pennies in a stream
Falling leaves of a sycamore
Moonlight in Vermont

Icey finger waves
Ski trails on a mountain side
Snowlight in Vermont

Telegraph cables, they sing down the highway
And travel each bend in the road
People who meet, in this romantic setting
Are so hypnotized by the lovely...

Evening summer breeze
Warbling of a meadowlark
Moonlight in Vermont

Louis Armstrong:

Ella:

Warbling of a meadowlark
Moonlight in Vermont

You and I and moonlight in Vermont
