The fact that he doesn't care
About what I need
The fact that he doesn't care
About what I want
It's just a never ending game
Of learning how we're not the same
He just doesn't really care about me

Yes, I am so aware
Of how lost we are
How often we fight these days
How impatient you are
It's just a matter of time
Until we find ourselves apart
Yes, I don't really care anymore

You are the one
You are the one
You are the one for me
You are the one
You are the one
You are the one for me
You are the one
You are the one
You are the one for me
You are the one
You are the one
.Are the one
