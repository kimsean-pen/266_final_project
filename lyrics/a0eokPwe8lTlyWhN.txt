the night my
necklace fell off
you fluttered through my
capillaries like a
stone moth

i agree with your ideas but not your tactics
so look me in the eye & be practical
when practically there's nothing left for me to say or do
it's only up to you

a live ladybug
trapped between my toes:
keep it together man
we're all connected now
stay composed

i agree with your ideas but not your tactics
so look me in the eye & be practical
when practically there's nothing left for me to say or do
it's only up to you

the current picture: the metronome;
i don't know what this is but it's not my home

i thought that we were falling in love
but we weren't; only i was

i agree with your ideas but not your tactics
so look me in the eye & be practical
when practically there's nothing left for me to say or do
it's only up to you
