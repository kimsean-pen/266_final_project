Let me carry the corpse of a lifetime
Let me carry the weight of it all
Dry the tears by the grace of time
Worship the ritual of death
An illusion to feel safe in a house of glass
While hours break away like porcelain
Shades of oblivion dancing around
But some refuse to see
Once left the sacred womb
As bleak and desolate ghouls
An illusion to feel safe in a house of glass
