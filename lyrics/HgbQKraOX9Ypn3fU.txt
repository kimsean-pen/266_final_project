We can go there over bridges,
under bridges, over bridges
And when we get wet,
we hang to dry

I can do it,
I can bring it,
I can screw it,
I can sing it

I can screw it,
I can bring it,
I can do it,
I can sing it

If I stand still,
like a shark I'll die

I can lose it,
I can find it,
Whether it's my heart or mind

It's hard lo leave,
it all behind ohh

Somebody gotta pick up the phone when I call
Sitting here waiting doing nothing at all

When I fall I have to rise
Honey, You gotta come with me tonight... Hey

We can go there over bridges,
under bridges, over bridges
And when we get wet,
we hang to dry

Hiah, hiah, hiah, hiah,
Hiah, hiah, huhu, hiah,

City high, city low,
Gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta go
City low, gotta gotta go
We keep saying things without a sound

I can choose it,
I can use it,
I can be geronimo,
I can choose it,
I can use it,
I can be geronimo,

I've got to turn myself around oho
Geronimooooo
Geronimooooo Hey

We can go there over bridges,
under bridges, over bridges
And when we get wet,
we hang to dry
