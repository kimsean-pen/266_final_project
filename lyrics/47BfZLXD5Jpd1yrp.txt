Simmering songs never get plain
Tinsel dreams, sweet lemonade
The gates close the pack shut down
They packed up they found another town
To replace, to erase

Curious schools mimicking fools

This isn't control
This isn't control
This isn't control
This isn't control
This isn't control
This isn't control
This isn't control
This isn't control

Left behind the perfect crime
Like a swell hence subside
Subside
What was the spell it feels like a curse
Wonder if you could lead first

Curious schools mimicking fools

This isn't control
This isn't control
This isn't control
This isn't control
This isn't control
This isn't control
This isn't control
This isn't control
