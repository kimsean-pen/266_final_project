I'm running, I'm running
The moment I heard it
I guess I was nothin'
And a new girl that you caught (that you caught)
She, she is stunning
You stare me deep, deep in the eyes
With a sense of guilt
'Cause you knew how we build
You knew my boundaries
Stay, stay you fucking up the party and and done it
That led to the hickeys and bruises

As soon as I met your manoeuvres
Like a vampire in the dark
Huntin' for new blood, for new blood
Huntin' for new love, for new love
That will leave to new scars, that will leave to new scars
That will leave to new scars

My pain is filled with dust
No potions for us
Used to circulate blood until you swallowed my trust
My pain is filled with dust
No potions for us
Used to circulate blood until you swallowed my trust
My pain is filled with dust
No potions for us
Used to circulate blood until you swallowed my trust
My pain is filled with dust
No potions for us
Used to circulate blood until you swallowed my trust

Pain is filled with dust
Pulses and rust
Swallowed my trust
Pain is filled with dust
Pulses and rust
Swallowed my trust

You frontin', you frontin'
You keep telling lies
I'm tripping, I'm bugging
All I did was give my all
Now I'm left punching the wall
We in this club drunk as fuck, shit
That must stuck in bed luck
Second time goin' do this
And you knew 'bout my last one
So you did me dirty like my last one

My neck's filled with hickeys and bruises
As soon as I met your manoeuvres
Like a vampire in the dark
Huntin' for new blood, for new blood
Huntin' for new love, for new love
That will leave to new scars, that will leave to new scars
That will leave to new scars

My pain is filled with dust
No potions for us
Used to circulate blood until you swallowed my trust
My pain is filled with dust
No potions for us
Used to circulate blood until you swallowed my trust
My pain is filled with dust
No potions for us
Used to circulate blood until you swallowed my trust
My pain is filled with dust
No potions for us
Used to circulate blood until you swallowed my trust

Pain is filled with dust
Pulses and rust
Swallowed my trust
Pain is filled with dust
Pulses and rust
Swallowed my trust

I wanna dive in clouds
But clouds don't work for me
I wanna dive in clouds
But is this what you need
I wanna dive in clouds
But clouds ain't what they seem
Just how love deceives, just how love deceives, just how love deceives
I wanna dive in clouds
But clouds don't work for me
I wanna dive in clouds
But is this what you need
I wanna dive in clouds
But clouds ain't what they seem
Just how love deceives, just how love deceives, just how love deceives
