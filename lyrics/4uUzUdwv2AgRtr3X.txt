Out on the sea, we'd be forgiven
Our bodies stopped the spirit living
Wouldn't you like to know
How far you've got left to go?

Somebody's child, nobody made you
It's not what you stole, it's what they gave you
In or out you go
In your silence, your soul

Would you rather go unwilling?
Your heart is full and now it's spilling
Barreling down the steps
Only a moment left

In hind of sight, no peace of mind
Where you begin and I'm defined
Daughter of unconscious fate
Time will tell in spite of me

In hind of sight, no peace of mind
Where it begins and we're defined
Shadows bend and suddenly
The world becomes and swallows me in

Whistle to a friend gentle till the end
Anyway in a name she takes shape just the same
