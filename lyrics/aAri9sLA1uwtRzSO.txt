Hmmm ...

Soft heavenly eyes gazed into me
Transcending space and time
And I was a rendered still
There were no words for me to find at all
Or as I stood there beside myself
I could see you and no one else

When I saw you
When I saw you
I could not breathe, I fell so deep
When I saw you
When I saw you
I'd never be, I'd never be a same

Na na na
Na na na
O-o-o-o-oh
O-o-o-o-oh

O-only once in a lifetime love rushes in
Changin' you with a tide and dawn's ribbon of light

Bursts through the dark
Wakening you inside

And I thought it was all untrue
Until there all at once, I knew

When I saw you
When I saw you
I could not breathe, I fell so deep
When I saw you
When I saw you
I'd never be, I'd never be the same

With no beginning and without an end
You are the one for me and it's evident
And your eyes told me so, o-oh yeah
Your eyes let me know o-o-o-oh ...

When I saw you
When I saw you
I could not breathe, I fell so deep
When I saw you
When I saw you
I'd never be, I'd never be a same
O-o-o-o-oh ...
I'd never be the same
