It's magnetism
By the time I look in your eye
They call it kismet
Still taking us by surprise

It's an intuition
Loyal lover and friend of mine
You've got my devotion
A good connection for communication

And If you tell me you need me(I'll come on by)
And if you tell me you want me(I'll be by your side)
And if you tell me your hungry(I'll make you a lunch)
And if there's nothing to tell me

But you know that you're the only one I want
Don't want any other woman
You're the only I want
Don't want any other woman

Because it's magnetism
Dream come true
A manifestation
A living organism
Working it's magic, drawing me in

You're the only one I want, don't want any other woman
(You're the only one I want, don't want any other woman)
You're the only one I want, don't want any other woman
(You're the only one I want, don't want any other woman)
No

And If you ever need me(I'll come on by)
And if you ever want me(I'll be by your side)
And if you ever need me (I'll come on by)
If you want me

Know that you're the only one I want, don't want any other woman
(You're the only one I want, don't want any other woman)
You're the only one I want, don't want any other woman
(You're the only one I want, don't want any other woman)
No
No
No
No
No

Because it's magnetism
