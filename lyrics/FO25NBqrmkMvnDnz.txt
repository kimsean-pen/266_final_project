Someone turned the light on, baby
Someone turned the light on
Someone turned the heat on, honey
Someone turned the heat on
Someone find a someone, baby
Someone to rely on
Someone turned the heat on, honey
The summer's here

Early june
I will stay
It will bloom
If you say
What a life
In the shadow
What a life
In the shadow
Out of sight
Coming soon
There's a light
Afternoon
Let the sun
Be your guide
Let it come
By your side

Someone take the cash out, baby
Someone take the cash out
Someone fix a drink now, honey
Someone fix a drink now
Someone find a someone baby
Together we'LL get lashed out
Someone fix a drink now honey
The summer's here

Any way the wind blows
ANY WAY THE WIND BLOWS

Early June I'm a cowboy
Early June I'm a cowboy
