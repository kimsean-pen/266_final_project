Lost in the cracks of the landslide
You saw me slipping on my blind side
I'm feeling lost, feeling tongue-tied
And now I'm frozen in your headlights

Deep in the haze of your love high
I used to soar on the live wire
I'm coming down from your supply
And I don't know if you can make right

I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me
I can't take it
Can't believe I went and lost you baby
Earth keeps shaking
All around
Oh, you let me down
And I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking

Watch it

Oh you let me down
No one saved me
No one saved me
No one saved me me me...

Oh you let me down
No one saved me
No one saved me
No one saved me me me...

Ohh
Ohh
Oh you let me down

I can't take it
Can't believe I went and lost you baby
Earth keeps shaking
I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me

Watch it

Watch it

Watch it

Watch it

Hit the ground running up from you
Baby you know I don't want to
No I want you
But there's nothing left to say

Lost in the riddle you gave me
Caught in the middle you played me;
See so plainly
But there's nothing left to say...

I should've known
I should've known
Known Known

I should've known
I should've known
Known Known

I should've known
I should've known
I should've known
I should've known...

Watch it

Ohh
Ohh
Oh you let me down

I can't take it
Can't believe I went and lost you baby
Earth keeps shaking
I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me
