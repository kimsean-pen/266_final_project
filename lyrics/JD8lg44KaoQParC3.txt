Such a life without the light
Do you fear to lose your sight?
Well it doesn't bother me
Cause you don't see what I see
There's a devil in my mind
and the mysteries of time revealed
In the dark I'm running free
Give to me your energy

Oh, give me to the night
Give me to the ages
Take me away
Give me to the night
Give me to the ages
The darkness is calling

I don't think of all the things
That I will never be
I don't think of all the places
That I will never see
And I won't get on my knees
For all the people I can't please
But it seems to be so easy for you
So do it by yourself!

Oh, give me to the night
Give me to the ages
Take me away
Give me to the night
Give me to the ages
The darkness is calling my name
Again and again and again!

Give me to the night
Give me to the ages
Take me away
Give me to the night
Give me to the ages
The darkness is calling

Oh, give me to the night
Give me to the ages
Take me away
Give me to the night
Give me to the ages
The darkness is calling my name
