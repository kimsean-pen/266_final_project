Best Of Both Worlds,
That's what you want
All your own way, That's not my way
And I won't share you, I couldn't fare to
It's time for you to choose
Which one you'd rather loose
Could you love me, And forget me
Are you sorry, That you've met me?
What we've been through,
Means nothing to you I can't satisfy you
You want
Best Of Both Worlds
Make your fickle mind up
I won't stay while you enjoy
Best of Both Worlds
I have loved you Since I found you
You belong here,
Just look around you
Keep your true love,
Or take your new love
You must choose between us,
You want Best Of Both Worlds
Make your fickle mind up
I won't stay while you enjoy
Best Of Both Worlds
You've got to choose between us
You just can't have the two of us
Make your fickle mind up
I won't stay while you enjoy
Best of Both Worlds
