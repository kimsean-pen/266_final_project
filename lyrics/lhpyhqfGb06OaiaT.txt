Will you keep our love and your mistakes?
And what's left, I will be free to take
And I can't lie if I don't know the truth
Just another night, drunk and confused

Will you keep our love and my mistakes?
And what's left, I will be free to take
When the fog meets the water of your lies
When the fog meets the water of your lies

What is real is what you feel

When the fog meets the water of your lies
When the fog meets the water of your lies

(When the fog meets the water of your lies)
What is real is what I feel
It's real
