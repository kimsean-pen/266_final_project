Wait
I'll be swifter than the speed of light
Carbon my body a billion years of time
You wake with the stitches over both your eyes
And deny me my body and all earthly delights

It's time
You are light
I guess you are afraid of what everyone is made of

All your praying moments amount to just one breath
Please keep your victory
But give me little death

It's time
You are light
I guess you are afraid of what everyone is made of

So take to the streets with apocalypse refrain
Your devotion has the look of a lunatic's gaze
