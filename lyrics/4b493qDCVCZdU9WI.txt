Why don't you talk to each other?
Why don't you talk to each other?
Just give it a try
Why don't you talk about what happened?

I know you're trying to avoid it but I don't know why
You might not believe it
You might not believe it but you got a lot in common, you really do
You both love me and I love both of you

Look, if I were you I'd hate me too
I don't hate you
But I knew how you felt about Rose and I stayed anyway
That wasn't the problem

Then what was?
She fell in love with you
Well, you know Rose
She always did what she wanted

I know you both need it
I know you both need it
Someone who knows what you're going through
You might not believe it
You might not believe it but you got a lot in common
you really do
You both love me and I love both of you
You both love me and I love both of you
