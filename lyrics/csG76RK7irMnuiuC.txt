When you wake up in your morning
Head on down the river
See your soul
Feel it sway
Hear the world screaming
Listen, your name
Makes it seems like nothing could hear you

You fall back off the ledge in your mind's eye
It can see how you land and that's the difference
Now proceed calmly to the edge of your road
A narrow way that is leading you home

Will I hear my soul?
Will I hear my soul?
Will I hear my soul?
Will I hear my soul?

You feel your shoulder tightening
So you lean and sway
If you're made of stone, then turn into clay
Wash away my body, I don't need it
I stop moving, slowly glisten and hurt

Mary has a note for me, I'll leave in a day
A precious secret, like a bird inside a vest
Wings won't mend, so I hold them again
It doesn't speak, it just sings 'til it burns

Then I hear my soul
Then I hear my soul
Then I hear my soul
Will I hear my soul?
Will I hear my soul?
Will I hear my soul?
Will I hear my soul?
Will I hear my soul?

Only placement in the ages drees me
Then why can't it please me?
And why must my dirty skin be hot when you come near me?
Must remember to dance alone at night
Keep the profane in the light
I have only got this life and it merits this
It merits this
Merits this, yeah
Merits this, oh

I must remember to dance with you tonight
I must remember I owe my heart
