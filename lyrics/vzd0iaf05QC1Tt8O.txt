A winter morning black as any night
A landscape held in time under the ice
There's a house on the hill
She's living there still
Rooms are full of pictures black and white

So the story goes, she lives alone
Her company is framed in monochrome
She keeps them alive
Long after they've died
No one ever knows until they're gone

Stand still evermore
Pose for eternity with me
Your soul on my wall
Love is a camera full of memories
I once went to her house when I was young
The spell to be her subject was too strong
Now from here behind glass
I see more fools pass
Flies caught in the secret web she's spun

Stand still evermore
Pose for eternity with me
Your soul on my wall
Love is a camera full of memories
Every photograph
Is a cenotaph
Won't you stay here a while
In a flash you'll see
You belong to me
All I need is a smile

Stand still evermore
Pose for eternity with me
Your soul on my wall
Love is a camera full of memories

Stand still evermore
Pose for eternity with me
Your soul on my wall
Love is a camera full of memories
Run, run away from the house on the hill
There's a witch in the house that you're living next to
Run, run away from the house on the hill
There's a witch in the house that you're living next to
