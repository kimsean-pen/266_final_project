Dan, you're an old soul
And the songs that you write are beautiful
And the songs that you sing are sad and true
And you make believe
And you make us laugh
And you sing us to sleep
And you make us cry when you drop your gun
Dan, old soul

Dad, you're an old soul
And the words that you write are beautiful
And the stories that you told when I was young
How it shaped me
And the land that we love
And our family
And the way I see myself in you
Dad, old soul
