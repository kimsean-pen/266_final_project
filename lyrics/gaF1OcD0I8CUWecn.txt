You think you're a fighter
Fighting for a better place
Where you can live your life
Without any fears

You will not succeed
As long as you pray
To the god of light
Listen to my words

Surrender to the darkness
Hide yourself from the light
Don't fight against your destiny
Be a part of the night

You waste your time
Down on your knees
Waiting for a light
To touch your soul

You will not succeed
As long as you pray
To the god of light
Listen to my words

Surrender to the darkness
Hide yourself from the light
Don't fight against your destiny
Be a part of the night

You will not succeed
As long as you pray
To the god of light
Listen to my words

Surrender to the darkness
Hide yourself from the light
Don't fight against your destiny
Be a part of the night
(Be a part of the night)
(Be a part of the night)
