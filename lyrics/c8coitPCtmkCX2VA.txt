I feel something cruel within me
Calling out
It calls my heart to wonder
Far from here
It troubles my dreams
The thoughts of leaving
It claws at me
Leave everything I've come to know and depend on

Buried hidden meanings at the edge of everything
Slowly there corroding every bit that's left of me
Buried hidden meanings at the edge of everything
Slowly there corroding every bit that's left of me

The weight is not mine
Weight is not mine alone
Though you pretend you comprehend it
The fear is not mine, the fear is not my end
Though you attempt to keep me in it

Did you even try to find me?
Did you even care for one last chance at reconciliation?
Do you know how long these veins have ran?
Remnant of red that stains your hands
We are all but to our hand again
This familiar place of discontent
Are you ready for the Apocalypse?
When our hearts implode, from this corrosion.

Buried hidden meanings at the edge of everything
Slowly there corroding every bit that's left of me
Buried hidden meanings at the edge of everything
Slowly there corroding every bit that's left of me

You must know
And you all... but must know

The fear is not mine, the fear is not my end
Though you attempt to keep me in it
The weight is not mine
Weight is not mine alone
Though you attempt to keep me in it

Did you even try to find me?
Did you even care for one last chance at reconciliation?
Do you know how long these veins have ran?
Remnant of red that stains your hands
