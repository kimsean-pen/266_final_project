Riding a motorcycle and being in a gang
being in love and womans rights and male hedonism
wroshipping the devil
good vibes all around
and acting cool
and acting cool
and acting cool
and acting cool
and acting cool
and acting cool
sometimes you gotta close your eyes
to truly see the light
and most of us are older now
we should know wrong from right
you and me
me and you
loving each other the way that we do
i changed my life i was gasping for air
i was leaning forward almost fell outta my chair
and now youre looking suspicious asking
is that true come on people
would i lie to you
come on people
would i lie to you
would i lie to you
its just that sometimes you gotta close your eyes
to truly see the light
(its just that) most of us are older now
we should know wrong from right
you and me
me and you
loving each other the way that we do
more like a couple of nights ago
said nobody knows
oh i am safe but not for long
go back a couple of nights ago
play the usual
so i feel safe to sing along
more like a couple of nights ago
couple nights ago
