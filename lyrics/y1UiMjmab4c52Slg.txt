This is the film, close to the third act and the misery
It's not rain you rapist werewolves, it's God pissing down on you

You won't die alone 'cause I'll break off my own arms
Sharpen my bones, stab you once for each time
I thought you were trying to take something
You'll never be good enough to even look upon

It's better to push something when it's slipping
Than to risk being dragged down

If you wanna hit bottom don't bother to try taking me with you
I won't answer if you call
Two heartbeats down in, in hell
Trying to break your fall, your fall

This isn't a mob, won't need to change the names
Everyone around you has murdered someone, something sacred
Isn't one nail without dirt under it?
Isn't any white cotton panties that aren't soaked and stained red?

It's better to push something when it's slipping
Than to risk being dragged down

If you wanna hit bottom don't bother to try taking me with you
I won't answer if you call
Two heartbeats down in, in hell
Trying to break your fall, your fall

Into the fire, into the fire
Into the fire, into the fire
Into the fire, into the fire
Into the fire, into the fire
Into the fire
