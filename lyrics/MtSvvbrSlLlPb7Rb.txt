Another saturday, another careless move
Tells the world that you're thinking of what to do
A window opens up, then someone calls your name

But I can tell you don't know how to play this game

I know this isn't it
You'll hit your target someday

So now you're on your own
Won't you come back home
To see you're not that kind
And find the strength, to find the strength
To find another way
To find another way
To find another way
To find another way

So tell me what you need and I'll accommodate
But if too long goes by you just might be too late
An opportunity you can't afford to waste
So have the lines in your head first, for heaven's sake

You hear the day beckoning
Know that it's all in your head

So now you're on your own
Won't you come back home
To see you're not that kind
And find the strength, to find the strength
To find another way

So now you're on your own
Won't you come back home
To see you're not that kind
And find the strength, to find the strength...

So now you're on your own
Won't you come back home
To see you're not that kind
And find the strength, to find the strength
To find another way
