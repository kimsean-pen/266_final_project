I've been staring at the world, waiting
I've been looking for a change lately
All the trouble and all the pain we're facing
Someone gotta be the hope and someone gotta be the light

Too much light to be living in the dark
Where are we going? We ain't getting very far
Why waste time?
We only got one life

And don't you know it starts today?
And baby, no, it's not too late
It begins with you and I
Together we can be the change

So go on, let your heart burn bright
And watch it catch like a wild fire
I believe in you and I
Together we can be the change
Whoah, whoah
Whoah, together we can be the change

So many hearts around the world breaking
If I only got one chance, I'll take it
Let my voice be the trumpet that can say that
Someone gotta be the hope, someone gotta be the love

Too much light to be living in the dark
Where are we going? We ain't getting very far
Why waste time?
We only got one life

And don't you know it starts today?
And baby, no, it's not too late
It begins with you and I
Together we can be the change

So go on, let your heart burn bright
And watch it catch like a wild fire
I believe in you and I
Together we can be the change
Whoah, whoah
Whoah, together we can be the change

Face it
One chance we gotta take it
Stand together and change it
We can make this world bright
Turn on all the lights
Face it
One chance we gotta take it
Stand together and change it
We can make this world bright
Turn on all the lights
We can be the change

And don't you know it starts today?
And baby, no, it's not too late
It begins with you and I
Together we can be the change

So go on, let your heart burn bright
And watch it catch like a wild fire
I believe in you and I
Together we can be the change
Whoah, whoah
Whoah, together we can be the change
Whoah, whoah
Whoah, together we can be the change
