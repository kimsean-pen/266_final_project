One hundred thousand
Repetitions
Recite the mantra
Flowers unfold
Loosen the grip
Undo the fiction
Release the power
Trapped in the story

One hundred thousand
Thousand million thoughts
Streams of tomorrow
Drowning this moment
Loosen the noose
Release the bonds
Breathe in the power
Of no tomorrow

This mystery never ends
Angels and demons smiling
Embrace the burial mound
Prepare the ground

One hundred thousand
Nightmares obscure
The precious knowledge
Form is illusion
Loosen the noose
Release the bonds
Breathe in the power
Held in this moment

Prepare the ground
The burial mound
Breathe in the power
Held in this moment
This blessed grave
This blessed death

Streams of tomorrow
Cleanse our fate
Silver moon
Trumpet sounds
All to awaken
Prepare the ground
Awaken
