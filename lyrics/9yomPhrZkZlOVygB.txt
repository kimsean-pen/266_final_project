I'll be the one
That stays 'till the end
And I'll be the one
That needs you again
And I'll be the one that proposes
In a garden of roses
And truly loves you long after curtain closes
But will you still love me
When nobody wants me around?
When I turn 81 and forget things
Will you still be proud?
Cause I am the one
That waited this long
And I am the one
That might get it wrong
And I'll be the one that will love you
The way I'm supposed to, girl
But will you still love me
When nobody wants me around, around?
When I turn 81 and forget things
Will you still be proud?
Proud of me, of my short list of accomplishments
Me and my lack of new news
Me and my selfishness
Or me and myself wish you nothing but a happy new version of you
Cause I, I, mm-mmh
Want you to tell me you find it hard to be yourself so I can say it's gonna be alright
And I want you to love me the way you love your family
The way you love to show me what it's like to be happy
