You were so young,
And I guess im old.
Open your eyes,
Ill keep mine closed.
I prefer standing,
And you take your seat.
Ill be wide awake,
And you'll fall asleep.
And you'll fall down a hole.
That's the one place we both know
You take me with you if you could, but I wouldn't go
I guess sometimes we both loose our minds, to find a better road.

I can be pensive,
You can be so sure.
You'll be the poison,
You'll be the cure.
I'm alone on the journey,
I'm alive none the less,
And when you do your very worst,
Mmmmm it feels the best.

And you'll fall down a hole.
That's the one place we both know.
You take me with you if you could, but I wouldn't go.
I guess sometimes we both loose our minds, and find a better road.

And you'll fall down a hole.
That's the one place in this world that we both know.
You take me with you if you could,
But if you could i'd lose everything.

Can't you see the faces melting as the sun rains from their eyes,
Go on and keep your head with the hearts that you left behind.
Look at yourself, look in the mirror, don't you see a lie?
That you tell yourself again a thousand times.
And the truth that makes us laugh will make you cry,
You wanna die? No?

So you fall down a hole,
Thats the one place where we both know,
You take me with you if you could but I wouldn't go.
Because sometimes, we both loose our minds to find a better road.
