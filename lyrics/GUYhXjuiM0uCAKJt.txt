I'm convinced that you hate, you hate me,
You like, you like to see my cry.
It's already a proven fact,
That you hate and you wait on me to die.
It's so scary, I find it hard to confine,
I will make you see it my way.
You give, I take,
You say you want to be away from me.

You bring me!
I've got the reason and I don't wanna let go!
Take me down!
I've got the reason and I want to know!

I'm convinced that you, fucked me real good,
You did but I won't let it go.
I got my reasons and I'm not leaving,
So I'll wait on you to die.
Please take this time for me to be unforgiven,
I give my life to you.
I lay my life on a line for you,
For you, for you, for you!

You bring me!
I've got the reason and I don't wanna let go!
Take me down!
I've got the reason and I want to know!

I...
Got...
No reason...
I...
Got...

You bring me!
I've got the reason and I don't wanna let go!
Take me down!
I've got the reason and I want to know!

Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
I've got no reason!
