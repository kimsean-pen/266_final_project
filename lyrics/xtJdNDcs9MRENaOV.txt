I've been in and out of my head a thousand times
Trying to pick apart the words you said
To make some kind of sense in my mind
Here's to moving on
Screaming at the wind
Cause I know that you're well and truly gone

Better late than never gets me by

Your second-guess
Well it's just as good as mine and I'll confess
Though the words are gone the hurt lives on
Apologies
They have left me cold and empty
Screaming all the words you said, again

Better late than never gets me by

I've been begging all these years for your
forgiveness but every word I say just complicates the distance

I couldn't leave this behind if I tried
Cause better late than never gets me by

And I'll be begging on my knees for your forgiveness
For every word you said that I mistook for weakness
I can't seem to leave this behind though I try
Cause better late than never gets me by

Better late than never gets me by
Better late than never gets me by
Better late than never gets me by
Better late than never
