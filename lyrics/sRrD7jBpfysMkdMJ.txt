Mississippi, I'm alone in the alley
What am I supposed to be fighting for?
If you build yourself up tall
you can tell me what the future holds
Will you settle where you stand or keep it to yourself?

Will you go?
Will you go?
Will you go?
Will you go?

Will you go?
Will you go?
Will you go?
Will you go?

Will you go?
Will you go?
Will you go?
Will you go?
