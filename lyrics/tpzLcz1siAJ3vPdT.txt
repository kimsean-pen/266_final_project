You can have the sound of a thousand voices calling your name
You can have the light of the world blind you, bathe you in grace
But I don't see so easily what you hold in your hands
Cause castles crumble, kingdoms fall and turn into sand

You can be an angel of mercy or give up the hate
You can try to buy it just like it every other careless mistake
How do you justify I'm mystified by the ways of your heart
With a million lies the truth will rise to tear you apart

No one gets out alive,
Every day is do or die
The one thing you leave behind is
How did you love?
How did you love?
It's not what you believe
Those prayers will make you bleed
But while you're on your knees
How did you love?
How did you love?
How did you love?

Nothing ever feels the quite same when you are what you dreamed
And you will never look at anything the same when you see what I see
How we forget ourselves, lose our way from the cradle to the grave
You can't replicate or duplicate, gotta find your own way

No one gets out alive,
Every day is do or die
The one thing you leave behind is
How did you love?
How did you love?
It's not what you believe
Those prayers will make you bleed
But while you're on your knees
How did you love?
How did you love?
How did you love?

This ain't no cross to bury
We are the judge and jury
We are the judge and jury

No one gets out alive,
Every day is do or die
The one thing you leave behind is
How did you love?
How did you love?
It's not what you believe
Those prayers will make you bleed
But while you're on your knees
How did you love?
How did you love?

This ain't no cross to carry
We are the judge and jury
This ain't no cross to bury
We are the judge and jury

How did you love?
How did you love?
How did you love?
How did you love?
How did you love?
How did you love?
How did you love?
How did you love?
