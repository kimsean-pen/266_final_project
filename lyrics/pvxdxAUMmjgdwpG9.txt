I think I know you
I know a thousand times
We must be hiding this so I'll stay sleeping

There's nothing wrong
I just don't have it now
I can't sell myself that love is real

Every time I feel okay my heart moves forward
Thinking of the one today and I get
Every time I feel okay my head moves forward
Figure out the one today and I get

I think I know you
I know a thousand times
We must be hiding this so I'll stay sleeping

There's nothing wrong
I just don't have it now
I can't sell myself that love is real

Every time I feel okay my heart moves forward
Thinking of the one today and I get sleepy
Every time I feel okay my head moves forward
Figure out the one today and I get

Try to keep it quieter today
Try to keep it quieter today
