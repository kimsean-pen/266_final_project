Frozen dog hanging by a chain over the fire in the yard
Oh my God, little bones that break and free me from my haunted house

Sing your simple shiners pretty heart
Sing your simple shiners pretty heart

Lover now torn apart on weekends you spend in your bed alone
Oh my god, misery is tangible and breaks your heart in two

Sing your simple shiners pretty heart
Sing your simple shiners pretty heart
