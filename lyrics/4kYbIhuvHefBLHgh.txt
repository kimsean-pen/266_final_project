you move forward, i move backwards
and together we make nothing at all
and everybody knows
how your garden's growing tonight

what's this tender fascination
and the boredom emulation of love
stories to take home
we had your garden growing just right

you do it for me
you do it with quickness
a man of the hour
as god is my witness
me and my song
we'll do it alone

you do it for me
you do it for money
a man of the hour
it aches in my belly
me and my song
we'll do it alone

now this tender fascination
is only meant to take you so far
i'll remind you to remind
how else to never mind it at all

you move forward, i move backwards
and together we make nothing at all
everybody knows
how your garden's growing tonight

you do it for me
you do it with quickness
a man of the hour
as god is my witness
me and my song
we'll do it alone

you do it for me
you do it for money
a man of the hour
it aches in my belly
me and my song
we'll do it alone
