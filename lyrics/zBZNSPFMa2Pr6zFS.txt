Into the twilight zone
You will never be alone
The monsters will come out to play
When evil feeds your fear
The good will never disappear
A bright light will show you the way

Into the twilight zone
You will never be alone
A bright light will show you the way

They're here
They're here
They're here

Into the twilight zone
You will never be alone
The monsters will come out to play
When evil feeds your fear
The good will never disappear
A bright light will show you the way

A bright light will show you the way
