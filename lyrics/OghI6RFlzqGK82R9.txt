Your repetition is killing us, killing us
We made a story and it wore off, it wore off
So what is this?
My head spins
The air's getting thick now and I can't breathe
The words are coming so easily
The air's getting thick now and I can't breathe
The words are coming so easily
Oh no, oh no
Everybody out, everybody out of here
I can't stand it
Everybody out, everybody out of here
A broken mind, a fear of rage, fear of rage
We tried our best but nothing came, nothing came
So what is this?
I feel nothing
The air's getting thick now and I can't breathe
The words are coming so easily
The air's getting thick now and I can't breathe
The words are coming so easily
Oh no, oh no
Everybody out, everybody out of here
I can't stand it
Everybody out, everybody out of here
