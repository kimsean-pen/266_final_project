I was riding in the basement
Buying Cassios with my friend
Then I found my dad's old tape-machine
That sip the magic again

I was lonely, I was havin' fun
I was lonely, but I was having fun

I don't wanna start all over again
I don't wanna start all over again

Singin' pumpkins in the mirror
Pointin' mitfalls under my bed
Before I was fat, a truncheon leaf
Everything still had a head

I was lonely, I was havin' fun
I was lonely, but I was having fun

I don't wanna start all over again
I don't wanna start all over again
