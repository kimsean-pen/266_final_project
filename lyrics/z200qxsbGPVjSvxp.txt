I can't believe it
The way you look sometimes
Like a trampled flag on a city street, oh yeah
And I don't want it
The things you're offering me
Symbolized bar code, quick I.D., oh yeah

'Cause I'm a 21st century digital boy
I don't know how to live, but I've got a lot of toys
My daddy's a lazy middle class intellectual
My mommy's on Valium, so ineffectual
Ain't life a mystery, yeah

I can't explain it
The things you're saying to me
It's going yayayayayayaya, oh yeah

'Cause I'm a 21st century digital boy
I don't know how to read, but I've got a lot of toys
My daddy's a lazy middle class intellectual
My mommy's on Valium, so ineffectual
Ain't life a mystery, yeah

I tried to tell you about no control
But now I really don't know
And then you told me how bad you had to suffer
Is that really all you have to offer?

'Cause I'm a 21st century digital boy
I don't know how to live, but I've got a lot of toys
My daddy's a lazy middle class intellectual
My mommy's on Valium, so ineffectual

Cats, sports, iron claw (21st century digital boy)
Neurosurgeon, scream for more (21st century digital boy)
Innocents raped with napalm fire (21st century digital boy)
Everything I want, I really need (21st century digital boy)

Ain't life a mystery, yeah
