Call your momma "mommy"
(You gotta not!)
Askin' her for money
(You gotta not!)
Never keep your house clean
(You gotta not!)
Wearin' dirty laundry
(You gotta not!)
Is that what you call flirtin'?
(You gotta not!)
You ain't even workin', boy get a job
And baby when you wanna start growin' up
We can boom, boom, boom, baby, fall in love

Oh, you don't like kids?
(You gotta not!)
And you still smoke cigs? (Ew)
(You gotta not!)
Is you afraid of Blue's Clues?
(You gotta not!)
Do you still use a bluetooth?
(You gotta not!)
You love whitey-tighties
(You gotta not!)
'Cause they only show off your muffin top
And baby when you wanna start growin' up
We can boom, boom, boom, baby, fall in love
(Let's go!)

I need a man, a man who can act like a man
So hear me now, I don't get paid to babysit no one
I'm out here lookin' for the one to love
Singin', I need a man, so hear me now

Oh, you don't bump to The Weeknd?
(You gotta not!)
You argue with my best friend?
(You gotta not!)
Yeah all the hottie-totties
(You gotta not!)
If that's the way you party
(You gotta not!)
Everybody want me
(You gotta not!)
But you kinda hot, so I thought, why not?
And baby when you wanna start growin' up
We can boom, boom, boom, baby, fall in love

I need a man, a man who can act like a man
So hear me now, I don't get paid to babysit no one
I'm out here lookin' for the one to love
Singin', I need a man, so hear me now

Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

All my ladies, if you need a man, sing it!
Call your momma "mommy"
(You gotta not!)
Askin' her for money
(You gotta not!)
And baby when you wanna start growin' up
We can boom, boom, boom, baby, fall in love

I need a man, a man who can act like a man
So hear me now, I don't get paid to babysit no one
I'm out here lookin' for the one to love
Singin', I need a man, so hear me now

Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
(So hear me now)
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
(So hear me now)
I need, I need a man
I need, I need a man
I need, I need a man
I need, I need a man
I need a man
