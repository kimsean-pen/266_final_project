Black eyes in the summer sublime
Now your blood has turned to wine
Don't be so quick to call me a child
Came to with the curtains drawn
No need to hide the scars on your arms
Was then I knew nothing was wrong

Anymore, anymore, anymore
I couldn't take anymore, anymore, anymore
I wanted to die with you
I wanted to die with you

I didn't know the price I'd pay
I lost my way, don't say it wasn't true
But could you never learn to behave
Like a middle class kid with the privilege to save
Your barbs for a private page?
Don't need to be told what I'll never be

Anymore, anymore, anymore
I couldn't take anymore, anymore, anymore
I wanted to die with you
I wanted to die with you
I wanted to die with you
I wanted to die with you
I wanted to die with you
I wanted to die with you
I wanted to die with you
I wanted to die with you, oh
I wanted to die with you
I wanted to die with you
