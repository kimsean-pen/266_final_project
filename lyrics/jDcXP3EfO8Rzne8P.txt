It's 4 a.m. in London, it's evening for you
You're staring at the sunlight while I'm looking at the moon
You're getting up for work now as I settle into bed
Couple tears on a screen but remember when we said

Flock of birds fly over the time zones
Nobody can tell us what we don't know

Distance is easy, you make me completely alive
You make me completely alive
You make me completely alive
You make me completely alive
You make me complete

It's 4 a.m. in London, finally I know
The way that I'm feeling is bigger than the roses
That I've been sending your way
How else could I say?

Fock of birds fly over the time zones
Nobody can tell us what we don't know

Distance is easy, you make me completely alive
You make me completely alive
You make me completely alive
You make me completely alive
You make me completely alive

Be on time that's what matter to me now
You play it too long and we share what we found
Swimming in your arms but as the sun goes down
Flying your way through the night and the day

Be on time that's what matter to me now
You play it too long and we share what we found
Swimming in your arms but as the sun goes down
Flying your way through the night and the day

You make me completely alive
You make me completely alive
You make me completely alive
(You make me completely alive)
You make me completely alive
