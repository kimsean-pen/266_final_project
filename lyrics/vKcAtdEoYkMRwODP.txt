In a wooden boat in the shipping lanes
With the freighters towering over me
I can hear the jets flying overhead
Making lines across the darkening sky
And when the sun is going down
I can take a taxi into town
And the waiter at the restaurant
Sets a table just for one

Wheels keep on spinning round
spinning round, spinning round
Wheels keep on spinning round
Spinning round and round

Okay

So I had a plane to take me to
A place so far away from you
Eventually we began to see
That we could be completely free
And I could get away from you
And you could get away from me
And we could live each separately
In our cities in the sun

Wheels keep on spinning round
Spinning round, spinning round
Wheels keep on spinning round
Spinning round and round

Hey hey
Okay, alright

In a seedy karaoke bar
By the banks of the mighty Bosphorus
Is a Japanese man in a business suit
Singing, smoke gets in your eyes
And the muscular cyborg German dudes
Dance with sexy French-Canadians
While the overweight Americans
Wear their patriotic jumpsuits

Wheels keep on spinning round
Spinning round, spinning round
Wheels keep on spinning round
Spinning round and round

Alright, hey
It's alright, hey
This one right, hey

Wheels keep on spinning round
Spinning round, spinning round
Wheels keep on spinning round
Spinning round and round
I don't know
Why you say you are not in love with me?
