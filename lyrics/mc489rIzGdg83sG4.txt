I want to make, to feel the golden age
I miss the rush, the lights of better days
You count me out of such a life's worth
And turn around, gonna feel, gonna touch, gonna hold
the things you had

I won't feel the sun's too hot
I can't touch your precious past
But I live, I live, I live
I live those days tonight

You claim your history is beyond, a man like me
But I live, I live, I live
I live those days tonight

Face the ghost the keeps me on the ground
Take the best of what they talk about
In the cold outside we're waiting
to embrace the nights of fully ghosts
I gonna feel the love you had

I won't feel the sun's too hot
I can't touch your precious past
But I live, I live, I live
I live those days tonight

You claim your history is beyond, a man like me
But I live, I live, I live
I live those days tonight

I live, I live, I live
I live, I live, I live
I live those days, live those dreams,
like they're all mine
I hold them close inside
I live those days, live those dreams,
like they're all mine
I won't let them hold me back
I live those days, live those dreams,
like they're all mine
I hold them close inside
I live those days, live those dreams,
like they're all mine
I won't let them hold me back

I won't feel the sun's too hot
I can't touch your precious past
But I live, I live, I live
I live those days tonight

You claim your history is being young, a man like me
But I live, I live, I live
I live those days tonight
