Wow, you're telling me about this
I'll tell you about that
Stop talking shit you'll walk into another trap
When all the time you know
You know my name, you know my name, you know my name
Just settle down you're losing the plot
It took you a lifetime to get where you got
If I had it all I'd be dead in a week
If I had my way I'd be king for a day

Oh wow, what's your band called mate?
Well what's your band called mate?
I'm sorry, oh I'm sorry but it's far too late
I'm trying to start a war
I heard it all before
Now go fetch me a milkshake don't forget the straw

Now I don't have the time to listen to this
I don't know by now that the point you have missed
Look what you've got
It's love that it's not
Don't care what they say, be king for a day, be king for a day

We got the night, we got the world
Into the future I give you my word
Open your eyes into the light, into the light

Wow, you smell of hotel soap
Trying to tell your joke
Over and over just blowing smoke
Industry standard time after time
The higher the mountain the higher I climb

What is the point in trying to pretend?
In single file we queue to the end
Look what you've got
It's love that it's not
Don't care what they say, be king for a day, be king for a day
Take all you fuckers and blow you away

We got the night, we got the world
Into the future I give you my word
Open your eyes into the light, into the light

Free from love, free from life
Free from you i'm untouchable
Free from pain, free from ego
Free to rave i am rising
I'm rising up, i'm rising up, i'm rising up, i'm rising

Wow, you're telling me about this
I'll tell you about that
Stop talking shit you'll walk into another trap
And all the time you know
You know my name, you know my name, you know my name
Be king for a day, be king for a day

We got the night, we got the world
Into the future I give you my word
Open your eyes into the light, into the light

King for a day
