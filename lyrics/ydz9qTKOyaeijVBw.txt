I'm going to answer, protecting
It can be so hard to forgive
It's not what I thought and it's not what I pictured
When I was imagining my man
You are so nervous all of the time giving the classics
I know that imagining my man
Imagining, imagining my man

All my life (hey!)
I've had to fight to stay
You were right, love takes time, hey, hey

You have this dream, apparently I'm not done
I leave and it's twelve-fold
If you get there
Be honest, respectful

All my life (hey!)
I never tried to stay
You were right, love takes time, hey, hey

I hope one dream will get the way
Lucky to be given the chance
I do not have the answer
But I don't have the wish to go back

All my life (hey!)
I've had to fight to stay
You were right (yes!), love takes time, hey, hey
All my life (hey!)
I've had to fight to stay
You were right, love takes time, hey, hey
