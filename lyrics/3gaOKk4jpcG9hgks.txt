Dark is the sea: raging waves
endless the sky above me
mighty is the wind that fills our sail
many of us will follow: our journey brave
The day when ice would break and sun was high
we sailed with wind of fate across the seas
we followed the stars bright in the night
The land was bleak and could not provide
sail across the sea with the wind and tide
brothers at my side: our blood the same
Oden up high: I call thy name
Through the fog they will come in the dawn
with the wind from the raging sea
beware of the men of the North
they will sail down the blooded shore
with the wind they will return to the seas
Down foreign shores: all land would sleep
silent at dawn: with fire and steel
by our swords: silver and gold
our journey glorious: tales will be told
The day when ice would break and sun was high
we sailed with wind of fate across the seas
we followed the stars bright in the night
The land was bleak and could not provide
sail across the sea with the wind and tide
brothers at my side: our blood the same
Oden up high: I call thy name
Through the fog they will come in the dawn
with the wind from the raging sea
beware of the men of the North
they will sail down the blooded shore
with the wind they will return to the seas
