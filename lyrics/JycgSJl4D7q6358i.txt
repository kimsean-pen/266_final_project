Hello again on another Monday morning
I have come to realise in recent years
That there are times when there's only one word
In which I can express my faith

Ooo oh

I know that that one word is quite sufficient

Ooo oh

There's no other word

Ooo oh

It's quite sufficient

Ooo oh

There's no other word

Ooo oh

Ooo oh

There's no other word

Ooo oh

Ooo oh

If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me
Ooo oh, no baby please don't go
Ooo oh, no baby please don't go
Ooo oh, no baby please don't go
Ooo oh, no baby please don't go
Ooo oh, no baby please don't go
Ooo oh, no baby please don't go
Ooo oh, no baby please don't go
Ooo oh, no baby please don't go
Ooo oh, no baby please don't go
Ooo oh, no baby please don't go
Ooo oh, no baby please don't go
Ooo oh, no baby please don't go

Ooo oh
