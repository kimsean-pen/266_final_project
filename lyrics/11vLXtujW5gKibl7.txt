to many times ive been right here in this position
ive been her time and time again, i just dont listen
im heaven sent but im hell bound, broken angel i fell down
im heaven sent but im hell bound, broken angel i fell down
she said i have demon eyes
you dont know how to take a peice of mind
this life is a puzzel, were all trying to find a peice of mind
keep it together
im dripping diamonds along with depression
i fight under pressure
i love silence so the day i die, ima shoot with supression
skeletons all up in my closet
any second they watching i cant stop it
i let the door then i shut it
i dont wanna feel nothing, fuck it
too many time ive been right her in this position
ive been here time and time again, i just dont listen
im heaven sent but im hell bound, fallen angel i fell down
im heaven sent but im hell bound, fallen angel i fell
how many more times till i lost time
how many more words till the last line
how many more tears left for the last cry
how many more deaths till the last life
how many more, how many more
i dont know, i dont know
too many times ive been right here in this position
ive been here time and time again, i just dont listen
im heaven sent but im hell bound, broken angel i fell down
im heaven sent but im hell bound, broken angel i fell down
