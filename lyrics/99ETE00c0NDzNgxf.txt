Waking from the daze of a restless slumber
I had that dream again,
Gotta get your name, gotta ask your number,
But I'm losing all my teeth again.

Standing at the edge of the tallest tower,
I hold your hand and dive,
Falling and falling for what feels like hours,
Falling in love before the day arrives.

Right in the middle of a nightmare honey,
I found you right next to me,
And I'll admit it, it might sound funny,
To fall in love with a fantasy.

My Bad Dream Baby,
Tonight's for me and you.
Don't wake me, Bad Dream Baby,
Cos my dreams don't come true.

And I know these lucid dreams aren't the remedy,
But I can't keep trying to sweep you off your feet,
And I know I've lost my grip on reality,
But it's real enough for me.

I'm in the middle of a nightmare, honey
I need you right next to me,
And I'll admit it, it might sound funny,
To fall in love with a fantasy!

My Bad Dream Baby,
Tonight's for me and you.
Don't wake me, Bad Dream Baby,
Cos my dreams don't come true.

Oh my Bad Dream Baby,
I'm not givin' up on me and you,
Its just a bad dream, baby,
Gotta make my dreams come true!
