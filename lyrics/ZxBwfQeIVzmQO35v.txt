Blackest shadow full of death
The Blond beast comes marching in
Sender of fear and abhorrence rise
Through clouds of ash and decay
Black birds of carrion follow
He comes to fill the graveyards up
Setting sails towards your last mask
Through bleeding wounds yet to come

The gentle touch of violin strings
The crows of death and ashes sing
... the Blond beast

Enraptured wolf-packs high on blood
Bohemia, Moravia
A funeral nation with a funeral urge
Local morale pulverized
None dare to raise a hand
Exile revolt - nails of doom
Protectorate within your grasp
All opposition erased

The gentle touch of violin strings
The crows of death and ashes sing
Gently caressed by Azrael's wings ...the Blond beast

The gentle touch of violin strings
The crows of death and ashes sing ...the Blond beast
