I am sick of this cycle turning in the opposite direction
you made me so happy way back in kindergarten.
The first kiss we created during recess at the daycare
The time out sessions nearby the closets
They were beyond worth it.

The children in the background
they've always stayed in focus
the camera could never do it's justice
and I'm still sick to my stomach about it.
the aperture was far too open for you to notice.
Well the light blinds my expression
all of thee attention was never what I wanted in the first place.

I've always had the darkest clouds above my head.

Storms bring me nothing but problems, why?

Signs for good luck are never good signs.
They higher your hopes up just to see you die inside.
Please lie to me and tell me that I am okay
because it's getting worse.
I guess when you're a kid stuck inside a candy store
you're bound to get sick of everything.
I have learned that signs for good luck are never good signs
They higher your hopes up just to see you die inside.
