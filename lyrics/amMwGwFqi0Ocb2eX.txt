The morning bell
The morning bell
Light another candle and
Release me
Release me

You can keep the furniture
A bump on the head
Howling down the chimney
Release me
Release me
Please

Release me
Release me

Where'd you park the car?
Where'd you park the car?
Clothes are all over the furniture
Now I might as well
I might as well

Sleepy jack the fire drill
Run around, around, around, around, around, around
Around

Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half

Everyone wants to be a
Everyone wants their dignity
Everyone wants to be a friend
Nobody wants to be a slave 'cause

Walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking

The lights are on but nobody's at home
Everyone wants to be a friend
Nobody wants to be a slave

Walking, walking
Walking, walking
Walking, walking
Walking, walking
Walking, walking
Walking, walking
Walking, walking
Walking, walking
Walking, walking
Walking, walking
Walking, walking

Walking, walking, walk, walk
Walking, walking, walk, walk
Walking, walking, walk, walk
Walking, walking, walk, walk
