Tell me, tell me, tell me
(What, what) What do you want?
Tell me, tell me, tell me
(What, what) What do you need?

Tell me, tell me, tell me

You know the sign says "Free Admission"
So what do you say
You can start at the beginning
No one's listening at the door frame
You got to separate now
What's real
What's not real

Tell me, tell me, tell me
(What, what) What do you want?
Tell me, tell me, tell me
(What, what) What do you need?

Tell me, tell me, tell me
(What, what) What do you want?
Tell me, tell me, tell me
(What, what) What do you need?

You know I want the everlasting
So what do you say?
We don't have to right an ending
You know, it's all there for the asking
Why don't we separate now
What's real
What's not real

Tell me, tell me, tell me
(What, what) What do you want?
Tell me, tell me, tell me
(What, what) What do you need?

Tell me, tell me, tell me
(What, what) What do you want?
Tell me, tell me, tell me
(What, what) What do you need?

Try taking the invitation
Lay it on me
Animal communication
Stop and spin

Tell me, tell me, tell me
What do you want?
Tell me, tell me, tell me
What do you need?

Tell me now, tell me all of it
Tell me now
Tell me what do you want now
Tell me all of it, tell me now
What do you need now
Tell me all of it, tell me now
Tell me what do you want now
Tell me all of it, tell me now
What do you need

Tell me, tell me, tell me
(What, what) What do you want?
Tell me, tell me, tell me
(What, what) What do you need?

Tell me, tell me, tell me
(What, what) What do you want?
Tell me, tell me, tell me
(What, what) What do you need?
