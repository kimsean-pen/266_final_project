Last night I've ended up with a lasting conclusion
There is no love that is worthwhile
I lost things at yours
That I will take back
After the trips you have gone
After the boys that we might have kissed
Your name ends with L
And I wish you could tell
That my thoughts are all wrong
You live in a birdhouse
And I want you to know
That I can leave (live) by the stairs
That I can go anywhere

But please, just say
I want you to stay
Baby, and I'll prove that you're mine?
But please just say
I want you to stay
Baby and I'll prove that you're mine?
Baby you know I am yours
