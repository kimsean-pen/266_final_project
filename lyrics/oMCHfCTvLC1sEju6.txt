She's a pretty good bad luck charm
Rolls snake eyes twice and bet the farm
Waving over waitresses to bring her more Manhattans
As if nothing bad could happen when she's on your arm
Life begins at 25
Slide your token on the felt and let it ride
Stupid is as stupid happens to
There's a pattern to the way she's always nearby

And the dealer that deals the cards
For the cameras and security guards
The roulette spinning
While she's grinning

But she doesn't play to win
She plays to make you lose again
Her heart of hearts
Is made of only broken parts
She's the queen of spades
She doesn't play to win
She plays to make you lose again
Her heart of hearts
Is made of only broken parts
She's the queen of spades

There's nothing quite like losing it all
Running home in one slipper from the royal ball
The slots keep singing their machine song
The casino's a maze of multi-colored walls

And the dealer that deals those cards
For the cameras and security guards
The roulette spinning
While she's grinning

But she doesn't play to win
She plays to make you lose again
Her heart of hearts
Is made of only broken parts
She's the queen of spades
(Queen of spades)

And when everything goes wrong
It's not your fault, it's not your fault
When everything goes to pieces
I'll tell you what the reason is
You'll never wanna play another game again

She doesn't play to win
She plays to make you lose again
Her heart of hearts
Is made of only broken parts
She's the queen of spades
(Queen of spades)
She doesn't play to win
She plays to make you lose again
Her heart of hearts
Is made of only broken parts
She's the queen of spades
