Ready for another remedy
Maybe not as good as used to be
I will be back tomorrow

Moments stalling for my destiny
Ready for another remedy
I'm not myself today

Making a scene in the pouring rain
Doesn't make a difference cause I've had enough
And all the things I need to say
Never make it out cause I've had enough
And everything I do today
Nothing gets done cause it's not enough
And I've had enough of everything
Tried to make it right and I'm wrong again
I'm afraid of everything
Everything's out cause I've had enough
And I don't believe in anything
Doesn't really matter cause I've had enough
And everything I do today
Fades away

Going nowhere with your strategy
Sit down, relapse, relax you got nowhere to be
I'm running from another

Running from another side of me
Maybe not as good as it used to be
I'm not myself today

Making a scene in the pouring rain
Doesn't make a difference cause I've had enough
And all the things I need to say
Never make it out cause I've had enough
And everything I do today
Nothing gets done cause it's not enough
And I've had enough of everything
Tried to make it right and I'm wrong again
I'm afraid of everything
Everything's out cause I've had enough
And I don't believe in anything
Doesn't really matter cause I've had enough
And everything I do today
Everything I do, it fades away
