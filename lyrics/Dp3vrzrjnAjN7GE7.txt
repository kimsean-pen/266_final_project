As a child it was not there
Not scared of the blood
The creak, and the thud inside your chest

Clearly calm, I'm keeping terrorised
The ageless thaw of winter
Alone but by your side

Here in light hung a soft divide
The billowed curtain call
Hold me down, was I born to lie?
Here at all, Here at all

My fear in lights, all I said comes home
I can't do this alone
Asleep inside, I was born to lie
Now prove me wrong, prove me wrong

But it's in your nature
Blooms inside your blood
Hold me in harms way baby
All is now harmed

But it's in your nature
Blooms inside your blood
Hold me in harms way baby
All is now harmed

As a child it was not there
Not scared of the blood
The creak, and the thud inside your chest

Clearly calm, I'm keeping terrorised
The ageless thaw of winter
Alone but by your side

My fear in lights
All I said comes home
I can't do this alone
Asleep inside, was I born to lie?
Now prove me wrong, prove me wrong

But it's in your nature
Blooms inside your blood
Hold me in harms way baby
All is now harmed

But it's in your nature
Blooms inside your blood
Hold me in harms way baby
All is now harmed
