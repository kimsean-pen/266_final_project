A thrill, a sigh...
My lips are trembling.
Your breath is thick,
It blows me away.
I know why, I know why,
It's the curse you're weaving.
And I know I, I know I
Am more than willing to comply.

The rush, the dance
Ignite my senses.
You hear my plea,
It drives you nearer.
You know why, you know why,
It's the spell that binds us.
And I know I, I know I
Am more than willing to comply.

I toss and turn
As sleep evades me;
The waves are strong,
The urge is stronger.

Burn my pain away,
Sing the song that I long for.
Find the flame within
And reveal all I need to know.
Burn this pain away,
My soul waits in sweet devotion;
All emotions swell
As I cry out for you.

Burn my pain away,
Sing the song that I long for.
Find the flame within
And reveal all I need to know.
Burn this pain away,
My soul waits in sweet devotion;
All emotions swell
As I cry out for you.
