When the shirt came off, it was all in time
When a m-m-m-minute turned into a mile
And I broke that grin, and I cut it out
And you got all turned on by the taste of the ocean
When I mention blue, all you thought was color
When you mention drugs, all I thought was sober
When your pants came off and I turned you over
When you mention blue

Kill
Smile
Cut it out for me this time
Smile, haven't seen him smile in a while

Keep the mask aligned
Cut it up in time
There's a space between valleys
And try and catch a vibe
Make a circle square
A rectangle curve
Use a smile as a noun and I think like a verb

Run quick switch sides
Spill the filled up canister
And the room is shaking
Now you're changing places
And I switched my pace
And my breathing races when you mention blue

Kill
Smile
Cut it out for me this time
Smile, haven't seen him smile in a while

(This is not) Kill
(This is not) Smile
(This is not, this is not) Cut it out for me this time
(This is not, this is not, this is not) Smile, haven't seen him smile in a while

Kill
Smile
Cut it out for me
Cut it, cut it out
Smile
Kill
Cut it out for me
Cut it, cut it out

We cut it out

Kill
Smile
Cut it out for me this time
Smile, haven't seen him smile in a while

Kill
Smile
Cut it out for me this time
Smile, haven't seen him smile in a while

Get down and stay awake
Smile
