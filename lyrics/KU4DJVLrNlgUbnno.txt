I went missing on the inside
Alone with every version of myself that's died
I fight to get you out of my head
But where I'm most exposed is where you make your bed

'Cause who I've been and who I'm not
We're all the same

This will only take a lifetime
To bury me as deep as troubled is your mind
I'm sinking deeper into your head
I'm the lie you live in, every thought you dread

'Cause who you've been and who you're not
We're all the same

You sing a shallow song
With every wasted breath
Your head's so deep below
The water which you tread
'Cause how I've been and how I'm not
We're all the same, we're all the same

I [?] 'cause I make it
Am I a victim or a hypocrite?
You're a craving that I can't forget
Some days I'd rather die than let this end
That's the problem that you have here
You're speaking only lies though they're so sincere
If you want, you can forget me
But your mind's too fucked, you'll never set me free

'Cause who you've been and who you're not
We're all the same

You sing a shallow song
With every wasted breath
Your head's so deep below
The water which you tread
'Cause how I've been and how I'm not
We're all the same, we're all the same

You sing a shallow song
With every wasted breath
'Cause who you've been and who we're not
We're all the same, we're all the same
'Cause who you've been and who we're not
We're all the same, we're...
