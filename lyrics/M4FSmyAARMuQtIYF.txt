smoke the tar down in yr lungs
only feel to feel so numb
drown yr child in birthday cake
for he was happy then
tear the skin off of yr face
try and recognize its place
but even if it wasn't there
you still just shouldn't care

pretend that you are not alone
inside yr empty funeral home
dead inside like yr casket
i see you lying there
smoke the tar down in yr lungs
only feel to feel so numb

when i see you
i hope i can
fall asleep
and never wake up

tired of being awake
ill take all yr klonopin
crush them up so delicately
like the bones of my most loved enemy
and ill stab myself in the chest
wont be happy, wont be sad
but oh god its for the best

tired of being awake
