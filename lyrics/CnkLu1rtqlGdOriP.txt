Sitting on a hillside
Watching all the people die
I'll feel much better on the other side

I'll thumb a ride
2/3:
I believe in magic
Why, because it is so quick

I don't need power when I'm hypnotized
Look in my eyes
What are you seeing (I see...)
How do you feel?
(...you)

I feel real phony when my name is Phil
Or was that Bill?
Life goes on here
Day after day
I don't know if I am living or if I'm
Supposed to be

Sometimes my life is so eerie
And if you think I'm happy
Paint me (white)(yellow)
I've been here once
I've been here twice
I don't know if the third's the fourth or if the -
The fifth's to fix

Sometimes I deal with numbers
And if you wanna count me
Count me out

I don't need the time of day
Anytime with me's OK
I just don't want you using up my time
'Cause that's not right
ahh...
They're locking them up today
They're throwing away the key
I wonder who it'll be tomorrow, you or me?
We're all normal and we want our freedom
Freedom... freedom... freedom... freedom
Freedom... freedom... freedom... freedom
(spoken:) Alla God's chilluns gotta have dere freedom
