Hey!

Well, my temperature's rising, and my feet on the floor
Crazy people knocking 'cause they're wanting some more
Let me in, baby, I don't know what you got
But you better take it easy, this place is hot

And I'm so glad we made it
So glad we made it
You got gimme some-a lovin' (Gimme gimme some lovin')
Gimme some-a lovin' (Gimme gimme some lovin')
Gimme some-a lovin' every day

Hey!
Well, I feel so good, everything is sounding hot
You better take it easy 'cause the place is on fire
Been a hard day, and I have so much to do
We made it, baby, and it happened to you

And I'm so glad we made it
So glad we made it
You got gimme some-a lovin' (Gimme gimme some lovin')
Gimme some-a lovin' (Gimme gimme some lovin')
Gimme some-a lovin' every day

Hey!
Well, I feel so good, everything is still hot
You better take it easy 'cause the place is on fire
Been a hard day, nothing went too good
Now, I'm gonna relax like everybody should

And I'm so glad we made it, hey, hey
So glad we made it
You got gimme some-a lovin' (Gimme gimme some lovin')
Gimme some-a lovin' (Gimme gimme some lovin')
Woo-hooo! (Gimme gimme some lovin')
Hey hey! (Gimme gimme some lovin')
I need you gimme gimme some of your lovin', babe! (Gimme gimme some lovin')
You know I needed somebody, woohoo! (Gimme gimme some lovin')
