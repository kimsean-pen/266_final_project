Ooh, better
Better to be wiser than a cool hand
Ooh, tied up
Would I have it tied up with my loose hand
Ooh, better
Better to be wiser than a cool hand
Ooh, tied up
Would I have it tied up with my loose hand

Do I have to act like that
And [?] my hand upon
[?] in vain
Like I'm painted on a show
It takes me by the hand
And it wants me to be afraid
Do I have to act like that
And chew a formula

Like I'm painted on a show
It takes me by the hand
And it wants me to be afraid

Ooh
All this strange investment
Wanna get there
Wanna
And I know this
And you know this
Wanna get there
Wanna see the
And I'd rather stay in bed

Ooh, better
Better to be wiser than a cool hand
Ooh, tied up
Would I have it tied up with my loose hand

Do I have to act like that
And [?] my hand upon
[?] in vain
Like I'm painted on a show
It takes me by the hand
And it wants me to be afraid
Do I have to act like that
And chew a formula
Like I'm painted on a show
It takes me by the hand
And it wants me to be afraid

Ooh, better
Better to be wiser than a cool hand
Ooh, tied up
Would I have it tied up with my loose hand
Ooh, better
Better to be wiser than a cool hand
Ooh, tied up
Would I have it tied up with my loose hand
