Cold sweat, the summer's gone,
Wake up, nobody's home.

I got trouble my way, I guess I'm here to stay,
Somebody told me to leave 'cause I ain't looking so great.
Somebody's running out, I'm shooting everything,
Until I saw on TV, why did I give it away?

Busted, now it's all about
Making, why you're coming around?

I got trouble my way, I guess I'm here to stay,
Somebody told me to leave 'cause I ain't looking so great.
Somebody's running out, I'm shooting everything,
Until I saw on TV, why did I give it away?
