Naughty, Naughty, Very Naughty (Ha Ha Ha Ha)

There's a guy in the place who's got a bittersweet face
And he goes by the name of Ebeneezer Goode
His friends call him 'Ezeer and he is the main geezer
And he'll vibe up the place like no other man could
He's refined, sublime, he makes you feel fine
Though very much maligned and misunderstood
But if you know 'Ezeer he's a real crowd pleaser
He's ever so good - he's Ebeneezer Goode
You can see that he's mischievous, mysterious and devious
As he circulates amongst the people in the place
But once you know he's fun, and something of a genius
He gives a grin that goes around from face to face to face
Backwards and then forwards, forwards and then backwards
'Eezer is the geezer who loves to muscle in
That's about the time the crowd all shout the name of 'Eezer
As he's kotcheled in the corner, laughing by the bass bin

'Eezer Goode, 'Eezer Goode, He's Ebeneezer Goode
'Eezer Goode, 'Eezer Goode, He's Ebeneezer Goode
'Eezer Goode, 'Eezer Goode, He's Ebeneezer Goode
'Eezer Goode, 'Eezer Goode, He's Ebeneezer Goode

He's Ebeneezer Goode

Ebeneezer Goode, leading light of the scene, know what I mean?
He created the vibe - He takes you for a ride as if by design
The party ignites like it's comin' alive
He takes you to the top, shakes you all around
Then back down - you know as he gets mellow
Then as smooth as the groove that is making you move
He glides into your mind with a sunny "Hello!"
A gentleman of leisure he's there for your pleasure
But go easy on old 'Ezeer he's the love you could lose
Extraordinary fellow, like Mr Punchinello
He's the kind of geezer who must never be abused
When you're in town and Ebeneezer is around
You can sense a presence in the sound of the crowd
He gets them all at it - the party
starts rocking - the people get excited
It's time to shout LOUD!
