What's better than trippin' is fallin' in love
What's better than Letterman, Leno, Fallon and all the above
What's better than poppin' bottles tryin' a ball in the club
Is the first caveman Pops with his son, ball and a club

What's better than paper is ballin' it up
What's better than followers, is actually fallin' in love
What's better than frolickin' follies, fallin' in mud

Rollin' in green pastures, wandering followin' love
What's better than eatin', is feedin' your fam
What's better than meetings is missin' meeting's to meet your fam
What's better than leanin' and needin' a Xan

Is hittin' your zen, dreamin' a dream could mean leavin' the land
What's better than yellin' is hollerin' love
What's better than rhymes, nickles, dimes and dollars and dubs
Is diallin' up your darlin', just for callin' her up
It ain't nothin' better than fallin' in love

I seen it come back, back, back and forth
You hit the nail right on the top of the head
I know you seen it all before
But when it looked you in the eyes
It ain't nothing you could say but that's love

That's love
That's love ooooh
That's love
Say that's love, oooh, oooh

That's love, that's love, that's love, that's love, that's love
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love (Who do you love?)
I love you, I love you, I love you

That's love
That's love, that's love
Say that's love, that's love, that's love
That's love, that's love, that's love, ah
