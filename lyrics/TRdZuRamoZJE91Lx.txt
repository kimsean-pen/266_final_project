At the bar
He said what do you do
She said what do you do
He said I edit
She said I study multi-dimensional kindness
And he decided to kiss her then
Without knowing she was a million
And that he was just one of them
You're all wrapped
You're going outside
You're gonna find a place to hide
And party like your heart hurts
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Party like your heart hurts
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Party like it doesn't work
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Party like it means well
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Party like it won't melt
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

They went home together
And they held hands all night
They fed the cats and watched the fish swim circles
They kissed and kissed until the dawn's first bird sing
And then there was just one of them
Suspended animation
Over the first bird and all the wet tree tops
Smoke around their body and simply get to shine
But there's no
You're all wrapped
You're going outside
You're gonna find a place to hide
And party like your heart hurts
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Party like your heart hurts
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Party like it doesn't work
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Party like it means well
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Party like it won't melt
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ohhh party like your heart hurts
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ohhh party like it doesn't work
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ohhh party like it means well
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Party like it won't melt
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

You're gonna find a place to hide And party like you're
AAEEAAAHHH AAEEAAAHHH
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
