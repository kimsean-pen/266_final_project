Space Time

I fix my attention on this ball
spinning round inside of me, deep inside
Revolving conscious planet
on an axis around this star
By the light

And the black holes in the vault of heaven
make me wonder, wonder why
How matter can disappear
Are there doors in this wall to reach the light
from time and space

Now I see those mounts of fear
feel the weight of nonsense killing simplicity
I can touch this wind of night
that erases our light and makes us paranoiac
But my legs are now so tired
climbing all alone, all space, and all the time
So I fix my attention now
on this perfect planet revolving around this star
And the sun, it seems so close
I can touch the heat of presence and I know...
I can see this monster light
that embraces those notions: space and time

The black holes in the sky, I ask the reasons why
Light blackened? Door opened?
Swim back time, door giving entrance to
Supernova as only light
Meet the earth and all the stars
The entrance, the essence, supply us
