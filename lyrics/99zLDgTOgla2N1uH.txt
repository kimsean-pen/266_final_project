Hoping to delay every exchange
Altering state or staying the same
Transform and reshape
In the midst of all this
Not yet finished
So much will to fight it

A misprediction
These differences don't sit well
Somewhere between what is next
And what has been

Ease of recollecting
Never to project it
Harboured and held to
We stretch to fit
Are taught to drift
The succession of the inevitable
When it tears, when it ruptures
Prepare

It's fleeting and transient
And all that is definite
It becomes clear to us
Only in retrospect

Idly engage, in rooms left to wait
Lapses forgotten, here to remain
Tempted by fate
Outshine the grey, get carried away
Aimlessly searching, forever stray
Unfolding as it should

Idly engage, in rooms left to wait
Lapses forgotten, here to remain
Tempted by fate
Outshine the grey, get carried away
Aimlessly searching, forever stray
Unfolding as it should
