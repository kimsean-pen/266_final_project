I met a devil woman
She took my heart away
She said I had it coming to me
But I wanted it that way

I think that any lovin's good lovin'
So I took what I could get, mmm ooh ooh
She looked at me with big brown eyes
And said

You ain't seen nothing yet
B-b-b-baby you just ain't seen n-n-n-nothin' yet
Here's somethin' that you're never gonna forget
B-b-b-baby you just ain't seen n-n-n-nothing yet

And now I'm feeling better
'Cause I found out for sure
She took me to her doctor
And he told me of a cure

He said that any love is good love
So I took what I could get, yes I took what I could get
And then she looked at me with her big brown eyes
And said

You ain't seen nothing yet
B-b-b-baby you just ain't seen n-n-n-nothin' yet
Here's somethin', here's somethin' you're never gonna f-forget, baby
You know, you know, you know you just ain't seen nothin' yet

Any lovin's good lovin'
So I took what I could get, yes I took what I could get
And then, and then, and then she looked at me with her big brown eyes
And said

You ain't seen nothin' yet
Baby you just ain't seen n-n-n-nothin' yet
Here's somethin', here's somethin', here's a lover you'll never forget baby
Baby baby baby you ain't seen n-n-n-n-nothin' yet
You ain't been around

You ain't seen nothin' yet, that's what she told me
She said I need an education, go to school
I know I ain't seen nothin' yet
I know I ain't seen nothin' yet, ooh, ooh, ooh

I got something for you when I get home
Better be good
I been everywhere
But I ain't seen nothin' yet
I deserve it one of these days, oh yeah
Ooh, but I ain't seen nothin' yet
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

I ain't seen nothin' yet
I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait
If you want to show me what I ain't seen
Where I ain't been
La la la la la la la la la la
