I wish the couple on the corner would just get a room
Seems like everyone around me is on their honey moon
I'd love to take a pin to a heart shaped balloon
cause everybody's got somebody but me

I don't know how I landed on this movie set
It's like a casting call for 'Romeo and Juliet'
I never would have noticed if we'd never met
But everybody's got somebody but me

And I miss you
Without you I just don't fit in
I know we're through
But I'm wishing we could try it again

I hear loves songs playing on the radio
People slow dancing everywhere I go
I'm a good slow dancer but you'd never know
'Cause everybody's got somebody but me

And I miss you
Without you I don't fit in
I know we're through
But I'm wishing we'd try it again

Sitting here lonely at a table for two
Watching lovers being lovers in the corner booth
Seems like even cupid don't know what to do
Everybody's got someone but me

Yeah, I don't know if I'll ever find another you

Cause but everybody's got somebody but me
