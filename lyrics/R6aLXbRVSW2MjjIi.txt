I know you hate that I think this way
I know you think that it's wrong of me
I know that everything's strong today
But the longer we go I know the fire will start to fade, fade, fade

I'm maybe walking too long for this race
I know you said that you won't do the same
And so I'm writing this song so the day
See I'm right, I'm play this record with a smirk while I say

I told you so, I told you so
I told you so, I told you so

I know you hate that I think this way
I could be wrong but the chances ain't great
I know your calls, your sweet messages
Will turn from daily just to make me smile to plain necessary

I know you're wishing your eye just see me
But somehow time seem to make it blurry
And so I'm writing this song so the day
Yeah, see I'm right, I'll play this record while I cry and I say

I told you so, ooh baby, I told you so
I told you so, I told you so

I know the newness of it all seems right
But baby, I'm no fool and I got pride
That happily ever
Love should just last a while, while, while

I know you think you love me
But love ain't never stopped nobody
From creeping around every once in a while
When things start to settle down
And so I won't look like a clown, I'm a call it now

I told you so, I told you so
I told you so, unless you prove me wrong
I told you so, I told you so
I told you so, I told you so
