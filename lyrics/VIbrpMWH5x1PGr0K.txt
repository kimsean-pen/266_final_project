You feel out of breath, used up and broken down
Just like shattered glass in pieces on the ground
Somedays you wanna scream, but you can't make a sound
But you're not alone

Here comes another day, here comes another fight
You'd rather give it up than give it one more try
'Cause no one understands the way you feel inside
But you're not alone

Right now it feels like the end of the world
All your battles are lost
You've been cheated (mistreated)
Just when you think that you can't hold on any longer
Hold on a little bit longer
Trust me, you'll see
You'll be so much stronger
(You'll be so much stronger)

It's only temporary, but it feels like you're stuck
Like no wishing well, but it will chance your luck
They say when one door closes another opens up
And you walk right through
Yeah, you know what to do

Right now it feels like the end of the world
All your battles are lost
You've been cheated (mistreated)
Just when you think that you can't hold on any longer
Hold on a little bit longer
Trust me, you'll see
You'll be so much stronger
(You'll be so much stronger)

You'll might have to bend but you're not gonna break
Wipe the tears from your face and the fear off your face
You know deep down inside, you've got what it takes

Right now it feels like the end of the world
All your battles are lost
You've been cheated (mistreated)
Just when you think that you can't hold on any longer
Hold on a little bit longer
Trust me, you'll see
You'll be so much stronger
(You'll be so much stronger)
