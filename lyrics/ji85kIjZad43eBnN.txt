Chillin' with a hair tie,
no makeup with some sweatpants on.
You know I can always be that guy,
You can think about me all night long
But I think you need something to think of me.
Something that will keep you warm
And show we can be more than just this
So baby if you are not ready for my kiss

Then you can wear my sweatshirt
And you can tell your friends we'll be together till the end
Girl you can wear my sweatshirt
Cuz you're the only one I hold and I don't want you to be cold
So baby wear mine

When you go to sleep at night, When you wake up in the morning
And when you walk the halls girl you know wanna flaunt it
Said this may be the start of something new
Girl I'm gonna tell you exactly what I wanna do is more than just this
So baby if you are not ready for my kiss

Then you can wear my sweatshirt
And you can tell your friends we'll be together till the end
Girl you can wear my sweatshirt
Cuz you're the only one I hold and I don't want you to be cold
So baby wear mine...
and you can wear my, my, my, my sweatshirt
And I don't want you to be cold,
cold, co- co- co- cold
So you can wear my

So you can wear my sweatshirt
And you can tell your friends we'll be together till the end

Cuz you're the only one I hold and I don't want you to be cold
So baby wear my
Sweatshirt
Cuz you're the only one I hold and I don't want you to be cold
So baby wear my
