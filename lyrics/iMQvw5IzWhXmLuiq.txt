I can hear your heartbeat I've tried so hard to forget
I'm being buried under the memory of all of my regrets

I've spent ages losing sleep while strangers warmed your bed
I know it's over, please, be over, there's nothing left to save

Let me let you down
I can't watch you drown with me
Let me let you down
I can't watch you drown with me

Your voice is ringing in my ears, but I can't see you talk
You could tell me to go straight to hell, and I'd enjoy the walk

I've spent ages losing sleep while strangers warmed your bed
I know it's over, please, be over, there's nothing left to save

Let me let you down
I can't watch you drown with me
Let me let you down
I can't watch you drown with me

If I could make it simpler, if I could get back to the start
I would keep you even closer so that I could hear your heart
But your pulse has started fading, I'll try to hold on to the sound
I know it's over, please, be over 'cause I'll just let you down

Let me let you down
I can't watch you drown with me
Let me let you down
I can't watch you drown with me
