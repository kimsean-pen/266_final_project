Lord, when they call my phone I just press ignore
Couple A&Rs; live on my front porch
They say that I'm almost on I tell them I know

My circle full
They thought that I need them but I'm cool
Taking my space up they better move
'Cause if it ain't this shit what would I do
Probably give it to her like she wanna
Hands up on her make her jaw drop
And the only time she running to me now
When she run and come and give me nana
I'm into getting my funds up
I got a bitch out in London
They don't know just how much shit be ringing on me

Thought that they was special they confused
The truth is I don't think I'm much like you yeah yeah
I ain't no fool yeah yeah
I paid my dues on dues now they can kiss my ass
Remember when they would talk down its
like now they be lucky if talking to me
Just came from Germany fresh off the
flight after signing the deal of your dreams
I just don't think you'd know
Quite how much they would call
