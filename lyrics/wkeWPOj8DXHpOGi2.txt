Girl,
You wanted,
To shut it all off and make a run for the door.

It's so hard,
To make it,
For every inch we get we need a mile more.

But there is always so much distance can't but feel it somehow,
But you have never ever felt it like you feel it right now.
I'm closing up inside and I was only just started,
And you can't be close enough unless I'm feeling your heart beat.

All of your love,
Was all that I needed.
All of your love,
Was all that I needed.

Girl,
What are you doing now?
And are you going out?
Or has your life shut down?

Are you there?
This string keeps cutting out,
I feel like freaking out,
But we keep reaching out.

But there is always so much distance can't but feel it somehow,
But you have never ever felt it like you feel it right now.
I'm closing up inside and I was only just started,
But you can't be close enough unless I'm feeling your heart beat.

All of your love,
Was all that I needed.
All of your love,
Was all that I needed.

Girl,
It's hard enough,
Just to move around.
It's hard enough,
Just to move around.

I wanted you,
Oh, I wanted you,
Oh, I wanted you to move...
Oh, I wanted you,
Girl, I wanted you,
Oh, I wanted you to move...
Around.
Around.

All of your love,
Was all that I needed.
All of your love,
Was all that I needed.
