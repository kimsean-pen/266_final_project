A: Your career?
B: I don't know. I've thought about this quite a bit sir,
and I would have to say considering what's waiting out there for me,
I don't want to sell anything, buy anything,
or process anything as a career.
If you know what's a career, I don't want to do that.

In your eyes, all white and wide
I tried to stop you, twenty times
And it worked, you always came back
When did you stop coming back?
