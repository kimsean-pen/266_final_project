Hey, this party might be cool
I think I know those kids from school, but I only came for you
Hey, I'm feeling all alone
They said that you're at home, I wish that I was too
I'm feeling like a loner like I rarely ever do
I'm lying to myself, and they're lying to me too
I wish that you were here so I could be alone with you
'Cause my life is extra empty when the glass is empty too
Smiles are always toothless, but I run out of excuses so I have to play excited
But I wish that I was uninvited
Smiles are always toothless, but I run out of excuses so I have to play excited
But I wish that I was uninvited
Get me off the list
Get me off the list
Get me off the list
I've got nothing on my wrist
Get me off the list
Get me off the list
Get me off the list
Get me off the list
I've got nothing on my wrist
Get me off the list
Get me off the list
Get me off the list
Get me off the list
I've got nothing on my wrist
Get me off the list
Get me off the list
Get me off the list
Get me off the list
I've got nothing on my wrist
Get me off the list
Is that all you wanted to do is drop my name in conversation?
I don't want to hurt you, I just don't want to have this conversation
Cause you say you don't judge, but your always around making observations
I'm gonna find some way to just avoid the situation
And I know what you say for a while for I say that I'm tired so I try to be patient
And I try to be nice but I'd rather be kind than a bad obligatoin
'Cause you seem really nice but you flirt with me twice and then get into fights about who I should like
I say that I'm fine
You say that you're fine too
Smiles are always toothless, but I run out of excuses so I have to play excited
But I wish that I was uninvited
Get me off the list
Get me off the list
Get me off the list
I've got nothing on my wrist
Get me off the list
Get me off the list
Get me off the list
Get me off the list
I've got nothing on my wrist
Get me off the list
Get me off the list
Get me off the list
Get me off the list
I've got nothing on my wrist
Get me off the list
Get me off the list
Get me off the list
Get me off the list
I've got nothing on my wrist
Get me off the list
