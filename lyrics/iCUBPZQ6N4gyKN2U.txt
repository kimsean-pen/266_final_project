Rawr! Rawr!

I have a heart, I swear I do
But just not, baby, when it comes to you
I get so hungry when you say you love me
Hush, if you know what's good for you

I think you're hot, I think you're cool
You're the kind of guy I'd stalk in school
But now that I'm famous, you're up my anus
Now I'm gonna eat you, fool

I eat boys up, breakfast and lunch
Then when I'm thirsty, I drink their blood
Carnivore, animal, I am a cannibal
I eat boys up, you better run (run, run)

I am cannibal (cannibal, cannibal, I am)
I am cannibal (cannibal, I'll eat you up, I am)
I am cannibal (cannibal, cannibal, I am)
I am cannibal (cannibal, I'll eat you up)

Whenever you tell me I'm pretty
That's when the hunger really hits me
Your little heart goes pitter patter
I want your liver on a platter

Use your finger to stir my tea
And for dessert, I'll suck your teeth
Be too sweet and you'll be a goner
Yup, I'll pull a Jeffrey Dahmer

I eat boys up, breakfast and lunch
Then when I'm thirsty, I drink their blood
Carnivore, animal, I am a cannibal
I eat boys up, you better run (run, run)

I am cannibal (cannibal, cannibal, I am)
I am cannibal (cannibal, I'll eat you up, I am)
I am cannibal (cannibal, cannibal, I am)
I am cannibal (cannibal, I'll eat you up)

Oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh

Oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh

I am cannibal (cannibal, cannibal I am)
I am cannibal (cannibal, I'll eat you up, I am)
I am cannibal (cannibal, cannibal, I am)
I am cannibal (cannibal, I'll eat you up)

I love you, haha
I warned you
Rawr!
