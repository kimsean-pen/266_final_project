Scattered seeds and breaking storms
Won't make a decent lie for you
Naked and with every breath you climb the stairs
Step by step and I don't need this
I don't need to be saved
Five steps away from this cliff top
And birds sing their praises
To this weary world that haunts my weary soul

There are monsters here
And as you scream it makes no sense,
It makes no sense,
It makes no sense at all (x2)

In every despair I'll find you standing there,
With the bitter taste of envy on your sleeve
Because tonight is our night,
And I don't want this
No, so wont you let me go

There are monsters here
And as you scream it makes no sense,
It makes no sense,
It makes no sense at all (x2)

And every animal will find itself a home
Every man and woman
Well, they'll just lose control
And we can make ourselves believe
That I don't want this that I don't need this
No, I have this to myself

There are monsters here
And as you scream it makes no sense,
It makes no sense,
It makes no sense at all

In every despair
I'll find you standing there
It makes no sense,
It makes no sense at all

...sense at all
...sense at all
