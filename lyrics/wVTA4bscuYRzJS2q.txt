Listen to the girl
who waits by your side
in a simple word
don't need to ask why
nothing's gonna change
the people pass by
you feel no pain
as she starts to cry
craving
craving some comfort
craving
craving some comfort
craving
craving some comfort
craving
craving some comfort
you can't explain
the confuse on your mind
you're on your way
you won't rewind
it's over with
no need to hide
you're just a myth
and you know it's fine
craving
craving some comfort
craving
craving some comfort
craving
craving some comfort
craving
craving some comfort
