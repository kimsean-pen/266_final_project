How long can i go on amusing myself
Night after night sitting all alone
While you're in the arms of someone else
Don't you know that

While you're out looking for sugar
Somebody's gonna take your honey and be gone
While you're out looking for sugar
Somebody's is tryin take your honey and be gone
You just buzz, buzz, buzz here and there
Uh oh eh everywhere

You think you're the sugar oh daddy with a candy kiss oh yeah
You think about your love and baby i just can't exist mhm

While you're out looking for sugar
Somebody's gonna take your honey and be gone
While you're out looking for sugar
Somebody's is tryin take your honey and be gone

Well how can i be faithful?
Truly, i don't know
If i find myself in the arms of someone else
Is all your fault

While you're out looking for sugar
Somebody's gonna take your honey and be gone
While you're out looking for sugar
Somebody's is tryin take your honey and be gone
You just buzz, buzz, buzz here and there
Uh oh eh everywhere

You sneak across the floor baby with your shoes right in your hands
Well how much more do you think I can stand?

While you're out looking for sugar
Somebody's gonna take your honey and be gone
While you're out looking for sugar
Somebody's is tryin take your honey and be gone

While you're out looking baby
While you're out looking baby
While you're out looking for sugar
You got some honey at home
She's all alone
While you're out looking for sugar
Somebody's gonna take your honey and gone
While you're out looking for sugar
Somebody's is tryin take your honey and be gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Take it right
