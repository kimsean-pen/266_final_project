I can't hide... I can run but I can't hide
I feel like there's an ache
There's something in my eye
Like a bird after it's pray
A tiny parasite
You attach right to my soul
I walked across the sky
The knife began to glow
And the darkness became light
Your palms' moist tonight
I got this stolen heart
I'm lying but I'm kidding
Like a stitch to pull apart
It will bleed but it's a game
You attach right to my soul
I walked across the sky
The knife began to glow
And the darkness became light
Your palms' moist tonight
ahhh...
uuuhhh...
ahhh...
uuuhhh...
ahhh...
uuuhhh...
ahhh...
uuuhhh...
ahhh...
uuuhhh...
ahhh...
uuuhhh...
ahhh...
uuuhhh...
ahhh...
You attach right to my soul
I walked across the sky
The knife began to glow
And the darkness became light
You're like a bird in flames
You can run but you can't hide
I will build the scane of pain
On your way to paradise
Your palms' moist tonight
