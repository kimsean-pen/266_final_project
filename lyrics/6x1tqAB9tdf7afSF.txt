Gimme that one time
Fight at the red light
Better go on and drive
Caught me on the red line
All night, all night
Gimme that one time
Fight at the red light
Better go on and drive
Caught me on the red line
All night, all night

Mm, ooh I, ooh I
Fuck all day and I freak all night
Never asked your name 'cause I ain't got time
Mm no, ooh I, ooh I
Mm, ooh I, ooh I
Fuck all day and I freak all night
Never asked your name 'cause I ain't got time
Mm no, ooh I, ooh I

I don't wanna know
Who's that bitch with the freaky fashion?
I don't wanna know
Sex so good, make you wanna get married
I, yeah I
I see you call me back too late again
And right before my cell phone dead
You playing with my 1%, I

All the boys blowing up my phone
Ring ring ring, wanna take me home
Find the time and down below
You're the only one I want
All the boys blowing up my phone
Ring ring ring, wanna take me home
Find the time and down below
You're the only one I want

He call right back
I'mma let him tell that voicemail what he gon' do
And I'm lowkey ghosting
Leaving hope and praying that he get through
I call him back on my 1%
Meet me in my bed, let the shit get real
How's it feel knowing I'm in your head and that I already sent

I don't wanna know
Who's that bitch with the freaky fashion?
I don't wanna know
Sex so good, make you wanna get married
I, yeah I
I see you call me back too late again
And right before my cell phone dead
You playing with my 1%, I

Beat it
Love your lips on my liquor, go
Don't it taste so sweet and low?
House-keeping
Running right back out the door
When they see you beat that kitty
Better keep it
Little secret on the low
How I ride that stud like a rodeo
Beat it
Love your lips on my liquor, go
Don't it taste so sweet and low?

I don't wanna know
Who's that bitch with the freaky fashion?
I don't wanna know
Sex so good, make you wanna get married
I, yeah I
I see you call me back too late again
And right before my cell phone dead
You playing with my 1%, I
