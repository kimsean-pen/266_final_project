Being alive
I see you in everything
My vocabulary's limited
But I wanna tell it all to you
If I could would you want me to?
Being alive
If I become a piece of dirt
For a dollar can I enter
Your brain?
Being alive
Matters quite a bit
even when you
feel like shit
Being alive
Matters quite a bit
even when you
feel like shit
Being alive
I'm collapsing inwardly
Your name strikes a match in me
After the drum solo
I looked up
Craig
called out to me after
said
maybe see you later?
Being alive
matters quite a bit
even when you
feel like shit
Being Alive!
