Old tree, old tree
You've cast your last spell on the earth
You've shed all your leaves
You've spent all your years
And to the earth you have returned

And what you have seen
No one else could have seen
And what you have known
No one else could have known
And when the plough's teeth turn the weeds
Your minerals start to shine

And what you have been
No one else could have been
And what you have learned
No one else could have learned
We see your miracles in the fields
And the noon light as your sign

Old tree, old tree
You've cast your last spell on the earth
You've shed all your leaves
You've spent all your years
And to the earth you have returned
