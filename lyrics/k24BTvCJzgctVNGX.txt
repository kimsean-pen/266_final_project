In the back wit my niggas, off a xan we might act up
Kamikaze, cause you know we all strapped up
Your bitch she want me, cause she see a nigga stacked up
But I can't keep her, I just want to beat her back up
Wit my niggas, off a xan we might act up
Kamikaze, cause you know we all strapped up
Your bitch she want me, cause she see a nigga stacked up
But I can't keep her, I just want to beat her back up

Now i'm in the Rari switching lanes
Pull up to the street and they all know my name
Now I got a bag, and my baby chain swang
I was just broke, steady looking for some stains
And my little brother Mijay free my nigga out the cage
Sellin drugs and I get it ask your bitch, I'm getting paid
And I'm in a Mazi cause I crashed the fucking Range
And I see your bitch cause I'm better than your main

In the back wit my niggas, off a xan we might act up
Kamikaze, cause you know we all stacked up
Your bitch she want me, cause she see a nigga stacked up
But I can't keep her, I just want to beat her back up

In the back wit my niggas, off a xan we might act up
Kamikaze, cause you know we all stacked up
Your bitch she want me, cause she see a nigga stacked up
But I can't keep her, I just want to beat her back up
Hey what she do right here?
Lil' bitch

Yeah, you know I'm in that brand new space coupe
Hop up out a van like, "nigga, what it do"
I can fuck yo bitch and then I kick her out my room
And I'm in a fast car nigga Vroom, Vroom
I be wearing Louis V down cause I flex hard
Posted wit my niggas sippin' wockhardt
And we don't give a fuck we got a cold heart
Running through the money nigga, that part

In the back wit my niggas, off a xan we might act up
Kamikaze, cause you know we all strapped up
Your bitch she want me, cause she see a nigga stacked up
But I can't keep her, I just want to beat her back up
