Shove me out to see
The sea
The quiet of December
To the deep I turn

From the wreck I bless
This mess
For what I can remember
Your ghost I burn

Why do I always feel
Like I'm waiting to begin?
Why do I always feel
Like I'm waiting to begin?

Lay me down this sound
Unbound
The birds of spring returning
Your ghost I burn

Shall I sleep to keep
This peace?
The winter from her leaving
To the bow I run

Why do I always feel
Like I'm waiting to begin?
Why do I always feel
Like I'm waiting to begin?

Why do I always feel
Like I'm waiting to begin?
Why do I always feel
Like I'm waiting to begin?
