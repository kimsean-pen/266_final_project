Silhouette that comes to me,
as your state of infinity.
Even in your equal mind,
you were passing through this time.
Delicate with no defense,
honor what you love to no end.
Perfection in the accident,
truly yours is just what I meant.

Equal mind
Equal mind
Equal mind

There is no way you could know,
these waves they come and they go.
In blooms they're chasing the lights,
too soon say these goodbyes.

Equal mind
Equal mind
Equal mind
