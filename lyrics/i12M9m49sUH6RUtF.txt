Don't let yourself be silent
if this means more to you
than you're letting yourself (be heard)
(I'll need the time)
I am too blind to see (It's one thing)...
Just let me sing
the words I'm not too proud to say
I'd spit in your face If you weren't facing away
Ooohhhh
Don't turn your backs (don't fade away)
(And judge) the life for you to live another day
To live another day
Open the arms inside of yourself
Nothing no one nowhere
You've lost it all before
and you can lose it again
It's not the same
it's not the same without a sacrifice
What gives you the right to fight for something you have (wanted)
(And don't) you see the weakness of honour
You can't take what you know nothing about
Eeuuurgh
You're like a leech
draining the life out of me
You're showing you're bleeding
How typical of you
Open the eyes inside of yourself
Nothing. No one. Nowhere.
Nothing no one nowhere
you've lost it all before
and you can lose it again
It's not the same
It's not the same without a sacrifice
This is something that you can change for yourself
You've lied your way through every mess that you've made
You're like a leech
Draining the life out of me
You'll never change you'll always be the same
