Kites and clouds are above me, our hearts will be heavier
Just put your head on my head or touch the blankets in my bed
Give me your hand and lie beside me and cut your hair on Saturday eve

Warm eyelids, like empty shells, oh eyelids, long sleep is making me weak
Eyelids, like empty shells, oh eyelids, long sleep is making me weak

Our hearts are on fire, your love is all that I ever need
So close your sleepy warm eyelids, through the alleys of ivy
Shivering forest inside you, shimmering water inside me

Warm eyelids, like empty shells, oh eyelids, long sleep is making me weak
Eyelids, like empty shells, oh eyelids, long sleep is making me weak

Here with you, silver mountains, boundless lakes and we can walk alone
Here with you, frozen hands embrace the silence, we can walk alone
Here with you, silver mountains, boundless lakes and we can walk alone
Now I'm here with you, frozen hands embrace the silence, we can walk alone
