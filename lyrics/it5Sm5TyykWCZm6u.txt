Who do you think that you are?
Who put that thought in your head?
So take your thoughts and melt them together
Don't care what anybody says

Sometimes you're trying to love
Sometimes you wait till your dead
You can't find the wrongs in each other
Don't care what anybody says
Close my eyes and feel
Gonna take it to heart
Gonna close up and hide in yourself
Now come on make it a start

You close your eyes to love
You gotta take it to heart
You gotta hold it inside real close
Before they tear you apart
And sometimes I feel
You're gonna make it to the end
You gotta live and you do what you feel
Don't care what anybody says
Gonna see it to the end
Gonna see it to the end
You gotta know what you are
