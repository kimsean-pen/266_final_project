One more prayer for the dying
And a prayer for the dead
Can you feel the blood flow
From the fallen angel

I've travelled through the world
Survived the strangest places
Another déjà vu
In the search for truth
Faced fatal embraces

Head or number
Do or die
Kill your demons
The breath of life

It's unpredictable
It's never visual
Always spiritual
It's the ritual

It's untouchable
It's indestructible
It is invincible
It's the ritual

You can't murder the holy silence
On your journey to asylum
And you breathing in
The smoke and fear

Listen to the ghostly cry
When the death is shining
The defender of the darkest sphere

Head or number
Do or die
Kill your demons
The breath of life

It's unpredictable
It's never visual
Always spiritual
It's the ritual

It's untouchable
It's indestructible
It is invincible
It's the ritual
