I can't say I'm into it, but who am I to moan
I'm the saint, I'm the hypocrite at your end of the phone
So make clear your interest, and make sure you're alone
'Cause I am dying

'Cause you're basic, and you're basically on your own

I'm fine, borderline, so bad it hurts
Think fast with your money 'cause it can't get much worse
I get told that I'm far too old for number one perks
But it's well worth trying

I'm good, and the neighborhood can play a big part
I bought this for a thought, for a kiss, for a tale of a broken heart
I guess we are a thing gonna him, gonna him, but they think there's a start
That leaves me crying

'Cause you're basic, and you're basically on your own

I can't say I'm into it, but who am I to moan
I'm the saint, I'm the hypocrite at your end of the phone
So make clear your interest, and make sure you're alone
'Cause I am dying

'Cause you're basic, and you're basically on your own

We were only living our separate lives
Except we do the same things at the same times
I kept to the moral guidelines that you set
For now I'll step towards my leader and disguise our lies like I'm king set

Like I'm king set
Like I'm king set
Like I'm king set

I can't say I'm into it, but who am I to moan
I'm the saint, I'm the hypocrite at your end of the phone
So make clear your interest, and make sure you're alone
'Cause I am dying
'Cause you're basic, and you're basically on your own
