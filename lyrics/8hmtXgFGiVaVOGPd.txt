I knew who you were, it was perfectly obvious
I was uncomfortable playing it cool
But I feel like I have always known you
I kept you close and I thought you would question it
Young in the night, when we stare like the rest of them
God forbid
Oh my god

I would hold you close
'Cause it is a lonely world
But would you want me too
'Cause it is a lonely world
Well I put off 'cause I'm painfully difident
I played it out in my head from afar
But they trust me too
You disappeared to my dissatisfaction
Oh, what could have been with a little more time?
Woe is me
Oh my god

I would hold you close
'Cause it is a lonely world
But would you want me too
'Cause it is a lonely world

Yeah I would hold you close
'Cause it is a lonely world
If I was confident
'Cause it is a lonely world

Yeah I would hold you close
'Cause it is a lonely world
But would you want me too
'Cause it is a lonely world

Yeah I would hold you close
'Cause it is a lonely world
If I was confident
'Cause it is a lonely world
