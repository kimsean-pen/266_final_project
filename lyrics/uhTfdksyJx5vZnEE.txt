Mountains with eyes listen in white heat
To our city and lies
Endless sunshine, flawless dreams
We lost in a wasteland

We're on fire
We'll eat stars
Everything
Is never enough

Living like
There's no tomorrow
We are here
In the future past

Insatiable perfect neon stranger
All the money you need
Watching nature on my screensaver
In a wasteland

Everything
Is never enough

Living like
There's no tomorrow
We are here
In the future past

Everything
Is never enough

Living like
There's no tomorrow
We are here
In the future past

Living like
There's no tomorrow
We are here
In the future past

Never enough, never enough
Never enough, never enough
Never enough, never enough
Never enough, never enough
Never enough, never enough
Never enough, never enough
Never enough, never enough
Never enough, never enough
