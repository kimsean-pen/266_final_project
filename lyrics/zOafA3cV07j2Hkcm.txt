My minds dark and dusty
Do not disturb on the door
I lived in this madness,
And wondered what it's all for

I've held onto my problems,
When I should,
Have let them go
I'm weak from the hatred that,
I have come to know

This isn't what I wanted
What I need now is you
Falling,
Drowning,
As my weight is breaking through
Help me I'm falling

When I think of how cheap,
The price of fame has become
Is it all worth it
To try and be number one

It's hard to remember who I was,
When this began (when this all began)
It's hard to take the lessons that I've learned,
And make amends

This isn't what I wanted,

What I need now is you
Falling,
Drowning,
As my weight is breaking through
Help me I'm falling
I'm falling

Sleep on the sheets of this bed i've made (this bed I've made)
A house of cards that I once made will fall today (fall today)
My times out of greed, of love and pain (love and pain)
It Will fall to me in the frozen rain

This isn't what I wanted,
What I need now is you
Falling,
Drowning,
As my weight is breaking through

This isn't what I wanted,
What I need now is you
Falling,
Drowning,
As my weight,
My weight is breaking through
As my weight,
My weight is breaking through
As my weight,
My weight is breaking through
