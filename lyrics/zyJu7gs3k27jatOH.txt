I can't stop looking in the mirror
Do I really make that face?
And you remind me what I look like
Now I'm alone in my own place
You, me
You, me
You, me
You, me
You chose to leave (you, me)
You chose to leave (you, me)
You chose to leave (you, me)

I keep looking in the mirror
'til I see myself, I see myself (eh)
Hey lover will you blow my cover
'cos I'm not myself
I'm not myself, I wake up
In the middle of the night and
I don't like the stranger in the bathroom light
I keep looking in the mirror
'til I see myself, I see myself

I'm trying so hard to forget you
When were you last online?
I should pretend I never met you
I'm still so desperate all the time
Do I really laugh like that?
Do I speak, do I move?
Do I look like that?
Come on I know what I'm good at
You, me
You, me
You, me
You, me
Where you at?
Where you at?
Where you at?
You, me
You, me
You, me
You, me

I keep looking in the mirror
'til I see myself, I see myself (eh)
Hey lover will you blow my cover
'cos I'm not myself
I'm not myself, I wake up
In the middle of the night and
I don't like the stranger in the bathroom light
I keep looking in the mirror
'til I see myself, I see myself

People love
People leave
People let down
People show up
Roll up
People grow up
People move out
People disappear
People don't change
People rearrange
People miss the game
People lose
People try
People lie
Can't look you in the eye
People suck
People fuck
People leave that shit behind
People throw up on the carpet
People trip up on the stairs
People laugh
People dare
People stare
People tell you what to wear
People jump
People sink
People float
People think
People fail
People hate what they don't know
People think they owe us nothing
People think they're at the top
People drop
People love what they don't know
People, people, don't stop

I keep looking in the mirror
'til I see myself, I see myself (eh)
Hey lover will you blow my cover
'cos I'm not myself
I'm not myself, I wake up
In the middle of the night and
I don't like the stranger in the bathroom light
I keep looking in the mirror
'til I see myself, I see myself

I keep looking in the mirror
'til I see myself, I see myself (eh)
Hey lover will you blow my cover
'cos I'm not myself
I'm not myself, I wake up
In the middle of the night and
I don't like the stranger in the bathroom light
I keep looking in the mirror
