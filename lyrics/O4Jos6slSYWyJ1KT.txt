waking up your neighbors downstairs
I've been inside your bedroom a thousand years
and as you tie me to the bed for good I say
that I want you in the most unromantic way
Louisiana, you're torturing me with a beautiful face
Ana, come on, I thought we had a damn good thing (damn good thing)
a penny in the couch and a diamond ring

so baby, stay away from my friends
'cause I need them to carry me
when it's over I'll count back from ten

and you can listen to glass hearts shattering
I don't know how you got into me
down my throat and made a home in my veins
they used to be the rivers that would take us away
now you only call me every Christmas and my birthday
I still can't believe how you look next to me

just like a strip club bedroom scene
baby, stay away from my friends
'cause I need them to carry me
when it's over I'll count back from ten
and you can listen to something that you've never heard before
never heard before (oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)

(oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
never heard before (oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
(oh oh, oh oh)
but you don't know what it's like
to wake up in the middle of the night
scaring the thought of kissing razors
this blood evacuation (oh!)
is telling me to cave in
stay away, away
oh no, no, oh no
just stay away, away, from my friends (from my friends)
(away, away)
(away, away)
(away)
