Well, I sympathize completely
But there's nothing I can do
I am just a humble servant
With a message here for you

Well, I know you have good reasons
And there's things you've got to do
But the boatman won't be waiting
And he's leaving here with you

And you can't take him with you
No matter what you do
No, you can't take him with you
Not the place you're going to

One more mile
One more road
One last bridge
One less load

Well I sympathize completely
But there's nothing I can do
I am just obeying orders
I'm a simple soul like you

Well, you really are persuasive
But I've heard it all before
And the boatman's getting restless
As he stands upon the shore

And you can't take him with you
No matter what you do
No, you can't take him with you
Not the place you're going to

Can't take him with you
Can't take him with you
Can't take him with you
