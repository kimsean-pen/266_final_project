Oh my god, I put my pants on inside out
I couldn't tell 'cause the lights were out
I beat the sunrise again, oh oh oh
Neighbors stare, I smile and wave 'cause I just don't care
They're probably jealous of my sexy hair
And the heels in my hands
Well please don't judge, it was mad late
I had a lot to drink
But I was only being safe

Don't act like you haven't been there
7 a.m. with the bed head
Everyone knows it's the walkashame

My daddy knows I'm a good girl
We all make mistakes in the drunk world
Everyone here has done the walkashame

Oh my brain, little bird just sound like airplanes
How can something so cute cause me
So much pain
Well please don't judge, it was mad late
I had a lot to drink
But I was only being safe

Don't act like you haven't been there
7 a.m. with the bed head
Everyone knows it's the walkashame

My daddy knows I'm a good girl
We all make mistakes in the drunk world
Everyone here has done the walkashame

I might be walking but it's only cause I'm out of breath
Don't even try to act like you ain't done the same mistake
And if you're gonna do the walk, do it like a boss, a boss
That's right
A little bit of rum in my tummy, yom, yom
Must shake it up, and dance like a dummy, dom, dom
He kissed me and called me his babe
Asked me to stay
How could I turned that away?
Don't judge, it was mad late
I had a lot to drink
But I was only being safe

Don't act like you haven't been there
7 a.m. with the bed head
Everyone knows it's the walkashame
My daddy knows I'm a good girl
We all make mistakes in the drunk world
Everyone here has done the walkashame
Don't act like you haven't been there
7 a.m. with the bed head
Everyone knows it's the walkashame
