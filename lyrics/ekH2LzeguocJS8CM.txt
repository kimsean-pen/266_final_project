I wait for you on the widow's peak
I peak over the tops of the trees
Out to the sea, watch the waves cap with white
And I know you're not comin' home tonight

I pray for you on the widow's peak
I hold steadfast to my tired belief
That the wind won't rip you overboard
Still I scan for your body on the shore

I think of you on the widow's peak
My widow, I know it's gettin' bleak
But the ship is sinkin' in the stone
I won't be yours anymore
Oh I know I won't be yours anymore

(I wait for you)
(I know)
(I think)
