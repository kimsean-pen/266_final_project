I had watched you taking in the spring
through dusty sun-kissed bodies wondering

Between you and me
As if they don't see this distraction
This beautiful view
This delicate you in the way

If I follow you tonight
And leave tomorrow
If it's all forgotten love
forgotten love

If I follow you then I
Will need you closer
One more day is not enough

Anything that I could ask of you
Is more than anything that I could do

What did I say?
I cannot say I remember
but every word
Seems so absurd, my love

If I follow you tonight
And leave tomorrow
If it's all forgotten love
Forgotten love

If I follow you then
I will need you closer
One more day is not enough

I don't mind
If all this time
Is all we have to spend
Ever me
I carelessly pretend

If I follow you tonight
And leave tomorrow
If it's all forgotten love
Forgotten love

If I follow you then
I will need you closer
One more day is not enough
