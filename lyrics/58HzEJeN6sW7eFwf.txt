You always check yourself
In every mirror you see
Day and night
And it is such a shame
Your vanity is to blame
Oh why don't you knock it off

It is the pointlessness
That's got me loving less
I cannot handle that you're such a wannabe
You're caught up in yourself
And me, you don't even see

I won't be crying when I'm lonely
Sorry making sure I'll have a
Good time
Ain't nothing wrong when i'm alone now
'Cause I'm alone and I'm proud
I won't be crying when I'm lonely

I'm sure you don't believe
That anybody can tell
You're a fool
I'll bet that you believe
They only think that you're cool
And a handsome devil too

But baby trust me now
You'd better turn around
'Cause otherwise you're gonna fall and hit the ground
'Cause all this spirit boy
Won't last eternally

I won't be crying when i'm lonely
Sorry making sure I'll have a
Good time
Ain't nothing wrong when I'm alone now
'Cause I'm alone and I'm proud
I won't be crying when I'm lonely

I won't be crying when i'm lonely
Sorry making sure I'll have a
Good time
Ain't nothing wrong when I'm alone now
'Cause I'm alone and I'm proud
I won't be crying when I'm lonely
Sorry making sure I'll have a
Good time
Ain't nothing wrong when I'm alone now
'Cause I'm alone and I'm proud
I won't be crying when I'm lonely
