This is wrong, I should be gone
Yet here we lay, cause I can't stay away
Roses bloom in your dirty room
I come to play, cause I can't stay away

No I can't stay away-ay
I'm conflicted, I inhale now I'm addicted
To this place, to you babe
I can't stay away, can't stay away
We get up, we go down

Then we go one more round
It's wrong, they say
I can't stay a- I can't stay away
No I can't stay a- I can't stay away
I was numb, for you I come
Night and day, and I can't stay away
No I can't stay away
I'm conflicted, I inhale now I'm addicted
To this place, to you babe
I can't stay away, can't stay away
We get up, we go down

Then we go one more round
It's wrong, they say
I can't stay a- I can't stay away
No I can't stay a- I can't stay away
I wish I could leave and never return

Baby I know I should, but for you I'd burn
Stay away
'Cause I can't stay away-ay
I'm conflicted, I inhale now I'm addicted
To this place, to you babe
I can't stay away, can't stay away
We get up, we go down
Then we go one more round
It's wrong, they say
I can't stay a- I can't stay away
No I can't stay a- I can't stay away
I can't stay away, I can't stay away
I can't stay away, I can't stay away
