Look in my eyes i'm jaded now, whatever that means
But show me these things, i rip my heart out
It's worth my time, whatever that means

Soo, I wanna see up, my neck feels stiff until i wake up
You're in charge oh, and back to my neck, it's worth my
time, whatever that means

Soo share with me 'cause i need it right now
Let me see your insides
Ride me off 'cause i'd rather stop now
If you wanna open up

Give it to me, give me all whatever you want
It's never been me
To what this much from you i can see, yeah!

Share with me 'cause i need it right now
Let me see your insides
Ride me off 'cause i'd rather stop now
If you wanna open up
(You wanna open up! Yeah! Take me off! Take me off! Take me off!)

Look in my eyes i'm jaded now, whatever that means
But show me these things, i rip my heart out
It's worth my time, whatever that means

Soo, share with me 'cause i need it right now
Let me see your insides
Ride me off 'cause i'd rather stop now
If you wanna open up
(Wanna open up!)
(Share with me 'cause i need it right now
Let me see your insides
Ride me off 'cause i'd rather stop now
If you wanna open up, you wanna open up)
