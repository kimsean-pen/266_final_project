Everyone I once knew has faded away
This old town can never feel the same
'Cause where the hell is my hope I once held?
I'm leaving at first light, this is something I've never felt
I've lost my home
And goddamn, it's worse than you'll ever know
You'll ever know
It changes me from the inside

So many days have come and passed me by
I'm sick of waiting for the right time
To leave this all behind
Turn my back and say goodbye
Hold these thoughts, hold these memories inside my head
Why can't I just fucking forget
And leave this all behind?
Turn my back and say goodbye

Leave these sick memories behind closed curtains
Something is pulling me
Further the fuck away and I know this for certain
You know I won't let this fucking dream die
Let all the sick memories go
I've counted the cars as they passed me by
I've lived, I've lost and I won't let this dream die

So many days have come and passed me by
I'm sick of waiting for the right time
To leave this all behind
Turn my back and say goodbye
Hold these thoughts, hold these memories inside my head
Why can't I just fucking forget
And leave this all behind?
Turn my back and say goodbye

Don't worry about me when I'm gone
The weight of the world on my shoulders just feels so strong
Don't worry about me when I'm gone
The weight of the world on my shoulders just feels so strong
I'm reaching out, I'm reaching out for something
Reaching out for something
But at least I know I fucking tried
I fucking tried

I don't need anyone else by my side
