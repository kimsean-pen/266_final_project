Oh sun and moon beheld!
When we rose up from dust
No sound or song would dare dispraise
The might we have become

We hail to Thee, O avenging force!
We are the dawn ov New Jerusalem
We are the ending ov all days
We are the next 1000 years!

To Christ, falls saviour on the cross!
To the Emperor ov Rome!
To Christ, falls saviour on the cross!
To the devil in our souls!

We go where no mortals dare to go
Explore that human flesh yet not explored
The tree ov god shall not withstand the ruthless storm
We are the death that rides the pale horse

We hail to Thee, O avenging force!
We are the deportees from the Promised Land
Fallen, but we rewrite the history with blood
We are the next 1000 years!

To Christ, falls saviour on the cross!
To the Emperor ov Rome!
To Christ, falls saviour on the cross
For devil our souls!
