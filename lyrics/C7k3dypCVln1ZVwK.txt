Tell me if you got a problem
Tell me if it's in your way
Tell me if there's something bothering you
Tell me what should I say

You know I'd do almost anything
You know I'd change the world
You know I'd do almost anything
for my little girl

Tell me if you got a problem
Tell me now what's inside
Show me if you broke your heartstrings
You know you never need to hide

You know I'd do almost anything
You know I'd paint the sky
You know I'd do almost anything
For you're my guiding light

You are my star shining on me now,
A love from world's apart
I need for your
You are my shining star

Once upon a time a memory
Once upon a time girl
Once upon a time perfect life
Once upon a perfect world

You know I'd do almost anything
For you my guiding light
You know I'd do almost everything
To keep you in my life

You are my star shining on me now,
A love from world's apart
I need for your
You are my shining star

Just a memory
Every dream is of you and me
If I wish upon a star
Well I hope that's where you are

When Heavens turn
You know you'll shine
You're in my heart for all time
When Heaven turns
You know you'll shine
In worlds apart

Cause yeah you are my Star
A love from worlds apart I need for you,
You are my shining star, my star
A love from worlds apart I need for you,
You are my shining star,
shining on me now
A love from worlds apart I need for you,
You are my shining star, my star
A love from worlds apart I need for you,
You are my shining star

You are my star shining on me now,
A love from world's apart
I need for your
You are my shining star
