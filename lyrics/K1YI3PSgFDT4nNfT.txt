Got my hobnails
I got the jitter shakes
Diamond Hoo Ha Man
I do what it takes

All I got, is all I need
Oh, but what I really want
Is in my dreams
When the sun goes down
I just can't resist
Bite me!

Got to get you in my suitcase
Oh, can't you see
I want you
Got to get you in my suitcase

I'm going to hot tail
To the motel
Love you all night long
Oh my baby bell

All I got, is all I need
Oh, but what I really want
Is in my dreams
When you hold me down
I just can't resist
Bite me!

I got to get you in my suitcase
It's duty free, I gotcha
Now I got you in my suitcase

When the sun goes down
I just can't resist

Bite me!

I got to get you in my suitcase
Oh, can't you see
I want you
Gonna take you in my suitcase, suitcase
