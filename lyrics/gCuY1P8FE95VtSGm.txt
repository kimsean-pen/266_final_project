65 nickels in my pocket
It's how I'm gonna home tonight
65 nickels in my pocket
Yea, they're wearing me down but that's all right
65 nickels in my pocket
It's better than walking with you
'Cause I got 65 nickels in my pocket
For every shitty thing you put me through

Way too many nickels in my pocket
It's better than getting in a fight
65 nickels in my pocket
'Cause it doesn't matter who was wrong or right
I got so many nickels in my pocket
But it's better than walking with you
'Cause I got 65 nickels in my pocket
For every shitty thing you put me through

Our faces smash together in that locket
But tonight I want to be alone
Tell me in the morning if we're talking
'Cause I don't really care and
I don't wanna know

65 nickels in my pocket
So I don't have to walk home with you
Emptied out the change jar to find them now
I'll take the subway yea that's what I'll do
I got $3.25 and a lighter
And if the train don't come I'm screwed
'Cause I got 65 nickels in my pocket
For every shitty thing you put me through

(On the bus, on the street
On the rails and I'm on my feet)
(On the bus, on the street
On the rails and I'm on my feet)
65 Nickels in my pocket

65 Nickels in my pocket

I got 65 nickels in my pocket
