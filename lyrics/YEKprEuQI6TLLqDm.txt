Every time you said you loved me, you loved yourself
Every time you said you cared, you loved yourself

Love the ones you love to hate
Dancing devils in your parade
We all make mistakes
And you will be fine

You dance in a circle with the words that you say
You wanna take a, take a chance with all the lies you say

Love the ones you love to hate
Dancing devils in your parade
We all make mistakes
And you will be fine

All the times we sat at the table
You could've tried to understand me
All the pain this father has been through
You could've tried to understand me
All the times we sat at the table
You could've tried to understand me
All the pain this father has been through
You could've tried to understand me

Love the ones you love to hate
Dancing devils in your parade
We all make mistakes
And you will be fine
Love the ones you love to hate
Dancing devils in your parade
We all make mistakes
And you will be fine
Love the ones you love to hate
Love the ones you love to hate
Love the ones you love to hate
You will be fine
And you will be fine
And you will be fine
And you will be fine
You will be fine
