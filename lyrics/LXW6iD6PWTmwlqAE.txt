Freckles goes from a line around your face
And I get lost when I try to find my way
And I start to tumble down
Pick me back up off the ground
Teardrops boiling in a pot of gold
And we drink up 'til we're wrinkled then we're old
We can always fly away
I mean every word I say

Ever think what if we never met?
You love me, but you don't know it yet
Everything is just an accident
A happy accident

Limbo and we're going lower still
And we plan love, put it on a window sill
And another time and place
Where I never even had the chance to see your face

Ever think what if we never met?
You love me, but you don't know it yet
Everything is just an accident
A happy accident

If I never laid eyes on you
Would I feel something missing?
If you never laid eyes on me
Would you know something's gone?
But I don't think that I'll ever know
Let's just live in the afterglow
Let it go
Just let it go

What if we never met?
You love me, but you don't know it yet
Everything is just an accident
A happy accident
A happy accident
A happy accident
