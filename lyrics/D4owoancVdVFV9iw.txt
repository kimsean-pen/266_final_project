Do you know how it feels to hide
With thoughts repressed deep down inside?
I guess you just loved the lie
Truth is, you can't decide where my heart resides

You want to cure me of this epidemic
You call me sick
I wish I had said it
The words to admit to you who I am
My entire life I was dealt the wrong hand
Cast aside (cast aside) from the man that I am

I've never felt so free
And it kills me to hear you say
You "choose to love me"
I was hoping that would be a given
Given our history
I've never felt so free (so free)
You think I'm wrong
You think I'm wrong
But I never felt better

Stop living in denial, stop loving the lie
I thought blood was thicker than water
You think I'm wrong but I never felt better
Stop living in denial, stop loving the lie
I thought blood was thicker than water
You think I'm wrong but I never felt better

I know I disappointed you
But I've got nothing to prove

You want to cure me of this epidemic
You call me sick
I wish I had said it
The words to admit to you who I am
My entire life I was dealt the wrong hand
Now I've realized
This is who I am, I am
I've made my decision
You're either with or against me
You're either with or against me
You're either with or against me

Stop living in denial, stop loving the lie
I thought blood was thicker than water
You think I'm wrong but I never felt better
Stop living in denial, stop loving the lie

I'm standing firm, it's who I am (who I am)
You can't keep me, you can't keep me down
I'm moving on, I'm living free (living free)
You can't stop me, you can't stop me now
I'm standing firm, it's who I am (who I am)
You can't keep me, you can't keep me down
I'm moving on, I'm living free (living free)
You can't stop me, you can't stop me now
