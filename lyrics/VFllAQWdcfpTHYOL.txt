If I could make a wish, I think I'd pass
Can't think of anything I need
No cigarettes, no sleep, no light, no sound
Nothing to eat, no books to read

Making love with you has left me peaceful, warm and tired
What else could I ask, there's nothing to be desired

Peace came upon me and it leaves me weak
So sleep, silent angel, go to sleep

Sometimes â"
All I need is the air that I breathe and to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe and to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe ...

Making love with you has left me peaceful, warm and tired
What more could I ask, there's nothing to be desired

Sometimes â"
All I need is the air that I breathe and to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe and to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe ...

Peace came upon me and it leaves me weak
So sleep, silent angel, go to sleep

Sleep, silent angel, go to sleep ...
