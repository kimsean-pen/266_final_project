Send in the clouds
Bring down the rain
Shut all the blinds and turn out the lights
I feel insane when you get in my bed

I am the trick
My mother played on the world
Seventeen doctors couldn't decide
Whether I should be allowed in the game

Why can't monsters
Get along with other monsters?
Soi disantra, soi disantra
Soi disantra

I know a puppy
Who walked from Kentucky
Made to East Virginia by dawn
He had seventeen ideas in his head

Windex tears flow down the robot's face
He never felt a mother's embrace
My mama named me after a king
I'm gonna bury my name in you

Why can't monsters
Get along with other monsters?
Soi disantra, soi disantra
Soi disantra
