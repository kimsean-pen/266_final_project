I been thinking of my problems
Living on rock bottom
This pressure be piling up
But I'm feeling like why bother
Reflecting on all the days
Growing up, there was no drama
Telling me move on
But honestly I don't wanna
Are you happy now?
Got a couple dollars in your pocket
Go and stack it up
Pretending to mitigate all your problems
Motherfucker
I just miss the days on the playground
Seems like everybody that I loved went away now

Like why does the time fly?
How come as I grow I keep feeling less alive?
How come all I see is the past when I shut my eyes?
Man, I thought it would last, but it passed me by
Tell me why does the time fly?
How come every song I write I say I wanna die?
How come all I see is your face when I look to the sky?
Man, I thought it would last, but it passed me by
'Cause

And I can't, can't go back
'Cause things change
I can't change that
And I can't, can't go back
'Cause things change
I can't change that

Every time I take a trip back home
I see the faces of the ones I used to hold so close
Looking nothing like they did in those old photos
Birds out, beer gut, that's the way life goes
I always tried to get them out of the rut
But it seems like all they wanted was to get fucked up
I could lead you to the water
But I can't make you drink
I can give my two cents,
But I can't make you think

Like why does the time fly?
How come as I grow I keep feeling less alive?
How come all I see is the past when I shut my eyes?
Man, I thought it would last, but it passed me by
Tell me why does the time fly?
How come every song I write I say I wanna die?
How come all I see is your face when I look to the sky?
Man, I thought it would last, but it passed me by
'Cause

And I can't, can't go back
'Cause things change
I can't change that
And I can't, can't go back
'Cause things change
I can't change that
