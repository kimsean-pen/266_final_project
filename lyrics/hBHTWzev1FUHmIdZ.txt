Feel the heat of the night

Jumpin', jumpin' up and down

free your soul and free your mind.
Now set you free, right on time

feel the heat and free your mind
put your hands up in the air
and wave 'em like you just don't care
Feel the rhythm stay real tight
feel the heat feel the night
let the groove control your move
shake your bud and make me hot

feel the heat of the night.

Move your body shake your bud
