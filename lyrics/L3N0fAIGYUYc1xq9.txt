You can't fight a war with nobody to fight back
But if we get to digging to the bottom of the stack
We'll sell it to the youth and you never know, maybe
You'll get back home and you'll see your baby, oh

We'll just act like we care

All we're needing is a reason
It don't need to be clear
Singing songs to the news
It can play to their fears
Someone's gotta' die and you don't have to love him
But the military's still got more in its budget, oh

We always need more next year

No one cares about the waves
At the bottom of the ocean
And at the bottom of the ocean
It's always blue
No one will remember
Cause nothing lasts forever
And everybody's looking
For somebody to use

When you don't bring them home and the war hasn't ended
There's still money there and that money needs spending
The powers that be, we gotta' do what we do
If they never know it than they'll never feel used, oh
Like I often do

To all the pretty girls out there looking for heartache
Crying, "All I wanted is to be your baby"
And all the pretty girls out there living with heartache
Crying cause they're never gonna' see their baby, oh

We just act like we care

No one cares about the waves
At the bottom of the ocean
And at the bottom of the ocean
It's always blue
No one will remember
Cause nothing lasts forever
And everybody's looking
For somebody to use

No one will remember
Cause nothing lasts forever
The world is always changing
And it's always blue
And it's always blue
