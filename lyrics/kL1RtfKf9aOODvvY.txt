Is she really going out with him
Oh there she is, let's ask her
Betty, is that Jimmy's ring your wearing
Um hm
Gee it must be great riding with him
Is he picking you up after school today
Unuh
By the way, where'd you meet him

I met him at the candy store
He turned around and smiled at me - you get the
picture
That's when I fell for...
The leader of the pack

My folks were always putting him down
They said he came from the wrong side of town
They told me he was bad
But I knew he was sad
That's why I fell for...

One day my dad said find someone new
I had to tell my Jim we were through
He stood there and asked me why
But all I could do was cry
I'm sorry I hurt you...

He sort of smiled and kissed me goodbye
The tears were beginning to show
And as he left me on that rainy night
I begged him to go slow
But whether he heard, I'll never know

I felt so helpless what could I do?
Remembering all the things we'd been through
At school they all stop and stare
I can't hide the tears, but I don't care
I'll never forget you...

The leader of the pack, now he's gone
The leader of the pack, now he's gone
The leader of the pack, now he's gone
