Saturday night, I feel the air is getting hot
Like you baby
I'll make you mine, you know I'll take you to the top
I'll drive you crazy
Saturday night, dance, I like the way you move
Pretty baby

It's party time and not one minute we can lose
Be my baby
Da ba da dan dee dee dee da Nee na na na
Be my baby
Da ba da dan dee dee dee da Nee na na na
