I just need someone in my life
To give it structure
To handle all the selfish ways
I spend my time without her
You're everything I want
But I can't deal with all your lovers
You're saying I'm the one
But it's your actions that speak louder
Giving me your love
When you are down and need another
I've gotta get away and let you go
I gotta get over

But I love you so
I love you so
I love you so
I love you so

I'm gonna pack my things and leave you behind
This feeling's old and I know
That I've made up my mind
I hope you feel what I felt
When you shattered my soul
'Cause you were cool and I'm a fool
So please let me go

But I love you so (Please let me go)
I love you so (Please let me go)
I love you so (Please let me go)
I love you so
