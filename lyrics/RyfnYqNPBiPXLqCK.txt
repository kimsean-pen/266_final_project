Wonder, tell me do you wonder
Tell me, do you let your mind
Slip away at night
Underneath, this feeling a reminder
I've been tryna find some time here
See what you're all about

Ooh, bring me home
And ooh, decompose
Right here, forever

Take my heart and make it feel
Take my soul and make it real
'Cause I was bright, yeah I was pale and blue
Starry-eyed by every thought of you
Take my hand before I go
Take it all 'cause I'm a ghost
Wish it was something that I said to you
But some rest is all I need

But I'm afraid, afraid of the light
I'm feeling the pain, the worst of my life
And worms will eat my flesh
'Til Earth is all that's left
Bleeding and breathing

Take my heart and make it feel
Take my soul and make it real
'Cause I was bright, yeah I was pale and blue
Starry-eyed by every thought of you
Take my hand before I go
Take it all 'cause I'm a ghost
Wish it was something that I said to you
But some rest is all I need

The brightest blue in the dark
I feel it falling apart
The brightest blue in the dark
I feel it falling apart

Take my heart and make it feel
Take my soul and make it real
'Cause I was bright, yeah I was pale and blue
Starry-eyed by every thought of you
Take my hand before I go
Take it all 'cause I'm a ghost
Wish it was something that I said to you
But I know that some rest is all I need
