Ahh
Girl, I love you
Ahh
Ehhh, ahh
It's, it's, it's Serani
Just in case you never know
Just in case you never know, oh, oh
Ehhh, ahh

Love you girl, do you feel the same?
I don't wanna play games, no games, ahhh
You're the only that can out my flame
Baby, just play it straight, straight, no games, ahhh

We've been together six months now
(The most perfect days)
You pushed for us to exchange vows
(Baby, changed my ways)
I gave my life over to you
(Then you turned around)
After all that we've been through
(I was your rebound)

Girl, I want you (All time)
I'll forever love you (You're mine)
I'm not mad, even though I'm sad
('Cause you) Should give me one more chance

Love you girl, do you feel the same?
I don't wanna play games, no games, ahhh
You're the only that can out my flame
Baby, just play it straight, straight, no games, ahhh

Is this the life you really want
(Constant delusion)
Your time with me was very fun
(There's no illusion)
But I don't know you anymore
When you walked outside that door
You left your happiness

But girl, I want you (All time)
I'll forever love you (You're mine)
I'm not mad, even though I'm sad
('Cause you) Should give me one more chance

Love you girl, do you feel the same?
I don't wanna play games, no games, ahhh
You're the only that can out my flame
Baby, just play it straight, straight, no games, ahhh

Cause your my one and only
I'm still here feeling lonely
Feeling wasted, yeah-e-yeah, yeah-e-yeah, ahhh
Your my sunshine
I need you back one more time
Ti-i-ime, time, ahhh

Love you girl, do you feel the same?
I don't wanna play games, no games, ahhh
You're the only that can out my flame
Baby, just play it straight, straight, no games, ahhh
