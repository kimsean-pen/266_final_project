Mama said before I'm grown
I'll find somebody I can call my own
So when the stars are shining bright
I dream about the boy who's gonna hold me tight

And I wonder who he'll be
I wonder if he'll be good to me
I wonder, gosh oh gee
I wonder if he'll love me forever

Every night I close my eyes
And there is something that I visualize
I hear a voice, say, "I love you"
I picture all things that we're gonna do

And I wonder who he'll be
I wonder if he'll be good to me
I wonder, gosh oh gee
Wonder if he'll love me forever

Every day I love him more
Than I did the day before
I will try to make him see
Just how much he means to me

We will meet and fall in love
And make a promise to the stars above
We will talk and get home late
Oh I can see it now, I can hardly wait

And I wonder who he'll be
I wonder if he'll be good to me
I wonder, gosh oh gee
Wonder if he'll love me forever

And I wonder who he'll be
I wonder if he'll be good to me
I wonder, gosh oh gee
Wonder if he'll love me forever

I wonder and ever
I wonder forever
I wonder and ever
I wonder forever
I wonder and ever
I wonder forever
