Hurts to see
Mind capacity
Shame idle mind
No, you have changed me
My mouth is shut
Stupidity has shut my mouth
Shame idle mind
No, you have changed me
So when you come
And too unprepared to come alone
I hold your hands so hard my knuckles turn white
When your clear the streets and kill the lights
See the light
Pull it to freedom
The words and the light
My name you have changed it
You totally changed it cruel
This is how you tell me
Once again
How am I nothing on you
How everything is supposed to end
Father I will make it
Its the journey of our life
Fix my eyes on the sun
What have I done
