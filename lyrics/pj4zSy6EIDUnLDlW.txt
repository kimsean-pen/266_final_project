I can't make no guarantees (guarantees, no)
Half this shit ain't what it seems (like what it seems, no)
I can't trust you at the scene (at the scene, oh)
You don't love me you a fiend (aye, you a fiend, oh)
I can't give you what you need (What you need, oh)
I see hoe shit in your genes (in your genes, oh)
Fuck that talk if it ain't cream (if it ain't cream, yeah)
You don't know what you ain't seen (oh, yeah yeah)

OK, a snake can act a friend
I knew what Eve didn't
They gon' make this shit sound sweet
Just as long as they got some to eat
But the minute that you slip, they be the key witness
Spreading lies through they damn teeth
Til the day you off your damn feet
It be different
'Specially when they hear that beat kicking
See you in the whip they wanna be whipping
Watch whoever on your passenger side
You might end up with your keys missing
Niggas quick to talk behind the scenes
I ain't really with that sneak dissing
Shawty said I ain't gon' be shit
I said she don't know what she missing

Go ahead and give me my space
You ain't eating off of my plate
I've been killing for a minute now
Pay attention to the crime rate
Competition, I ain't met mine
Got a nigga making headlines
I gave niggas time to hop on
They just couldn't meet the deadline

I can't make no guarantees (guarantees, no)
Half this shit ain't what it seems (like what it seems, no)
I can't trust you at the scene (at the scene, oh)
You don't love me you a fiend (aye, you a fiend, oh)
I can't give you what you need (what you need, oh)
I see hoe shit in your genes (in your genes, oh)
Fuck that talk if it ain't cream (if it ain't cream, yeah)
You don't know what you ain't seen (oh, yeah, look, yeah)

I dont want attention from you
I seen first hand what the fuck attention could do
Niggas know damn well, they shouldn't be mentioning you
But how could they not
When you in a drop-top-top-notch-top-spot
Told them boys it would go like this
Name a young nigga who flow like this
All that hate I would get back then,
came from the same ones who know my shit

Get me paid
Grow my hits
Ride my wave
Blow my dick
Shooting at a nigga you sure might miss
Fucking with a goat, ain't no right risk

Aye can't you see?
I'm gon' be with the team, you know me (aye you know me)
I got plans, I got plans, I got plans,
you ain't seen (aye, you ain't seen)
Who I am, who I am, who I am, what you mean? (what you mean?)
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm a king...

I can't make no guarantees (guarantees, no)
Half this shit ain't what it seems (like what it seems, no)
I can't trust you at the scene (at the scene, oh)
You don't love me you a fiend (aye, you a fiend, oh)
I can't give you what you need (what you need, oh)
I see hoe shit in your genes (in your genes, oh)
Fuck that talk if it ain't cream...
