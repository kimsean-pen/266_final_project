I am nothing without love
I'm but a ship stuck in the sand
Some would say that I'm all alone
But I am, I'm nothing without love

I wanna hold her in my arms
But she feelin' alone, she feelin' sad
I would take credit for what's wrong
But I am, I'm nothing without love

Three years at sea after the storm
And this sinking ship that love had put me on
God, I wish a gust of wind would come and carry me home
But I, I got nowhere to go

Now I hear you sharp with the force of a wave
So I'm setting my sail, I'm heading for the empire state, hey, hey
I don't wanna lose this one, she made me feel whole, you know
I am, I'm nothing without love

Oh baby, show me a sign
Send me a signal that everything's fine
Come on, stand up right up by my side
You know that I, I wanna rest in your life

Na na na, hey, na na na, oh
Na na na, hey, na na na, oh
Na na na, hey, na na na, oh
Na na na, hey, na na na, oh (I wanna rest in your life)

Na na na, hey, na na na, oh
Na na na, hey, na na na, oh
Na na na, hey, na na na, oh
Na na na, hey

I am nothing without love
I'm just these palms without a pair
And I would take credit for this song
But I am nothing without love

Baby, show me a sign
Send me a signal that everything's fine
Oh, just come on, come one, come on, come on right by my side
Don't you know that I, don't you know that I, I wanna rest in your life

I wanna rest in your life, I wanna rest in your life
'Cause I am, I'm nothing without love
