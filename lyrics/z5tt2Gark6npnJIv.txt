Dot King was whittled from the bone of Cain
With a little drop of poison in the red, red blood
She need a way to turn around the bend
She said, "I want to walk away and start over again"

There are things I've done I can't erase
I want to look in the mirror see another face
I said, "never", but I'm doing it again
I wanna walk away, start over again

No more rain, no more roses
I'm on my way, shake my thirst in a cool, cool pond
There's a winner in every place
There's a heart that's beating in every page
The beginning of it starts at the end
When it's time to walk away and start over again

Weather's murder at a hundred and three
William Ray shot Corabell Lee
A yellow dog knows when he has sinned
You wanna walk away and start over again

No more rain, no more roses
I'm on my way, shaking my thirst in a cool, cool pond
Cooper told Maui the whole block's gone
They're dying for jewellery, money and clothes
I always get out of the trouble I'm in
I want to walk away, start over again

I left my bible by the side of the road
Carve my initials in an old dead tree
I'm going away but I'm going to be back when
It's time to walk away and start over again

It's time to walk away and
You gotta walk away, gotta walk away
I just wanna walk away yeah, wanna walk away and start over again
I wanna walk away, wanna walk away, wanna walk away, wanna walk away,
I wanna walk away...
