Reach the top and start to cry
Heaven looked me in the eye
Afraid to jump but had to try
Exhaled and said: Goodbye

I'm flying
I'm flying

Always knew I had to go
Find the me I did not know
Who I'd be when I got old
Just how far the wind would blow

I'm sailing
I'm sailing

All in all this much is true
'Cause love and hate and they both burn
Peace and war they take turns

All in all there's nothing new
I'm still myself but I've changed
Things I always thought were strange
Aren't that strange at all

All in all
All in all

God is older than I am
He was where it all began
I try to do the best I can
To see this truth from where I stand

I'm praying
I'm praying

All in all this much is true
There's love and hate, and they both burn
Peace and war, they take turns

All in all there's nothing new
I'm still myself but I've changed
Things I always thought were strange
Aren't that strange at all

All in all there's nothing new
I'm still myself but I've changed
Things I always thought were strange
Aren't that strange at all

All in all
Oh, all in all
