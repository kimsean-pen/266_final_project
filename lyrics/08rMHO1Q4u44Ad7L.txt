I wanna another sleep tight,
Before it's too late now
I wanna get you back
Got no time to waste now
And I've been spending too much time on you
Should've flee right now
'Cause I'm up all night
Thinking about you

I just want your love
I feel it all around me
I just want your love
To feel it all the time boy

Are you??
'Cause you're all that I see
I wanna make it right,
I've got no else to tell now
I've been losing my mind over you
All to you, all to you
And I can't see straight
With or without you!

I just want your love
I feel it all around me
I just want your love
To feel it all the time boy
I just want your love
I feel it all around me
I just want your love
To feel it all the time boy!

All I do is keep on loving you
All I do is keep on loving you
All I do is keep on loving you
All I do is keep on loving you
All I do is keep on loving you
