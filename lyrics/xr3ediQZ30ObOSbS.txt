Here's a situation that's been weighing on my brain
I know you've been looking for something brand new
Oh now please forgive me for what I'm about to say
Tell me baby can you, baby can you

Give me one good reason why you don't give this a try?
Girl there's no point in feeling guilty
Oh I'm asking can you keep a, can you keep an open mind?
No we got nothing to hide, so girl why don't we?

Spend a little time in the middle
Middle out on the floor (yeah)
Never done it like this before (c'mon)
Girl why don't we?
Love right now just a little
Cause you deserve so much more (yeah)
Never done it like this before (c'mon)
Girl why don't we?

Let's not waste another moment, baby take a chance (take a chance now)
I know that you feel this, cause I feel it too
Oh but you be sitting, like you forgot how to dance (how you dance now)
Think of what we can do (baby can you)

Give me one good reason, why you don't give this a try?
Girl there's no point in feeling guilty
Oh I'm asking can you keep a, can you keep an open mind?
No we got nothing to hide, so, girl why don't we?

It's what you've been missing
Can't you see?
So girl why don't we?
