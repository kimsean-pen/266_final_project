Oh, oh, ooo, whoa
Oh, oh, ooo, whoa

I was better off the night before I met you
But I was mesmerized and high on every word you spoke
You were born to run but your poison tongue won't save you
'Cause when you play with fire it all goes up in smoke

I hope your hands burn when you touch her
I won't be the cure for the scars you've earned
You lit the fuse, thought I'd burn too
But you're playing with a heart that's fireproof

Oh, oh, ooo, whoa
Oh, oh, ooo, whoa
Oh, oh, ooo, whoa
Oh, oh, ooo, whoa

Don't know whats behind those eyes
But I can feel it (I can feel it)
A kind of danger in the darkness written on your soul
If the brightest dark can light the sky forever
How could you ever think you were invincible?

I hope your hands burn when you touch her
I won't be the cure for the scars you've earned
You lit the fuse, thought I'd burn too
But you're playing with a heart that's fireproof

I watch your flames rise
Destroy your alibis
I should have warned you
You're playing with a heart that's fireproof

Oh, oh, ooo, whoa
Oh, oh, ooo, whoa
Oh, oh, ooo, whoa
Oh, oh, ooo, whoa

No more games, can't escape (oh, oh, ooo, whoa)
You will always be my worst mistake (oh, oh, ooo, whoa)
Gasoline on your grave (oh, oh, ooo, whoa)
Going down in flames, going down in flames (oh, oh, ooo, whoa)
No more games, can't escape (oh, oh, ooo, whoa)
You will always be my worst mistake (oh, oh, ooo, whoa)
Gasoline on your grave (oh, oh, ooo, whoa)
Going down in flames (oh, oh, ooo, whoa)

I hope your hands burn when you touch her
I won't be the cure for the scars you've earned
You lit the fuse, thought I'd burn too
But you're playing with a heart that's fireproof
I watch your flames rise
Destroy your alibis
I should have warned you
You're playing with a heart that's fireproof

Oh, oh, ooo, whoa
Oh, oh, ooo, whoa
Oh, oh, ooo, whoa

You're playing with a heart that's fireproof
(Oh, oh, ooo, whoa)
