I'm a lonely woman
Alone in the world
Drifting through town
Drifting through town

I was once a loved woman
Once was all that I knew
Fodder for the fire
Picture of you

I drove to the place
Scattered my remains
Wild wind through the canyon
Moonlight on the plain

I'm a lonely woman
Won't leave a trace
You won't remember my name
Won't remember my face

I'm a lonely woman
Alone in the world
Drifting through town
Drifting through town
Drifting through town
Drifting through town
