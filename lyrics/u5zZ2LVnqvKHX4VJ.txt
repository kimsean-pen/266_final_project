Tangled in the sunrise
(tangled in the sunrise)
Pretending we care what the clocks strikes (pretend pretend pretend)
Yea I see storms in your eyes
(I see storms)
Their leftover from last night
(Pretend pretend pretend)
If it's in your heart it's not so fun but I can't stop looking since you found me attractive
I can't get past it
If it's in the deep blue of your sky
stare into mine and you can hold me captive, do me without askin'
And love me through life
Cause baby we can know where to go
and love me through life
Cause baby we can know it
Deeper than devotion
I don't need cigarettes when i've got your potion

Ooh pour a little poison
Not another day which you've been holdin'
If it's in your heart it's not so fun but I can't stop looking since you, found me attractive
I can't get past it
If it's in the deep blue of your sky
stare into mine and you can hold me captive, do me without askin'
And love me through life
Cause baby we can know where to go
And love me through life
Cause baby we can know it
Cause baby we can know it
I watched a flame around your tongue
You spoke of fire forever young and now I'm burning for it
You got me burning for it
Kiss me again with more red wine
Most lovers stay without goodbye
You got me hurting for it
You got me hurting for it
(You got me hurting, got me burning, now I'm hurting for it)
(You got me burning, got me hurting)
Kiss me again
Love me through life
Cause baby we can know where to go
(Kiss me again ohh)
And love me through life
Cause baby we can know where to go
And love me through life
Cause baby we can know it
