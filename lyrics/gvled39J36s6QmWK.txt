Let's leave this place behind when we finally decide
what it's gonna take to make you feel alive (feel alive).

What's it gonna take to open up your eyes?
to open up your eyes?

It's time to get out of this town
this torture (this torture).
It still holds you down.
Be blessed and move forward silent and sound.

These words don't always come out right,
but I feel that we're wasting time.
Letting go of each other we're still holding tight.
All these words don't always come out right,
but I feel that we're wasting time.
Are we wasting our time?
Are you still holding tight?

It was only fair to look to the sky,
to breathe in the air,
to wait in the shadows.
With empty hands, no sense of pride.
Would you give up if we'd all given up.
'Til the East was ours we drew the lines that divide.
Stapled these badges of pain to our sides.
To our sides.

We've all had our enemies we're leaving the past behind.
I don't feel like I'm losing sleep.
I know you can see it in my eyes.

We've all had our enemies we're leaving the past behind.
I don't feel like I'm losing sleep.
I know you can see it in my eyes.
You can see it in my eyes.
You can see it in my eyes.

These words don't always come out right,
but I feel that we're wasting time.
Letting go of each other we're still holding tight.
All these words don't always come out right,
but I feel that we're wasting time.
Are we wasting our time?
Are you still holding tight?

I'll leave my heart there by your bedside
if you swear that your eyes won't stray.
To be honest, open and hoping.
To find the words to say.

I'll leave my heart there by your bedside
if you swear that your eyes won't stray.
In honesty, honestly I only let go for the sake of you.
