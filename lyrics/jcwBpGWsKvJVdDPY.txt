You should know better
How many times do I have to say to you?
I'm so worth it!
You'll see it
Your house in Miami
Is great but ain't much to me
Jacuzzi and flat screen
Party like on MTV
You've got your BMW convertible
Pay all attention to her
Like she's your favorite girl
I don't know why I keep hanging on
Would you even notice if I was gone?
When you see what you lost
You won't wanna pay the cost
You'll curse it
I'm so worth it
Just shut up! Let me say
Don't throw it all away
We were perfect
I'm so worth it
I'm so worth it
I'm worth it
No Gucci
No Prada
Valentine's Day got nada
My friends say you're trouble
Always some kind of drama
Don't need all that money
Don't need a private jet
Cause when you're with me
All you need is what you get
Can't you see I'm taking this too long
Would you even notice if I was gone?
When you see what you lost
You won't wanna pay the cost
You'll curse it
I'm so worth it
Just shut up! Let me say
Don't throw it all away
We were perfect
I'm so worth it
I'm so worth it
I'm worth it
It's so much better
When we're together
Life's so much richer
And you have me to thank
I'm money in the bank
When you see what you lost
You think of your house in Miami
Jacuzzi and flat screen
Party like on MTV
When you see what you lost
You think of your car and your money
You'll curse
I'm so worth it
I'm worth it
I'm worth it
When you see what you lost
You won't wanna pay the cost
You'll curse it
I'm so worth it
Just shut up! Let me say
Don't throw it all away
We were perfect
I'm so worth it
I'm so worth it
