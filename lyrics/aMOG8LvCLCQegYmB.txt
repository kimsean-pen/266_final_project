wake up baby
the fire is down to smoke
burnt out, strung out
trying not to choke
leaning on a lover
for desire we can't recover
i'm running on the fumes
of us burning up too soon

hanging from the wire
on a line you said to tread
turned round, got shot down
by words you never said
i'm trying not to fight
cause i love the getting high
but the weight of my world
is little more than sky

who do you love?
who do you love?
it's not me your thinking of

just another candle
you can count out in the wind
just another war
that was never raged to win

who do you love?
who do you love?
it's not me your thinking of
