Patience is a virtue
When you live for revenge
Hide your weapons, veil your hate
Seek your foes unguarded and

Slay them!
Behead them!
Oh sweet revenge!
Behold, the axe of judgement falls!
This is war!
So make them suffer!

I share no thought for the dark depths
Where fate made me dwell
My hate has shaped me to perfection
A ruthless executioner

Remember this hate
Was the only thought in my head
When I woke up wounded on the ground
Stabbed in the back
A coward's attack
Curse you!
This means war!

Is I would believe in soul
I would slaughter yours
But fear and agony in your eyes
Will have to do

Slay them!
Behead them!
Oh sweet revenge!
Behold, the axe of judgement falls!
This is war!
So make them suffer!

When the axe of judgement falls
The vindictive one stands tall
When the axe of judgement falls
The vindictive one stands tall

Slay them!
Behead them!
Oh sweet revenge!
Behold, the axe of judgement falls!
This is war!
So make them suffer!

This is war!
Make them suffer!
