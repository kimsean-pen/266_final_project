I am in love with this place
But I fear for it's grace
Shoot for the sky
Opens up like the sea
And the resinous high
Bloodlines and divines
Will my kids see the trees?
Will the glen fall on me?

I was hoping you would walk with me
Down the Aisles of Light gallery
Leave a child with legacy
We lay, we lay, we lay
All day

And when she came
I grabbed her head
And dipped her in the lake
And seldom seen, a side of me
Beneath my feet the earthen shake
I can't calm down
I'm flooding in spring
And swelling from the sound
And I am driftwood found
