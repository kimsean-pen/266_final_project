Blood from a Stone
Booze & Glory
Last update on April 5th 2016
I'm serving my time
I'm serving nine to five
And theres no bars to hold me
But there may as well be
Its a life sentence
No chance of parole
I guess I'm as free as a man can be
Stuck down a hole
We're living for the weekend
But we're dying nine to five
We gave them everything they wanted
But they wanted a fight
We gave them our muscles
But they wanted our souls
I guess they don't know
You can't get blood from a stone
I guess they don't know
You can't get blood from a stone
It's late Friday night
I'm stuck here pulling pint after pint
Waiting for last order's bell to ring
I'd rather be anywhere but here
But I serve your pint with smile and a wink
And I pray for my ship to come in
I guess I don't know
How long I 'll be waiting
