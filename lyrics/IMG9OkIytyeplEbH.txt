It was upon a row of houses
Tight skirts and baggy trousers
Grey men in cheap disguises,
High hopes and higher rises
Who lived a girl who was on a mission
Who lived a boy who was under suspicion
Tried hard to stay beside her
Until the devil put his seed inside her

How?
You know how
Sleep to long and the sand runs out
So close to midnight
Time to fly
Do or die
Stoned in the headlights

Here we lie
High and dry
The world will never see you 'til you open your eyes
Say goodnight
Kill the light
The world will never hear you tonight
Idlewild

For two years he tried to reach her
Worshiped the ground beneath her
She, she was always running
He, he saw the end was coming
But now the story takes a turning
She wakes up and her sheets are burning
Head down against the fire
Now, now, now the table turns

She won't learn
Sleep to long and your bed starts burning
So close to midnight
Idlewild
You don't know it
You never need to

Here we lie
High and dry
The world will never see you 'til you open your eyes
Say goodnight
Kill the light
The world will never hear you tonight
Idlewild
Idlewild

I thought that we were good together
I thought that we could weather the weather
Whether or not the whys, the wherefores
The high hopes were only there because, because,
Because I thought the only thing between us
Was something shallow now a river so deep we see it
Dredge up the wreckage our parents left us
And lay it on the banks to rot and fester
And now I smell it hanging like a death star,
In Gretna Green, Derby, Manchester[?]
I don't want to hear it now

Here we lie
High and dry
The world will never see you 'til you open your eyes
Say goodnight, kill the light
The world will never hear you tonight
Idlewild
Idlewild
Kill the light
Idlewild.
