Shame on me, slap on my wrist
At your door and I'm not proud of it
Yesterday I said "I'm done"
I swung back just like a pendulum

(Ha ha)
Ooh, and the sugar turned bitter
Ooh, and the summer turned to winter
But I still want your love
(Ha ha)
Ooh, they can tell me I'm a sinner
Ooh, but they can't call me a quitter
I won't give you up

Old habits die hard
Every time I say goodbye
I find a way to justify
Running to your arms
Old habits die hard
You'll never wanna change
I wanna correct my brain
You can't help who you are
Old habits die hard

Made a promise, made a pact
With my fingers crossed behind my back
Like a creature you set free
I'll crawl back to you eventually

(Ha ha)
Ooh, and the sugar turned bitter
Ooh, and the summer turned to winter
But I still want your love
(Ha ha)
Ooh, they can tell me I'm a sinner
Ooh, but they can't call me a quitter
I won't give you up

Old habits die hard
Every time I say goodbye
I find a way to justify
Running to your arms
Old habits die hard
You'll never wanna change
I wanna correct my brain
You can't help who you are
Old habits die hard

One more time will it fade away
Too far gone to come back today
Old habits die hard
One more time will it fade away
Too far gone to come back today

Even though they tell me I'll be better alone
You're in my muscle memory and you're in my bones
A world without you is a world I don't wanna know

Old habits die hard
Every time I say goodbye
I find a way to justify
Running to your arms
Old habits die hard
You'll never wanna change
I wanna correct my brain
You can't help who you are
Old habits die hard

One more time will it fade away
Too far gone to come back today
Old habits die hard
One more time will it fade away
Too far gone to come back today
