I was five and he was six
we rode on horses made of sticks.
He wore black and I wore white
he would always win the fight.

Bang Bang
He shot me down
Bang Bang
I hit the ground

Bang Bang
That awful sound
Bang Bang
My baby shot me down.

Seasons came and changed the time
when i grew up i called him mine.
He would always laugh and say
remember when we used to play.

Bang Bang
I shot you down

Bang Bang
You hit the ground
Bang Bang
that awful sound

Bang Bang
I used to shoot you down.

Music played and people sang
just for me the churchbells rang.
Now he's gone
I dont know why.
And till this day
sometimes i cry.
He didn't even say goodbye
he didnt take the time to lie.
Bang Bang
He shot me down
Bang Bang
I hit the ground
Bang Bang
That awful sound
Bang Bang
My baby shot me down.
