I never meant to be the one
Who kept you from the dark
But now I know my wounds are sewn
Because of who you are
I will take this burden on
And become the holy one
But remember I am human
And I'm bound to sing this song
So hear my voice, remind you not to bleed
I am here

Saviour
Will be there
When you are feeling alone, oh
A Saviour
For all that you do
So you live freely
Without their harm

So here I write my lullaby
To all the lonely ones
Remember as you learn to try to be the one you love
So I can take this pen
And teach you how to live
What is left unsaid
The greatest gift I give

So hear my voice
Remind you not to bleed
I am here

Saviour
Will be there
When you are feeling alone, oh
A Saviour
For all that you do
So you live freely
Without their harm
Saviour
Will be there
When you are feeling alone, oh
A Saviour
For all that you do
So you live freely
Without their harm

When I hear your cries
Praying for life
I will be there
When I hear your cries
Praying for life
I will be there
I will fight
I will always be there
I will fight yeah!
