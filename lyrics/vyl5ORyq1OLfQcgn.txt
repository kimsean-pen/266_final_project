So you're lying in your underwear
Oh, in someone else's bed
And the silence is so dangerous
It's a terrible sense of dread

So I have another cigarette
And I just try to forget
How did I end up all alone?
How did we all end up dead? Oh yeah

Sunday morning when the rain begins to fall
I believe I've seen the end of it all, oh yeah
Sunday morning when the rain begins to fall
I've got the cure for it all

And my dirty little secret
Has a wretched little name
In the filthy morning after
I have walked the walk of shame

Oh, and you will be the end of me
As I have been the death of you
And I quite enjoy your suffering
Oh, I want to watch the view, oh yeah

Sunday morning when the rain begins to fall
I believe I've seen the end of it all, oh yeah
Sunday morning when the rain begins to fall
I've got the cure for it all

Are you there when I'm ready to top myself?
Were you there when I'm all, all alone?
Do you even know why I am suffering?
Are you down to your bones?
Are you down to your bones?
Are you down to your bones? Oh yeah

Sunday morning when the rain begins to fall
I believe I've seen the end of it all
Sunday morning when the rain begins to fall
It's the end of the world

I never said I would try for you
I never said I would die for you
I never said I would try for you
I never said I would die for you
