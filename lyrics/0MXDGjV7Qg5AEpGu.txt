In the jungle you can sleep
With the commandments at your feet
Where the devil lays his hand

You don't even need to think
I'm tearin holes without a sink
But I know just where I stand

Lines from the story you put before me
I don't know what to choose
Under the oak tree tin all around me
I don't know what to prove

Yeah she felt you felt like hell

In the jungle you're in the jungle
You're in the jungle that's you
In the jungle you're in the jungle
You're in the jungle

And I'll be waitin for a hit yeah
Ain't gonna seem fair tonight
And I'll keep havin other fits yeah
Because it makes me feel alright
Alright alright ooohhh ooohhh yeah
right ooohhh ooohhh yeah

So if you should need a hand
Write down the address of the land
But I'm runnin out of time

Under the oak tree tin all around me
I don't know what to prove
Lines from the story you put before me
I don't know what to choose
Under the oak tree tin all around me
I don't know what to prove

In the jungle you're in the jungle, in the jungle
I'll tell you when it's time to leave
In the jungle you're in the jungle, in the jungle
I'll tell you when it's time to leave

You're never gonna get clean
In the jungle you're in the jungle, in the jungle
