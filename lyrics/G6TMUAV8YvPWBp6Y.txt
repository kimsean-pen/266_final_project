I never thought that I'd be here
I never thought I'd have short hair
I'll never grow up in my head
Although my heart and soul are dead
Cause in my mind I'm alone
In my mind I belong in New York City

I wanna cry in your hands
I wanna die in your hands
Cause I've hate what I've become
Oh I guess that I'll just run
Cause in my mind I'm alone
In my mind I belong in New York City
