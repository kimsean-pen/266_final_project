When you have balance and sleep through the night
Then you will feel everything is alright
Follow the leader and lead you astray
And when you hear me get out of my way

There is a reason that we're here tonight
Injection of power to get in the fight
Where we go when we go, all you will see
Taking it back, no apology

When you're feeling low and you feel you're out of balance
Out of balance
When there's time to kill, you know you will be out of balance
Out of balance
Out of balance

Now they say nothing that you need to hear
The more that you listen, insanity's clear
Calling them out for their dark, evil ways
Then you will know it's the end of all days

When you're feeling low and you feel you're out of balance
Out of balance
When there's time to kill, you know you will be out of balance
Out of balance

When you're feeling low and you feel you're out of balance
Out of balance
When there's time to kill, you know you will be out of balance
Out of balance
Out of balance

When you're feeling low and you feel you're out of balance
Out of balance
When there's time to kill, you know you will be out of balance
Out of balance

When you're feeling low and you feel you're out of balance
Out of balance
When there's time to kill, you know you will be out of balance
Out of balance
Out of balance
Out of balance
Out of balance
Out of balance
