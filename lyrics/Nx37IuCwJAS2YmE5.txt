Well, that'll be the day
When you say goodbye
Yes, that'll be the day
When you make me cry
You say you gonna leave
You know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die

Well, you give me all your lovin' and your turtle dovin'
All your hugs and kisses and your money too
Well, you know you love me, baby
Still you tell me, maybe
That some day, well, I'll be blue

Well, that'll be the day
When you say goodbye
Yes, that'll be the day
When you make me cry
You say you gonna leave
You know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die

Well, that'll be the day
When you say goodbye
Yes, that'll be the day
When you make me cry
You say you gonna leave
You know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die

Well, when cupid shot his dart
He shot it at your heart
So if we ever part and I leave you
You say you told me an' you told me boldly
That some day, well, I'll be blue

Well, that'll be the day
When you say goodbye
Yes, that'll be the day
When you make me cry
You say you gonna leave
You know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die

Well that'll be the day (Woo ooh)
That'll be the day (Woo ooh)
That'll be the day (Woo ooh)
That'll be the day
