Yeah

I have not come, yeah, to testify
About our bad, bad misfortune
And I ain't here a wonderin' why
But I'll live on and I'll be strong
'Cause it just ain't my cross to bear

I sat down and wrote you a long letter
It was just the other day
Said, sure as the sunrise, baby
Tomorrow I'll be up and on my way
But I'll live on, I'll be strong
'Cause it just ain't my cross to bear, oh no

Oh but I'll live on, I'll be strong
'Cause it just ain't my cross to bear, it's not baby

But in the end, baby
Long towards the end of your road
Don't reach out for me, babe
'Cause I'm not gonna carry your load
But I'll live on and I'll be strong
'Cause it just ain't my cross to bear
