I'm the best bad friend
That you're ever gonna get
Never get too close
Keep a comfortable distance
Always on my own
With that je ne sais effect
Make you blush and bleed
And knock you off your feet

I'm so cold, so cold
Yeah, what do you expect?
Let me down before
Don't ask for my respect
I'm so cold, so cold
No, I ain't got no regrets
No, no

I wear my ice, yeah
I wear my ice around my neck
Like a gold chain
I hold it close over my chest
Yeah, yeah
I'm so cold, so cold
Yeah, what do you expect?
Let me down before
Don't ask for my respect
I wear my ice, yeah
I wear my ice around my neck
No regrets

Blow a molly kiss
Take you higher than the Eiffel
Doors on my whip
Always feeling suicidal
My favorite song is
Your words pressed on a vinyl
But you fucked that up

I'm so cold, so cold
Yeah, what do you expect?
Let me down before
Don't ask for my respect
I'm so cold, so cold
No, I ain't got no regrets
No, no

I wear my ice, yeah
I wear my ice around my neck
Like a gold chain
I hold it close over my chest
Yeah, yeah
I'm so cold, so cold
Yeah, what do you expect?
Let me down before
Don't ask for my respect
I wear my ice, yeah
I wear my ice around my neck
No regrets

So cold, so cold yeah
So cold, so cold yeah
No regrets
So cold, so cold yeah
So cold, so cold
So cold, so cold

I wear my ice, yeah
I wear my ice around my neck
Like a gold chain
I hold it close over my chest
Yeah, yeah
I'm so cold, so cold
Yeah, what do you expect?
Let me down before
Don't ask for my respect
I wear my ice, yeah
I wear my ice around my neck
No regrets
