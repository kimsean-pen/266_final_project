He followed me home again
And his eyes were watering
His eyes were watering
Like a child

I made-believe for him
That my blood was dripping
My blood was dripping into
His mouth

Screaming
Screaming

He cut off my oxygen
And my eyes were watering
As he tore into my skin
Like a lion

I knew it was poison
As he filled me to the brim
And my blood was dripping
Like a lamb

Screaming
Screaming
Screaming

Leave your bedroom light on
I live to watch you undress
And you know that I'm there
As you soak in my stare
With your right arm

Come to me
Come to me
Come
Come to me
