Why is my love so cold?
No more will I pretend
Gasping for air as you're slipping through my fingers
Don't kiss me goodbye, please, don't leave here

I'm dying inside knowing it's my fault
Crying with my fist against the wall
Can't get away, I swear I'm gonna break
I'm paralyzed, I need you now

The smell of sacrifice
Your disappearing whispers
I cannot grasp how my life inside just withers
Don't kiss me goodbye, please, don't leave here

I'm dying inside knowing it's my fault
Crying with my fist against the wall
Can't get away, I swear I'm gonna break
I'm paralyzed, I need you now

I need you
I need you now
I need you

Death before I give dishonor
Death before I disobey
Death before I give dishonor
Death before I disobey
Disobey, disobey

I'm dying inside knowing it's my fault
Crying with my fist against the wall
Can't get away, I swear I'm gonna break
I'm paralyzed, I need you now

I need you now
