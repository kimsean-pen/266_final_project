I don't need no doctor
But I need something to kill the pain
Don't know what I'm after
But the pressure driving me insane

Searching for a differnt ride
Had a funny feeling I can't hide
Hey, Hey, Do the Zombie Stomp
Why can't they just let me be
Alone without the misery
Hey, Hey, Do the Zombie, Zombie Stomp
Hey, Hey, Do the Zombie Stomp
Hey, Hey, Do the Zombie Stomp

Flirting with disaster
Mornign after killing me again
Hiding from the laughter
And the demons dancing round my brain

Always dancing on thin ice
I guess I'll have to pay the price
Hey, Hey, Do the Zombie Stomp
Thinking how it could have been
If I had never let them in
Hey, Hey, Do the Zombie, Zombie Stomp
Hey, Hey, Do the Zombie Stomp
Hey, Hey, Do the Zombie Stomp
Hey, Hey, Do the Zombie Stomp
Hey, Hey, Do the Zombie Stomp

Take me to the doctor
'Cause I feel it coming on again
Don't know where I'm going
'Cause I guess I don't know where I've been

Looking for a different ride
Always dancing on thin ice
Hey, Hey, Do the Zombie Stomp
Thinking how it could have been
If I had never let them in
Hey, Hey, Do the Zombie, Zombie Stomp
Hey, Hey, Do the Zombie Stomp
Hey, Hey, Do the Zombie Stomp
Hey, Hey, Do the Zombie Stomp
Hey, Hey, Do the Zombie Stomp
