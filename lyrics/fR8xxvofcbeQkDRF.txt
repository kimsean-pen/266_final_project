A funny thing
I think that you are wrong now
You sober up
And then you say you're sorry

And i think that you're mistaken
When you say that I'll be taken
Away

I want to (want to)
Figure things out
And i need to (need to)
Be alone for a while
For a while

I know this girl
She often thinks I'm a stranger
And when i'm not
There's still no room for me

What will happen when I'm distant
I don't think that she's resistant
To love

I want to (want to)
Figure things out
And I need to (need to)
Be alone for a while
For a while

My mistake
Was to leave you
With an open door
My heart won't break
I've got so much
Time left to kill
