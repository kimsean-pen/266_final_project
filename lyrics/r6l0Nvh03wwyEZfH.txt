You are the king you are the queen
You are the fire that meets the gasoline
You are the gun, you are the one
We the oh oh oh

You are the king you are the queen
You are the fire that meets the gasoline
You are the gun, you are the one
We the rats, rats, rats, rats

You are the cat, you are the mice
You are the knife and the magical device
You are the rain, we are the sane
We the oh oh oh

You are the king you are the queen
You are the fire that meets the gasoline
You are the gun, you are the one
We the rats, rats, rats, rats

Who are you and who am i
We are distruction in the eyes of a nuclear nation
An island so keen, on the death machine
These arms are execution
The dilution of our lines, through propergander rhymes
Is an illusion which causes confusion
When confused we agree, we're the powers to be

Yeaaahhhhhhh
But it broke me
It just means money
We are the rats of the idiocracy

You are the king you are the queen
You are the fire that meets the gasoline
You are the gun, you are the one
We the rats, rats, rats, rats
We the rats, rats, rats, rats
We the rats, rats, rats, rats
We the rats, rats, rats, rats
We the rats, rats, rats, rats
We the rats, rats, rats, rats
We the rats!
