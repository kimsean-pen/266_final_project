Oh have some heart and hold it to your chest,
We weren't in love, we were too young.
We throw our words around as if they were not gold,
well they are.

Oh maybe someday I will be something more,
Real with arms and legs so I can walk away and stay away forever and some more
some more.

I'll stick around to watch this town fall down to it's knees,
You can pray the day that you hope is coming round real soon.
I will run and stay away in a place that I don't know well of,
You can chose a different song that you will soon love.

Well here are the reasons that hurt me the most.
Call off the search I'm coming home,
People lie once, but not on the third,
Not without reason, not for a girl.

The names will vary, the names they may change,
But the game, the game it stays the same,
Oh love, we want the ones that we will grow to hate, to hate.

It's just so...
so...

I'll stick around to watch this town fall down to it's knees,
You can pray the day that you hope is coming round real soon.
I will run and stay away in a place that I don't know well of,
You can chose a different song that you will soon love.

Oh here are the reasons that hurt me the most,
Call off the search she's coming home.
People lie once, but not on the third,
Not without reason, not for a girl
