I saw the storm felt the wind began to change
I saw the sky rip wide open
I looked away hid my face from the world
Ran away from everything
But now I'm back for more

I heard the sounds saw flashing light
Watched the day turn into night
I heard the sounds saw flashing light
Watched the day turn into night

And through it all
We've been thrown into the fire
We've been lost in the flame
But we will rise from the ashes again
All our heart's have been broken
We've been burned by the flame
But we will rise from the ashes again

She watched the world as it slowly slipped away
Lost all the dreams in the ocean
She sees his face, feels his touch on her hand
Remembers when she had everything

One day she will again
I heard the sounds saw flashing light

Watched the day turn into night
And through it all
We've been thrown into the fire
We've been lost in the flame
But we will rise from the ashes again
All our heart's have been broken
We've been burned by the flame

But we will rise from the ashes again
You are all that I have
Everything that I need
You're the one that I run to

You're everything I believe
You are all that I have
Everything that I need
You're the one that I run to
You're everything I believe

I believe
And through it all
We've been thrown into the fire
We've been lost in the flame
But we will rise from the ashes again
All our heart's have been broken
We've been burned by the flame
But we will rise from the ashes again
