She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind me, but do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said, "I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round"

She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"
No
And mama always told me, "Be careful who you love
Be careful of what you do
The lie becomes the truth"
And...
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and for forty nights, law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand, her schemes and plans
Because we danced on the floor in the round

So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
Oh think twice

She told my baby we danced til three
And she looked at me, then showed a photo
Baby cried, his eyes were like mine, oh no
Because we danced on the floor in the round

People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"
No
But she came and stood right by me with the smell of sweet perfume
It happened much too soon, she called me to her room
And...

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She say's that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

So Billie Jean is not my lover
She just a girl
Billie Jean is not my lover
She just a girl
Billie Jean is not my lover
