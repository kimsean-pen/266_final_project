I'm looking at an angel
And believe me when I say
She got that whole place blowing
She got the whole place blowing
She got that whole place glowing, glowing, glowing...
I'm looking at an angel
And believe me when I say
She got that whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowing
And she's high in the sky singing
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
She got wings
She got a halo
It seems to me so unnatural
Cause that's one thing that I just don't know
What seems to be so incredible
She looked at me
Took me by surprise yeaaahh
As if she took me by the hand to some foreign land
And had me way up
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Singing my song, yeah, yeah
From dust 'til dawn, yeah, yeah
I know you got a lot on your mind
But it won't be long, yeah, yeah
Always get better, yeah, yeah
And I may be wrong, yeah, yeah
Cause I'll never get it across the line
before they make it home, yeah, yeah
Singing my song, yeah, yeah
From dust 'til dawn, yeah, yeah
I know you got a lot on your mind
But it won't be long, yeah, yeah
Always get better, yeah, yeah
And I may be wrong, yeah, yeah
Cause I'll never get it across the line before they make it home, yeah, yeah
I'm looking at an angel
And believe me when I say
She got that whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowing, glowing, glowing...
I'm looking at an angel
And believe me when I say
She got that whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowing
And she's high in the sky singing
