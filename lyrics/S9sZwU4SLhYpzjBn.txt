Every day I'm just surviving
Keep climbing the mountain
Even when I feel like dying
Keep climbing the mountain

Another night I'm barely holding on
One step away from being dead and gone
In my life to die another day
Is this life that I've been living?
All that's meant for me?

Every day I'm just surviving
Keep climbing the mountain
Even when I feel like dying
Keep climbing the mountain

Every time I think I'm over it
I wake up in the bottom of it all again
I'm still surviving
Keep climbing, keep climbing
The mountain

The higher I go the harder I fall
So I don't look down, I don't look back at all
And when I wish it all would turn to black
I try to see the light and push the darkness back

Every day I'm just surviving
Keep climbing the mountain
Even when I feel like dying
Keep climbing the mountain

Every time I think I'm over it
I wake up in the bottom of it all again
I'm still surviving
I keep climbing, I keep climbing
The mountain

So if I'm numb, already too far gone
And if I feel a pulsing, I keep carry on
When I'm lost and want to fade away
I tell myself to live to die another day

Every day I'm just surviving
Keep climbing the mountain
Even when I feel like dying
Keep climbing the mountain

Every time I think I'm over it
I wake up in the bottom of it all again
I'm still alive then
Keep climbing, keep climbing
The mountain
The mountain
