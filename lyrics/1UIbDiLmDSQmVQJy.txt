So what's gonna happen when the old man goes
Will you embrace chaos or take control
When the guns are drawn outside your door
Will you call for peace or will you join the war

What you gonna do when the law breaks in
Will you stand your ground or confess your sins
Oh no no no you don't know
Oh no no no you don't know

Where you gonna hide all the lies you told
Can you buy back any of the soul you sold
When your will is weak and the weight is strong
Where will you go when you can't go on

What's gonna happen on your dying day
Will you turn to dirt or find the pearly gates
Oh no no no you don't know
Oh no no no you don't know

You can beg, you can plead, you can cry, you can pray
But nothing's gonna save you from the tidal wave
You can run, you can hide, you can leave, you can stay
Nothing's gonna save you from the tidal wave
You can beg, you can plead, you can cry, you can pray
Nothing's gonna save you from the tidal wave
You can run, you can hide, you can leave, you can stay
Nothing's gonna save you from the tidal wave

So what's gonna happen when the old man goes
What's gonna happen when the old man goes
Guns are drawn outside your doors
What's gonna happen when the old man goes

What you gonna do when the law breaks in
What you gonna do when the law breaks in
Oh no no no you don't know
Oh no no no you don't know

You can beg, you can plead, you can cry, you can pray
Nothing's gonna save you from the tidal wave
You can run, you can hide, you can leave, you can stay
Nothing's gonna save you from the tidal wave
You can beg, you can plead, you can cry, you can pray
Nothing's gonna save you from the tidal wave
Nothing's gonna save you from the tidal wave
Nothing's gonna save you from the tidal wave
