Calling for the last time
Caught a glimpse of it
Through shifted eyes
Show me through accomplishments recognizing but still there's nothing left
We're caught in between
Before it leaves me
Learning to trust a shaking mind
Simple equations to trace a twisted line
For me much too early
Recognizing but still inadequate
We're caught in between
Before it leaves me
Calling for the last time
Caught a glimpse of it shaping shifting eyes
Learning to trust a shaking mind
Simple equations to form a twisted line
Show me through accomplishments
Recognizing but still there's nothing left
