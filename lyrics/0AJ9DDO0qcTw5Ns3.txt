Heard you laughing
In a crowd outside a restaurant we used to go to
I caught glimpse that stopped me in my tracks
It took me back
You looked happy
With that little girl up on your shoulders, happy
I know where she got those crystal eyes of blue
Time's been sweet to you

As bad as it was
As bad as it hurts
I think God I didn't get what thought that I deserved
Sometimes life leads down a different road
When you're holding on the someone that you gotta let go
Someday you'll see the reason why
Sometimes, yeah sometimes
There's good in goodbye

I don't regret it
The time we had together
I won't forget it
But we both ended up where we belong
I guess goodbye made us strong

And yeah I'm happy
I found somebody too who makes me happy
And I knew one day I'd see you on the street
And it'd be bittersweet

But as bad as it was
As bad as it hurts
I thank God I didn't get what thought that I deserved
Sometimes life leads down a different road
When you're holding on the someone that you gotta let go
Someday you'll see the reason why
Yeah sometimes, yeah sometimes
There's good in goodbye

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

As bad as it was
Yeah as bad as it hurt
I think God I didn't get what thought that I deserved
Sometimes life leads down a different road
When you're holding on the someone that you've got to let go
Someday you'll see the reason why
Yeah, someday you'll see the reason why
There's good in goodbye

Yeah, yeah

There's good in goodbye
Mmhh, mmhh
