I'm lost, soul was tryna find a way
To you, being someone since you tempted me
So shock, the way that I feel
Oh, it's got to be for real

Suffocated love, I need to escape
I can barely breathe, understand these days
I need you to take me, before I fade away

For you I will fall, for you I will lose it all
For you great or small, dearly beloved
Anything that you want, anything that you want

Dearly beloved, dearly beloved
Dearly beloved, dearly beloved
Dearly beloved, dearly beloved
Dearly beloved, dearly beloved

... what you want
With me, been so tough every day that you're gone
While I bite, the way that I feel
Oh, it's gotta be for real

Suffocated love, I need to escape
I can barely breathe, standing in the space
I need you to take me, before I fade away

For you I will fall, for you I will lose it all
For you great or small, dearly beloved
Anything that you want, anything that you want

I will make it through
Because I would rather drown in a sea of you
Than to drift away in the empty truth

Dearly beloved, dearly beloved
Dearly beloved, dearly beloved
Dearly beloved, dearly beloved
Dearly beloved, dearly beloved
Dearly beloved, dearly beloved

For you I will fall
(dearly beloved, dearly beloved)
(dearly beloved, dearly beloved)
For you I would lose it all
(dearly beloved, dearly beloved)
(dearly beloved, dearly beloved)
For you, way too small
(dearly beloved, dearly beloved)
(dearly beloved, dearly beloved)
Didn't even love me, anything that you want
(dearly beloved, dearly beloved)
(dearly beloved, dearly beloved)
For you
(dearly beloved, dearly beloved)
(dearly beloved, dearly beloved)
(for you) Anything that you want
(dearly beloved, dearly beloved)
(dearly beloved, dearly beloved)
Anything that you want, anything that you want
