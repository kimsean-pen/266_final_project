I get up, and nothing gets me down
You got it tough, I've seen the toughest around
And I know, baby just how you feel
You've got to roll with the punches to get to what's real

Oh, can't you see me standin' here?
I got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Oh, can't ya see what I mean?

Might as well jump (Jump!)
Might as well jump
Go ahead and jump (Jump!)
Go ahead and jump

Oh, oh! Hey you!
Who said that?
Baby, how you been?
You say you don't know
You won't know until we begin

Oh, can't you see me standing here?
I got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Oh, can't ya see what I mean?

Ah yeah, might as well jump (Jump!)
Might as well jump
Go ahead and jump (Jump!)
Go ahead and jump

Ahhh...
Hey...
Jump!

Jump, yeah...
Might as well jump (Jump!)
Might as well jump
Go ahead and jump (Jump!)
Hey, hey, yeah
Go ahead and jump

Jump, jump, jump...
Jump!
