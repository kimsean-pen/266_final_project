It's too good, it's too nice
She makes me finish too quick
Is it love? No, not love
She turns my sexual trick
She says she's mine
I know she lies
First, I scream
Then I cry
Take a second of me
You beckon, I bleed
She suffocates me
She suffocates me with suggestion
I ask, do you feel the same?
And later on, maybe
I'll tell you my real name
She's so good
She's so bad
You understand
I can't stand
Now I could just kill a man
She's on her knees
I say please
