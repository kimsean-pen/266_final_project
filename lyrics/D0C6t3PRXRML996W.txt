Oh

Posted in the front seat of my Maybach
No where to go
Ready to do whatever's clever
Put on a show
Don't really matter, we can chop chop chop it up
We can get it poppin even thump in the parkin lot

Whatever you like, I'm on the same side
We can go the distance homie
Cause I'm always neutral
Give me the green light
Be there in no time
Play the right position
Baby you can have it all

Put the pedal to the metal
Roll out with my shades low
Get some of that ol you know, good ol, good ol
Kick back and roll down the window
And just let the wind blow
Get high off that ol you know, good ol' good ol'
We'll beat the traffic
And I know all the back streets
We can take the alleys baby there's no hurry
Put the pedal to the metal
Roll out with my shades low
Get some of that ol good ol, good ol

Baby boy right here I got the power
So what's the show
It'll keep you goin after hours
Stuck in a zone
What I got right here will make the boys hallucinate
Have you braggin, ecstatic
No one can duplicate

Whatever you like, I'm on the same side
We can go the distance homie
Cause I'm always neutral
Give me the green light
Be there in no time
Play the right position
Baby you can have it all

Put the pedal to the metal
Roll out with my shades low
Get some of that ol you know, good ol, good ol
Kick back and roll down the window
And just let the wind blow
Get high off that ol you know, good ol' good ol'
We'll beat the traffic
And I know all the back streets
We can take the alleys baby there's no hurry
Put the pedal to the metal
Roll out with my shades low
Get some of that ol good ol, good ol

We can uh uh uh, let the speakers bump,
keep it on the hush, this don't need to rush
We can uh uh uh, let the speakers bump,
keep it on the hush, this don't need to rush
We can uh uh uh, let the speakers bump,
keep it on the hush, this don't need to rush
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce with me

Put the pedal to the metal
Roll out with my shades low
Get some of that ol you know, good ol, good ol
Kick back and roll down the window
And just let the wind blow
Get high off that ol you know, good ol' good ol'
We'll beat the traffic
And I know all the back streets
We can take the alleys baby there's no hurry
Put the pedal to the metal
Roll out with my shades low
Get some of that ol good ol, good ol
