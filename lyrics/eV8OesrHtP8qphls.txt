The night come
The weathered.
And i prefer.we arrive
And i prefer.she took all night
The stunned on is funned on
You're findin in another bed

I.bed in the side
And i prefer her when she took all night
And you are only.

Chorus:
I'll find you you are over
I'll hold you when i.
When you're waiting for the.
Are breaking the .
You're waiting for the.
And now you're breaking the.
I'll find you.

And i prefer.in your eyes
Then i prefer her when she took all night
And stunned on, and stunned on
Oh white oh by in the side
And i prefer her 'cause she took all night
And you are more than.

[chorus:]

And leave your.
So you want ever more
So leave your.tonight
So he will never know

[2 x chorus:]
