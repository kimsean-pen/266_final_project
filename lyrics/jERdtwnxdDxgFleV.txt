Focus those eyes on me
I need to see you for who you are
The guilt makes me hesitant
I never meant to put this on you

(Pressure)

I thought I made it clear (I'm good for nothing)
Stay far away from here (Pressure on, pressure on the wound)
I wish you'd disappear (I'm good for nothing)
And stay far away from here

(Pressure)

Don't look so surprised baby
Remove me from your hopes and dreams
This heart wasn't meant to feel
I told you I'd hurt less without you

Hold me, feel my despair for love
Please be happy I'm giving up

I thought I made it clear (I'm good for nothing)
Stay far away from here (Pressure on, pressure on the wound)
I wish you'd disappear (I'm good for nothing)
And stay far away from here

I'm lost in the ocean
There's no light house in sight
Can't explain this emotion
Bring me back to life

I thought I made it clear (I'm good for nothing)
Stay far away from here (Pressure on, pressure on the wound)
I wish you'd disappear (I'm good for nothing)
And stay far away from here

Hold me, feel my despair for love (Pressure on, pressure on the wound)
Please be happy I'm giving up

(Pressure)
