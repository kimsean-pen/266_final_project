Forgive me now my heart, it don't know were to start
My ceilings fell apart
I've been down on the regular, I've seen things with my retina
These old days I don't feel that much

But darling when you smile it's like the rain dries out
Now there's no more room for clouds
Got me singing Hallelu, oh Hallelu oh
When you hold my hand it just reminds me of
There's still cool people in the world

Here me far away, I'm done with yesterday
I'm living for today
So now I've been good on the regular
I've seen things even clearer
These new days I've lived it up
Up

Cause darling when you smile it's like the rain dries out
Now there's no more room for clouds
Got me singing Hallelu, ah Hallelu oh
When you hold my hand it just reminds me of
There's still cool people in the world

Thought I've never love, love like this before
I let go then I run and we run with the rivers
You helped me fly, you give me life

Cause darling when you smile it's like the rain dries out
Now there's no more room for clouds
Got me singing Hallelu, ah Hallelu oh
When you hold my hand it just reminds me of,
There's still cool people in the world
