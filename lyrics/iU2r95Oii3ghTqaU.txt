Oh, oyy
Yeah, yeah

Baby, I know when we started out
There were things you didn't know
But, baby girl, we got a lotta things we need to discuss
I know I'm asking for a lot, but just trust

You say that things gettin' old
Sneakin' 'round creepin' and love on the low
But, baby girl, l I can't wait till it's officially us
I can't wait to let them know about us

First I thought that I could take you, boy, but I don't know
You told me you were gonna leave her for me long ago
Eventually I will but I just gotta take it slow
Don't wanna break her heart, although I gotta let her go
So, baby

So please don't say you wanna give up
How do I tell her that I'm falling in love
And I know you're waiting patiently for that day
When we no longer have to lie about us

When I'm with her all I want is your touch
And when you call me, I don't wanna hang up
And I know I say it often but I can't wait
Till we no longer have to lie about us

Baby, I know situation don't seem fair to us both
But baby girl, she's an issue that I'm 'bout to adjust
Don't mistake, our love is meant for just us
You are my soul, mind, body, spirit all that I know

But, baby girl, I can't wait till it's officially us
I can't wait to tell the world about us
First I thought that I could take you, boy, but I don't know
You told you were gonna leave her for me long ago

Eventually I will but I just gotta take it slow
Don't wanna break her heart although, I gotta let her go
So baby

So please don't say you wanna give up
How do I tell her that I'm falling in love
And I know you're waiting patiently for that day
When we no longer have to lie about us

When I'm with her all I want is your touch
And when you call me I don't wanna hang up
And I know I said it often but I can't wait
Till we no longer have to lie about us

Baby, won't you wait just a little bit
Just a little bit, just a little bit longer, longer
Just a little bit, just a little bit
Just a little bit longer longer

Won't you wait just a little bit
Just a little bit, just a little bit longer longer
Just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit longer

Baby, so please don't say you wanna give up
