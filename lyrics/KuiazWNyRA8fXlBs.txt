I feel like I've been locked in tight
For a century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone to release me
Thinking of rain blowing kisses my way
That don't mean I'm gonna hear what you say
Baby, baby

Oh, woah, woah
(My mind is saying let's go)
Oh, woah, woah
(But my heart is saying no)

If you wanna be with me
Baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta ask me the right way
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression
I gotta like what you do

I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Gotta catch me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out

The music's fading and the lights down low
Just one more dance and then we're good to go
Waiting for someone who gets me
My heart is racing at the speed of light
Let's go and have a little fun tonight
Baby, baby

Oh, woah, woah
(My mind is saying let's go)
Oh, woah, woah
(But my heart is saying no)

If you wanna be with me
Baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta ask me the right way
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
Just come and set me free, baby
And I'll be with you

I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Gotta catch me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Gotta catch me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out

Oh, woah, woah
My mind is saying let's go
Oh woah, woah
But my heart is saying no

If you wanna be with me
Baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta ask me the right way
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
Just come and set me free, baby
And I'll be with you
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Gotta catch me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Gotta catch me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
