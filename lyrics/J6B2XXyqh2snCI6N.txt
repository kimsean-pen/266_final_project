Lucy's underground
She's got a mouth to feed
Am I underground,
Or am I in between?

Lucy's underground
She's got a mouse to feed
Am I underground,
Or am I in too deep?

Show me love
Who's got your hand on the button now
Showin' love
You've got your hand on the button now

Lucy's underground
She's never coming back
Am I still alive
Or has the life gone bad

Take me underground
Take me all the way
Bring me to the fire
Throw me in the flames

So show me love
You've got your hands on the button now
Showin' love
You've got your hand on the button now
I'd rather die
I'd rather die
Than to be with you
