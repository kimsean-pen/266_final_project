We scan the empty sky always without success
We're lighting signal fires and spelling SOS
We stare at broken clocks, the truth comes twice a day
While every second just slips away

Are you going to wait here for a sign to let you know now?
Are you going to sit there paralyzed by what you've seen?
Or are you going to finally grip the wheel?
(I think you know how)
Is this more than you expected it to be?
Don't wait for a miracle to tumble from the sky
To part the seas around you or turn water into wine
Don't wait for a miracle, the world is passing by
The walls that all surround you are only in your mind

The stage is set and the curtains pulled
Ready or not, it's time, on with the show
Now the crowds have grown impatient
And the train has left the station
And the candles you are lighting in the dark will fade away

So what are you waiting for?
A sign to let you know now?
Are you gonna sit there paralyzed by what you've seen?
Are you going to finally grip the wheel?
(I think you know how)
Are you gonna throw it all away?
Don't wait for a miracle to tumble from the sky
To part the seas around you or turn water into wine
Don't wait for a miracle the world is passing by
The walls that all surround you are only in your mind

When the weight we carry breaks us
We're tempted to stay down but every road to recovery
Starts at the breakdown

But we don't need miracles to tumble from the sky
To part the seas around us or turn water into wine
Because we are the miracles, we happen all time
We're not scared of what surrounds us
We're not waiting for a sign
We are the miracles
