Be the greatest man in history
The greatest man that you can be
Just be

Walk, walk out on the beach with me
Walk out in the sea with me
Just be

All of the time you show me your love
Sweet love
And oh, how you know
This sweet love

Nights, cold nights wrapped in ecstasy
Those times still perplexing be
They just be

All of the time you show me your love
Sweet love
And oh, how you know
This sweet love

All of the time you show me your love
Sweet love
And oh, how you know
This sweet love, this sweet love
This sweet love, this sweet love
