Lately things are on my mind
Good news is hard to find
And I work on the factory line
And all I do is stay behind

Call my mama like I should
She says daddy ain't doin' too good
Me and him should wet a line
Just can't seem to find the time

But I love my life
Man it's somethin' to see
It's the kids and the dogs and you and me
It's the way it's alright

Everything goes wrong
It's a sound of a slow simple song
Finally saved some money up
'Til I had to fix my truck

Talked to brother the other day
He didn't have too much to say
Tryna quit these cigarettes
I can't seem to kick 'em yet

Sister got laid off last fall
And I got high cholesterol
But I love my life
Man it's somethin' to see

It's the kids and the dogs and you and me
It's the way, it's alright
And everything goes wrong
It's a sound of a slow simple song

Yeah, I love my life
Man it's somethin' to see
It's the kids and the dogs and you and me
It's the way, it's alright
And everything goes wrong
It's the sound of a slow simple song
