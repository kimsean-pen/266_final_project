You eyes are like a blue sky, blue sky, blue
You're floating in the fountain, in the fountain of youth
I bet you have an ocean, secret little potion
I bet you have a lover who's as fine as you
Hey Mr. Love, Mr. Big Love, Big Love
Hey nana hey nana
Hey nana hey nana
Hey nana hey nana
Hey nana hey hey
I've got a little secret too, I've got a mad little crush on you
I wonder if you notice, wonder if you see
I wonder if you ever want to dance with me
We shall never talk about such things, such things

555-7172 now 555-7172
And oh, before you go, before you go
Let me just take one last glance love
Oh, before you go, before you go
Could you tell me what's my chance love
High, low
High, low
Somewhere in the middle find a good little soul
High, low
High, low
I can bat my eyes like a heidi-ho
I've got a twinkle in my eye
Come baby, come dry my eyes
Are you gone to hold me, are you gone to see
Sweet daddy are you ever gone to marry me
Hey Mr. Love, Mr. Big Love, Big Love
