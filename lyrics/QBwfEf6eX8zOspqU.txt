Everything you've owned is gone
Everything you know is wrong
Everyone you've loved has left
Everything you've touched is dead

Everyone you know is gone
Everything you've touched, gone wrong
Take my hand, raise up underground
Listen well, follow the sound
(Chains moving along link our legs)??
Never quite knowing where to stay and rest for awhile

When you're underwater whisper
Wait for all the sounds to fall away
When you're underwater (insert your feet on the wall of things)??
