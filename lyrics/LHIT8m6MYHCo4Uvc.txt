Medicated, guarded, jaded
Promise baby, I'll be worth the ride
Warm heart, cold blood
Soft touch, tough love
Burned down, fucked up
Just the way you like
There's something in my nature
It seems to rise an angel
You got a taste for danger
Don't know why
And I don't want to hurt you
I want your hands all over
But do you know how to handle me cause I
I got, I got thorns
Wear them like a crown, yeah

That's what you get when you pick a rose
That's what you get when you pick a rose
Thorns

Easy to love but I'm hard to hold
Thorns

Ain't no daisy
You want safety
