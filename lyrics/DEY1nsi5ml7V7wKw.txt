Back in 1870 just beneath the Great White Way
Alfred Beach worked secretly
Risking all to ride a dream
His wind-machine
His wind-machine

New York City and the morning sun
Were awoken by the strangest sound
Reportedly as far as Washington
The tremors shook the earth as Alfie
Blew underground
Blew underground
He blew underground, yeah

Ahh
All aboard sub-rosa subway
Had you wondered who's been digging under Broadway?
It's Alfred
It's Alfred
It's Alfred
Poor Al, woh no Al

As for America's first subway
The public scoffed, "It's far too rude"
One station filled with Victoria's age
From frescoed walls and goldfish fountains...
To Brahmsian tunes
