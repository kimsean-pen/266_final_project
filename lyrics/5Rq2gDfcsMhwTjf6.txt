Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you now
You've got someone to blame?

You said
One love
One life
When it's one need
In the night
One love, we get to share it
It leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it

Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

Well it's
Too late
Tonight
To drag the past out
Into the light
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other
Carry each other
One

Have you come here for forgivness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?

Did I ask too much?
More than a lot?
You gave me nothing, now
It's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other, and we're doin' it again

You said love is a temple
Love the higher law
Love is a temple
Love the higher law
You ask me to enter
But then you make me crawl
And I can't be holdin' on
To what you've got
When all you've got is hurt

One love
One blood
One life
You've got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sister
Brothers
One life, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other
Carry each other
One
One
One
One
