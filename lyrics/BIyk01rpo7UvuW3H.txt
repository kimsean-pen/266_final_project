Story of my life
Well high school seemed like such a blur

I didn't have much interest in sports or school elections
And in class I dreamed all day 'bout a rock 'n' roll weekend
And the girl at the front of the room
So close yet so far you know she never seemed to notice

That this silly schoolboy crush wasn't just pretend
Life goes by so fast
You only wanna do what you think is right
Close your eyes and it's past

Story of my life
Story of my life
Story of my life
The story of my life

And I went down to my old neighbourhood
The faces have all changed, there's no one left to talk to
And the pool hall I loved as a kid is now a 7-11
And I went downtown to look for a job

I had no training, no experience to speak of
And I looked at the holes in my jeans
And I turned and headed back
Life goes by so fast
You only wanna do what you think is right

Close your eyes and it's past

Story of my life
Story of my life
Story of my life

Yeah good times come and good times go
I only wish the good times would last a little longer
I think about the good times we had
And why they had to end
So I sit at the edge of my bed
I strum my guitar and I sing an outlaw love song
Thinkin' 'bout what you're doin' now
And when you're coming back
Life goes by so fast
You only wanna do what you think is right
Close your eyes and it's past
Story of my life
Story of my life
Story of my life
Story of my life
The story of my life
