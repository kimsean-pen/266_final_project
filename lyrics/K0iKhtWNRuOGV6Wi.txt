Walden robe on setting sun
Take a spark from where we've come
I don't want to see this love
Become a memory

Broken wings don't let me fall
Just the back seat of this car
And as our distance goes apart
I hope that you'll wait for me

In quiet trees and power runs
Always in and toss my mind
I fear it's not enough this time
To stop from wondering

If things will ever go our way
And I can't seem to stay in place
We belong if that makes us change
It's not for nothing

The story bites and the moon it scores
I think I got it back this time
Stated up looking for some sun
I don't know

Know at times we lose our way
Moments closer every day
And just a little past the haze
It's not for nothing
