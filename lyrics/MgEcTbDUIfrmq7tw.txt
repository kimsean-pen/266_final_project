My tears were flowing down to the ground
A sad stream of silver is a mournin' man's gold
And where the seeds of sorrow soon were found
A flower of light, the omen saw the world

Step into the dreams of wonder
Open up the gates of wonder
Stare into the face of wonder
Free yourself from the spell you're under now!

I blessed the sign yes my prayers were heard
I laughed as I watched that tiny thing grow
Over the rainbow and up to the stars
A tower of dreams, waiting to come true

I saw this divine gate between the worlds
Waiting for me to take away my soul
I was no longer what I wasbefore
A chosen one that opened up the door
