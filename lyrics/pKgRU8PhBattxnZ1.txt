you can't be right
you're full of prejudice and spite
you think you've got me pegged but you're wrong
out of my way
there is a consequence to pay
you think you've got me pegged but you're wrong

I am someone who'll burn the whole world down
I'm the one to bring it right around

you're giving up on me
but what else have you got

you're losing sight
I won't give up without a fight
you think you've got me pegged but you're wrong
I'm not afraid
I'll take the chance I have to take
you think you've got me pegged but you're wrong

you can't expect the world to bend to you
you only feed the fire of anger and our disbelief

I can't be everything to everyone
and I can't be everything you think that I should be
