Got a lotta heart ache
He's a fuckin' weasel
His issues make my mind ache
Wanna make a deal
'Cause I love your little motions
You do with your pigtails
What a nice creation
Worth another night in jail
He's a player, diarrhea giver
Tried to grow his hair out, friends were listening to slayer
I'd like to find him friday night
Hanging out with mom, trying on his father's tights
Life just sucks, I lost the one
I'm giving up, she found someone
There's plenty more
Girls are such a drag
So all you little ladies
Be sure to choose the right guys
You'll come back to me maybe
I'll shower you with lies
Got a lotta heart ache
He's a fuckin' weasel
Decisions make my mind ache
Wanna make a deal
Ease away the problems and the pain
The girl chose the guy that makes you wanna kick and scream
All along, you wish that she would stay
Fuck the guy that took and ran away
He's a player, diarrhea giver
Tried to grow his hair out, friends were listening to slayer
I'd like to find him friday night
Hanging out with mom and trying on his father's tights
Life just sucks, I lost the one
I'm giving up, she found someone
There's plenty more
Girls are such a drag
Fuck this place, I lost the war
I hate you all, your mom's a whore
Where's my dog?
'Cause girls are such a drag
