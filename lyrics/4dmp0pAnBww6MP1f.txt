Told you sometimes I see things that others won't believe
Fold 'em let 'em hit me raise it baby can't you see
That all of it's illusion the conclusion soon will be
So let out your inner animals and celebrate with me

All the thoughts that run to my head gonna dance till my eyes go black
All the thoughts that run to my head gonna dance till my eyes go black
All if I'm gonna give it my all gonna give it till I can't go back
All the thoughts that run to my head gonna dance till my eyes go black

Will you take me
Out into the light where I can finally see
Shine your light with me and chase all the dark away
Shine your light with me and chase all the dark away

This is how you make yourself do what you wanna be
Keep your hands unfolded [inaudible] golden take it by the lead
You're a cut above the masses you're a king you must believe
So shine a light into the dark and then you'll finally see

All the thoughts that run to my head gonna dance till my eyes go black
All the thoughts that run to my head gonna dance till my eyes go black
All if I'm gonna give it my all gonna give it till I can't go back
All the thoughts that run to my head gonna dance till my eyes go black

Will you take me
Out into the light where I can finally see
Shine your light with me and chase all the dark away
Shine your light with me and chase all the dark away

What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting?
What are - what are - what are you waiting for?

All of this illusion all-all-all of this illusion
Go let out your inner animals and celebrate with me

Will you take me
Out into the light where I can finally see
Shine your light with me and chase all the dark away
Shine your light with me and chase all the dark away
Shine your light with me and chase all the dark away
