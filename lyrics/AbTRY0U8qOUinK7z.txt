Tell me are you better, now you put your life on hold
I can't make it better, cos the stories getting old
And you took the only part of me, made it into misery
Now I'm left there cold, while the stories getting old

Though I'm
Done done done done done done done done done done done done done done done
And even though I'm not
Sold sold sold sold sold sold sold sold sold sold sold sold sold sold
Your always laying
Low low low low low low low low low low low low low low low
I got to let you
Go go go go go go go go go go go go go go

And did you get a new me or something not quite the same
I know it's been months but I hope this will sit in vein
And the million times I'm told that my stories getting old
But tell me are you better?
Now your new life starts to unfolds

Though I'm
Done done done done done done done done done done done done done done done
And even though I'm not
Sold sold sold sold sold sold sold sold sold sold sold sold sold sold
Your always laying
Low low low low low low low low low low low low low low low
I got to let you
Go go go go go go go go go go go go go go

I no I, sort of pushed you away
But even if I hadnt have done
I doubt you would have stayed
You think I say these words
And a match will lead away
But then he won't make it better on any note he plays

Though I'm
Done done done done done done done done done done done done done done done
And even though I'm not
Sold sold sold sold sold sold sold sold sold sold sold sold sold sold
Your always laying
Low low low low low low low low low low low low low low low
I got to let you
Go go go go go go go go go go go go go go
