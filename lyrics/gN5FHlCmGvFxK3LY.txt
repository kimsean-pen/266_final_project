What if I did not love you?
Where wiould that leave me
Would I wander through the avenues?
Under a pall of misery?

(Verse)
Would I be face down in a gutter?
With cheap whiskey on my breath?
The lonely life of a writer
Who's words could not pay his debts

Singing please don't, please don't pass me by
I am alive, oh can't you see?
That I've been blinded completely
Please don't, please don't pass me by
I am alive, oh can't you see?
That I am pleading for your mercy

(Verse)
What if we became strangers?
Would you notice my face in a crowd?
And you could you hear the sorrow in my voice?
Helplessly crying your name out loud

(Verse)
Would I be searching for a savior?
Burned, and burning with regret
The lonely life of a writer
With one last desperate request

Singing please don't, please don't pass me by
I am alive, oh can't you see?
That I've been blinded completely
Please don't, please don't pass me by
I am alive, oh can't you see?
That I am pleading for your mercy

(Bridge)
I've been on the lam
Being hunted, so confused
They say time and tide it waits for no man
But I was just hoping
These storm filled skies would clear

Please don't, please don't pass me by
Please don't, please don't pass me by
Please don't, please don't pass me by
I am alive, oh can't you see?
That I am pleading for your mercy
