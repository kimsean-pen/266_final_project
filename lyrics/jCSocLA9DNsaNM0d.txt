Can you see me?
'Cause I'm right here
Can you listen?
'Cause I've been trying to make you notice
What it would mean to me
To feel like somebody
We've been on our way to nowhere
Trying so hard to get there

And I say, oh!
We're gonna let it show
We're gonna just let go of everything
Holding back our dreams
And try, to make it come alive
Come on, let it shine so they can see
We were meant to be
Somebody (somebody)
Somebody, yeah (somebody)
Somehow
Someday
Someway
Somebody

I'm so tired, of being invisible
But I feel it, yeah
Like a fire below the surface
Trying to set me free
Burning inside of me
'Cause we're standing on the edge now
It's a long way down

But I say, oh!
We're gonna let it show (let it show)
We're gonna just let go of everything
Holding back our dreams
And try, to make it come alive
Come on, let it shine so they can see
We were meant to be
Somebody (somebody)
Somebody, yeah (somebody)
Somehow
Someday
Someway

Somebody

We will walk out of this darkness

Feel the spotlight glowing, like a yellow sun
Oh-oh-oh (oh-oh-oh)

And when we fall, we fall together
Till we get back up and we will rise as one
Oh-oh-oh

Oh!
We're gonna let it show (let it show)
We're gonna just let go of everything
Holding back our dreams
And try, to make it come alive (make it come alive)
Come on, let it shine so they can see
We were meant to be
Somebody (somebody)
Somebody, yeah (somebody)
Somehow
Someday
Someway
Somebody

Somebody
Ooh, ooh, oh
