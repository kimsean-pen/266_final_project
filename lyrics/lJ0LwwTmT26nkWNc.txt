Now you know why, now you know
You don't know
Now you know why, now you know
You don't know

Now you know why, now you know
You don't know
Listen, listen, come, come, come
Now you know why, now you know

You don't know

Now you know why, now you know

You don't know

Now you know why, now you know

You don't know

Listen, listen, come, come, come
We've walked and drawn our lines

We've put our weapons down

No vision's turned to gold

And now we're blacking out

(Now we're blacking out)

So we pull our feet through the gravel and stone

And the season starts it's gonna be unknown

Be unknown

Imagine we are higher than the sparrows

Casually we're breathings with the Pharaohs
Tragically we fall just like the arrows
You will hear our voices echo
We, we are the hearts

We'll never be part of the soul

We are the hearts

Forever singing oh, oh, oh, oh

we are the hearts

And the future won't spill our bones

We are the hearts

Forever singing oh, oh, oho

Now you know why, now you know

You don't know

Now you know why, now you know

You don't know
So we are the hearts
Now you know why, now you know
You don't know

Listen, listen, come, come, come
We're dancing through the smoke
And we don't mind the flames
Now we've become the ghosts

That you know by name
High, high, high, high
Imagine we are higher than the sparrows
Casually we're breathings with the Pharaohs

Tragically we fall just like the arrows
You will hear our voices echo
we are the hearts
We'll never part of the soul

we are the hearts
Forever singing oh, oh, oh, oh
we are the hearts
And the future won't spill our bones
we are the hearts
Forever singing oh, oh, oho
Now you know why, now you know
You don't know
Now you know why, now you know
You don't know
Listen, listen, come, come, come
Now you know why, now you know
You don't know
Now you know why, now you know
You don't know
Now you know why, now you know
You don't know
Listen, listen, come, come, come
Now you know why, now you know
You don't know
Now you know why, now you know
You don't know
Now you know why, now you know
You don't know
Listen, listen, come, come, come
Now you know why, now you know
You don't know
Now you know why, now you know
You don't know
Now you know why, now you know
You don't know
Listen, listen, come, come, come
we are the hearts
And the future won't spill our bones
we are the hearts
Forever singing oh, oh, oh, oh
