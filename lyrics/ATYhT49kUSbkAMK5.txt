My friends come with me to candyland
I'll take you look round all the clowns
They're selling what you need
Just trust what I say
You know it's all lies anyway
It's wrong
Oh it's wrong, get it

All smiles D.J.T
War dogs on the street
The land of the free
One nation under fraud

Why won't you leave us alone

Forget about it
Ignorance is bliss
Just leave the thinking to us
Right now
