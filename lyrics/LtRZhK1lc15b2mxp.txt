"Tomorrow will be worse"

I heard her say as she closed the curtains
And walked away

Tied on the bed by hands of the past
Memories too painful to be opened
My body crushed and burned from escaping life
The sleep will come, with horrors of you...

New moon, would you open the gates
and take me away from this night
New moon, between the curtains
Walk me away on your silvery bridge
New moon, lay your mercy on me tonight

The despair of morning sun, beams of unholy light
No one can read the signs of these eyes
The prayer of escape, I will never heal

The flames on my skin to wash all bad away
Was unpurifying kiss of suffering

But I judge myself to give it all away, for you...

New moon, would you open the gates
and take me away from this night
New moon, between the curtains
Walk me away on your silvery bridge
New moon, lay your mercy on me tonight
