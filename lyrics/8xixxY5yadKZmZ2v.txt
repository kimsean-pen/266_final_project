Wash off your sins
Bound by the burden
Of the grief that's found within
Drown in a sea of sorrow
Bound to learn to swim
Wash off your sins

Since you were born
- of a broken soul
You never would endure
Shaped by the hands of fate
That always felt unsure
Since you were born

In your eyes, I
Could see a longing for the truth
You are burning within

And within, you are yearning
For eternal life
Longing for a sacrifice
Waiting for the end of time
As the cards unfold

Under the cross
- relations of a narcissist in mind
Harbored resentment
For the joys of human kind
Under the cross

Wake up
And put out the thorns
From your heart
Wake up
Or sleep with the tide

And within, you are yearning
For eternal life
Longing for a sacrifice
Waiting for the end of time
As the cards unfold

Words
Hard to forgive
When we fall
From grace
