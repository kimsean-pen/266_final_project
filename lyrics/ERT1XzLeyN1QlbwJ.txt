Death surrounds
My heartbeat's slowing down
I won't take this world's abuse

I won't give up, I refuse
This is how it feels when you're bent and broken
This is how it feels when your dignity's stolen

When everything you love is leaving
You hold on to what you believe in
(The last thing I heard was you whispering goodbye
And then I heard you flat line)

No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna stand and fight forever

(Don't close your eyes)

No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna fight for us together
No, we're not gonna die tonight

Break their hold

'Cause I won't be controlled

They can't keep their chains on me
When the truth has set me free
This is how it feels when you take your life back

This is how it feels when you finally fight back
When life pushes me I push harder

What doesn't kill me makes me stronger
(The last thing I heard was you whispering goodbye
And then I heard you flat line)
No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna stand and fight forever
(Don't close your eyes)
No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna fight for us together
No, we're not gonna die tonight
Don't you give up on me
You're everything I need
This is how it feels when you take your life back
This is how it feels when you fight back
No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna stand and fight forever
(Don't close your eyes)
No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna fight for us together
No, we're not gonna die tonight
No, we're not gonna die tonight
Not gonna die
(Not gonna die)
Not gonna die
(Not gonna die)
Not gonna die tonight
