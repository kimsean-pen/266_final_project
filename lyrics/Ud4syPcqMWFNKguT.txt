are you famous 'cause you're friends
or vice versa?
it depends on where you're standing
I can't tell from where I'm standing now

they always say be yourself
as if I could be someone else
someone I'd rather be
if I were you would you be me?

we are letters on the keyboard
I always stand aside
like the letters on the keyboard
why U and then I?
