Talk to me
Tell me your vision
The answer
Lies deep in you

Obey
These voices keeping you sane
Trust me, I promise
I won't lie again
Never ever again

No
We are you dreaming
No
The dreams you're feeling

So far away
We have to remember this day
It's there in your eyes
Like diamonds ablaze
Sleepless we walk
Through the valley of dreams
We live life long enough
Like lifeless machines

Listen

Now
We're learning children "be brave"
Their future may never be safe
You and me and I
Through this web of lies

No
We are you dreaming
No
The dreams you're feeling

So far away
We have to remember this day
It's there in your eyes
Like diamonds ablaze
Sleepless we walk
Through the valley of dreams
We live life long enough
Like silent machines

You and me and I
Through this paradise
You and me and I
Through this paradise

No
We are you dreaming
No
The dreams you're fearing
Sleepless and cold
The moonlight guides me
Shadows unfold
The path of arival

So far away
Remember September the day
With tears in your eyes
They will never be the same
A kingdom without a king
A prophecy of the free
Save us all from within
Start believing the dream

Sleepless I walk
The moonlight burns you
Voiceless I talk
The silence awakes you
Lifeless I stare
My eyes make you listen
Dreamless I dare
Make this your vision

So far away
