Unchain my heart (unchain my heart)
Baby let me be (unchain my heart)
Unchain my heart (unchain my heart)
'Cause you don't care about me (unchain my heart)
You've got me sewed up like a pillow case
But you let my love go to waste
So unchain my heart, oh please, please set me free

Unchain my heart (unchain my heart)
Baby let me go (unchain my heart)
Unchain my heart (unchain my heart)
'Cause you don't love me no more (unchain my heart)
Ev'ry time I call you on the phone
Some fella tells me that you're not at home
So unchain my heart, oh please, please set me free

I'm under your spell (I'm under your spell)
Like a man in a trance (like a man in a trance)
But I know darn well (but I know darn well)
That I don't stand a chance (that I don't stand a chance)

So unchain my heart (unchain my heart)
Let me go my way (unchain my heart)
Unchain my heart (unchain my heart)
You worry me night and day (unchain my heart)

Why lead me through a life of misery
When you don't care a bag of beans for me
So unchain my heart, oh please, please set me free

I'm under your spell (I'm under your spell)
Like a man in a trance (like a man in a trance)
Whoa! You know darn well (you know darn well)
That I don't stand a chance (that I don't stand a chance)

So unchain my heart (unchain my heart)
Let me go my way (unchain my heart)
Unchain my heart (unchain my heart)
You worry me night and day (unchain my heart)

Why lead me through a life of misery
When you don't care a bag of beans for me
So unchain my heart, please, please set me free (please set me free)
Oh won't you set me free (please set me free)
Woah, set me free (please set me free)
Whoa! Set me free little darling (please set me free)
