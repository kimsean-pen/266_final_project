You raised a storm within me
And I can feel it when we sleep
Your body's strong and your thoughts are far from me
But I still hold you when you sleep

I know you're not open and this is a futile thing
You said you wrote us into poetry

Don't be defeated
Just fall into the deep with me
Tell me you can feel it
Baby would you let me dream
It's not fair the way you'll always win with me
I know I'm not your only one
Wanna be the one you keep

You only call when the night can cover us
You only come around here to dream
And I've been feeling things that I can't cover up
Just tell me it's not as it seems

You have a habit of making me fall again
Said I'm unraveled I have to play to win

Don't be defeated
Just fall into the deep with me
Tell me you can feel it
Baby would you let me dream
It's not fair
The way you'll always win with me
Know I'm not your only one
Wanna be the one you keep

Don't be defeated
Just fall into the deep with me
Tell me you can feel it
Baby would you let me dream
It's not fair
The way you'll always win with me
Know I'm not your only one
Wanna be the one you keep

Wanna be your only

Wanna be your only one

Don't be defeated
Just fall into the deep with me
Tell me you can feel it
Baby would you let me dream
It's not fair
The way you'll always win with me
Know I'm not your only one
Wanna be the one you keep
