The light is dim but I am, I'm seeing
The air is thin but I am, I'm breathing
So far away
I feel so far away
From you
(...)
So take me home to you
I feel so far away
Take me home to, all I knew
I feel so far away
(...)
So take me home to you
I feel so far away
Take me home to, all I knew
I feel so far, away
(...)
