Oh yeah

Oh lady won't you come on down, won't you come on down
I said to my town
Oh mama won't you come on down, won't you come on down
I said to my home
Oh lady won't you move my way, can't you move my way

Oh mama when you give your love, when you give your love
You drive me crazy

Oh mama

Oh mama

See mama I gonna feel your everything, I feel your everything

Do you remember what I said when I got down on my knees?

Don't make me beg now baby, don't make me bleed
I gave you all a man could give and you still walked out on me

Oh mama

Oh mama

Oh mama

Oh mama

Your heart

Lovin', burning fire
