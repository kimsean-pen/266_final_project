Cold is the night I see you go
Into the night to find your Romeo
It's a pity finding someone
Won't bring it all to you right now

Enter the slowly crying game
Enter the fear it's all taken away
It's a pity finding someone
Won't be the way for you right now

Alone in the night you seek and wonder

Shady name, shady night
Hide the sunlight in your eyes
Lonely life's a crying road
Shady name, shady night
Hide the sunlight in your eyes
Only for the hiding Romeo

I'm not the one to make you complete
I'm not the guy to help you reach the dream
Such a pity lighting sunrise
Won't come before your eyes right now

All alone in the night you seek and wonder

Shady name, shady night
Hide the sunlight in your eyes
Lonely life's a crying road
Shady name, shady night
Hide the sunlight in your eyes
Only for the hiding Romeo
Shady name, shady night
Hide the sunlight in your eyes
Lonely life's a crying road
Shady name, shady night
Hide the sunlight in your eyes
Only for the hiding Romeo
Shady name, shady night
Hide the sunlight in your eyes
Only for the hiding Romeo
Shady name, shady night
Hide the sunlight in your eyes
Only for the hiding Romeo
