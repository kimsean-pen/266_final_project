Lately you and I can't even hold a conversation
It's like I'm talking to a wall
I hear that
You've been running around telling everyone you hate me
Somehow I didn't even know
And I've been talking to your mama
She said, "Boy, it's such a shame"
She knows that I've always been there, na na
So tell me who are them, na na

Rolling through the hills to the fake parties
Buying all those drinks with your fake ID
Hanging with your friends but your friends ain't me
Well you can say that I said hello

Say hello to your fake friends
Hope I don't meet them someday
Never there when you need them
But you still love them the same
I guess you can't be alone
Not even for one day
Say hello to your fake friends
Say hello, say hello

You hit me up at the middle of the night
But we haven't talked all day
You tell me, "I'm out of money and I need to get a ride"
My friends are heading out, it's late

Rolling through the hills to the fake parties
Buying all those drinks with your fake ID
Hanging with your friends but your friends ain't me
Well you can say that I said hello

Say hello to your fake friends
Hope I don't meet them someday
Never there when you need them
But you still love them the same
I guess you can't be alone
Not even for one day
Say hello to your fake friends
Say hello, say hello

Hmm, hmmhmhm, hmm
Hmm, hmmhmhm, hmm
Hmm, hmmhmhm, hmm

Rolling through the hills to the fake parties
Buying all those drinks with your fake ID
Hanging with your friends but your friends ain't me
Well you can say that I said hello

Say hello to your fake friends
Hope I don't meet them someday
Never there when you need them
But you still love them the same
I guess you can't be alone
Not even for one day
Say hello to your fake friends
Say hello, say hello
Say hello to your fake friends

Hope I don't meet them someday
Never there when you need them
But you still love them the same
I guess you can't be alone
Not even for one day
Say hello to your fake friends
Say hello, say hello
