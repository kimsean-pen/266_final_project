We'll never be as young as we are right now
We'll never see the world like we do right now
So take in what's around you, put your camera down
Take a shot, give it all you got

I have a way of getting stuck on yesterday
I tend to miss the little things that come my way
Always looking forward, always looking back
They seem so near, but they're not here

'Cause time move on so quickly, without or with me
I've got to take a breath

And slow down, slow down
My mind is racing
Catch up, catch up
I've got to pace myself
I'm always wondering
But I don't need to go right now

Let go, let go
We hold our fears too tight
Begin, begin
To live your life
The present is our future past
We've got to make this moment last right now

Have you ever noticed how your heartbeat feels
When you're nervous or excited 'cause it's getting real
Have you stopped to listen to what's in your soul?
That's your intuition, and it always knows

Time moves on so quickly, without or with me
I've got to take a breath

And slow down, slow down
My mind is racing
Catch up, catch up
I've got to pace myself
I'm always wondering
But I don't need to go right now

Let go, let go
We hold our fears too tight
Begin, begin
To live your life
The present is our future past
We've got to make this moment last right now

Woahhhhh
Right now (right now)
Right now (right now)
Enjoy the ride
The ride that you're on
Right now
Right now

Let go, let go
We hold our fears too tight
Begin, begin
To live your life
The present is our future past
We've got to make this moment last right now
