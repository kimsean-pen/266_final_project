I've been stuck in motion
Moving too fast
Trying to catch a moment, but it slips through my hands
All I see are long days and dark nights
I'm lost without you, but I'm on my way, so hold tight

I'm coming home tonight
Meet me in the valley where the kids collide into the morning
Oh my god, my town is coming alive (coming alive)
I'm coming home tonight, I know you're ready for the stars to fly
Into the morning
Oh my god, my town is coming alive
'Cause I'm coming home tonight
'Cause I'm coming home tonight

Don't wanna spend my whole life catching my breath
'Cause I've been running 'round and 'round and 'round
And I got nothing left
There's nothing like a sunset, skyline
To let you know you're almost home
So breathe in, and hold tonight

I'm coming home tonight
Meet me in the valley where the kids collide into the morning
Oh my god, my town is coming alive (coming alive)
I'm coming home tonight, I know you're ready for the stars to fly
Into the morning
Oh my god, my town is coming alive
'Cause I'm coming home tonight
'Cause I'm coming home tonight

Time has a way of diluting emotions
But I won't let the distance get in between us, no

Oh, I'm coming home tonight
Meet me in the valley where the kids collide into the morning
Oh my god, my town is coming alive (coming alive)
I'm coming home tonight, I know you're ready for the stars to fly
Into the morning
Oh my god, my town is coming alive
Tonight
'Cause I'm coming home tonight

Oh, woah (oh, woah)
Oh, woah, oh
Oh, woah (oh, woah)
Oh, woah, oh
