You call me up
Say that you been busy
But something made you just reach out
And we meet up
Tell each other stories
'Bout how we been since we last talked
Our coffee date
Moves into the evening
We wonder how it got so late
We walk around
And I keep asking how
I don't know better by now

You try but you can't shake me,
I think we're going crazy,
Keep saying that we're through but,
Baby I'm not over you
We're quick to go attack
But when we split I need you back and
I tell myself we're though but
Baby I'm not over you (you-oo-oo)
You're the one it's gotta be and I (oo-oo-oo)
Gotta get ya next to me
You try but you can't shake me
I think we're going crazy
Keep saying that we're through but
Baby I'm not over you Ooooh Aaaahh
You wear your clothes
Like you're trying to impress me
But I just think you're over dressed
You roll your eyes
Cause I keep my room messy
And you think we're too old for that
But I gotta know
How you can tweet but you can't text me
You say that I just need control
We go around
And I keep asking how
I don't know better by now

You try but you can't shake me
I think we're going crazy
keep saying that we're through but
Baby I'm not over you
We're quick to go attack
But when we split I need you back and
I tell myself we're though but
Baby I'm not over you (you-oo-oo)
You're the one it's gotta be and I (oo-oo-oo)
Gotta get ya next to me
You try but you can't shake me
I think we're going crazy
keep saying that we're through but
Baby I'm not over you

Now you say choose it my favorite music
We dance round my bedroom floor
Run to the store and pick up snacks for
A movie we can ignore
You try but you can't shake me
I think we're going crazy
keep saying that we're through but
Baby I'm not over you
We're quick to go attack
But when we split I need you back and
I tell myself we're though but
Baby I'm not over you (you-oo-oo)
You're the one it's gotta be and I (oo-oo-oo)
Gotta get ya next to me
You try but you can't shake me
I think we're going crazy
keep saying that we're through but
Baby I'm not over you Ooooh Aahhhh
Baby I'm not over you Ooooh Aaaahhhh
Baby I'm not over you
