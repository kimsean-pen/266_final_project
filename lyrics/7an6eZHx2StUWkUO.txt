There is a chill in the air and the clouds start to gather
Winter's ice cold depression paralyzes you
The days getting shorter,
and the nights become longer
It feels impossible to survive this

Your brances become so brittle
You become weaker with every fallen leaf
Existing with only a trace of life
Laying dormant in a bed of misery

Nothing that you do can free you from this slumber
Perseverance seems so futile

But with the conclusion of winter,
comes the inevitable spring
And you will bloom, and bring an ending
To the suffering
