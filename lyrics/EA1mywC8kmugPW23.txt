Dear Johnny, had had enough
Couldn't pretend anymore
This household, not a fairytale
No storybook left at the door

Couldn't put a fight
Didn't need to be right
Didn't want this to be his story
Made a run for his life
Slipped away in the night
Headed Straight for his crowning glory

(I'll never go home again)
Home is where you are
(I'll never go home again)
Always in your heart
(I'll never go home again)
Home is where you are
(I'll never go home again)
Always in your heart

Dear Frankie, so beautiful
No need for paint on her face
Her father, unbearable.
Under his roof, ain't no way

Couldn't put a fight
Didn't need to be right
Didn't want this to be her story
Made a run for her life
Slipped away in the night
Headed straight for her crowning glory

(I'll never go home again) x5
Home is where you are
(I'll never go home again)
Always in your heart
(I'll never go home again)
Home is where you are
(I'll never go home again)
Always in your heart

Babies take flight, never say never
There's a home for you here
Where love is unconditional
Go to the light, never say never
Make the family you want
With the ones who really love you
