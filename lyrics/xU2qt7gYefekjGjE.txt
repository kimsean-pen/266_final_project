The city is ours
The city is ours

Rolling past graffiti walls
Billboards lighting up the block
Everyone of us on a mission (oh, yeah)

Got a whole crew by my side
Cars beep beep, when they pass us by
Be ready to get down to business

We pull up, open the door
All the girls scream, "there they are"
It's packed from wall to wall and everybody is calling

Here we come, it's almost time
Feel the rush, now hit the lights
We're gonna get it all started

Because the night is young
The line is out the door
Today was crazy, but tonight the city's ours
Live it up until the morning comes
Today was crazy, but tonight
The city is ours
The city is ours

My, my look how we roll
Was it only a month ago?
Everybody said we were dreaming (oh, oh)

Now we're here, like, yeah, we told ya
Still far, but we're that much closer
And there ain't no way that we're leaving (oh, no)

We pull up, open the door
All the girls scream, "there they are"
It's packed from wall to wall and everybody is calling

Here we come, it's almost time
Feel the rush, now hit the lights
We're gonna get it all started (get it started)

Because the night is young
The line is out the door
Today was crazy, but tonight the city's ours
Live it up until the morning comes (morning comes)
Today was crazy, but tonight
The city is ours
The city is ours (oh yeah)

We gotta believe, it's destiny calling
So night after night we'll rock the whole place out (out)
As hard as it seems, I know if you want it
Then it's gonna happen somehow

Because the night is young
The line is out the door
Today was crazy, but tonight the city's ours
Live it up until the morning comes
Today was crazy, but tonight

Because the night is young
The line is out the door
Today was crazy, but tonight the city's ours
Live it up until the morning comes
Today was crazy, but tonight
The city is ours
The city is ours (oh)
The city is ours (oh)
The city is ours

The city is ours
