This fire burning is the only thing to calm my nerves
Just the sound of your voice will make me choke upon my words
This fire burning is the only thing to calm my nerves
Just the sound of your voice...
Let's do this

Come on!, come on!
Come on!, come on!
Come on!, come on!
Come on!, come on!

We're shit out of luck now because
the world has seen it's better years
Call it what you want
With sirens ringing out my ears let me take you
away to the top the world so we can watch it burn

Burn away
Every chance I've ever had I let slip away
Now I've got nothing to lose besides you
I'll go to hell and back for you I only hope you stay

This fire burning is the only thing to calm my nerves
Just the sound of your voice will make me choke upon my words
But I want to see your face
Hear every single breath that you take

Come on!, come on!
Come on!, come on!

I'll pull the strings of my heart (I'll pull
the strings of my heart) to guild me back to you
To guild me back to you
I'll topple mountains,
sway the masses, face perfection I've been lacking
Just to guide me back to you

This is yours and yours alone
This is yours and yours alone
I'll follow through with this I swear
I'll follow through for you
I'll follow through with this
There's no time to spare
I'll follow through with this I swear
I'll follow through for you
I'll follow through with this
There's no time to spare

When this world starts burning and I find you alone
I'll take what little time I have to make these feelings known
Because at the very least I told you whats been eating away in my head
I've been waiting for the chance and it's today

This fire burning is the only thing to calm my nerves
Just the sound of your voice will make me choke upon my words
But I want to see your face
Hear every single breath that you take
