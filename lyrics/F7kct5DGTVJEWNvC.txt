My heart has been broken
And all of my love's in vain
Heart have been broken
And all my love's in vain
But the people's always told me
That woman was the glory of a man
You whip her when she need it
The judge will not let you explain
Whip her when she need it
The judge will not let you explain
Because he believe in justice
and a woman is the glory of a man
I'd rather be tied out on the desert
Right out in the falling rain
Tied out on the desert
Right out in the falling rain
Than to lose my baby
She is the glory of a man
