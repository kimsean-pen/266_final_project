How could you be so cold
as the winter wind blows?
Remember that you're talking to me though,
you need to watch the way you talk to me now
After all these things that we've been through,
after all the things we got into
there are some things you haven't told me
I did some things but that's the old me
Now you wanna get me back and you gonna show me
you walk around like you don't know me
you've got a new friend, well I've got me
but in the end it's still so lonely
In the night, I hear them talk,
the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul
to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You bringin' out a side of me that I dont know
I decided we weren't gonna speak so
Why we up 3 A.M. on the phone?
Why would you be so mad at me fo'?
You know I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop 'cuz I know
all these things gonna go
Tell your friends you're gonna leave me
they say that they don't see what you see in me
wait a couple months and you'll see
you never find someone better than me
In the night, I hear them talk,
the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul
to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talk
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we've been through
They don't know about me and you
Why is there something new to see
you'll just keep hating me
we'll just be enemies
I know you can't believe
In the night, I hear them talk,
the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul
to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
(How could you be so cold?)
The coldest story ever told (as the winter wind blows)
to a woman so heartless
(How could you be so cold?)
How could you be so heartless?
(How could you be so cold?)
