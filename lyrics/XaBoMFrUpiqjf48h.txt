When I was a young girl,
When I was younger,
I met a boy like you,
We fought like enemy,
When I don't move my face,
When I thought I'd make it pain free,

That's when I nothing in your madness,
You thought I was crazy,
In seven different ways,
No I'm never crazy for you,
You're the monster in my life,
Hurry up I'm leaving,
With one foot in the grave,
One foot in the grave what were you thinkin

Be careful what you wish for,
Cause it might come true,
These wise words you once said,
It only takes a moment,
To fall in love again
