Open the windows
Lock all the doors
Spill all your secrets
On to the floor
Remember the bodies
Remember the war
Remember the wanting
And what we endured

Swallow the silence
Choke on the word
Blow out the candles
With all that you learned

Remember your sister
Remember her love
Remember the cancer
That filled up her lungs

I trusted you
I trusted you
I trusted you
I trusted you
I trusted you
I trusted you
I trusted you
I trusted you

Bury the hatchet
Under your tears
We'll run with the shadows
Until we disappear

Bury the hatchet
Under your tears
We'll run with the shadows
Until we disappear
