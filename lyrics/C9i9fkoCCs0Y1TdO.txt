It's not far to go, it's not far at all
It's not far to go, you're not far at all

Pool's out back, water's so cold
There's not much said that I don't know the
Difference between frozen hands and feet
You come right out and you ask me
Nobody ever asks me
Only you come out and ask me

In the pool out back, water to my chest
Towel lying in the grass
Looks a lot worse than it seems
But you know baby that's just me
Baby, baby that's just me
Baby, baby that's just,
Baby, baby that's just me

It's not far to go, no it's not far at all
And darlin' darlin' darlin' darlin', yeah

Looking for a laugh
What's that sound
When you're done whining
Take things back
I'll be there as always
Feet submerged and probably frozen
We can only hope that I'll be frozen, yeah
We can only hope that I'll be...

Enough of that as if I care
As if I need to know, like I was there
But if I was, you just call my name
Call my name and I'll be there
If you call my name, you know I'll be there

Imagine you're so far away
No matter what you do, no matter what you say
You couldn't stop the world for a moment
In the middle of good-bye
You stop in to say
Hi
Is it alright, is it alright if I...
Hi
Is it alright, is it alright if I...
Hi
Is it alright, is it alright if I...
Hi
Is it alright, is it alight

Pool's out back, water's so cold
There's not much said that I don't know
The difference between frozen hands and feet
You come right out and you ask me

It's not far to go, it's not far at all
Is it alright, is it alright if I...
Hi
