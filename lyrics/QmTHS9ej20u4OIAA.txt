When we was talking on the phone last night
He said you woke up with them dream and vision in you loving me,
close with, body shaking,
Oh, you got nobody there hold you.

And I'm longing and waiting
I'm longing and waiting.

Best time I ever had, 'cause we choose
On the midnight time
'cause what I'm looking for,
church go body naked,
we got a lot of catching up to do,
and I'm longing and waiting
I'm longing and waiting.

Away

Baby, you know
Miss you
I miss you too
What if you touch me?
Won't you?

Strip down at the front door
Eat up the kitchen floor
Right it to the bedroom
Give you what you're waiting for
If it waits so patiently baby

Turn it on, take a shower,
look down after hours
say baby you're the one that I'm looking for
let's play for a while.
Turn it on, take a shower,
look down after hours, you'd know
say baby you're the one that I'm looking for
let's play for a while.

Turn it on, take a shower,
look down after hours
say baby you're the one that I'm looking for
let's play for a while.
Turn it on, take a shower,
look down after hours, you'd know
say baby you're the one that I'm looking for
let's play for a while.

Baby, baby, baby
