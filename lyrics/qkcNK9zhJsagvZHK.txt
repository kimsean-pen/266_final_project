Tell me anything, paper
All of your love
Breath like thick water
They're in my lungs
My skin is full of black ink
In your white cloth
So much I think
Little I know

Claw off my name
Means still standing
Peel back my skin
Call out my name
Vessel of brightness
Come make me blind
This present darkness
Swallowed my love

My skeletons are all swimming
Punches with the bleeding sun
