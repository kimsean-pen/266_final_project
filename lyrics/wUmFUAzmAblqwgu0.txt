If you're out there all alone
And you don't know where to go to
Come and take a trip with me
To future world

And if you're running through your life
And you don't know what the sense is
Come and look how it could be
In future world

We all live in happiness our life is full of joy
We say the word "tomorrow" without fear
The feeling of togetherness is always at our side
We love our life and we know we will stay

'Cause we all live
In future world
A world that's full of love
Our future life will be glorious
Come with me future world

You say you'd like to stay
But this is not your time
Go back, find your own way
To future world

Life can be for living
Just try and never give in
Tell everyone the way
To future world

One day you'll live in happiness with a heart that's full of joy
You'll say the word "tomorrow" without fear
The feeling of togetherness will be at your side
You'll say you love your life and you'll know why

'Cause we all live in future world
A world that's full of love
Our future life will be glorious
Come with me future world

Screaming out:
"We all live in future world
A world that's full of love
Our future life will be glorious"
Come with me
Come with me
Come with me
Future world
Future world
Future world
Future world
