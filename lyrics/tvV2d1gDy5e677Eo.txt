Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
'Pop Goes The World' by 'Men Without Hats'

Johnny played guitar, Jenny played bass
Name of the band is 'The Human Race'
Everybody, tell me have you heard?
Pop goes the world
Jenny played keyboard, Johnny played drums
Called Little Baby and a big Bonhomme
Everybody, tell me have you heard?
Pop goes the world
It goes something like this

Johnny and Jenny had a crazy dream
To see their pictures in a magazine
Every little boy needs a girl
Pop goes the world
Jenny and Johnny gettin' smart it seemed
Made more money on a movie screen
Every little nest needs a bird
Pop goes the world

One, two, three and four is five
Everybody here is a friend of mine
Whatever happened to the Duke of Earl?
Pop goes the world
Six, seven, eight and nine is ten
Send Al Gunn to see the doctor, Ben
Hey what planet are we on? The third
Pop goes the world
And every time I wonder where the world went wrong
End up lying on my face goin' ringy dingy ding dong
And every time I wonder if the world is right
End up in some disco dancin' all night
Johnny played guitar, Jenny played bass
Name of the band is 'The Human Race'
Everybody, tell me have you heard?
Pop goes the world
Johnny played guitar, Jenny played bass
Ain't nobody couldn't take their place
Everybody, tell me have you heard?
Pop goes the world, pop goes the world, pop goes the world
