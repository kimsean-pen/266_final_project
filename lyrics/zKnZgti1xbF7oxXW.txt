In my time
That's the way I usually go
But, then when I feel fine
Tthat's when I'll be letting you know

If I try, try, (taking it slow, taking it slow)
Feel like I can't sustain it (letting it go, letting it go, so easily)
So I try as best as I can to break my fall
But, you about to set me baby, you about to set me off

I don't wanna do it, I don't wanna go
I don't wanna but my fuses are about to blow
My alarm is going, I'm on high alert
Baby it's enough, just set me off, just set me off
Set me off, just set me off

Be aware, I am not your everyday babe
When I'm there, I'm there
Everythin' all in, they play fair
Keeping it real, keeping it cool)
But, I gotta tell ya
(?)

So, I try, as best as I can to stay in my heels
But, they are breakin' off, so shakey
You're about to set me off

I don't wanna do it, I don't wanna go
I don't wanna but my fuses are about to blow
My alarm is going, I'm on high alert
Baby it's enough, just set me off, just set me off
Set me off, just set me off

It's crazy, I am always in control
But baby, with you I am good to go
Take caution, I'm about to blow my top
Come closer baby, set me off, just set me off

I don't wanna do it, I don't wanna go
I don't wanna but my fuses are about to blow
My alarm is going, I'm on high alert
Baby it's enough, just set me off, just set me off
Set me off, just set me off

I don't wanna do it, I don't wanna go
I don't wanna but my fuses are about to blow
My alarm is going, I'm on high alert
Baby it's enough, just set me off, just set me off
Set me off, just set me off

Set me off, just set me off
Set me off, just set me off
