(We're going to dance)
(We're going to dance)
(We're going to dance)
(And have some fun, fun, fun)

(Dig!)

The chills that you spill up my back
Keep me filled with satisfaction when we're done
Satisfaction of what's to come

I couldn't ask for another
No, I couldn't ask for another (Another try)

Your groove, I do deeply dig
No walls, only the bridge
My supper dish, my succotash wish (Sing it, baby)

I couldn't ask for another (uh-huh, uh-huh)
No, I couldn't ask for another

Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart (Astronomical)
Groove is in the heart (Hit me)

(Watch out)

The depth of hula groove
Move us to the nth hoop
We're going through to Horton Hears A Who-Who

I couldn't ask for another
No, I couldn't ask for another

DJ Soul was on a roll
I've been told he can't be sold
He's not vicious or malicious
Just deee-lovely and delicious

I couldn't ask for another

Uhh, sumpin' lurks in this torso (Yeah)
Hot, got a deal, you wanna know (You wanna know)
Delightful, truly deee-liteful (Liteful)
Like makin' it, doin' it, 'specially at a show (Show)

Feelin' kinda high like a Hendrix haze (Haze)
Music makes motion moves like a maze (Maze)
All inside of me (Side), heart especially (Yeah)
Help of the rhythm, where I wanna be (C'mon)

Flowin' and glow with electric eye (Eye)
You dip to the dive, baby, you'll realize (Yeah)
Baby, you'll see the funky side of me
Baby, you'll see that rhythm is the key (Yeah)

Get, get with it, with it
Can't can't, quit it, quit it
Stomp on a stoop when I hear a funk loop (Loop)
Playin' Pied Piper follow who's true
Baby, just sing about the groove (Sing it)

Groove is in the heart (Na-na-na, na, na)
Groove is in the heart (Na-na-na, na, na)
Groove is in the heart (Na-na-na, na, na)
Groove is in the heart

(One, two, three)
(Bluh-luh-luh-luh-luh)

(Blow them horns all on)

(Groove is in the heart)

Groove is in the heart (Yeah)
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart

(Mmm)

(Heh-heh, heh-heh)
(C'mon, y'all)
(Y'all are crazy, man)
