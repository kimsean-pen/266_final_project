I used to wonder why
Once I became your guy
Often I felt alone
Then you spent an entire day telling me how I rate
I wish I should have known

You were window shopping
Yeah, comparing me to the other boys I'm not, aha
Instead of stopping you refuse to try and see
Or appreciate what I've got

Oh, I've been forced to draw a line in the sand
For myself I'm taking a stand
If I fall again, that is if I can, oh oh
I'm gonna get myself an upgrade
An upgrade
An upgrade
I'm gonna get myself an upgrade
An upgrade
An upgrade

I'm gonna get myself a girl who's serious
Listen to her, then us
Thinking a step ahead
You were only concerned about going a day without somebody in your bed

Who we date don't matter
To you, all he was
Was a trophy for your wall
I left my angel shattered
But it's you who's sad because
Baby ****** before ****

Oh, I've been forced to draw a line in the sand
For myself I'm taking a stand
If I fall again, that is if I can, oh oh
I'm gonna get myself an upgrade
An upgrade
An upgrade
I'm gonna get myself an upgrade
An upgrade
An upgrade

Take a look, a closer one
Ask
Yeah the stranger you're seeing is me
Now I refuse to settle for anybody anymore

I'm already gone
I'm letting you go, oh oh
I'm gonna get myself an upgrade

I've been forced to draw a line in the sand
For myself I'm taking a stand
If I fall again, that is if I can, oh oh
I'm gonna get myself an upgrade
An upgrade
An upgrade
I'm gonna get myself an upgrade
An upgrade
An upgrade

I'm gonna get myself an upgrade
An upgrade
An upgrade, yeah
I'm gonna get myself an upgrade
