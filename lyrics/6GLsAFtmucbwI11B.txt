Clap until your hands hurt
Standing ovations, or boo-boo-boos
W-watch until we blur
Walk off into the sunset

Tell rock 'n roll I'm alone again
I want to put the mid-west home again
Your time has passed, they say never means never
So the fast dance won't last but never means forever
Never means forever

Alpha dog and o-o-omegalomaniac-ac-ac
Alpha dog and o-o-mega-megalo
Welcome to the new déjà vu
I can almost see the wizard through the curtains
Alpha dog and o-o-omegalomaniac-ac-ac

We must have the best coach
Tell the best jokes
We must make it hard to look so easy
Doing something so hard

You must see my way
They scream when they look at me
I'mma, I'mma star
I'mma, I'mma star

I'mma star
Oh, I'mma star

Alpha dog and o-o-omegalomaniac-ac-ac
Alpha dog and o-o-mega-megalo
Welcome to the new déjà vu
I can almost see the wizard through the curtains
Alpha dog and o-o-omegalomaniac-ac-ac

You're not the first or the last
But you're possible the prettiest, whoa
He's a fighter past his prime
He's in the gutter waving his hand
I'm just fine

You're not the first or the last
But you're possibly the prettiest, whoa
He's a fighter past his prime
He's in the gutter waving his hand
Alpha dog and o-o-omegalomaniac-ac-ac
Alpha dog and o-o-mega-megalo
Welcome to the new déjà vu
I can almost see the wizard through the curtains
Alpha dog and o-o-omegalomaniac-ac-ac
