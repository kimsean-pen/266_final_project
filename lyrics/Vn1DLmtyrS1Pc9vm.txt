Picture me a magazine
Empty in the night
No, there is not much redeeming
About this dawn's breaking light.

Curtains, I could have it on my own
The window, the view,
The second story fall.

Kristen by the look
Hummed on all the tracks.
She said a diamond wouldn't hurt,
And that I should roll it back.

Curtains on the quiet sight
Curtains came ...
Where is the ... height?
