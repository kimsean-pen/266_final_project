Voices in my veins, whispers of sedition reign
All eyes on me, spill my blood and show my shame

Even when I close my eyes, I see it in my sleep
And I've wasted so much time, now I'm taking back my dreams
Soul so heavy, soul so heavy
Still pretending I can hold my own 'cause it's all I've ever known

Wait for the rain
I'll be there watching, watching as it washes you away
One and the same, just a phantom I refuse to name
All eyes on me, spill my blood and show my shame

War of attrition, I do this to myself
Of my own volition, I compromise my mental health
Condescending, condescending
Never ending ways to bring me down, drag my face into the ground

Wait for the rain
I'll be there watching, watching as it washes you away
One and the same, just a phantom I refuse to name
All eyes on me, spill my blood and show my shame

Nothing lasts forever, you will die with me
I've wasted so much time, now I'm taking back my dreams
All eyes on me, spill my blood and show my shame

Wait for the rain
I'll be there watching, watching as it washes you away
Wait for the rain
I'll be there watching, watching as it washes you away
One and the same, just a phantom I refuse to name
All eyes on me, spill my blood and show my shame
