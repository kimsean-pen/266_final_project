Call it new wave
Say it like you should
Because a call to arms
Is a calling card
And I'm calling soon
Hoping I can get through to you

We're not sleeping, we're just dreaming
Nothing said has come so easy

We're not sleeping, we're just dreaming

Call it new wave
Second guess the feel
Call it everything at once 'cause
This is days on days
But something's changed
'Cause nothing good can stay the same

Every single time you throw your white flag down and surrender
Like every single second's just another second spent to lose

But this is something I can't lose

We're not sleeping, we're just dreaming
Nothing said has come so easy
We're not sleeping, we're just dreaming

I was just doing the sane thing
(To try something that the rest have never seen)
I was just doing the same thing

Whoa whoa oh

Every single time you throw your white flag down and surrender
Like every single second's just another second spent to lose

We're not sleeping, we're just dreaming
Nothing said has come so easy
We're not sleeping, we're just dreaming

I was just doing the sane thing
(To try something that the rest have never seen)

I was just doing the same thing

Whoa whoa oh

We are the new wave
Crashing the same day

We are the new wave
Crashing the same day

We are the new wave
Crashing the same

We are the new wave

We are the new wave

Call it new wave
Until it's all washed up
Because we'll be crashing soon
But before we do
I hope I get through
Through to you
