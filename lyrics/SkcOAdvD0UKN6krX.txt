I was folded by ferns
You could return, the earth
All to her
Open mouth
Look up and out
Fall my failures
To the ground
I know, I know, I know all them
I am wind in the pines
I am a line you can't define
When the dawn breaks
In my love-lock landscapes
I know, I know, I know all them
Be in my vision
My gardener
I'll be an architect
On open steam
Be in that canyon
That corridor
I'll be an architect
On window steam
I, ll be in the steam
