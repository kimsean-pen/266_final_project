When you leave, and you will
When the going gets tough
And you turn tail and run
We're aware that you're scared
But uncertainty's always nine tenths of the fun

Stay with me, I'm begging you
Don't do this on your own
Stay with me, I'm not a fool
Not just for anyone

Every time you return
With fresh meat in your teeth
And a spark in your eye
Does it burn, burn for me
I have never been strong enough to be released

Stay with me, I'm begging you
Don't do this on your own
Stay with me, I'm not a fool
Not just for anyone
Stay with me
I'm warning you
Stay with me, I'm not a fool
Not just for anyone

There you go, here I stay
You can come home
I'll be your safe
There you go, Here I stay
Take all your secrets
And lock them away

Don't do this on your own
Don't do this on your own
