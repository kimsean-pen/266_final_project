You said you couldn't stay
You've seen it all before, I know
And sold you on their way
Oh honey that's ok

No harm, he's armed
Settin' off all your alarms
When I find out
I hope it's you who set this trap

And stuffers rarely change
At least I'm on my own again instead of
Anywhere with you
Oh to me it's all the same

And I've lost my page again
I know this is surreal
But I'll try my luck with you
This life is on my side
Oh I am your one
Believe me, this is a chance
Oh, oh

Let's see what is for sale
He's trying hard to give his job a chance
It's never gonna be
It's sad, but I agree
The signals don't seem right
It lasts for just one night, and then
I'm sorry that I said
That we were just good friends

No harm, he's armed
Settin' off all your alarms
They're trapped, I can't
Be there in time I'll think about that

And I've lost my page again
I know this is surreal
But I'll try my luck with you
This life is on my side
Well I am your one
Believe me, this is a chance
Oh, oh
