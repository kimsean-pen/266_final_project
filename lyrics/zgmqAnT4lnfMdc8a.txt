I favored being out of it
But I got tricked by my tiny mind
I didn't want to sit here
And loosen up to a rhythm I thought was tight
I still want to be rid of it
I favor being dumb
I don't want an awakening
I don't believe in fun
I favored being out of it
But I got tricked by my tiny mind

There ain't no sun down there
No breaks for all this kind
There ain't no filth in summer
Where wheat grows from the shine
What breaks the skin in this
Of aging life's true mist
Of all the grief in bread
The dough brings when it's made
The light gets faint and timely
While you go out your mind
The bus don't smell of roses
But the bins are always kind
I'll take it as it comes lit
No change from whatever note
These street lights are the pointers
On the cold and quiet roads

I favored being out of it
But I got tricked by my tiny mind
I didn't want to sit here
And loosen up to a
Rhythm I thought was tight
I still want to be rid of it
I favor being dumb
I don't want an awakening
I don't believe in fun
I favored being out of it
But I got tricked by my tiny mind

I don't wanna flip the page
Of my negative script
They cornered my young age
And ran away with it
I don't wanna flip the page
Of my negative script
They cornered my young age
And ran away with it
