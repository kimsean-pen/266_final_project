We love each other so deeply
That I ask you this, sweetheart
Why should we quarrel ever?
Why can't we be enough clever?
Never to part
Everytime we say goodbye
I die a little
Everytime we say goodbye
I wonder why a little
Why the gods above me
Who must be in the know
Think so little of me
They allow you to go
When you're near
There's such an air

Of spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere
Begin to sing about it
There's no love song finer
But how strange the change
From major to minor
Everytime we say goodbye
Everytime we say goodbye
