Cast a shadow into the ground
Coal black soil barren of life
Reaches the horizon
The ashes of the world

Once burned so bright
Light devoured day and night
Pyre of the Gods
Life torn asunder

Cold as ice and indifferent
Was the hand of the scythe
Death came like a flood
End followed the 4th rider

Desolate is the land
No leaves have fallen
Burnt branches pierce the sky

Eroded and bleak
Last snow has fallen
Frozen rain descends from the sky
Veil of winter in white

Dead woods are standing tall
Reaching for the burning star
The warmth from afar

Daylight that died
Was followed by the breath of ice
Shroud of cold sewed by the fire

Like an everlasting fall
Delays the arrival
Winds whisper a voiceless call
For winter

Like an everlasting fall
Decelerate the final
Last winter for us all
Life torn asunder

Last cliff where the land meets sea
Where waters dark and deep
Conceals no life inside
Deserted and stark
Scorched and forsaken

Like an everlasting fall
Delays the arrival
Winds whisper a voiceless call
For winter

Like an everlasting fall
Decelerate the final
Last winter for us all
Last winter for us all.
