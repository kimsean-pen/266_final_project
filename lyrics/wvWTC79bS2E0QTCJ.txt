You're afraid to meet someone
'Cause you've been burned
You've been burned, you've been burned
Love is good until it's gone
That's what you learned,
What you've learned, what you've learned

You don't have to hide your love away and
I know that I'm gonna make mistakes but
Leaning on somebody isn't easy
I'll do what I can to make you see, oh

This is not a temporary love
This is not a temporary love
Now your heart is in my hands
I won't give it up
This is not a temporary love

You may not think I know the difference
But I do
But I do
But I do
I feel the gravity in between us
And you can too
You can too
You can too

We don't have to hide our love away and
Both of us are gonna make mistakes 'cause
Leaning on somebody's never easy
But look at me
And tell me you don't see love, oh

This is not a temporary love
No, this is not a temporary love
Now your heart is in my hands
I won't give it up
This is not a temporary love

Love
Love
Love

When the world around is caving in
And the winds will keep on changing
Take my hand and let it spin
We'll hold still

This is not a temporary love
No, this is not a temporary love
Now my heart is in your hands
Please don't give it up
This is not a temporary love

This is not a temporary love
No, this is not a temporary love
Now your heart is in my hands
Please don't give it up
This is not a temporary love
This is not a temporary love
