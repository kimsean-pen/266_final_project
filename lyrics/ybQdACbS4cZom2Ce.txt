Behold the heart of mine in flames
A top the highest mountain
Below the darkest depths
In the valley of hate I wander
My frost bitten heart is set ablaze, set ablaze

Ravage my soul
Plunder my mind
Branded by thunder, fire and ice

Trampled in fury by hordes of the light
I am crushed by the hand of my sky
My sky has forsaken me

Rivers of crimson lead me now
Trail of fire
In a place of fire ethernal
Left in flames

Scattered in a world of thorns
Torn from my earthly self
Aggreived in tears and bitterness
I fall beyond stars, beyond stars

Ravage my soul
Plunder my mind
Branded by thunder, fire and ice
Trampled in fury by hordes of the light
My firey heart is stronger than ever
It's stronger than ever before

My heart in flames
