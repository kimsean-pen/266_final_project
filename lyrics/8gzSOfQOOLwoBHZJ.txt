You can start a family
Or you can start a war
Began with good intentions
Now you don't know what you're fighting for

There's no way of knowing
The way you are today
When I look up to the sky
There's only one thing that I wanna say

Lay down, try and talk about it
Lay down, don't scream or cry or shout it
Stay down, don't deny or doubt it
No one knows you better than me

The world's a little darker
Through your tinted view
When the times get harder
Know I'll always be there for you

But there's no way of knowing
But I guess if I may
When I look up to you
There's only one thing that I wanna say

Lay down, try and talk about it
Lay down, don't scream or cry or shout it
Stay down, don't deny or doubt it
No one knows you better than me
