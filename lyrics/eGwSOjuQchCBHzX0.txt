Writhing and embraced,
retribution, soul eclipse turns solid,
energized, sucking vomit - acting like its honey;
deprived of I,
Falling while thrusting squares through circles,
serving one single new dimension.
Terror rising, agnostics nemesis, a prophet of extinction.

I scorch the skies before your very eyes,
my deliverance - enslavement labelled: love.

Just trust this nemesis to sign and seal extinction.
