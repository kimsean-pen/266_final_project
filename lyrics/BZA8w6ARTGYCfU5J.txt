This little town hasn't changed so much, not since the time of night
When we would lie out and talk like we couldn't be touched
Then you'd go away when the morning was light
But sure enough well we had to grow up
And there's nothing like a full time job to put out your fire
We were young and wasn't in love but maybe we were happy
Getting carried away

Now that seems so long ago, out the door and down the road
I'm sometimes sick when I'm alone of the times we had and now we don't
But out in the past we were running around that
Sometimes so fast with your foot on the ground
It was so hard to stand you never could tell
That all I saw was you

And every place that we talk about don't seem so far away
When you rely on yourself and the one you're around
And always believe everything that they say
But little talk isn't always enough and just cause you're
Still here now doesn't mean you're a liar
We were young and that was enough
And life has a habit of getting in the way
