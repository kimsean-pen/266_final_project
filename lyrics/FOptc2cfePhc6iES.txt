I'm on fire
(I'm good enough)
I'm good enough
Go, just like you never broke my heart
Like you never said the words
Two worlds never further apart

Go, life will never be the same
But I will keep on finding my way
I move on to get to my brighter day

(I'm good enough)
I'm good enough
Go, just like you never broke my heart
Like you never said the words
Two worlds never further apart
Go, life will never be the same
But I will keep on finding my way
I move on to get to my brighter day
