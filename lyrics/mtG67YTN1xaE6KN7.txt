Girls in their heels and a skinny pair of blue jeans
...
Boys in black pearl buttons lookin' just like Springsteen
...

Momma says why you wanna play in a silly rock n' roll band
...
Well if you stood here Momma
I know you'd understand yeah

...
It's the lights
It's the high

It's the roar of a crowd on a Friday night
...
And everybody's screamin' out yeah, yeah, yeah
...

And everybody's singing out yeah, yeah, yeah
...
Get on your feet if it feels good
If it feels right

'Cause we're all stars tonight
So sing it out yeah, yeah, yeah
...

(Hey!)
(Hey!)
'Cause i'll get a little rowdy
Gonna party all night long

...
And boys sway with your girls
When we play a little slow song

...
Put your hands in the air
Shine a lighter or a cell phone
You better buy another round
We ain't goin' home no
On the floor
In the stands
Tonight we're all in the band
And we're screamin' out yeah, yeah, yeah
...
And everybody's singing out yeah, yeah, yeah
...
Get on your feet if it feels good
If it feels right
'Cause we're all stars tonight
So sing it out yeah, yeah, yeah
...
And everybody's screamin' out yeah, yeah, yeah
...
Everybody's singing out yeah, yeah, yeah
