I woke up holding my pillow
Didn't know it was a dream
I felt like I found my real love
Only if theres a way to bring it to me
Then I would be so complete and mellow
Until then I can have you to myself
If I want to feel love

Boy I dream you in the morning, noon, and night
And I need you in my life
Oh I, Oh I
Yeah I dream you in the morning, noon, and night
And I need you in my life
Oh I, Oh I
Yeah I dream you all the time

Love - how much I get to see you
There has never been a time when I was lonely and can't reach you
Boy it's such a perfect time for me
Forever - I was afraid there'd never be true love
Cause I know you're the kind I see myself with
I don't know if it exists out here - love

And I picture you and I for always in our life
It's like we're intertwined
You're always on my mind
I picture you and I for always in our life
It's like we're intertwined
You're always on my mind

Morning, noon, and night
I need you in my life
Oh I, Oh I
Boy, I dream you all the time
Morning, noon, and night
My life, Oh I, Oh I
I need you in my life

In the morning, noon and night
Oh I
really need you in my life
I need you oh
I need you boy
I need you in my life

Boy I dream you in the morning, noon, and night
And I need you in my life
Oh I, Oh I
Yeah I dream you in the morning, noon, and night
I need you, I need you in my life
Oh I, Oh I
Yeah I dream you all the time

Morning noon and night
Need you in my life
Oh baby
Heyyy
Oh I need you
I need you
