I knew when I first saw you on the showroom floor
You were made for me
I took you home and dressed you up in polyester
Princess of my dreams

Emotionless and cold as ice
All of the things I like
The way you look, the way you move
The sound you're makin'
In ultra-chrome, latex and steel

I plug you in
Dim the lights, electric Barbarella
Your perfect skin
Plastic kiss, electric Barbarella
Try to resist, then we touch
Hallucinate and tranquilize

She's so fine
She's all mine

Our private life is subject to investigation
No time to waste
People say they heard about our deviation
But you never looked so good

Wear the fake fur and fake pearls for me
And put on your mystery
The way I feel you know
I'll never keep you waiting
In ultra-chrome, latex and steel

I plug you in
Dim the lights, electric Barbarella
Your perfect skin
Plastic kiss, electric Barbarella
Try to resist, then we touch
Hallucinate and tranquilize

I plug you in
Dim the lights, electric Barbarella
Your perfect skin
Plastic kiss, electric Barbarella
Try to resist, then we touch
Hallucinate and tranquilize

Princess of my dreams
Princess of my dreams
Major domo plasticomo Barbarella
She's so fine
Pro-genetic, you electric Barbarella
She's all mine
My pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty Barbarella

Barbarella
Barbarella
Barbarella
