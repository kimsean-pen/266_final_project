I'm beautiful, I know 'cause it's the season
But what am I to do with all this beauty
Biology- I am an organism
I'm chemical, that's all that is all
I'm liquid smoothe
Come touch me too
And feel my skin is plump and full of life
I'm in my prime
I'm liquid smoothe
Come touch me, too
I'm at my highest peak
I'm ripe, about to fall
Capture me
(?)Please take my picture???
I'm pulsing
My blood is red an unafraid of living
Beginning to end

I'm liquid smoothe
Come touch me too,
And feel my skin is plump and full of life I'm in my prime ...

How I feel this river rushing through my veins
With nowhere else to go
It circles round
