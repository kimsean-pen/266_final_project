Who are you? What you really do?
When you have to fight the agony
That's aiming back at you?
Who are you? Who you run to?
Depend, defend, hope on?
Can you function on your own?

Are you from those who will swallow down
The pain, disgrace, the sadness (Yeah)
When the one you love so much
Can take your soul and break it? (No)

Wait for, oh wait for
What I waited for?
Wait for, oh wait for
On no, I'm done

Walking out
Whatever I've built
I'm gonna burn down
I'm walking out
You're no more a king
Cause I was your crown

First you said, you would die for me
But in the end I was the one
Bleeding all alone
First you said you kneeled, you swore
You loved, you lived for me
How could you forget it all?

Are you from those who can take a loving heart
And squeeze it out of love?
Than prepare to slowly get
Not loved but hated instead

Walking out
Whatever I've built
I'm gonna burn down
I'm walking out
You're no more a king
Cause I was your crown

Walking out (walking out), walking out (walking out)
No crying now
Walking out (walking out), walking out (walking out)
No begging
Walking out, hoohoo
At last, I feel proud
I'm walking out

You knew that my heart wasn't small
But somehow you came and filled it all

Walking out
Whatever I've built
I'm gonna burn down
I'm walking out
You're no more a king
Cause I was your crown

Walking out (walking out), walking out (walking out)
No crying now
Walking out (walking out), walking out (walking out)
No begging
Walking out
At last, I feel proud
I'm walking out
