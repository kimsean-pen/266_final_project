The muscle and bone - they encase my heart but never touch my soul.
I'll save that for the water and its shore,
fear makes friends with joy.

And I'll march slowly and I'll never forget
How the music stopped or the feel of your breath. [four times]

The flesh and the blood -
they keep my body warm but still my mind is cold.
To know what's fair is not always fair,
but what proves real will never flee.

And I'll march slowly and I'll never forget
How that black dress fell upon your white neck.
Grand Isle rests quiet this time of year
And I know you will be leaving soon my dear
