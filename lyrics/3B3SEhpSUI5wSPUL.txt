The caves of our mouths are forests,
Darkness and the air,
In between is over-
Flowing and the rushing
Wolverinelies past,
his shiny shiny teeth,
She is kind, he is free
Full of knowing

She is sure (x2)

The caves of our mouths are bears'
Bellies and the air,
In between this spewing,
Comets and the dancing,
Centaur queen flies past,
her tiny tiny teeth
He is kind, she is free
Wants to show him

She is sure (x3)

Find him in the bat's mouth
He is singing in her bat's mouth
He is shaking and dancing in a bat mouth
He is getting tired and sleeping in a bat mouth
And she's holding him tight in a bat arms
She is wrapping him up in a bat arms
And she's thanking her mother Sea
"Thank you mother Sea
For letting him see
The sea in me"

She is sure (x8)
