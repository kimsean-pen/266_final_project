You gotta speed it up
And then you gotta slow it down
'Cause if you believe that our love can hit the top
You gotta play around
But soon you will find that there comes a time

For making your mind up
You gotta turn it on
And then you gotta put it out
You gotta be sure that it's something
Everybody's gonna talk about

Before you decide that the time's arrived
For making your mind up

Don't let your indecision
Take you from behind
Trust your inner vision
Don't let others change your mind
And now you really gotta burn it up
And make another fly by night

Get a run for your money
And take a chance and it'll turn out right
But when you can see how it's gotta be
You're making your mind up
And try to look as if you don't care less
But if you wanna see some more

Bending the rules of the game
Will let you find the one you're looking for

And then you can show that you think you know
You're making your mind up
Don't let your indecision
Take you from behind
Trust your inner vision

Don't let others change your mind
And now you really gotta speed it up
And then you gotta slow it down
'Cause if you believe that our love can hit the top
You gotta play around

But soon you will find that there comes a time
For making your mind up
And now you really gotta speed it up
And then you gotta slow it down
'Cause if you believe that our love can hit the top
You gotta play around
But soon you will find that there comes a time
For making your mind up
For making your mind up
For making your mind up
For making your mind up
