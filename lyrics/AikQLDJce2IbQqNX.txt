Hard time forgivin'
Even harder forgettin'
Before you do somit'
You might regret, friend
Hard time forgivin'
Even harder forgettin'
Before you do somit'
You might regret, friend

Took me for granted
But call it love if you will
I'm aware of this
I didn't let you in
Sank for you to swim
Dancing on the ledge
Try to make you stay
I didn't let you in!

Broke to what became
Became you and me
Tried to mend it but
I can't bend the truth!
Bricks are caving in
Oh how sweet, this sin
I left you the keys
You won't let me in!

Hard time forgivin'
Even harder forgettin'
Before you do somit'
You might regret, friend
Hard time forgivin'
Even harder forgettin'
Before you do somit'
You might regret, friend!

Left me on the floor
Now I'm at the shore
Here's change you can't keep
Sold yourself too cheap!
Thought you got away
This here ends today
You thought hell was hard
Let me show you now!

Hard time forgivin'
Even harder forgettin'
Before you do somit'
You might regret, friend!
Hard time forgivin'
Even harder forgettin'
Before you do somit'
You might regret, friend!

This time I will be louder than my words
Walk with lessons that oh, that I have learnt
Show the scars I've earnt
In the light of day
Shadows will be found
I will hunt them down!

Hard time forgivin'
Even harder forgettin'
Before you do somit'
You might regret, friend
Hard time forgivin'
Even harder forgettin'
Before you do somit'
You might regret, friend
