It's a long road and it gets windy
Fog is real low and it's so blinding
Oh, I'm trying to steer
Trying to take the lead
But I feel like the road is steering me
Getting so lost, like a castaway
Feeling so crossed, like a renegade
And I'm trying to call out in the big city
Just a small voice and no one's listening to me

Oh oh, tell me where to go
Tell me that you know
Just how bright I glow

Every time that you think you've lost your shine
Just remember nothing's brighter
You're the city lights
Every time that you fade into the night
Just remember you're the fire
You're the city lights

So shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, ooh

Oh, I'm blending in and I'm sticking out
Like a sore thumb that they don't know about
Wanna make peace, wanna just breathe
Wanna be the light that makes them all believe
I'm the race car, not the spectator
I'm the hero, not the narrator
Hercules, battling, conquering, everything, yeah

Oh oh, tell me where to go
Tell me that you know
Just how bright I glow

Every time that you think you've lost your shine
Just remember nothing's brighter
You're the city lights (You're the city lights)
Every time that you fade into the night
Just remember you're the fire
You're the city lights

That shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, oh

Everybody knows that everybody glows like the city lights
Everybody knows that everybody glows like the city lights
Everybody knows that everybody glows like the city lights
Everybody knows that everybody glows like the city lights

The city lights, oh oh
Ooh, the city lights
You are...

Every time that you think you've lost your shine
Just remember nothing's brighter
You're the city lights (You're the city lights)
Every time that you fade into the night
Just remember you're the fire
You're the city lights

That shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, oh
