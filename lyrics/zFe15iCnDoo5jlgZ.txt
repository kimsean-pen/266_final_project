I'm way too good at
Saying I love you, like I believe it
I'm way too good at
Staying up all night, keeping a secret
I'm way too good at
Turning my phone off whenever you call me
Only say that I want you
'Cause it's what I'm used to

(I know, I know)
I should leave
(Try to let go)
But I can't
It's like I'm standing at the bottom of a hole with the shovel in my hand

I'm way too good at faking it
I'm way too good at making it look like, I don't want nobody else
I even started fooling myself
I'm way too good at

Being a zombie, when we're in the bedroom
I'm way too good at
Doing the things that, I don't really want to

(I know, I know)
I should leave
(Try to let go)
But I can't
It's like I'm standing at the bottom of a hole with the shovel in my hand

I'm way too good at faking it
I'm way too good at making it look like I don't want nobody else
I even started fooling myself
I'm way too good at faking it
I'm way too good at making it look like, I don't want nobody else
I even started fooling myself
'Cause I'm way too good at faking it

Ohh, I'm way too good at making it look like, I love you
Making it look like, I want to
Be here when I'm already gone
I should've told you all along
That you're not the one
Babe, I'm already done

I'm just way too good at faking it
I'm way too good at making it look like, I don't want nobody else
I even started fooling myself
I'm way too good at faking it
I'm way too good at making it look like, I don't want nobody else
I even started fooling myself
'Cause I'm way too good at faking it
I'm way too good at making it look like, I don't want nobody else
I even started fooling myself
'Cause I'm way too good at faking it
I'm way too good at
