In the jungle that we roam
To search and find and to explore
All we, all we all know
All we, all we don't know

Pushing back, remove the leaves
To find something bigger than me
All we, all we all know
All we, all we don't know
So far so good
So don't turn back
So far so good

It's been hard
Trying to find the best of it
I'm always hung up on the risk
Don't over think about it hard
When all that's left is rearranged
And everything is in the way
Don't over think about it
Don't over think about it

If I think too hard and never leave
I'll watch the world turn without me
All we, all we all know
All we, all we don't know
To hide from lions and the wolves
Would never break the fears we hold
All we, all we all know
All we, all we don't know
So far so good
So don't turn back
So far so good

It's been hard
Trying to find the best of it
I'm always hung up on the risk
Don't over think about it hard
When all that's left is rearranged
And everything is in the way
Don't over think about it
Don't over think about it

So far so good
So don't turn back
So far so good
So far so good
So don't turn back
So far so good
So far so good
So don't turn back
So far so good
So far so good
So don't turn back
So far so good

It's been hard
Trying to find the best of it
I'm always hung up on the risk
Don't over think about it hard
When all that's left is rearranged
And everything is in the way
Don't over think about it
Don't over think about it
Don't over think about it
