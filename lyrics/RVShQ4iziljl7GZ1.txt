Hey girl you feeling real uptight
No fun & games for you this friday night
Your daddy says: "you might as well go to school"
He pays the bills so don't you be no fool

'cause you're a young girl
And you're really not on your own
You're a young girl
And you shouldn't be allowed to roam

Now listen to me
And hear what I've got to say
Love will come your way
One of theese days
And in just a matter of time
Every little thing is gonna be just fine

'cause you're a young girl
And you're really not on your own
You're a young girl
And you shouldn't be allowed to roam
'cause you're a young girl
And you're really not on your own
You're a young girl
And you shouldn't be allowed to roam

'cause you're a young girl
And you're really not on your own
You're a young girl
And you shouldn't be allowed to roam
'cause you're a young girl
And you're really not on your own
You're a young girl
And you shouldn't be allowed to roam
