Eh-yeah, wonderful world, beautiful people
You and your girl, things could be pretty
But underneath this there is a secret
That nobody can repeat

Take a look at the world and the state that it's in today
I am sure you'll agree we all could make it a better way
With our love put together
Everybody learn to love each other

Instead of fussing and fighting, cheating, back-biting
Scandalizing and hating

Baby, we could have a wonderful world, beautiful people
You and your girl, things could be pretty
But underneath this there is a secret
That nobody can repeat, yeah now

Man and woman, girl and boy, let us try to give a helping hand
This I know and I'm sure that the love we all could understand
This is our world, can't you see?
Everybody wants to live and be free

Instead of fussing and fighting, cheating, back-biting
Scandalizing and hating

Yeah, we could have a wonderful world, beautiful people
You and your girl, things could be pretty
But underneath this there is a secret
That nobody can repeat, mmm yeah yeah

Talkin 'bout the wonderful world, beautiful people
You and your girl, things could be pretty
Wonderful world, beautiful people
Wonderful world, beautiful people
Wonderful world, beautiful people
