I remember laughter
My rollercoaster emotions
Oh, how they echo in my mind
Like counterfeit excitement
This happy pandemonium
Of zooming in on our next high

And it feels like flying
It's a fool's paradise
And here we go denying
That there's always a price
And no easy way out
But we can leave our gilded cages
In the silence of minds

I remember the question
Who are we really living for
N' I could feel you by my side
Rare like the flower
Peace without euphoria
This surrender feels so right

And it feels like flying
It's a fool's paradise
And here we go denying
That there's always a price
And no easy way out
But we can leave our gilded cages
In the silence of minds

There ain't no denying
It feels like, like flying

Two worlds colliding
There ain't no bargaining
No giving in without a fight
Model of defiance
In the face of adversity
You keep your target in your sights

And it feels like flying
Outta fool's paradise
And there's no denying
But I'll pay the price
With my fear and doubt
I'll leave them in their cages
And rise to blinding heights
