No wonder I feel a thousand petals
I'm walking by cherry blossoms in the sky
Feels exciting to be living
No wonder I feel so tired of talking
There's so much to take in today

I'm humming like washing machines through the window
And feeling glad that I saw you in your favorite jeans
Feels so friendly when you say "Hello"
No wonder I want to wrap you up and take you home
I'm looking forward to the chance to meet again
But then again it all depends

Suddenly I'm not so sure
That intentions can be pure
If I could just throw all my doubts into the wind
I think that they'd come back again

Every cloud has a silver lining
Every cloud has a silver lining
Every cloud has a silver lining
Every cloud has a silver lining
