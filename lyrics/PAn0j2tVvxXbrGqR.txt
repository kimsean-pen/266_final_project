Contemplating, isolating and it's stressing me out
Different visions, contradictions
Why won't you let me out?
I need a way to separate, yeah
But I promise you that
I'll make sure you never forget me (never forget me)

Now that you want it, now that you need it
I'm too far gone
You're trying to blame me, but I'm not breaking
I'm telling you I'm bulletproof (bulletproof)
Believe me I'm bulletproof (bulletproof)
You made me so bulletproof (bulletproof)
And now I'm too far gone

You're addicted and so twisted that it's freaking me out
Distant eyes, it's no surprise
You can't do anything now
I need a way to separate, yeah
But I'm telling you that nothing will ever be the same

Now that you want it, now that you need it
I'm too far gone
You're trying to blame me, but I'm not breaking
I'm telling you I'm bulletproof (bulletproof)
Believe me I'm bulletproof (bulletproof)
You made me so bulletproof (bulletproof)
And now I'm too far gone

Now that you want it, now that you need it
I'm too far gone
You're trying to blame me, but I'm not breaking
I'm telling you I'm bulletproof (bulletproof)
Believe me I'm bulletproof (bulletproof)
You made me so bulletproof (bulletproof)
And now I'm too far gone

I'm telling you I'm bulletproof (bulletproof)
Believe me I'm bulletproof (bulletproof)
You made me so bulletproof (bulletproof)
And now I'm too far gone
