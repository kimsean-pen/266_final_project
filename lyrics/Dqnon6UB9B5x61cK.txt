Whats your name, Where do you stay
I just got In town today
And Im here, here all alone
Ill be gone by tomorrow

And I dont want to look like a womanizer
But girl youre so hot its like youre on fire
And youre the only one in here that I admire
So would you give into what you desire

And I dont know if its right
But I just want to love you
For tonight just one night
For tonight just one night
For tonight just one night
For tonight just one night
Just one night just one night

Just so you understand
I just want a one night stand
Im not trying to be your man
I just want this one night stand

And I know what youre thinking
Im a dog for no reason
Why should we both be living
Together for the evening

And I dont want to look like a womanizer
But girl youre so hot its like youre on fire
And youre the only one in here that I admire
So would you give into what you desire

And I dont know if its right
But I just want to love you
For tonight just one night
For tonight just one night
For tonight just one night
For tonight just one night
Just one night just one night
