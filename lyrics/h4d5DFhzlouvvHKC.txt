Time to question our lifestyle, look how we live
Smoking weed like it ain't no thing, so even kids wanna try now
Then lie down and get ran through
Nobody watches them clocking, the evil men do
Faced with the demons, addicted to hearing victims screaming
Guess we was evil since birth, product of cursed semen's
Cause even our birthdays, are cursed days
A born thug in the first place, the worst ways
I'd love to see the block in peace
With no more dealers and crooked cops, the only way to stop the beasts
And only we can change, it's up to us to clean up the streets
It ain't the same, too many murders
Too many funerals and too many tears
Just seen another brother buried plus I knew him for years
Pass by his family but what could I say?
Keep your head up and try to keep the faith and pray for 'Better Dayz'

Thinking back as an adolescent
Who would have guessed, that in my future years I'd be stressing
Some say the ghetto's sick and corrupted
Plus my P.O. won't let me hang with the brothers I grew up with
Trying to keep my head up and stay strong
All my homies slanging yayo all day long
But they wrong, so I'm solo (so low) and so broke
Saving up for some Jordan's, cause they dope
I got a girl and I love her but she broke too
And so am I, I can't take her to the place she wanna go to
So we argue and playfight, all day and night
Making passionate love 'til the day light
Plus we bout to get evicted, can't pay the rent
Guess it's time to see who really is your friend
You tell me you pregnant and I'm amazed
So many blessings while we stressing looking for them 'Better Dayz'

Now me and you was real cool, hell on them square fools
Since back in high school we was true, me and you
Only part of us separated we stay faded
Affiliated with gang bangers and still made it
Up in the gym, mess with me, gotta mess with him
Still dressing like grown men, when rolling
Out in the dark, smoking Newports, gaming marks
Gotta place in my heart, homie stay smart
Locked you up in the pen and gave you 3 to 10
I send you letters with naked flicks of old friends
Hoping you well, I know it's Hell
Doing time in the cell you need mail, when you in jail
And me I'm doing cool
I've settled down had a family, working and night school
Every once in awhile, I reminisce
And wonder how we ever came to this
I miss the 'Better Dayz'

Better dayz, Better dayz
Heeyyy
Better dayz
Thinking bout better dayz
Better dayz, Better dayz, Better dayz
Heeyy
Better dayz
Got me thinking bout better dayz
