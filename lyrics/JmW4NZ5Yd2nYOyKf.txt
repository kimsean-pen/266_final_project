A fire's gotta burn
The world is gonna turn
A rain has gotta fall
Fate is gonna call
But I just keep on breathing
Long as my heart is beating

Someone's gotta hate
It's never gonna change
Gets harder everyday
It's a hell of a place
To keep your heart from freezing

To keep yourself believing

But I won't run
I'm not afraid
I'll look 'em in the eye

Gonna hear me say it

My life
My love
My sex
My drug
My lust
My god it ain't no sin
Can I get it?
Can I get an Amen?
My grace
My church
My pain
My tears
My hurt
My god, I'll say it again

Can I get it?
Can I get an Amen?
Can I get it?
Can I get an Amen?
Can I get it?
Can I get an Amen?

Life has gotta kill
Faith is gonna blind
Hope is gonna fade
The truth is gonna lie
Sometimes there's no reason
To justify the meaning

But I won't run
I'm not ashamed
It's gonna take more than this for me to break

My life
My love
My sex
My drug
My lust
My god it ain't no sin
Can I get it?
Can I get an Amen?
My grace
My church
My pain
My tears
My hurt
My god, I'll say it again

Can I get it?
Can I get an Amen?
Can I get it?
Can I get an Amen?
Can I get it?
Can I get an Amen?

My life, my love, my sex, my drug, my lust...

My life
My love
My sex
My drug
My lust
My god it ain't no sin
Can I get it?
Can I get an Amen?
My grace
My church
My pain
My tears
My hurt
My god, I'll say it again
Can I get it?
Can I get an Amen?
Can I get an Amen?
Can I get it?
Can I get an Amen?
