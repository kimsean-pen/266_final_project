Oh, don't say it now
Wait, don't just give up
Move from your old house
This city can be so loud

Say what you gotta
Sleep in somehow

Inside of reverie how do you know
When you've gone too far?
And it's all ash and dust
Well then I won't let you to take me for a ride

Say what you gotta
Sleep in somehow
Leave things on speaking terms
And I'll see you around

It's all ash and dust
I won't let you take me for a ride
And it's all over us
And still I won't let you take me for a ride
