You mean I've been dancin' on the floor, darlin'
And I feel like I need some more and I
Feel your body close to mine and I
Move on love it's about that time
Make me feel mighty real
Make me feel mighty real

You make me feel mighty real
You make me feel mighty real

When we get home darlin' and it's
Nice and dark and the music's in Vienna
Still you're hot and you kiss me back and it
Feels real good and I know you love me
Like you should

Oh, you make me feel mighty real
You make me feel mighty real

Make me feel mighty real
Make me feel mighty real
Make me feel mighty real
Make me feel mighty real

I feel real, I feel real, I feel real, I feel real
I feel real, I feel real, I feel real, I feel real, uh

I feel real, I feel real, I feel real, I feel real
Uh, I feel real, uh, I feel real
I feel real, I feel real, I feel real, I feel real

You make me feel mighty real
You make me feel mighty real
Oh, you make me feel mighty real
You make me feel mighty real

I feel real when you touch me
I feel real when you kiss me
I feel real when you touch me
I feel real when you want me
