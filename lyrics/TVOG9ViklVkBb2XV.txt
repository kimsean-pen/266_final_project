I am you

Stillborn into this state of being numb
I am the temple and the sacrifice
The shrine, entombed within lies all I am
And you, the womb from whence I came

I am you

If I am you, no life is sacred in my hands
If I am you, no love will prosper in this world
If I am you, I am the faith to end all faith
If I am you, you shall not live to save yourselves

I bring no God, no after world
I am no more than a lie
I love your life not for you
I am a throne made from dust

I bring no God, no after world
I am no more than a lie
I love your life not for you
I am a throne made from dust

If I am you, no life is sacred in my hands
If I am you, no love will prosper in this world
If I am you, I am the faith to end all faith
If I am you, you shall not live to save yourselves

If I am you, no life is sacred in my hands
If I am you, no love will prosper in this world
If I am you, I am the faith to end all faith
If I am you, you shall not live to save yourselves
