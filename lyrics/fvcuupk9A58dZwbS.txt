The demon skin is covered in fine mist
Opened his hand in my hand, holding my eyes to the future
Hovering above myself, letting loose the guided
Punching these holes in my head, the space time paradigm

Omnipresence
Primal instincts

Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go
Let it go

Calling reason, finding you
These wild hearts run
Ever deeper, burning through
These wild hearts run

Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go
Let it go

Letting me free the quintessence in fine mist
Opened his hand in center, holding my eyes to the future
Hovering above myself, letting loose the guided
Punching these holes in my head, losing my skin to the landslide

Omnipresence
Primal instinct

Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go
Let it go

Calling reason, finding you
These wild hearts run
Ever deeper, burning through
These wild hearts run

Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go
Let it go

Shield failure
Speed farewell
Shield failure
Speed farewell
