I stand here waiting for
You to bang the gong
To crash the critic saying
"Is it right or is it wrong?"
If only fame had an I'V, baby could I bear
Being away from you

I found the vein
Put it in here
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause
Live for the applause-plause

Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause
Give me that thing that I love
(Turn the lights on)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch
(Make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love
(Turn the lights on)

Put your hands up, make 'em touch
(Make it real loud)
...
Make it real loud
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
...
Make it real loud
Put your hands and make 'em touch, touch.

Put your hands up
...
Put your hands up
Put your hands up

Put your hands up
...
Put your hands up
Put your hands up

Put your hands up
...
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Put your hands up

...
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Put yoyr hands up
...
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause
Live for the applause-plause

Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause...
Give me that thing that I love
(Turn the lights on)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
(Make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love
(Turn the lights on)

Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
(Make it real loud)

...
Make it real loud
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
...
Make it real loud
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
Put your hands up
