Quietly while you were asleep
The moon and i were talking
I asked that she'd always keep you protected
She promised you her light that you so gracefully carry
You bring your light and shine like morning
And then the wind pulls the clouds across the moon
Your light fills the darkest room
And I can see the miracle that keeps us from falling
She promised
All the sweetest gifts
That only the heavens
Could bestow
You bring your light and shine like morning
And as you so gracefully give her light as long as you live
I will always remember
This moment
