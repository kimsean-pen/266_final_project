It's like it never even happened
I never got to know this side of you
Frozen all connections
Now I can't find the person that was you
Oh no, I can't remember
The leaves were bound to change
I loved you in the summer
The leaves were bound to change

Why can't I seem to find my mind?
The time is almost up
It's wide, I'm fried and died inside
It's deep and broken up
Host of the feelings left, isn't there
Ran outside to waste his cares
If had done faster, then I'm spared to sleep instead of suck
Maybe it's time to quit the game
It wasn't me
The world is drunk

I'm a piston on a mission, pumping out my guts
She said I was something like a filler on her molar
A hibernating Siamese twin on her shoulder

I lose my shit enough, I bite a bit more than I can chew
You collected fashion tips and now I wear a cage
Stuck in a batters grip, faking a limp
Happy to cry, waiting for gifts, biding my time
I injected apathy attempt to disengage
Avoiding those parroting, they won't decide a
They won't decide a
They won't decide a
They won't decide a thing

When I saw you there looking like a shadow
Of what you were, I could see my sorrow
Shining in the moment
When you turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around my world
Shining in the moment
Hit me with the cold
I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm without you, girl
Snow falling, downpour, downpour
Snow falling, downpour, downpour

I'm so sick in the brain, I don't even practice keeping in touch
Throw my thoughts in the drain
The clutch of abraxas stone, torn deep through the rug
Watch my drippin bone erupt,
as I bellow the message, complete with the flood
When the hot fog rolls on a match and sparks it up
Ribbon lip quiver, God callin' when I've had enough

I'm lost
Why can't I seem to find my mind?
The time is almost up
It's wide, I'm fried and died inside
It's deep and broken up
If had done faster, then I'm spared to sleep instead of suck
Maybe it's time to quit the game
It wasn't me
The world is drunk
