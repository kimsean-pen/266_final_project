of a life that's allotted to be yours
a trifle
oh take it from me
that tonight is closed

hot pepper hot pepper
hot pepper look at me i am alone
hot pepper hot pepper
i'm single i have no friends in my new city
hot pepper i'm alone
without dignity for you to consider
hot pepper hot pepper
look at me

to babble
too big for
your likes exposed
the idol grants you this lie that is ours

hot pepper hot pepper
hot pepper look at me i am alone
hot pepper hot pepper
no friends in my new city
hot pepper vanity
without consequence for you to trip over
hot pepper hot pepper
hot pepper hot pepper
look at me
