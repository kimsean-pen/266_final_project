Broken down, misunderstood, our love burned away.
You dragged me down,
turned my life around, you drove me insane because,
I felt alone when I was deep in
love, I felt alone when I was with you,
and I've never been so sure of
anything that I wanted you out of my life.
And I know that I've been followed,
by my troubles and my sorrows,
now I'm standing by the shallows,
and I say, I won't be fighting for love, fighting for love.
Fighting for love.
I thought you were my remedy, the one who'd bring me clarity,
now I'm stronger than I've ever been and I say
I won't be fighting for love, fighting for love.
Wasted time on all your lies and you're the one to blame
that all my life I've been losing every fight, you know,
I felt alone when I was deep in
love, I felt alone when I was with you,
and I've never been so sure of
anything that I wanted you out of my life.
And I know that I've been followed,
by my troubles and my sorrows,
now I'm standing by the shallows,
and I say, I won't be fighting for love, fighting for love.
Fighting for love.
I thought you were my remedy, the one who'd bring me clarity,
now I'm stronger than I've ever been and I say
I won't be fighting for love, fighting for love.
Hey, I won't be fighting for love.
