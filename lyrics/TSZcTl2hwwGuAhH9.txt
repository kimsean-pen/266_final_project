I hear the ravens calling to you
Oh soulless creature violent death
Scapegoated, blame laid upon me
I'll be damned to take what's left

The real root of the problem
Has been buried too deep
By the time you get to it
Problems will have surpassed the end

Dig them up, Dig them up
Or let the pendulum swing (2x)

I put my hand to your heart
And let the bullet burn your blood
You seem to me death incarnate
Raper of life, killer of love

The real root of the problem
Has been buried too deep
By the time you get to it
Problems will have surpassed the end

Dig them up, Dig them up
Or let the pendulum swing (2x)

The real root of the problem
Has been buried too deep
By the time you get to it
Problems will have surpassed the end

Dig them up, Dig them up
Or let the pendulum swing (2x)
