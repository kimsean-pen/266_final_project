Boy, stupid boy
Don't sit at the table
Until you're able to

Toy, broken toy
Shout and shout
You're inside out

If you don't know
Electric Co
If you don't know
Electric Co

Red, running red
You play for real
The toy could feel

A hole in your head
You go in shock
You're spoon fed

If you don't know
Electric Co
If you don't know
Electric Co

Two, three, four
I can't stop
Useless is the castle wall
Useless is the castle wall
He's gonna jump

If you don't know
Electric Co
If you don't know
Electric Co
If you don't know
Electric Co
If you don't know
Electric Co
If you don't know
Electric Co
If you don't know
Electric Co

Just to hear me

I've found my way home
