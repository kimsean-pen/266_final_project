It's a little bit late now
But there's times you will get a little bit out of hand
Making all of a spill
And if we can lay this down you're going all the way
Take a look and I'll check it out
'Cause I can always find it

Such a lonely place, ooh
This room without your face, ooh

Ooh, American Science
All night long she can two-step and sway
Ooh, it's such awful manners
Don't keep me waiting come and lie beside me

A little megalomania becomes you evidently
There ain't a thing you can't acquire with your cling-wrap
Plaything just look at this state
I crawl around in a daze
Like symptomatic case of your soul persuasion

Such a lonely place, ooh
This room without your face, ooh

Ooh, American Science
All night long she can two-step and sway
Ooh, it's such awful manners
Don't keep me waiting come and lie beside me

Ooh, it's a little bit later now
There's times you will, let it all get out of hand
When you feel you feel
I just switched on the operation

Such a lovely face, ooh
And pulls me into place, ooh

Ooh, American Science
All night long she can two-step and sway
Ooh, it's such awful manners
Don't keep me waiting come and lie beside me

Ooh, American Science
All night long she can two-step and sway
Ooh, it's such awful manners
Don't keep me waiting come and lie beside me
