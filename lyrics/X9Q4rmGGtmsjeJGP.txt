Something in the way you look inside
Something in the way you leap
Something in the way your smile disappears
When you look at me

Something in the way you love me
Something in the way you don't
Something in the way you talk so sadly
Something in the way you look

Something in the way you hate me
Something in the way you don't
Something in the way we breathe each other
Something in the way we choke

Something in the way we breathe each other
Something in the way we choke
