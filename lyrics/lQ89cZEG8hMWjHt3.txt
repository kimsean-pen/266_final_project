As the floods of God
Wash away thin air
They say it was written
In the page of the Lord
But I was looking
For that great jazz note
That destroyed
The walls of Jericho

The winds of fear
Whip away the sickness
The messages on the tablet
Was Valium
As the planets form
That golden cross Lord
I'll see you on
The Holy Cross Roads

After all this time
To believe in Jesus
After all those drugs
I thought I was Him
After all my lying
And a-crying
And my suffering
I ain't good enough
I ain't clean enough
To be Him

The tribal wars
Burning up the homeland
The fuel of evil
Is raining from the sky
The sea of lava
Flowing down the mountain
The time will sweep
Us sinners by

Holy rollers roll
Give generously now
Pass the hubcap please
Thank you Lord
