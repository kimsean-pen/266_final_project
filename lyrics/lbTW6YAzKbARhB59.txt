The sun is out, the sky is blue
There's not a cloud to spoil the view
But it's raining, raining in my heart

The weather man says clear today
He doesn't know you've gone away
And it's raining, raining in my heart

Oh, misery, misery
What's gonna become of me?

I tell my blues they mustn't show
But soon these tears are bound to flow
'Cause it's raining, raining in my heart

But it's raining, raining in my heart

And it's raining, raining in my heart

Oh, misery, misery
What's gonna become of me?

I tell my blues they mustn't show
But soon these tears are bound to flow
'Cause it's raining, raining in my heart

Raining in my heart
Raining in my heart
