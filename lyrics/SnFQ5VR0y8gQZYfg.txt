If I walk this way
It's an easy way home
Hand in han with someone I don't know
Beautiful and maybe tonight
And then the morning comes, and then the morning comes
Now I wish I was alone again
Now I wish that I could remember your name
Now I wish I was alone again
Coffee Cigarette Goodbye
Strangers Connect Tonight
But we don't know why, and we don't know how
But we could fall into each other now
But if I'm making my way into the back of your mind
Hand in hand but I know you this time
Beautiful and I know its right
And the the morning comes, and then the morning comes
I never wanna be alone again
And now I know that I remember your name
I never wanna be alone again

But we don't know why, and we don't know how
But we could fall into each other now
Strangers Connect Tonight
But we don't know why, and we don't know how
But we could fall into each other now
Or we could fall into each other now
Oh woah Oh woah
but maybe
oh maybe
oh maybe
But we could fall into each other now
Strangers Connect Tonight
But we don't know why, and we don't know how
But we could fall into each other now
But we could fall into each other now
But we could fall into each other now
Strangers Connect Tonight
Strangers Connect Tonight
But we don't know why
But we could fall into each other now
Strangers Connect Tonight
Strangers Connect Tonight
But we don't know why
