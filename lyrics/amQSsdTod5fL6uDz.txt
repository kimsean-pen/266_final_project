It's hard to have strength when there's nothing to eat
And it's hard to eat when you don't have the teeth
And how, when you lose the one thing you love
There's nothing below and there's nothing above.

I've been going through changes
I've been going through changes
I've been going through changes
With nothing at all.

It's hard to accept what you don't understand
And it's hard to launch without knowing how to land
And how, when it burns, you can't change a thing
You can soften the blow, but you can't stop the sting

I've been going through changes
And I've been going through changes
And I've been going through changes

Nothing at all, nothing at all!

I am still yours even if you're not mine
I stare at the floor and I study the lines
Oh I took my place at the back of the crowd
Baby I couldn't see, but at least it was loud.
At least it was loud.

And I've been going through changes
And I've been going through changes
And I've been going through changes

And I know that I needed changes
But not this, this is not painless
(oh) no, this is not painless.
oooohh uuu. Nothing at all.
