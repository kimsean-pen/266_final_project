I look beyond the center
We're not safe on the water

I look beyond center
You won't say
You won't say love is dead

Wait for all this time
Don't want to wait for all this time

I look beyond the center
We're not safe on the water

We're not safe on the water
You won't say
You won't say love is dead

Wait for all this time
Words of love echo all this time

I wait for Millicent to name
The life that she wants to save
I wait for sentiment to fade
Want to wait, wait for love

I look beyond the vacant
Reflections on the water

They cost us all we wanted
Say love and lost hope

I'll never say wait for all this time
Words below ache for all this time

I wait for Millicent to say
Watch before they fall on the wrong side
I wait for, you wait for dawn
To tend to their lust
You wait too long

I look beyond the center
We're not safe on the water

We're not safe on the water
You won't say
You won't say love is dead

Wait for all this time
Words of love ache for all this time

I wait for Millicent to call
I wait for Millicent to one side, alone
I wait for innocence and
The words that wash away
You wait too long

You wait for
You wait for love

You wait for
Wait for love

You wait for
You wait for love

You wait for
You wait for love
