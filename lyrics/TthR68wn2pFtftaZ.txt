Oow
Yeah, you know they're gonna bring it down now
They're gonna wreck it down, yeah
Something's come to rock me
And I can't keep my head
I get nervous in the New York City streets
Where my legacy treads.
I know I'm better off standing in the shadows
Far from humans with guns
But now it's too late, there's no escape
From what they have done.
Come on.
I'm going deeper underground
There's too much panic in this town.
I'm going deeper underground
There's too much panic in this town.
I'm going deeper underground
But I got to go deeper, got to go much deeper
yeah.
They gonna wreck it down, yeah.
Step do-do-do-do-dow-di-dow-di-di-down
Hey, yeah, we're gonna bring it down, yeah
Some people with a pocket full of money
And an eye full of hate
Take a pleasure in destruction of the very thing
That they tried to create.
Somebody tell me why does all mankind
Only tamper and touch?
Have a habit where they bite off more they can chew
And now it's too much.
I'm going deeper underground, hey ha
There's too much panic in this town.
I'm going deeper underground
There's too much panic in this town.
I'm going deeper underground
There's too much panic in this town.
I'm going, I'm going,
I'm going deeper underground.
I'm going, I'm going,
I'm going deeper underground.
I'm going, I'm going,
I'm going deeper underground.
I'm going, I'm going,
I'm going deeper underground.
Something's come to rock me
And I can't keep my head
I get nervous in the New York City streets
Where my legacy treads.
I know I'm better off standing in the shadows
Far from humans with guns
But now it's too late, there's no escape
From what they have done.
