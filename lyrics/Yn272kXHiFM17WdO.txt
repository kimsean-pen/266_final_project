They've been breaching my freedom
They point invisible guns
Humble to whatever they told me
Humble to The Almighty One
Got me moving backwards most of the time
Mallets ringin' all over town
Conflicted by the one I'm noddin' behind
Pulled between the truth and judging eyes

It's not a sin
I hear the Devil's callin'
It's not a sin
I hear the Devil's callin'
Meeee
He's callin'
Meeee
He's callin'
Meeee

Why do I feel so alone in the back of the bar
Sippin' beer out a jar in room full of people that mean me no harm
The ocean feels calm
When it's only me and her around
Around, mallets over town
Children cryin'
People dyin'
But my country told me
Put your head down, baby boy
Baby, put your head down, baby boy

It's not a sin
I hear the Devil's callin'
It's not a sin
I hear the Devil's callin'
Meeee
He's callin'
Meeee
He's callin'
Meeee

It's not a sin
I hear the Devil's callin'
It's not a sin
I hear the Devil's callin'
Meeee
He's callin'
Meeee
He's callin'
Meeee
