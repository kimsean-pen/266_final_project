I wanna know, wanna know how to leave my soul behind for you to take
It's getting late and don't you hate it how the clock moves fast when your heart's
been racing
And I fell fast like lead from the sky
The minute that you told me 'bout the music you like

You said "come along get in my car, I know a place and it ain't too far"
Turn the music up louder, girl
I know we only got an hour, girl
Before I leave you for a long, long time
And I really wanna make you mine

So turn the music up louder, girl
Going down, going down the road where the moon stares down on the stories told
Live for the moment go ahead and hold it tight to the memories stuck in your soul
And we scream out to the ears in the sky
Loudest beasts in the wild tonight
Drive 'round town til the time's are up

I don't wanna go cause I haven't had enough
So turn the music up louder, girl
I know we only got an hour, girl
Before I leave you for a long, long time
And I really wanna make you mine
So turn the music up

Turn the music up, louder girl
So turn the music up louder, girl
I know we only got an hour, girl
Before I leave you for a long, long time
And I really wanna make you mine
So turn the music up louder, girl
I like the way you move your shoulders, girl
When we're driving up the west coast, girl
So trap me in this moment, girl
Turn the music up
Turn the music up
Turn the music up
Turn the music up
I wanna know, wanna know, how to leave my soul behind for you to take
