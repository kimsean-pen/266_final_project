Pills n potions, we're overdosin'
I'm angry, but I still love you
Pills n potions, we're overdosin'
Can't stand it, but I still love you

I still love, I still love,
I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love,
I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love

Ayo, they could never make me hate you
Even though what you was doin' wasn't tasteful
Even though you out here lookin' so ungrateful
I'mma keep it movin', be classy and graceful

I told 'em it's no friends in the game, you ain't learn that yet
All the bridges you came over, don't burn that yet
Niggas want respect, but niggas ain't earn that yet
Self-righteous and entitled, but they swearin' on the bible

That they love you when really they no different from all your rivals
But I still don't wish death on 'em, I just reflect on 'em

Pills n potions, we're overdosin'
I'm angry, but I still love you
Pills n potions, we're overdosin'
Can't stand it, but I still love you

I still love, I still love,
I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love,
I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love

Yo, people will love you and support you when it's beneficial
I'mma forgive, I won't forget, but I'mma dead the issue
Soon as you outta niggas lives is when they start to miss you
They see you doin' good, now it's kinda hard to diss you

Niggas be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you
Niggas be mad when they can't come and live lavish with you
B-B-B-But I sped off in a Benzy
I see the envy when I'm causin' a frenzy

So I pop pills for 'em
Cop cribs in the hills on 'em

Pills n potions, we're overdosin'
I'm angry, but I still love you
Pills n potions, we're overdosin'
Can't stand it, but I still love you

I still love, I still love,
I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love,
I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love

I get high off your memory
I get high off your memory
I get high off your memory
In due time we'll be fine
In due time

I still love, I still love,
I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love,
I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
