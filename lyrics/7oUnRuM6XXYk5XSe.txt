Days alone, never felt like this
The lights of home, a year away
And it's too late to fight it all, just drive.
And the streets... glow... and the night...
The night is soft

Soft

And it's all inviting
as anyone could ever know
and this warm collective we endure...
We endure and pass the moment
We endure and pass the moon.
We endure and pass the moment
We endure.
We endure and pass the moment
We endure and pass the moon.
We endure and pass the moment
We endure.

Here's a little riddle bout a when I was a little toddle,
piddle in the puddle and my head was in a muddle
you can sing it when you're sad,
you can sing it when you're mad,
you can sing it in the shower come along the latest's
Gaia to gaia to gaia to gaia to gaia
to gaia to gaia to gaia to gaia to gaia
to gaia to gaia to gaia to gaia to gaia
to gaia to gaia to gaia to gaia to gaia

So we fall on warm silence
I know, yes, I know we all go away.

If you feel like you are incomplete,
yet you are still in love yet you are sleeping,
eternal I, I, I, I
So we fall on warm silence
I know we all go away!.
