This time you'd better bite your tongue
Think twice before you open that mouth
Take a breath, hold it in your lungs
Being from rage, will it overcome?

I feel the tension rising high
A feel a hump, down in my chest
Nothing is strange, I see in red
Can't hold it back
Here comes my.

Temper temper, time to explode
Feels good when I lose control
Temper temper, time to explode
Chamber's empty, time to reload

Too late cause now you can't disarm
Too slow, you know you should've backed down
Did you think before you crossed that line?
This intervention's gonna be divine

I feel the time is crawling near
I feel the sweat dripping down my face
Nothing is strange, I see in red
Can't hold it back
Here comes my.

Temper temper, time to explode
Feels good when I lose control
Temper temper, time to explode
Chamber's empty, time to reload

Temper temper, time to explode
Temper temper, time to explode
Temper temper, time to explode
Temper temper, time to explode
Temper temper, time to explode
Feels good when we lose control
Temper temper, time to reload
Chamber's empty, time to reload

Here comes my.

Temper temper, time to explode
Feels good when I lose control
Temper temper, time to explode
Chamber's empty, time to reload
Temper temper, time to explode
Feels good when I lose control
Temper temper, time to explode
Chamber's empty, time to reload
