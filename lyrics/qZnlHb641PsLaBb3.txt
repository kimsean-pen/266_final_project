I don't feel as if I know you
You take up all my time
The days are long and the nights will throw you away
'Cause the sun don't shine

Nobody ever mentions the weather can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember life is a game we play

We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
'Cause the years are falling by like the rain
And it's never gonna be the same
Till the life I knew comes to my house and says
Hello

There ain't no sense in feeling lonely
They got no faith in you
But I've got a feeling you still owe me
So wipe the shit from your shoes

Nobody ever mentions the weather can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember life is a game we play

We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
'Cause the years are falling by like the rain
And it's never gonna be the same
Till the life I knew comes to my house and says

Hello, hello
(It's good to be back, it's good to be back)
Hello, hello
(It's good to be back, it's good to be back)
Hello, hello
(It's good to be back, it's good to be back)
Hello, hello, hello
