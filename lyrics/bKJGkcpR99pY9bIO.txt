She keeps feeling for the blindfold
She keeps wishing for the secret society to fall
She keeps watching for the jaguar
With the silver trembling hand

Dagger
Night fight
Tomorrow
She forgets about the fear

When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
When she's high

She puts diamonds on her forehead
They remind her how the animals
And trees and insects call
Is it wrong not to believe?
Nature makes us all compete

Daggers
Night fight
Tomorrow
She forgets about the fear

When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
When she's high

When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
When she's high

When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
