There's definitely some pressure
And stress in my life
Ah, with trying to balance
So many different activities and everything

Kinda, sometimes I just need
To step back from it
Um, and sit down and think to myself
"Ok, it's all gonna happen
It's gonna be ok
You just have to take it as it comes
And roll with the punches"
