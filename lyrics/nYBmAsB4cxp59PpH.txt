I just got fixated on somebody
When I say "somebody", I mean you
This obsession's much more than a habit
But I can't help myself
I can't help myself

I've been calling you from private numbers
Just to hear your voice then I hang up
So damn hot you're showing up the summer
But I can't help myself
I can't help myself

I got a one track mind
And it's takin' up all my time
I got a one track mind
And it's all on you
(It's all on you!)
It's all on you
(It's all on you!)

I got a one track mind
And it's takin' up all my time
I got a one track mind
And it's all on you
(It's all on you!)
It's all on you
(It's all on you!)

Feeling myself when I think about you
And don't believe your friends, I'm not a creep
(Not a creep, I'm not a creep)
The minute that you tell me I'm allowed to
I'mma pick you up and I'mma take you out

I got a one track mind
And it's takin' up all my time
I got a one track mind
And it's all on you
(It's all on you!)
It's all on you
(It's all on you!)

I got a one track mind
And it's takin' up all my time
I got a one track mind
And it's all on you
(It's all on you!)
It's all on you
(It's all on you!)

You might think I'm crazy, but I'm crazy 'bout you
(Baby, can you blame me looking good like you do)
You might think I'm crazy, but I'm crazy 'bout you
(Baby, can you blame me looking good like you do)

And my friends they don't get it
But they say I'm obsessed
But I'm upset
And I won't stand here for nothing less than your caress

And I won't rest
And I won't sleep
And I'm a mess
And I won't eat
And when it all is said and done
I know that you're the onle

One track mind
(One track mind, one track mind)
And it's takin' up all my time
(Takin' up my mind's eye, girl)
I got a one track mind (Ooh)
And it's all on you
(It's all on you!)
It's all on you
(It's all on you!)

I got a one track mind
And it's takin' up all my time
(One track mind; Takin' up my mind's eye, girl)
I got a one track mind
(One track mind, Ooh, one track mind)
And it's all on you
(It's all on you!)
It's all on you
(It's all on you!)
