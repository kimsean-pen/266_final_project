Fade into dust
Baby, take charge now
See if you can
See into the fire

You're not a rerun
Not just another one
You're a new friend
It just began
Who's up tonight?
Whose girl gonna get picked up tonight?
Who's open now?
Look at me, look at me
Bad man wanna be me
Look at me, look at me
Bad man wanna be me

Fade into dust
Baby, take charge

But who's hot tonight?
Whose girl wanna get picked up tonight?
But it's just another one
Pull it back for another one
And I'm gone, gone, gone.
