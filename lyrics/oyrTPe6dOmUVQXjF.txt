So cold, so very distant
Where does all the time go?
It's such a shame that I could walk
right past you and not know the difference
How could you expect a title when you live underground?
How could you be so cavalier when this house is so cold?

I'd rather say you rest in peace, no skin off my back
Even though it's your blood in my veins, I do with it what I choose
Run to your place of hiding but you can't escape the guilt
Wake up and wish to start again, but what does that mean to me?
Nothing

I'd rather say you rest in peace, no skin off my back
Even though it's your blood in my veins, I do with it what I choose
I'd rather say you rest in peace, no skin off my back
Even though it's your blood in my veins, I do with it what I choose

My life to lead and my soul to keep
How do I save your name from dishonor?
No more dishonor
Shame on you
Yeah
