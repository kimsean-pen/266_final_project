She saw the look in his eyes
And she knew better
He wanted her tonight
And it was now or never
He made her feel so sad

Oh, oh, oh, Jamie's cryin'
Oh, oh, oh, Jamie's cryin'

Now Jamie wouldn't say, "All right"
She knew he'd forget her
And so they said goodnight
And now he's gone forever

She wants to send him a letter
Just to try to make herself feel better
It said, "Give me"
("Give me a call sometime")
But she knows what that'll get her

Oh, oh, oh, Jamie's cryin'
Oh, oh, oh, Jamie's cryin'

Now Jamie's been in love before
And she knows what love is for
It should mean, a little, a little more
Than one-night stands

She wants to send him a letter
Just to try to make herself feel better
It said, "Give me"
("Give me a call sometime")
But she knows what that'll get her

Oh, oh, oh, Jamie's cryin'

Oh, oh, oh, Jamie's cryin'
Oh, oh, oh, Jamie's cryin'
Oh, oh, oh, Jamie's cryin'
Oh, oh, oh, Jamie's cryin'
