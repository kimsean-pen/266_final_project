t was in London,
Where we heard the revolution,
From Covent Garden,
All the way down to Brixton.

It was in Tottenham,
Man got shot by a policeman,
A young girl went to test them,
Went up against the system,
Oh oh, I don't know

Who are you
Who are you

On the television,
Of course they blame the youth for disruption,
Cause they took Fortnum & Mason,
And nothing said about the shooting,
Just the looting

It was in London
It was in London

And it was thunder,
Caught between love and anger,
From Trafalgar,
All the way up to Camden

Can you believe this is London?
Can you believe this is London?
Can you believe this is London?
Can you believe this is London?
Can you believe this is London?
Can you believe this is London?
Can you believe this is London?

London town, London town
London town, London town
