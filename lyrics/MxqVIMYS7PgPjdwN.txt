It seems to me
there's something serious beginning
A new approach found
to the meaning of life
Deny that happiness
is open as an option
and disappointment
disappears overnight
Say that love
is an impossible dream
Face the facts
that's what it's always been
Relax
What you see is what you see
and what you get
is a new philosophy

(That's what you got
That's what you get)

Miserablism
Is is and isn't isn't
Miserablism
Is is and isn't isn't

Meanwhile your life
is still directed as a drama
with realism
on the sparsest of sets
Every performance
tends to reach the same conclusion
No happy endings
but a message to depress
saying life
is an impossible scheme
That's the point
of this philosophy

Miserablism
Is is and isn't isn't
Miserablism
Is is and isn't isn't

But if 'is' wasn't
and 'isn't' were
you can't be sure
but you might find ecstasy

Oh, no!

Just for the sake of it
make sure you're always frowning
(Angst! Angst! Angst!)
It shows the world
that you've got substance and depth
You know life
is an impossible scheme
and love
an imperceptible dream

(That's what you got
That's what you get)

Miserablism
Is is and isn't isn't
Miserablism
Is is and isn't isn't
miserable
