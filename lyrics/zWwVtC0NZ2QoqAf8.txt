Calling out of context
Just to see her
Falling out of sunset
Into your blue sky
Just to see her

I see your light is shining, where there was no face
I see what its defining, from another space
I see what's different in me
And what's not the same
Now I see it both ways, just for instance now

Rowing out to sea, rowing out to sea
Oh I don't see me

Calling out, sending out, just to see her
I see what's different in me and what's not the same
Now I see it both ways rowing out to sea

Over the waves, over the broad waves
Rowing out to sea, rowing out to sea
Over the waves, over the sea
Calling out to sea
Calling out to sea
