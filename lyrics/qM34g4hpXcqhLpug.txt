Pain is not what you ask for
But it is always what you get.
Afraid of the unknown
You repeat all you did before.

Fear of losing and mistaken again
Will take everything you have and leave you in pain

Questions and doubts are eating you alive
You want to live but slowly you die

Just stop for a second and:

Feel the light dancing, see the reality
Hear your heart screaming, fool the gravity.
Breathe in the marmalade sky
Absorb its colors it's divine
Breathe in the marmalade sky
Absorb the colors it's divine

Forgiveness is the elixir for the peace of mind
Find and feel each pixel before you become blind
Passion is ingredient for the happy life recipe
Love's the bridge between imagination and reality
Clear your mind
Clear your mind into crystal clarity
Forget the rules of the dead society
Build your own kingdom in the clouds
Break the laws invented by fake lords.

Questions and doubts are eating you alive
You want to live but slowly you die

Feel the light dancing, see the reality
Hear your heart screaming, fool the gravity.
Breathe in the marmalade sky
Absorb the colors it's divine
Breathe in the marmalade sky
Absorb the colors it's divine

Fear of losing and mistaken again
Will take everything you have and leave you in pain
