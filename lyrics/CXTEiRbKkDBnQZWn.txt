And so I know, it's begun again
Never be the same, and with that I said
Never ever be this way again
Hold on 'til the end (campfire girls make me feel alright)
(Campfire girls make me feel alright)

Like it's the last hello
Whirlwinds and roller coasters
Long grass making shapes hello
Disappearing, disappearing floating graves
Never, ever, ever, ever be this way
Never ever be this way again
And so I know (campfire girls make me feel alright)
(Campfire girls make me feel alright)

It's begun again
Never be the same, and with that I said
Campfire girls, make me feel alright
