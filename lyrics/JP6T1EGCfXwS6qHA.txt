Gone so long I stepped out of the woods
Well I was misunderstood, but in light of it all
I sit back and check their disguise
Their dark shallow eyes, got lost in the haze of the light

So I sit back and watch
I see all their masks soon appear
Long for the woods
From this place I'll disappear

They all strive to deviate from the norm
But collectively swarm to be all the same, well
To alter image prosthetics are worn
Their primped plastic forms melt in the heat of the light

So I'll step to the light
I see all their masks soon appear
I long for the woods
From this place I'll disappear
Disappear
Disappear, oh Lord
Disappear
