Cut it open now
Yeah it's been a minute
Kept none of the vows
Yet another gimmick
Yeah you said hold on
But I didn't feel it
Yeah you said hold on
But I don't feel it

Keeping you close is hard
Ended up in the dark
Couldn't just play your part
Couldn't just play your part

Keeping you close is hard
Ended up in the dark
Couldn't play your part
Couldn't play your part

Cut it open now
Yeah it's been a minute
Kept none of the vows
Yet another gimmick
Yeah you said hold on
But I didn't feel it
Yeah you said hold on
But I don't feel it

Keeping you close is hard
Ended up in the dark
Couldn't just play your part
Couldn't just play your part

Keeping you close is hard
Ended up in the dark
Couldn't play your part
Couldn't play your part
