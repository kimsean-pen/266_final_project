There's something in the way
She moves made too distractions
I try to ride this way
To try and make a mess
Cos heavy in the air
Up the words that she left hanging
I try to walk away
But I only stand and stare

The rain that comes
Over the love that was left behind is gone
But the riverman runs
Found me the girl who'll electrify the storm
Cos in a little while
She'll be gone

(Hey yeeeeeeeeeeah)

I waited in the rain
My feet too wet to stand in
I shouted out your name
Behind the rainbow's end
But somewhere in the crowd
She heard me chained and changeling
Like a memory that fades
She slipped away again

The rain that comes
Over the love that was left behind is gone
But the riverman runs
Found me the girl who'll electrify the storm

But the rain that comes
Over the love that was left behind is gone
But the riverman runs
Found me the girl who'll electrify the storm
And in a little while
She'll be gone

(The riverman runs)
(But the riverman runs)
(The riverman runs)
(But the riverman runs)
