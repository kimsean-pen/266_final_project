Don't spit on me and shame yourself
Because you wish you were someone else
You look so clean but you spread your dirt
As if you think that words don't hurt

You build up walls no one can climb
The things you do should be a crime
You're the queen of superficiality
Keep your lies out of my reality

And when you're nice it's just a pose
You're one of those

[chorus]
Haters
Traitors to the human race
Haters
What a drag, what a waste
I'd like to see them disappear
They don't belong anywhere
Haters, haters

Spinning a web that's hard to see
Of envy, greed and jealousy
Feeling angry, but you don't know why
Why don't you look me in the eye

You want my friends, you want my clothes
You're one of those

[chorus]
Haters
Traitors to the human race
Haters
What a drag, what a waste
I'd like to see them disappear
They don't belong anywhere
Haters, haters, haters, haters

Different life forms
Different species
Broken promises and treaties
Talkin' 'bout exterminating
Not the haters, just the hating

You say your boyfriend's sweet and kind
But you've got your eyes on mine
Your best friend's got her eyes on yours
It all goes on behind closed doors

And when you're nice it's just a pose
You're one of those

[chorus]
Haters
Traitors to the human race
Haters
What a drag, what a waste
I'd like to see them disappear
They don't belong anywhere
Haters

Haters
Later for the alibis
Haters
Any shape, any size
I'd like to see them disappear
They don't belong anywhere

Haters
Traitors
Haters, haters
Haters
