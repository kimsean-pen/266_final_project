Sail Away with me honey
I put my heart in your hand
Sail Away with me honey
Now, now, now
Sail Away with me
What will be will be
I wanna hold you now
Now, now

Crazy skies all wild above me now
Winter howlin' at my face
And everythin' I held so dear
Disappeared without a trace
Oh all the times I've tasted love
Never knew quite what I had
Little darling if you hear me now
Never needed you so bad
Spinnin' round inside my head

Sail Away with me honey
I put my heart in your hand
Sail Away with me honey
Now, now, now
Sail Away with me
What will be will be
I wanna hold you now
Now, now

I've been talkin' drunken gibberish
Fallin' in and out of bars
Tryin' to get some explanation here
For the way some people are
How did it ever come so far?

Sail Away with me honey
I put my heart in your hand
Sail Away with me honey
Now, now, now
Sail Away with me
What will be will be
I wanna hold you now
Now, now

Sail Away with me honey
I put my heart in your hand
Sail Away with me honey
Now, now, now
Sail Away with me
What will be will be
I wanna hold you now
Now, now
Sail Away with me honey
I put my heart in your hand
You break me up if you pull me down
Woah
Sail Away with me
What will be will be
I wanna hold you now
Now, now
