when your range is off
when you call that complete
your finished task was a burden
I'll give you that to concede

if you wear a mask
if you wear a badge
if you're lost in the curtains of time
you'll be erased

sleep tight, gold night
protect my brain
I was bright, I was right
all the time

if you ever need to talk
I won't be around
if you ever need to fight for life
I'll make no sound

I completed your task
it was much too tough
your burdens now were twice removed
it must be rough

I use my golden light to find a way
your bones they were always, they were always in my way
the fire finds a way to completely erase
I followed you out
you threw up and you complained
and I bide my time, and I hide my glory away
in the basement room where you used to kneel and pray

if you need a friend now
better look some place else
you burned this bridge long ago
here's to your health
I'm a blue light, I'm a crippled coward
shining out in the night
the sky is clearer now that I'm filled with fright
