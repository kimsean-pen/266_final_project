Talk about your feelings
I'm goin' pitch black
Talk about my feelings
I don't wanna, fuck that
It don't believe me I mustn't whip that
Soft as the pillow is, ship this shit back

Stand up and notify the registry
I'm buying a house in a shit storm economy
Make love, I plagiarized the books I read
My infinite wisdom, belligerent at lightning speed
I'll go get the decider
I'll be the center divider
I could be more than just "Hey bro, listen"
I'll be claiming you flaggin
I'll be braggin I'm admin
I could fulfill the people's crave for pigskin

(Who am I kidding?)
And I'm assuming that you're worth it
You would never break my heart
The way you're killing me is perfect
Bleed me out and leave no scar
(Who am I kidding?)
I got a feeling I deserve it
Wanna hurt me? Baby, get in line
The way you're killing me is perfect
Stare until it makes me blind

Prey on my spirit til you come alive
Hydrate my fire 'til it smolders out
Can't fight the feeling this is meaningless
Who am I kidding I can't breathe without
Oh, it's calling me
I can't turn away
Treat me like a slave
I'll come willingly
Oh, you're the reason I get out of bed
Still can't fight the feeling this is meaningless

Small world syndrome, I can hear your criticism
Buh- buh- bouncing off the base of my buttons
(Meaningless)
You bluffin
I could go get the biggest brick so you could break in
I could constrict the citizen to make a payment

Talk about your feelings
I'm goin' pitch black
Talk about my feelings
I don't wanna, fuck that
It don't believe me I mustn't whip that
Soft as the pillow is, ship this shit back

(Who am I kidding?)
And I'm assuming that you're worth it
You would never break my heart
The way you're killing me is perfect
Bleed me out and leave no scar
(Who am I kidding?)
I got a feeling I deserve it
Wanna hurt me? Baby, get in line
The way you're killing me is perfect
Stare until it makes me blind
