I heard you told your friends I wrote you a breakup song
The funny thing is, it wasn't even about you
Ok, maybe I did
So, what if it was
That don't make you a king
The world ain't revolving around you.

I'm in my car, riding around
My bass is up, no slowing down
Love ain't a game, don't got no time
No, you don't see me crying, no baby, baby.

I ain't gonna hit you with a heartbreak song
I ain't gonna give you what you're betting on
‘Cause boy you don't deserve a single word
Don't know if you heard
I forgot all about you
I ain't gonna bore you with a sob story
Go crying to my friends and throw a hate party
It's so overrated, overplayed, and I'm ok
I'm just better without you.

I'm going out and making my own rules
One thing on my mind and baby, it ain't you
I'm turning up, I got it going on
So, I ain't gonna hit you with a heartbreak song.

You called to tell me that you made a mistake
But that was something I knew
So, now baby, baby, bye, bye, bye
I'm at the bar, martini twist
Boy hook it up, just read my lips
Love ain't a game, don't got no time
No, you don't see me cryin'.

I ain't gonna hit you with a heartbreak song
I ain't gonna give you what you're betting on
‘Cause boy you don't deserve a single word
Don't know if you heard
I forgot all about you
I ain't gonna bore you with a sob story
Go crying to my friends and throw a hate party
It's so overrated, overplayed, and I'm ok
I'm just better without you.

I'm going out and making my own rules
One thing on my mind and baby, it ain't you
I'm turning up, I got it going on
So, I ain't gonna hit you with a heartbreak song
I've been a hot mess looking in the mirror
(But if you need me)
I will be swinging from the chandelier.

I ain't gonna hit you with a heartbreak song
I ain't gonna give you what you're betting on, bettin' on, bettin' on

I ain't gonna hit you with a heartbreak song
I ain't gonna give you what you're betting on
‘Cause boy you don't deserve a single word
Don't know if you heard
I forgot all about you
I ain't gonna bore you with a sob story
Go crying to my friends and throw a hate party
It's so overrated, overplayed, and I'm ok
I'm just better without you.

I'm going out and making my own rules
One thing on my mind and baby, it ain't you
I'm turning up, I got it going on
So, I ain't gonna hit you with a heartbreak song.
Yeah, I ain't gonna hit you with a heartbreak song.
