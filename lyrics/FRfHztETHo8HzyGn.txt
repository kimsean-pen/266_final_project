When aimless hearts are suffering alone
And hope has turned its tide
When souls are empty, where do you go
For the resolution
We heard you calling, selling a solve
A way to heal our wounds
A violent passage soothing us all
For a time

It sounds like a fury
I'm sure it is
Something to cure me
The problem is

I don't believe you, no
I don't believe you, no

We stand here bleeding, left to atone
To pacify ourselves
We bought your gospel down to the bone
For a lie

That sounds like a fury
I'm sure it is
Something to cure me
The problem is

I don't believe you, no
I don't believe you, no

Whatever the voice you claim to be
Save your breath
The faintest faults are plain to see
Whatever the face your remedy
Lines you've read
Your vision holds no truth for me

But it sounds like a fury
I'm sure it is
Something to cure me
The problem is

I don't believe you

It sounds like a fury (I don't believe you)
I'm sure it is
Something to cure me (I don't believe you)
The problem is
It sounds like a fury (I don't believe you)
I'm sure it is (I don't believe you)
Something to cure me (I don't believe you)
The problem is (I don't believe you)
No
