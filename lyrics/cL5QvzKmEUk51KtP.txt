don't ask this time

don't ask the reasons why
you started on two feet
and ended on your knees
ah ahh
ah ahh

taking all the cues (?) from the past
build it into something that doesn't last
stake it on an empty threat
can you find the pieces to fit this yet?
'cause it looks like that you've got more to learn

learn
'cause it looks like that you've got more to learn

don't ask this time
don't ask the reasons why
you started on two feet
and ended on your knees
ah ahh
ah ahh
don't ask this time
don't ask the reasons why
you started on two feet
and ended on your knees

ah ahh
ah ahh

fall into the safety of force
stretching out your hands to grasp
a fragment of a hope to find
I don't see a place left (?) for you to climb
'cause it looks like that you've got more to learn
learn
'cause it looks like that you've got more to learn

learn
'cause it looks like that you've got more to learn

don't ask this time
