Watching
Always watching
The Snare
Our curse

Remember the cold
Remember that it follows forever

Remember the cold
Remember that it follows forever
The cold that came before
And the cold that comes after

Chill wind howls
All hearts dread

I see you watching
Your eyes sear craters in my flesh
I feel you always
I am writhing

I can see you watching
The hollow eyes sear craters in my flesh
I can feel you always
I am writhing

Watching
Always watching
The snare
Our curse

Flee with the sun

Your hand rests over mine
You're in every word that I've written
In every single line
You are in the wind when I listen

I feel your presence behind
In every step that I've taken
On every single path
I am writhing

Your hand rests over mine
You're in every word that I've written
In every single line
You are in the wind when I listen

I feel your presence behind
In every step that I've taken
On every single path
And I'm writhing

And I writhe
