Lying in a box
Dark with emotions
A claustrophobic disease sets in
Lungs drawing in more air
Lack of memory present
As the heart races with terror
Lack of oxygen
Lack of oxygen

Missing from the thrid world
Below the song I lie
Missing from the third world
Below the song I lie

Damage to visceral organs
Membranes of those cells open
Adrenaline damage imminent
Lack of oxygen
Storming of adrenaline
Incompatible abnormal rhythms
Triggering the fear to succumb

Knowing of what's to come
Pass away pass away
Wandering in to the other side
Calming the fear as a rush subsides
A stage of separation
From this physical world
Pass away passing on to the next
Sleeping in your grave - lack of oxygen

Lack of oxygen
On this side or the other
