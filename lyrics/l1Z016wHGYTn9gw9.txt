Please please tell me now
Please please tell me now
Please please tell me now
Please please tell me now

I made a break I run out yesterday
Tried to find my mountain hideaway
Maybe next year maybe no go
I know you're watching me every minute of the day yeah
I've seen the signs and the looks and the pictures
They give your game away yeah
There's a dream that strings the road
With broken glass for us to hold
And I cut so far before I had to say

Please please tell me now
Is there something I should know
Is there something I should say
That would make you come my way
Do you feel the same 'cos you don't let it show

People stare and cross the road from me
And jungle drums they all clear the way for me
Can you read my mind can you see in the snow
And fiery demons all dance
When you walk through that door
Don't say you're easy on me
You're about as easy as a nuclear war
Cos the dream that strings the road
With broken glass for us to hold
And I got so far before I had to say

Please please tell me now
Is there something I should know
Is there something I should say
That would make you come my way
Do you feel the same 'cos you don't let it show

Please please tell me now
Is there something I should know
Please please tell me now
Can you see what makes me blow
Please please tell me now
Is there something I should know
Is there something I should say
That would make you come my way
