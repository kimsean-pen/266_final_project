Girls, please, please
Allow my voice to calm you down
Boys understand
Girls will never listen or learn
I was old enough to know better
Young enough to still decide

That it was worth my time for something beautiful
I finally found my voice
And something that's worth writing down
With a picture perfect memory of her body, her body
Girls, please, please
Allow my voice to calm you down
Boys understand
Girls will never listen or learn
And I'll sing so sweet
While I speak I'll bite my tongue
'Cause girls never listen
She was young enough to fall in love
Naive enough to think she wanted out
It wasn't worth her time for something beautiful
You say love, she says maybe
I say please, she says baby, "it's not you, I'm just out of my head."
Her body, her body
Girls, please, please
Allow my voice to calm you down
Boys understand
Girls will never listen or learn
And I'll sing so sweet
While I speak I'll bite my tongue
'Cause girls never listen
Speak low
Can you keep this a secret?
Tell me your lies and I will tell you of mine
Whisper sweetly, while you touch me gently
I'm out of my mind
(Speak low)
We're not twenty-one, it's time that we had some fun
(Speak low)
We're not twenty-one
('Cause girls never listen)
We're not twenty-one, it's time that we had some fun
We're not twenty-one
('Cause girls never listen)
We're not twenty-one, it's time that we had some fun
We're not twenty-one
We're not twenty-one,
it's time that we had some fun, we're not twenty-one
