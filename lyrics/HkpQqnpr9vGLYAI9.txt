Fame is not what you deserve
It's only endless curse, I know
My bravery is made
Of despair, I am jaded, my fault

The whole is just a play
Dream all day
Of revolt and decay
Collapse all day

I need some to create
To hide lies and to fake that guilt
My feelings are confused
My lipstick smile abused, insult

The whole is just a play
Dream all day
Of revolt and decay
Collapse all day

Don't expect no tears and pride
Survive with no surprise, it's tragic

The whole is just a play
Dream all day
Of revolt and decay
Collapse all day

The whole is just a play
Dream all day
Of revolt and decay
Collapse all day
