Consume all the obscene
Persuade the most hideous and ugly
Under every pile and stone.
A rebirth, for you to find
Freedom is to be able to go in any direction
So take the uncertain path

One foot in the open
Ten feet ahead
Build your own ladder
And don't lie to yourself.

Secrets left above the grave
It's not for one to keep.
You're all so self destructive
Spend more time with the broken
You know you lost when you feel transparent

Be at one with the wind (ever changing)
Even if it's a struggle
Make this your priority

Open all your senses to new impressions
Act like all that was has vanished

One foot in the open
Ten feet ahead
Build your own ladder
And don't lie to yourself.

Secrets left above the grave
It's not for one to keep.
You're all so self destructive
Spend more time with the broken
See what became of their mistake
You know you lost when you feel transparent

One foot in the open
Ten feet ahead
Build your own ladder
And don't lie to yourself.

Secrets left above the grave
It's not for one to keep.
You're all so self destructive
Spend more time with the broken
See what became of their mistake
You know you lost when you feel transparent

You know you lost
You know you lost
You really know you lost when you feel transparent
