Fuck the world
I don't care anymore
If you're feelin' like I
Throw your hands in the sky
In my Buffalo stance
Both feet on the ground
And a head up in the clouds
How low can you go, let me know

Hey, nothing lasts forever
I just gotta tell it to myself
So one day I can wave it
Sayonara
I'll be gone tomorrow
I just need to say what's on my mind
So finally I can wave it
Sayonara

Pa da pa pam pam
Pa da pa pam pam
(Say it)
Pa da pa pam pam
Pa da pa pam pam

In my rearview mirror all the people cry
Singing to my last goodbye
Knew this drug would get me high
Dance around my funeral pyre
Soon we all be dreaming
Baby can you feel it kicking in
Oh yeah, yeah yeah

Hey, nothing lasts forever
I just gotta tell it to myself
So one day I can wave it
Sayonara
I'll be gone tomorrow
I just need to say what's on my mind
So finally I can wave it
Sayonara

Pa da pa pam pam
Pa da pa pam pam
(Say it)
Pa da pa pam pam
Pa da pa pam pam

Fuck the world
I don't care anymore
If you're feelin' like I
Throw your hands in the sky
In my Buffalo stance
Both feet on the ground
And a head up in the clouds
How low can you go, let me know

Hey, nothing lasts forever
I just gotta tell it to myself
So one day I can wave it
Sayonara
I'll be gone tomorrow
I just need to say what's on my mind
So finally I can wave it
Sayonara
