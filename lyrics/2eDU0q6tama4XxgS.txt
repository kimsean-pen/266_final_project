O Satan, I acknowledge you as the Great Destroyer of the Universe.
All that has been created you will corrupt and destroy.
Exercise upon me all your rights.
I spit on Christ's redemption and to it I shall renounce.
My life is yours Lord, let me be your herald and executioner.
My actions shall lead other hearts away from salvation
All shall acknowledge Your sacred royalty and crawl in terrified devotion.

Where is the book of truth, or the inheritance that'd enlighten me?
No voice shall answer to my probe and throbbing prayers...
But certainty and madness write in ashen letters

Seest thou how faith wrought with his works
And by works was faith made perfect?

And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and He in him.
And hereby we know that He abideth in us, by the Spirit which He hath given us.

"The essence of Revelation lies in the fact that it is the direct speech of god to man"
