Right foot on the gas
The trees become a blur
Brake near the left foot
Smell the rubber burn

Out of the frying pan
Into the fire, that stands
Everywhere

Here we all sit and wait in limbo
Wondering which when will the wind blow
There's a new world beyond a window
Better or worse, I'm moving out of limbo

Walking back and forth
Walking in the mazes
Time ran and go back
Take it to the bridge

I've got no
Particular place to go
Except limbo

Here we all sit and wait in limbo
Wondering which when will the wind blow
There's a new world beyond a window
Better or worse, I'm moving out of limbo

Moving out of limbo (Hit me)
Moving out of limbo (Cold sweat)
Moving out of limbo (On the good foot)
