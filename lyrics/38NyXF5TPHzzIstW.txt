Hardly grateful or content
I'm acting in the moment
Scared of my own independence
My only nemesis is incompetence
Scared of my own independence

Always left wondering when
Will I grow out of my adolescence

Much to your dismay
I'm in a sea of hate
Can't accept what's on this plate

And my enemies start to spread
Killing sprees are best left unsaid
On my knees I am begging to confess

Always left wondering when
When
When
Will I grow out of my adolescence

Always left wondering when
When
When
Will I grow out of my adolescence
