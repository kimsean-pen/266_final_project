I don't want to lie, can we be honest?
Right now, while you're sittin' on my chest
I don't know what I'd do without your comfort
If you really go first, if you really left

I don't know if I would be alive today
With or without you like night and day
Read and repeat every conversation
Bein' with you every day is a Saturday
But every Sunday, you've got me prayin'

Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me (don't leave me alo-)
Don't leave me a-

A-a-lone, ah-ah

A-a-lone, ah-ah

I don't want to call and you not answer
Never see your face light up my phone
Never see you singin' Tiny Dancer
Everytime my head hurts, everytime I'm low

'Cause I don't know if I would be alive today
With or without you, like night and day
Everything about you uncomplicated
Here with you every day is a Saturday
But every Sunday, you've got me prayin'

Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone
(Don't leave me alo-) don't leave me a-

A-a-lone, ah-ah

A-a-lone, ah-ah
(Don't leave me alo-)

Don't you ever leave me
Don't you ever go
Don't you ever leave me, no

Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone
(Don't leave me alo-)

Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone

Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone
