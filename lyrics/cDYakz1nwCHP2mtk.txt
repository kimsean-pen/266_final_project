Well she wants to be a singer in the band
Maybe I'll give the girl a hand and a microphone
Looks like she's all alone
She can bring a friend though she's not my kind of friend
She keeps staring me out with her ol' black 'n' blue eyes

And I can take her dancing just to give the girl a chance
And I was never that good at being nice when I should
I guess that she'll forgive me right before she tries to kill me
'Cause I sold her on yesterday's come-take-me-home eyes

I can take her waltzing just so she could kick my head in
Oh I do believe I was drunk and both of my heads had shrunk
I guess her name was Tina cause before I'd even seen her
I was lost in her what's-your-name
Just get me fucked eyes
Oh take me home" eyes

And Chelsea said she's got nowhere to go
And if she does she's getting there slow
And I can help her out but I've got somewhere to be
And that's the very thing when your dealing with me

Young soul Dagger, begging me to bag her, filthy heart and swollen hips
And she said oh my dearest I'm not pretty, isn't it a pity
That you won't kiss these rotten lips
So take me home eyes
Ole black 'n' blue eyes

And Chelsea said she's got nowhere to go
And if she does she's getting there slow
And I can help her out but I've got somewhere to be
And that's the very thing when your dealing with me
