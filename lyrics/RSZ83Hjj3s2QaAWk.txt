got nothing to lose this time
and I'm bored with the same old lines
I never know what to do, what to say to you
one look and you'll knock me out
put me on the floor with a 10 count
I don't wanna make a scene
I gotta make you see

that I've been waiting for a girl like you
and I know there's nothing I can do
don't it make you hurt
don't it make you feel
like the world ain't on your side
like you're never gonna get it right
no I can't fight
I can't sleep at night
just thinking about you girl
I'm a fool
for you
yes I am

you been on my mind
since I saw you walking by
I knew I had to know you better
you were everything
but I didn't know what to say
so you just walked away
I couldn't believe what a fool I was to let you go

'cause I've been waiting for a girl like you
and I know there's nothing I can do
don't it make you hurt
don't it make you feel
like the world ain't on your side
like you're never gonna get it right
no I can't fight
I can't sleep at night
just thinking about you girl
I'm a fool
for you
yes I am

when I saw you at the beach
talking with my friends
I couldn't believe my eyes
it was my lucky day
so I just asked you out
to the forum to see No Doubt
when you said you would go
I thought I might explode

'cause I've been waiting for a girl like you
and I know there's nothing I can do
don't it make you hurt
don't it make you feel
like the world ain't on your side
like you're never gonna get it right
no I can't fight
I can't sleep at night
just thinking about you girl
I'm a fool
for you

dont it make you hurt
dont it make you feel,
