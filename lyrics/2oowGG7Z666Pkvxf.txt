Powerfulness in my soul
A great force is
Supporting me
I see it has always been here
Innate, a natural right
Omnipresent
In every moment, every second, all the time

I feel I can face anything
Deeply strong...
A huge mind is working through me

Life is on our side
Wishing well-being on humankind

We are sons of a great and deep source
Transmitting unconditional love
Its power flows to each one of us
Eternally sustaining ourselves

Deeply trust in it

No matter the difficulties,
And all the troubles
No matter how hard is your path
You have the power
To face them all
Invincible
The strength of life is in you
Everything we live
Are chance to grow
To become more strong and conscious
There's no punishment
Only a chance to connect with our own inner being

I entirely open the door
I release this mighty force
