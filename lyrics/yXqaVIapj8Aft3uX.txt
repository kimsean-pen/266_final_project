Careful, I'm able to be alone
Wasted so I'm calling you on the phone
Tempted to touch, I like you so much
But I don't wanna seem eager
Admiring your words like a little girl
Is that what you wanted?

But if you're gonna make me beg for it, beg for it
I'm not willing to
And if you're gonna make me beg for it, beg for it
I'm not willing to

Careful, I'm the fire behind the flame
Wasted your chance on this guessing game
And I don't wanna fall for it, fall for it
If you're not the one
I could take a chance on it, chance on it
But I'm gonna walk home

And if you're gonna make me beg for it, beg for it
I'm not willing to
And if you're gonna make me beg for it, beg for it
I'm not willing to
And I don't wanna fall for it, fall for it
If you're not the one
So if you're gonna make me beg for it, beg for it
I'm not willing to
