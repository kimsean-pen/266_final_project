When you showed me your photo
You looked so unlikeable
As I would surely see
But I wish I'd said it once to you

You taught me a lesson
People are stupid in the dark
You pull my disgrace in the moonlight
People are just what they have
Loved and half blind, loved and half blind
In the moonlight

Pull out the gun, and give me your money
Give me your phone, you can keep your idea
For an attempt to simple reach as I punch you in the tummy
Once we felt sorry for you, people
But not that sorry

You taught me a lesson
People are stupid in the dark
You pull my disgrace in the moonlight
People are just what they have
Loved and half blind, loved and half blind
In the moonlight
