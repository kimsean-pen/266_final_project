You're my concentration
Everything else is a bore
I've got myself snagged on you
No self control

Now all that I wanna do
Sleep in the shadow of you
For the rest of my life

Now we can chisel
Chisel off built up walls
Of pain deposited
From past lovers

Memories they can sleep
And we can live comfortably
For the rest of our lives

Wrong or right
Shipwrecked into you, situation is foolish
Put up a fight
You're my big distraction, obvious companion
I'm falling fast like an avalanche

Indentured servant
A slave to a slave
Thank God for my hopeful heart
And for mutual feelings

For look how it's balanced now
Maybe we'll just settle down
For the rest of our lives

Wrong or right
Shipwrecked into you, situation is foolish
Put up a fight
You're my big distraction, obvious companion
I'm falling fast like an avalanche

Look how it's balanced now
Maybe we'll just settle down
For the rest of our lives, lives

Wrong or right
Shipwrecked into you, situation is foolish
Put up a fight
You're my big distraction, obvious companion
I'm falling fast like an avalanche

You're my big distraction, obvious companion
I'm falling fast like an avalanche
You're my big distraction, obvious companion
I'm falling fast like an avalanche

You're my big distraction, obvious companion
I'm falling fast like an avalanche
You're my big distraction, obvious companion
I'm falling fast like an avalanche
