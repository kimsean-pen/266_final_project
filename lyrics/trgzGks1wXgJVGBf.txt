Blue mist echoes to my past
The moment I remember my crime
Regret my anger avenue
The night wakes me to the day
My heart is dying
Things will never be the same
But I add fuel to the fire
As it burns desire
We become eternal flame
And razor sharp the pain

Uncertain presence close my eyes
Save me from eternal sight
Broken words permeate the room
Let the moment never fade away

My heart is dying
Things will never be the same
But I add fuel to the fire
As it burns desire
We become eternal flame
And razor sharp the pain

Uncover all the hidden lies
Imagine we're stars in the sky
