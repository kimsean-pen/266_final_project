Listen up
take warning
take warning
And you gotta take warning

Stand by your freinds, wrong or right
Can't call that justice
If its just a stupid excuse to fight
single out and attack
The ones who got no defense
you call that a new way of thinking
I call it regression to ignorance

Take warning (take warning)
Take warning (take warning)

New generation coming up
and we really gotta stand up to them

Take warning (take warning)

Nobody's got a thing against you
Unless you've got something to prove
We dont need no new set of standards,
We dont need no new set of rules
Bah!
Heard all that shit before
About stomping out any difference
We say stand together!
Not to fight just to exist

Take warning (take warning)
Take warning (take warning)

Intimidation coming up
and we really gotta say no to them

Take warning (take warning)

Enough is enough is enough
Why dont you just ease up?

I saw another beat down last nite, take warning
Who's the next to hit the ground tonight? take warning
take warning!

Take warning (take warning)
Take warning (take warning)

Intimidation coming up
and we really gotta say no to them

Take warning (take warning)
