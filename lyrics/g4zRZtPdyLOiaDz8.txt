A pale light frames
Your weary face
Your laboured breath clouds
The last light of the day

Unbidden thoughts of better times
Don't make the trail any easier
This last stage you must go alone
Would that I could go with you?

As we travelled many such before
Whether through storm or sunlit meadows
All these roads we walked together
All these memories will never fade

Your tender smile catches my breath
How can I go on without it?

The moment then
There is nothing worthwhile anymore
Your eyes swallow the light

The ship has sailed
You have breathed your last

All these roads we walked together
All these memories will never fade, fade!

So light you, lie in my arms
That the burden has been lifted from you
