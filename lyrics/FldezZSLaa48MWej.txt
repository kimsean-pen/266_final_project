Oh hannah
I wanna feel you close
Oh hannah
Come lie with my bones
Oh hannah
Don't look away
Oh hannah
Just look at me the same

I don't wanna be your friend
I wanna kiss your lips
I wanna kiss you until I lose my breath
I don't wanna be your friend
I wanna kiss your lips
I wanna kiss you until I lose my breath

Oh hannah
Tell me something nice
Like flowers and blue skies
Oh hannah
I will follow you home
Although my lips are blue and I'm cold

I don't wanna be your friend
I wanna kiss your lips
I wanna kiss you until I lose my breath
I don't wanna be your friend
I wanna kiss your lips
I wanna kiss you until I lose my breath

(Oh hannah Ã—4)

I wanna kiss you until I lose my breath
I don't wanna be your friend
I don't wanna be your friend
I wanna be your bitch
And I wanna touch you but not like this

The look in your eyes
My hand between your thighs
Oh this can't be real
It's all just a dream

I don't wanna be your friend
I wanna a kiss your lips
I wanna kiss you until I lose my breath
I don't wanna be your friend
Lose my breath
I don't wanna be your friend
Lose my breath
