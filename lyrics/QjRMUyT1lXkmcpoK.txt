Early morning underneath the city,
in a tunnel calling rescue me,
i come from the mountain i return again,
without a tear, naturally Girl like to smile half the time,
boys are the trouble all the time,
sitting in their pockets just a dime
lifting heavy spirits from the slime

no one likes a heartache or the kind,
everyones a problem sometimes,
flipping over secrets day and night,
flipping out our insides, what a fright.
