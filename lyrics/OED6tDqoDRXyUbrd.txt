Had the sweetest dream last night
I was playing with my knives
Gushin' blood ran down my chin, it wasn't mine
It was me against them all
Pinned them up onto the wall
Cut out pieces of their skin, I missed your call
They all tried running away
Chased them down through the woods
You're always running away from me
In my head I'm feeling fine
They all say I lost my mind
They're crying for the ones they love, but they hurt mine
I tell myself it's all for you
But I think I love it too
I took the bodies down the stairs, what did I do?
Blood red stains on my shirt again
This time the house will burn
Sorry, they called your name when I promised them it would hurt
Drag the bags out to the car
Gave them more than just a scar
A smile on my face, a spade under my arm
They all tried running away
Cut them up in the woods
You're always running away from me
Cold sweat runs down my back again
This time we'll feed the worms
Sorry they called your name when I promised them it would hurt
