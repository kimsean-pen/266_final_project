The judge was all hungover
When the president took the stand
So he didn't really notice
When things got out of hand

Then the press boys thank the president
And he tells them what to say
There's a photo opportunity
And then they're sent away

To a place where nothing matters
Where the wheels of progress turn
Where reality is fiction
But the dogs show no concern

Now the clerks look out the windows
At those dogs down in the park
Every window holds a staring face
Every desk stands piled with work

Now a dog cannot imagine
What it is to drive a car
And we in turn are limited
By what it is we are

We are dogs in our own paradise
In a theme park of our own
Doggy dancers doing doody
Doggy dreaming all day long

Dreaming all day long
Happy all day long
Dreaming all day long
In a paradise of our own

We are dogs in our own paradise
In a theme park of our own
Doggy dancers doing doody
Doggy dreaming all day long
