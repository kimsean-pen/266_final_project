To some it was a game
They discussed this round's wager
I fell into a trance
I started to fall

You were born with a name
Of a man who lived in danger
It wasn't part of the plan
I didn't answer the call

And I know we're chained to something
I was leaning against the wall
You are my savior
We flow in peace like the ocean
Sucked down as we fall
To a place unknown
I pray to Gods I don't see
That you will lay in my arms
I can't wait longer
We flow in time with the ocean
The arms of the clock as they fall
To a place called home
