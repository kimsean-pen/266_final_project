Feet, don't fail me now
Take me to the finish line.
Oh, my heart, it breaks

Every step that I take.
But I'm hoping that the gates
They'll tell me that you're mine.
Walking through the city streets
Is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a Friday night

Can you make it feel like home
If I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you honey.
Don't make me sad
Don't make me cry.
Sometimes love is not enough

And the road gets tough
I don't know why.
Keep making me laugh
Let's go get high.
The road is long

We carry on
Try to have fun
In the meantime.
Come take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain.
You like your girls insane.

So choose your last words
This is the last time.
'Cause you and I
We were born to die.
Lost but now I am found
I can see that once I was blind.
I was so confused as a little child

Try'na take what I could get
Scared that I couldn't find
All the answers, honey.
Don't make me sad
Don't make me cry.
Sometimes love is not enough

And the road gets tough
I don't know why.
Keep making me laugh
Let's go get high.
The road is long

We carry on
Try to have fun
In the meantime.
Come take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain.
You like your girls insane.

So choose your last words
This is the last time.
'Cause you and I
We were born to die.
(We were born, we were born)
We were born to die.
(We were born, we were born)
We were born to die.
Come take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain.
You like your girls insane.

Don't make me sad
Don't make me cry.
Sometimes love is not enough

And the road gets tough
I don't know why.
Keep making me laugh
Let's go get high.
The road is long

We carry on
Try to have fun
In the meantime.
Come take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain.
You like your girls insane.

So choose your last words
This is the last time.
'Cause you and I
We were born to die.
(We were born, we were born)
We were born to die.
(We were born, we were born)
(We were born, we were born)
(We were born, we were born)
(We were born, we were born)
(We were born, we were born)
(We were born, we were born)
(We were born, we were born)
(We were born, we were born to die)
