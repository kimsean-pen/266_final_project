I long for something simple
I long for something real
Will this heart heal?
Oh all my life been searchin'
It feels like I'm still lookin'
Oh I can feel...

And though I'm in a crowded room
But I feel lonely now
I know you're on your way
Though I don't see you now
So Cupid take your aim and open fire

Darlin' if you hold me, take it slowly, I
will let your love walk in
Yes I will let your love come in
Darlin' I've grown weary
Please won't you save me
I've closed too many doors
But I wanna let your love walk in
tonight

Afraid I am too broken
Afraid I can't be free
Oh the past bleeds
Defined by misdemeanours
Made up of my regrets
My memories

And though I'm in a crowded room
But I feel lonely now
I know you're on your way
Though I don't see you now
So Cupid take your aim and open fire

Darlin' if you hold me, take it slowly, I
will let your love walk in
Yes I will let your love come in
Darlin' I've grown weary
Please won't you save me
I've closed too many doors
But I wanna let your love walk in
tonight

When I'm dancin' on the rooftops
Come and find me
When I'm shattered and I seem lost
Oh take my hand
When I'm filled with joy and all you
hear is laughter
Come and find me oh take my hand

Darlin' if you hold me, take it slowly, I
will let your love walk in
Yes I will let your love come in
Darlin' I've grown weary
Please won't you save me
I've closed too many doors
But I wanna let your love walk in
tonight

I need you to hold me
Come on darlin'
I want you to hold me

Let your love walk in
Let your love walk in tonight
