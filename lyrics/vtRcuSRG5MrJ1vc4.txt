I scarify my brain with memories
The intensive taste of yesterday's air
Breath of freedom
Breath of fate
Distance between a million names and faces
The touch of native life
The culture's spell
I'm a man born to settle but with a soul born to stray
The source of my being
The core of this path
I'm rising my army stronger than death!
The sacred art of waiting
Humble votary
Time leaks through the days lost in dissolving dates
The hour of sacrum
The sacrum on stage
Sweet mantra of life
The cure that revives!
I morph into the shaman performing the rite
Trance of the screaming faces
The voice of my tribe
Mellifluous prayer that will never fade
Hear the common rhythm pulsating in our veins!
The source of my being
The core of this path
I'm rising my army stronger than death!
I'm digging my earth scar
Step after step
Against everything... I follow my fate!
I'm digging my earth scar till I dig my grave
Wherever I fall... I'll fall as a fulfilled man!
I'm digging my earth scar
Step after step
Against everything... I follow... my fate!
MY FATE!!!
MY FATE!!!
MY FAAATE!!!
