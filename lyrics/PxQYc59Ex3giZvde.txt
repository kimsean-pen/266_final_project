There's a fire that burns inside
It's an instinct that never lies
The target's tattooed between our eyes
Stand and fight
Under the lights on the high stage
A part of your life it can't take away
Just like the blood running through your veins
Everyone's watching through your eyes
There's only two options
Win or die (die, die)
Win or die (die, die)
Win or die (die, die, die, die...)
It went from a spark to an open flame
Now destiny's calling out your name
So reply, so reply...
And ignite
There's a power that's underneath
And you can't see it 'til you believe
On the edge of infinity
Feel the rush
Under the lights on the high stage
A part of your life it can take away
Just like the blood running through your veins
Everyone's watching through your eyes
There's only two options
Win or die (die, die)
Win or die (die, die)
Win or die (die, die, die, die...)
It went from a spark to an open flame
Now destiny's calling out your name
So reply, so reply...
And ignite
Ignite
Ignite
It went from a spark to an open flame
Now destiny's calling out your name
So ignite, so ignite
