she lost her voice down by the river
screaming for courage to take oceans under
she read your mind and called it a terror
misplacing her sleep to keep the world nearer

don't forget the way she pushed the water inside
wading through the spirits like a flood on the floor
don't forget, forget
don't forget, forget
don't forget, forget
don't forget

i'll miss keeping you
i hope you're sleeping too
i hope you're home

she took your face and called it her choir
knitting lace out of lashes powdered with ashes
she took your hands and told you to wonder
how you'd fit in the land if the waves held you under

don't forget the way she pushed the water inside
wading through the spirits like a flood on the floor
don't forget, forget
don't forget, forget
don't forget, forget
don't forget

i'll miss keeping you
i hope you're sleeping too
i hope you're home

i'll take you out and up and light
i'll bury you good and straight and right
i'll take you out and up and light
i'll bury you good and straight and right
i'll take you out and up and light
i'll bury you good and straight and right
if you ask in that soft voice
don't forget, forget
don't forget, forget

i hope you're home
i hope you're home
i hope you're home
