I got your jacket on
Hanging off my shoulder
Hose down that restaurant
'Cause the going out's supposed to be over
You go out of your way
To show me where you're working
I feel you hit the brakes, waiting on the green to turn yellow

Since we said hello, time's been flying
Don't wanna let go so let's find

One more red light
Let's keep it going
Take another lap around this town
Another slide over to your side
Stealing kisses, baby, I just wanna drag it out
Let's take the long way home
Nice and slow before we have to say goodnight
Let's find one more red light
Let's find one more red light

Who cares if we hold up a little bit of late night traffic?
If they flash their brights at us
Roll your window down, just wave 'em all around us

Baby, I'm down to take our time
Let's keep on driving till we find

One more red light
Let's keep it going
Take another lap around this town
Another slide over to your side
Stealing kisses, baby, I just wanna drag it out
Let's take the long way home
Nice and slow before we have to say goodnight
Let's find one more red light
Let's find one more red light

We could stop, lean on in
Thirty seconds of you lips
Until the lights turn back to green
Hands off the wheel, hold on to me
Hold on to me, yeah

One more red light
Let's keep it going
Take another lap around this town
Another slide over to your side
Stealing kisses, baby, I just wanna drag it out
Let's take the long way home
Nice and slow before we have to say goodnight
Baby, let's find one more red light
Let's find one more red light
Let's find one more red light
Oh, let's find one more red light
