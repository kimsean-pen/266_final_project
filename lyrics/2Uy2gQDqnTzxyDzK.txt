I want you to be my girl
Yes, I want you to be my dear
In the night I can't sleep
Maybe cos I only think of you
Only you baby only you.
When the night come I just need your love
When the sun come I need you oh my love
You know you're my only love
Now I want to stay with you
I want you to be my girl.
I don't know what's going on, my dear
But I know you're my girl
You know you are my only love
I want you to stay with me.
I want you to be my girl
Yes, I want you to be my dear
In the night I can't sleep
Maybe cos I only think of you
I want you to be my girl.
