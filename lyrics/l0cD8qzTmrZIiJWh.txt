Death by chocolate
Atlantic salt
Take my heart
And the flowers i stole
Sunday morning
Kurosawa
You
Are
Beautiful
You
Are
Beautiful
It seems to me
I've saved all my romantic gestures for you
If i recall
I've saved all my romantic gestures for you
The life you save
Marrying
The life you save
Marrying
It seems to me
I've saved all my romantic gestures for you
If i recall
I've saved all my romantic gestures for you
We danced to Stagger Lee
In the moonlight
Draped in gold
We danced to exploding boy
Like we were five years old
I will sack all my friends off
Pretend i like Elvis
I won't do those things
You could colour me selfish
The life you save
Marrying
The life you save
Marrying
(Solo)
The life you save
Marrying
The life you save
Marrying
