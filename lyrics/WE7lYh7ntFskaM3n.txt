I've been trying hard to
keep the static low
drown out the troubles
you know he's going to call
everyday and way our distance always grows
further and further so close to letting go

reach out a hand to me
it's not over
keep all our memories
bring them closer

and I wonder how you sleep at night
you know that it's not just alright
'cause static is so far from me

I've been trying hard to get you all alone
seems like the good days are never going to come
everything you say I hear that awful tone
you're just so tired those words are not your own

don't let them catch you
those friends that you wear (?)
they creep all around you
you're never prepared

and I wonder how you sleep at night
you know that it's not just alright
'cause static is so far from me

and I wonder how you sleep at night
you know that it's not just alright
'cause static is so far from me
