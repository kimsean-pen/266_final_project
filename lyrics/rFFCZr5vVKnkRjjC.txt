Good morning children, welcome to school

I heard I lost my self control
But everything I did just went and turned to gold
I love the pictures on the wall
Reminding me of what I lost to get it all

Outta my mind
But I made it
Outta my mind
I'm faded
Outta my mind
The ones I love have left my side
Outta my mind
But I made it, yeah

I'm old enough to know the game
But pushing buttons now is all that keeps me sane
What about tomorrow night?
Maybe we can take too much and start a fight

Outta my mind
But I made it
Outta my mind
I'm faded
Outta my mind
The ones I love have left my side
Outta my mind
But I made it, yeah
Somebody help me now
Because I don't know how
If you don't I'll stay down

Outta my mind
But I made it
Outta my mind
I'm faded
Outta my mind
The ones I love have left my side
Outta my mind
But I made it, yeah
