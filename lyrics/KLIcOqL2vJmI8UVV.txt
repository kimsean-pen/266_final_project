I picked it up slow
But now it's just a ritual
I didn't want the captain's role
But I'll steer us over highs and lows
It's communal but for you it's individual
And that makes me hysterical
I'm never gonna let you go

My bodies gone cold
My bodies gone cold
My bodies gone cold
And I've lost control

Why d'you waste your time with me I'm just an animal
Can you realize my head's a fucking carnival
All I wanna feel's a little chemical rush
All I really know is that it won't take long
I'll eat you alive, I'm just a fucking animal!

A simple love (simple love)
No, it could never be enough (be enough)
And I don't know who I can trust (no)
I'm teetering upon the edge
It's visceral (visceral)
When I hurt you I can never show (never show)
This has become habitual
And I will do it over and over and over and over and over

My bodies gone cold
My bodies gone cold
My bodies gone cold
And I've lost control

Why d'you waste your time with me I'm just an animal
Can you realize my head's a fucking carnival
All I wanna feel's a little chemical rush
All I really know is that it won't take long
I'll eat you alive, I'm just a fucking animal!

Why d'you waste your time with me I'm just an animal
Can you realize my head's a fucking carnival
All I wanna feel's a little chemical rush
All I really know is that it won't take long
I'll eat you alive, I'm just a fucking animal!
