Hey. I'm dazed on your front lawn tonight.
I'll drive home screaming At the Drive-In.
I've been driving this thing for too long,
And on and on and the point is etc.
I will explode if I don't. Believe me, that I know.
I will explode if I don't kiss you now.
I've been living like a sailor, my sea legs are wearing down.
