I am sober lying on my bed
Recreating you inside my head
You speak softly, resonating in my subconscious
Where did we begin?
Just one bait into you
When it's all about the two of us
And nothing's ever been so good
You remember a life that was all about the two of us
But you and I we never knew

It was the greatest place I've ever been
And it was right in front of me
You carried me back home again
While you became a lot of me
It was the greatest place I've ever been
And it was right in front of me
You carried me back home again
While you became a lot of me

Still in silent
One gets used to it
Being idol
But not you and me
Just one break in the week
We sat down just the two of us
And think about the life we know
All the promise we made
It will always be the two of us
The dream of being in control

It was the greatest place I've ever been
And it was right in front of me
You carried me back home again
While you became a lot of me
It was the greatest place I've ever been
And it was right in front of me
You carried me back home again
While you became a lot of me

While you became a lot of me
While you became a lot of me

While you became a lot of me
While you became a lot of me
While you became a lot of me
