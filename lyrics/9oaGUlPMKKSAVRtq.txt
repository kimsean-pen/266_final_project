Her eyes burn, like salt on a slug as she melts
She can't keep it up, she needs sleep
But she can't find the time
So she feeds the fire, can't let it fade
Hopes someone is here to take her away

Her eyes scream
'Cause she can't keep out the dreams
As they blend into her daze
She bends 'cause she's still afraid
Can't let it fade
Hopes someone is here to take her away

She bends 'cause she's too afraid to end
Their forever bender goes on
As they pull it together and more on the fire
Can't let it fade
Hopes someone is here to take her away

Her eyelids are paradise, but everyone's gone
Can't close her eyes, or turn down the song
Hide in the night and keep bending on
She feeds the fire, can't let it fade
Hopes someone is here to take her away

Her eyes burn, like salt on a slug as she melts
She can't keep it up, she needs sleep
But she can't find the time
So she feeds the fire
Can't let it fade
Hopes someone is here to take her away

Her eyelids are paradise, but everyone's gone
Can't close her eyes, or turn down the song
Hide in the night and keep bending on
She feeds the fire, can't let it fade
Hopes someones is here to take her away
