Everything I like is going to hell
And everyone I like is living in hell
I've got no use for friends, only connections
Give me what I want and leave me alone

And in five years from now, I'll be living in hell
In ten years from now, I might as well be dead
When I wake up at night, I'm floating above
The sheets on my bed
I've got no use for time, I've got enough
Give me what I want and leave me alone
