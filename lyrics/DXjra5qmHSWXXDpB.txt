Oh-oh! oh-oh!
Oh-oh! oh-oh!

The food is cold,
Your eyes are cold,
The window's cold,
The bed's cold.

Give me something that's not
Cold, come on, come on, come on!
Give me something that's not
Cold, come on, come on, come on!
Give me something that's not
Cold, come on, come on, come on!
Give me - ah!
Give me - ah!
Give me - ah!

The chair's hard,
Your voice is hard,
The money's hard,
The living's hard.

Give me something that's not
Hard, come on, come on, come on!
Give me something that's not
Hard, come on, come on, come on!
Give me something that's not
Hard, come on, come on, come on!
Give me - ah!
Give me - ah!
Give me - ah!

I'll give you my heartbeat
And a bit of tear and flesh.
It's not very much but while it's there,
You can have it,
You can have it
