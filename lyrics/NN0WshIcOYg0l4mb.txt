Back to the turning point
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Saved from judgement with a noose for my neck
They praise the champions of habit and wish death upon refugees
Only the soulless remain after the cleansing and wrath

After the cleansing and wrath

Fly with your own kind
We all have something to prove
But there are few who dare to live from the inside out
Fake conceptions challenge our reality

Question your reality

Beyond the boundaries that caged me
Behind the skyline of death
Within our reach yet so distant
Confront normality

I've spent my days in the gutter
Trying to find myself beneath the bricks of my sanity
Between our shelter and shame lies a pathway that takes us home

Fly with your own kind
We all have something to prove
But there are few who dare to live
From the inside out
Fake conceptions challenge our reality
