The rain is nothing to fear
When you become the storm

Suffering is to speak the truth and I'm not willing to hear
Working harder than before with nothing to show but tears
With only time, its hands to help, it's the hurt that we must let go
Pardoned, forgiven for their sins and what they put us through

The rain is nothing to fear
When you become the storm

We are not here to suffer
But what we get through makes us tougher
We are not here to suffer
But what we get through makes us tougher
Oh!

Suffer all the innocent who say that they don't belong
Can't find the strength that they
deserve, give them the ones who do not wrong
I know we weren't mean for love, time to break down every single door
And it keeps us trapped and torn
I know we are more than this, no more time to reminisce, it's war
And it's right outside our doors

The rain is nothing to fear
When you become the storm

We are not here to suffer
But what we get through makes us tougher
We are not here to suffer
But what we get through makes us tougher

Sometimes we suffer
The time we get tougher
Sometimes we suffer
Sometimes we get tougher

We are not here to suffer
But what we get through makes us tougher
We are not here to suffer
But what we get through makes us tougher
We are not here to suffer
But what we get through makes us tougher
(Become the storm)
We are not here to suffer
But what we get through makes us tougher
Become the storm!
