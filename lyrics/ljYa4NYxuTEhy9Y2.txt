Please don't be technology
So I can turn up your love like some cold machine
Don't feed me scraps from your bed
I won't be the stray coming back just to be fed

I'll be wait
Come and seal my fate, marine
Just pretend that you want me

And be my babe, would you be my babe?
Would you be my babe, would you be my babe?
Would you be my babe, would you be my babe?
Would you be my babe, would you be my babe?
Would you be my

Well don't be that note I can't hold
Well don't be that joke that I told and told 'til it got old
Don't be that hand 'round my throat so I can't breath
Say you're my friend but why won't you be my family?

And if you break
Just don't tell me

To be my babe, to be my babe
Would you be my babe, would you be my babe?
Would you be my babe, would you be my babe?
Would you be my babe, would you be my babe?
Would you be my babe, would you be my babe?
Would you be my babe, would you be my babe?
Would you be my babe, would you be my babe?
Would you be my babe, would you be my babe?

Be my serene
Tell me you know what I mean
(Prove me wrong)
You've set on me but you are not the sun
You are not the sun
(How do they know where I am?)
(Burn it down)
I'm outside your cold lips again
You've set on me but you are not the sun
You are not the sun

Just pretend that you love me
And be my babe, would you be my babe?
Would you be my babe, would you be my babe?
Would you be my babe, would you be my babe?
Would you be my babe, would you be my babe?
Would you be my
