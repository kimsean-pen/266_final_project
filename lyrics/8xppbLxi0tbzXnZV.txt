I hate it
I hate the way you're always right, I hate it when you lie
I hate it when you make me laugh, even worse when you make me cry
I hate it when you're not around and the fact that you didn't call
I just left the station now i'm so mad at myself
Came to a realization that I didn't need your help
I needed you the most but you weren't there when I fell
All you did was lie to me and make me hate myself
Now you coming back because it's over
But you act so much different when you're sober
I guess I'm just different i'm a loner
But you ain't never here you're just a stoner

You make me think that it's my fault
Now I'm passed out on the sidewalk
I get so pissed when you speak
I know that you can't stand me, either

All you ever wanted was a cheque
And now we always at each others necks
And I thought you was different from the rest, yeah
I still get chills when I see you
I get more angry than i need to
You don't bite the hand that feeds you
Now I know it was the wrong move

You make me think that it's my fault
Now I'm passed out on the sidewalk
I get so pissed when you speak
I know that you can't stand me, either

I hate it
I hate the way you're always right, I hate it when you lie
I hate it when you make me laugh, even worse when you make me cry
I hate it when you're not around and the fact that you didn't call
But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you, not even close, not even a little bit
Not even at all
