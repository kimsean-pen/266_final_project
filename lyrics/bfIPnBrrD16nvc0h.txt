She shouts, "The most incessant, the most deplete"
She said, "Show me conscience with nothing to be"
She said, "Null the worm"
Let's sober up
Caught in time with the fizz of the burn
And so we burn

Can you begin at the ending,
So that I may begin again?
I took this from you,
I thought I was you
Now don't misunderstand me
I never meant to, to create you

Only mayhem
