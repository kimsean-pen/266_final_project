Frequented by displeasing memories
Haunted by the creatures born of night
Sunk deep in the dejection and distress
Weak and powerless to severe the ties
Bound in the dream world
Wide-awake for every hour of sleep
Faltering towards the future
Only to come across with the past
No hope beacons here
No rays of light lingers
Underneath the black earth
Where the forgotten wait
No love resides here
No solace can be found
Underneath the cold soil
Where the sleeping gods lie
There is nothing to remember
When you are lost
There is nothing to strive for
When you are gone
Now rest for you are tired, let it go
Dive into sleepless dream, embrace oblivion
The moments of light between the darkness
Are brief and flee fast in the house of dead
Searching my way out of confusion
In this cold night cold as my heart
Trying to find a resolution
Assurance and strength to just go on
I'm in the thousand winds that blow
In the circling flight of blackbird
In the stars that shine at night
In the last dying rays of light
Be gone sorrow, leave your dead behind
Stay away grief, lay the ghosts to rest
Be gone sorrow, leave your dead behind
Stay away grief, lay the ghosts to rest
