Uh, sign it over
I could give you double, baby
Bend it over
I'ma hit it double, baby
Spend it all
I'ma make it back double
What's he doin' for you? Nothing
Nothing but trouble, baby

Burnin' rubber
I got a brand new foreign
I don't drive it that much, I'm tourin'
Every time that I shoot, I'm scorin', baby
What's he mean to you?
What's he really mean to you?
I don't give a fuck, girl
Come and swoop you up, baby, yeah

I could change your whole damn life in a day
Why would you wait on a train that's never coming, girl?
I could give you double, baby
Why would you wait?
Why would you wait on a man that's never growing up?

Yeah, I know you don't wanna be that girl
That's fucking 'what's-his-face'
And what's that shit? I think I saw him in
He ain't gonna rock with ya, talk with ya all the time, like I do
I could give you anything that you like, babe

Seein' double
I been drinkin' double, baby
Seein' colors
Feel like I'm hallucinatin'
Doin' numbers
Every show is sold out
Labels still callin', I started ballin'
We turn 'em all the fuck down

Turn on the hot tub
Skinny dippin', bubbles, baby
Set the mood right
I ain't really clubbin' lately
Know you wrapped up in the wrong relationship
You really tried this text and shit
I'd rather read your body language

I could change your whole damn life in a day
Why would you wait on a train that's never coming, girl?
(It's never coming, ooh, it's never coming, girl)
I could give you double, baby
Why would you wait?
Why would you wait on a man that's never growing up?

I could change your whole damn life in a day
Why would you wait on a train that's never coming, girl?
(On a train that's never coming, girl)
I could give you double, baby
Why would you wait?
Why would you wait on a man that's never growing up?

Yeah, I know you don't wanna be that girl
That's fucking 'what's-his-face'
And what's that shit? I think I saw him in
He ain't gonna rock with ya, talk with ya all the time, like I do
I could give you anything that you like, babe

(I could give you double, baby)
(Why would you wait?)
(Why would you wait on a man who's never growing up?)
(I could give you double, baby)
(Why would you wait?)
