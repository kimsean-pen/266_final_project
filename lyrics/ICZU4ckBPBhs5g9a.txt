Picture yourself in a room full of broken glass
Blood on the pieces, the pieces you can't put back
A little white light in a sea gone black
My head is a room and the room's full of broken glass

You can't change me, can you save me?
Oh, clean eyes, breaking my heart in all the right ways and
No, I don't mind, clean eyes
Oh, clean eyes, breaking my heart and breaking my chains and
I don't know why, clean eyes

I'm a cynic, I told you, I fear what I don't believe
I don't know what this is, but this is a different beast
I check the lock on the door three times
Can't put my faith in what I can't describe
I'm a cynic, I told you, I don't believe
Oh, clean eyes, breaking my heart in all the right ways and
No, I don't mind, clean eyes
Oh, clean eyes, breaking my heart and breaking my chains and
I don't know why, clean eyes

Oh, clean eyes, breaking my heart in all the right ways and
No, I don't mind, clean eyes
Oh, clean eyes, breaking my heart and breaking my chains and
I don't know why, clean eyes
