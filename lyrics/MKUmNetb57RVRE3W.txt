Years of development
destroyed in days
begins the genocide
A great fire
from the sky
had affected
the earth, moon and seas

As the earth
began to tilt
all the polar caps
had started to melt
all the seas
had overflown
ripping the continents
apart

Neolithic
Neolithic

As the sky
began to turn dark
and the sun
faded away
all the climates
had begun to drop
and the ground
started to freeze

As the land
began to freeze
All the animals
were trapped inside ice
some animals
had moved to the sea
creating a new
form of life

Stranded on the rivers shores
fossilized in time

As continents ripped apart,
landforms moved to the sea
As continents ripped apart,
landforms moved to the sea
As continents ripped apart,
landforms moved to the sea

Rising, Soaring, Devastating, Annihilation
