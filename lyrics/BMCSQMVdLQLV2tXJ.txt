My hands are burning again tonight
My heart's awake but I don't feel right
Oh I can feel the heat rise
If I could stand up and face this light
Tearing apart my old disguise
But I can't open my eyes

Still I see you

My mouth is cold, my body whole
I may explode but you feel like forever
Undying temple, your temple
I may explode but you feel like forever
I'm falling over and into
I am consumed and you feel like forever

I can't stop shaking as you come close
I want to run but I want you most
Is this what it means to die
I hold my breath as I wait on you
Longing to follow your every move
I've never been so alive

Still I see you, oh

My mouth is cold, my body whole
I may explode but you feel like forever
Undying temple, your temple
I may explode but you feel like forever
I'm falling over and into, oh!
I am consumed and I know your forever

Yeah I know you're forever
Yeah I know you're forever, oh
And it feels like forever, oh, oh

My mouth is cold, my body whole
I may explode but you feel like forever
Undying temple, your temple
I may explode but you feel like forever
I'm falling over and into, oh!
I am consumed and you feel like forever

But you feel like forever
But you feel like forever
I'm falling over and into, oh!
I am consumed and you feel like forever
