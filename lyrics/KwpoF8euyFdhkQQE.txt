Lucifer, enlighten not
This world's not worth to shed your image on
But blind them all (who are) gazing into your light
Tarnish the servants and seekers alike
Neither Eden nor Inferno is their house
Extinguish your flame they're all unworthy of
Bring forth the night, spit poison, spread blight
Kill friend and foe, disbeliever, proselyte

All hail darkness and evil
Eternally trapped in the purgatory aether
Damned to rot between heaven and hell

All hail damnation and terror
Ungranted redemption, cursed by the serpent's spell

Cast out, entrance forbidden
The moonchild is strangled, a new cycle yields
Nothing but suffering while gallows dance
On the endless cemetery fields
