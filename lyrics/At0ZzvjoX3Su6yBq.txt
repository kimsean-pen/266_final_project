It can be suicide,
Not to hide
But show ones true colours

It can be suicide
Not to hide
But show ones true colours
To those, who are angels
Who are angels

To attack, to attack

It can be suicide,
Not to hide
But to show ones true colours
To those who are angels
Who are angels
Who are angels to attack?
Who are angels to attack?
Who are angels to attack?
Suicide, Suicide
