I feel exactly the same
Ten steps from a hurricane
I know if I'm to blame
I'll be in danger
One thing before I go
I'd rather sleep alone
Then know I've built a home
With total strangers

I lost those feelings
All my hope is gone
It's like I'm dying slowly
I know this is done

It's me against the rest
I'm reaching through the darkness Is anybody out there?
I tried to cheat death
Played it like a game
But I feel it in the moonlit air
Moonlit Moonlit Moonlit
But I feel it in the moonlit air

I feel the setting sun
Burning inside my lung
Daylight that never comes
I fade away
I hear the violent crash
Of waves in their aftermath
Whispers they can't take back
Their regret sways

I lost those feelings
All my hope is gone
It's like I'm dying slowly
I know this is done

It's me against the rest
I'm reaching through the darkness
Is anybody out there?
I tried to cheat death
Played it like a game
But I feel it in the moonlit air
Moonlit Moonlit Moonlit
But I feel it in the moonlit air

You ever felt so lost?
Like you're walking through the dark,
All their words begin to taunt
All your hopeless thoughts
Can you see me now?
'Cause I've lost myself
I don't know what I've become I've lost myself

It's me against the rest I'm reaching through the darkness
Is anybody out there?
I tried to cheat death
Played it like a game
But I feel it in the moonlit air
Moonlit Moonlit Moonlit
But I feel it in the moonlit air
Moonlit Moonlit
