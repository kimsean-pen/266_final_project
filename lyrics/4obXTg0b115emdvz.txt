Did I meet you in the morning?
I could never tell
We were coming down together
Sitting by the mission bell

I was overwhelmed with sadness
When I heard what you'd become
Maybe someone's waiting for you
In a city further on from here, but

I'm not coming back for you
I'm not coming back for you
I'm not coming back for you
I'm not coming back for you
You were never really mine

Erin's in the corner
Sitting on a filthy floor
As another comes to see her
I can hear them through the door all night

Now we walk beside the water
As the sun begins to break
Twenty miles outside Boston
I don't see your face anymore, but

I'm not coming back for you
I'm not coming back for you
I'm not coming back for you
I'm not coming back for you
You were never really mine
Never really mine at all
Never really mine at all (mine at all)
Never really mine at all
