I, high king
Sovereign and servant
Holder of divine
Regality bestowed
In the Omphalos grove

My kingship
The song of the gods

Thou shalt know me by my fruits
The abundance in which we grew
The signs and wonders at our feet
Which the flight of the crows revealed

I am the crown of Gallia
I am the oak in the nemeton
I am the servant of Antumnos' children
I am the will of our gods
Ambicatus is my name

My chosen set forth to conquer
Kindling beacons

My kingdom prospered and grew

Thou shalt know me by my fruits
From the Hercynan forests
To beyond the sky-scraping Alps
To which the flight of the crows led us

I am the crown of Gallia
I am the oak in the nemeton
I am the servant of Antumnos' children
I am the will of our gods

I am the crown of Gallia
I am the oak in the nemeton
I am the servant of Antumnos' children
I am the will of our gods
Ambicatus is my name
