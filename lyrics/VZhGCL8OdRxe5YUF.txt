I see a choir coming down the hill
They're singing devil songs
A welded, twisted melody

They don't ask but still they come around
They see that you're not wanted
I don't wan't you to ruin it

They had eyes like a backwards sunset
A golden curve
They gave me armbands made of concrete
I have to swim, I have to swim

Cause you were not right
You were just righteous
With a friend as good as you, who needs enemies?
I guess we all make mistakes

I took a road I didn't recognise
And waited for a call to
Help me get her stabilised

I nursed her and then she came around
I prefer her conscious
Than dreams within a dream

Her eyes were described as deep set cigarette burns
Please keep me in the right context
I have to learn, I have to learn

Cause you were not right
You were just righteous
With a friend as good as you, who needs enemies?
Was it that bad?
(Let me tell you 'bout the two of us)
Were we really that venomous?
(Let me tell you 'bout the world)
With a friend as good as you, who needs enemies?
I guess we all make mistakes
Time is gunna tell
Or maybe it never will

Friends as good as you, friends as good as you
Friends as good as you, friends as good as you
Friends as good as you,
(let me tell you 'bout the two of us)
friends as good as you
(let me tell you 'bout the world)
Friends as good as you,
(let me tell you 'bout the two of us)
friends as good as you

Cause you were not right
You were just righteous
With a friend as good as you, who needs enemies?
Was it that bad?
(Let me tell you 'bout the two of us)
Were we really that venomous?
(Let me tell you 'bout the world)
With a friend as good as you, who needs enemies?
I guess we all make mistakes
But we're growing
But we're growing
But we're growing
But we're growing
