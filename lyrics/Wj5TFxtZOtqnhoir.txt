I don't mind you comin' here
Wastin' all my time
'Cause when you're standin' oh so near
I kinda lose my mind

It's not the perfume that you wear
It's not the ribbons in your hair
I don't mind you comin' here
And wastin' all my time

I don't mind you hangin' out
And talkin' in your sleep
Doesn't matter where you've been
As long as it was deep, yeah

You always knew to wear it well and
You look so fancy, I can tell
I don't mind you hangin' out
And talkin' in your sleep

I guess you're just what I needed (just what I needed)
I needed someone to feed
I guess you're just what I needed (just what I needed)
I needed someone to bleed

I don't mind you comin' here
And wastin' all my time, time
'Cause when you're standin' oh so near
I kinda lose my mind, yeah

It's not the perfume that you wear
It's not the ribbons in your hair
I don't mind you comin' here
And wastin' all my time

I guess you're just what I needed (just what I needed)
I needed someone to feed
I guess you're just what I needed (just what I needed)
I needed someone to bleed

I guess you're just what I needed (just what I needed)
I needed someone to feed
I guess you're just what I needed (just what I needed)
I needed someone to plead
Yeah, yeah, so plead me

(You're just what I needed)

(You're just what I needed)

(You're just what I needed)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
