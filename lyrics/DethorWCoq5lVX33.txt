All passion spent
We stay deaf to everything
All lost a shame
All words of peace have died away
Both on our lips
And in our hearths
All passion spent

Now
To go on and fail me
Come on and break me for good
'cause sometimes
We feel alive
Oh, why don't you fail me
Go on and break me once more
Lets come bind
In a dance of war

Either left to rot in difference
Or left to drown in despair
You shall turn around
And you should die from this life and be reborn to mine

Now
To go on and fail me
Come on and break me for good
'cause sometimes
We feel alive

Oh, why don't you fail me
Go on and break me once more
Lets come bind
In a dance of war

Go on and fail me
Come on and break me once more
'cause sometimes
We come alive

To be more than uninvolved
And all so cold and cruel
And most of all so ugly
And imprecise

Oh, I felt like I was going to dive
Into a cruel sea of lust when
She said: "Saviours, they come and go."

Oh, I felt like I was going to dive
Into a cruel sea of lust when
She said: "Saviours, they come and go."

Oh, why don't you fail me
Come on and break me for good
'cause sometimes
We feel alive
Oh, why don't you fail me
Go on and break me once more
Lets come ...
In a dance of war
