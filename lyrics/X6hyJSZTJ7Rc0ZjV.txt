From scum of the earth
Feeding decayed minds
Rising from flames
What takes our pain

As our world burns
Can't save those suffering
At what cost will it stop
What choice must be made

One day it all comes back again
The soil reclaims what was taken
Nothing ever belonged to us
For we were just the keepers

As our world burns
Can't save those suffering
At what cost will it stop
What choice must be made

One day it all comes back again
The soil reclaims what was taken
Nothing ever belonged to us
For we were just the keepers
Our kingdom approaches the sun
Consumed by what we became
Time now to repay the debt
For we were just the keepers

So easily fooled
Making outcasts of the free
No favours given for nothing
The cost will never be seen
