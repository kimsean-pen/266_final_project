My head is spinning round, my heart is in my shoes, yeah
i went and set the thames on fire, oh, now i must come back down
she's laughing in her sleeve boys, i can feel it in my bones
oh, but anywhere i'm gonna lay my head, i'm gonna call my home

well i see that the world is upside-down
seems that my pockets were filled up with gold
and now the clouds, well they've covered over
and the wind is blowing cold
well i don't need anybody, because i learned, i learned to be alone
well i said anywhere, anywhere, anywhere i lay my head, boys
well i gonna call my home
