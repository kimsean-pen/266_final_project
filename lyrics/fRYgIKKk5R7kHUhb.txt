Hello

I got a date in San Jose
I got a flight that I gotta take tonight
'Cause I got plans in Tokyo, Japan
I got a cabin in Switzerland

I got a dinner in Rio de Janeiro
Wake up next to pharaohs, hungover in Cairo
Sleeping in, it's the weekend, New Zealand
And then it's back to CO to rock the show

I'm sorry but I have to go
There's so many ladies that I know
You could try to get me here to stay
But you know that I'll be leaving here today

I gotta go now
But I really wanna stay
'Cause I know how to say

I'm always in a different time zone
My home's where I roam
I'm never gonna stop, I'm a rolling stone

'Cause I know how to say "love" a million different ways

Stumble in on the streets of Berlin
We can French kiss through the border fences
There's underwear on the mic stand in Iceland
Then it's back to NYC on the MIC

I've got a party in Saudi Arabia
Drunk in a building, so hot in Dubai
I wanna touch you in a parka in Russia
It was nice to see you but this is goodbye

I'm sorry but I have to go
There's so many ladies that I know
You could try to get me here to stay
But you know that I'll be leaving here today

I gotta go now
But I really wanna stay
'Cause I know how to say

I'm always in a different time zone
My home's where I roam
I'm never gonna stop, I'm a rolling stone

'Cause I know how to say "love" a million different ways

Ai shiteru, te amo, I love you, je t'aime
Everywhere I go I always say the same thing
In Russia, Japan, Brazil, Spain
Everywhere I go they seem to scream the same name

Ai shiteru, te amo, I love you, je t'aime
Everywhere I go I always say the same thing
In Russia, Japan, Brazil, Spain
Everywhere I go they seem to scream the same name

I gotta go now
But I really wanna stay
'Cause I know how to say

I'm always in a different time zone
My home's where I roam
I'm never gonna stop, I'm a rolling stone

'Cause I know how to say "love" a million different ways
