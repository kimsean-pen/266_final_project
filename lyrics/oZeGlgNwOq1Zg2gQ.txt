BL$$D
Yeah, yeah
Future, baby, Thugger Thugger
(Ayo Chef)
Pockets
Everything I got came from a lick
Ice on all my watches, on a ship
Underneath the turf's the worst it's gon' get (it's gon' get)
Whipped up water on my wrist, think I'm a fish

Play dip and dab out the bag (dab out the bag)
I got cribs, all know that (I got cribs, all know that)
You want problems for somethin' (you want problems for somethin')
Need to get you some racks (need to get you some racks)
She gon' bring it to daddy (she gon' bring it to daddy)
Eat the cake out her panties (eat the cake out her panties)
I was cool as a cat (I was cool as a cat)
Stay all facts
If I wouldn't have rapped, I'd still be rich (still rich)
Three million dollar house, came from evictions (hood rich)
Out here on a jet and a cruise ship (cruise ship)
Last night I stole a yacht to cruise in it (cruise in it)
If I wouldn't have rapped, I'd still be rich (hood rich)
If I ain't have this shit, I'd still be lit (hood rich)
If I fuck these hoes, then I'm trippin' (I'm trippin')
I can't fuck these hoes, they might try to pull the trigger
Ain't no slippin' (let's go)

The coupe is outside and I'm styled in the best
I see you killin' these niggas 'cause you're doin' it the best
Solitaries ain't nothing to me
Coughin' these like I got lukemi'
Forreal, la familia, I go gorilla, I'm part of the Bape team
Fuck you thought? Supreme on the quilt, hang low, it's a drag queen
I'm in a bronze Benz, I think it's the wagon
Ever since mom's titty, bitch I was flaggin'
She got some water on, she my Cancun ting (she my Cancun ting)
I got some black diamonds, my wrist is on Beijing (my wrist is on Beijing)
I'm tellin' all of my hoes give their orders to the maid (hold on, turn up)
I got 20 bitches with me and they ain't showin' shade
I got 20 closets, I could dress accordin' to the wave
I'm with 20 models but I dress accordin' to the babe
I'm goin' all in by my bro and my paper
Ain't got no fuckin' neighbors, ain't got no neighbors
Yeah
No neighbors, oh

Play dip and dab out the bag
I got cribs, all know that
You want problems for somethin'
Need to get you some racks
She gon' bring it to daddy
Eat the cake out her panties
I was cool as a cat
Stay all facts

If I wouldn't have rapped, I'd still be rich (hood rich)
If I ain't have this shit, I'd still be lit (hood rich)
If I fuck these hoes, then I'm trippin' (I'm trippin')
I can't fuck these hoes, they might try to pull the trigger
Ain't no slippin' (let's go)
