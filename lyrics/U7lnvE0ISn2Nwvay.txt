One two one two
She's trapped
Gonna need some help
What you think about that
One two one two
She's trapped
Gonna need some help
What you think about that
One two one two
She's what
Gonna need some help
What you think about that
One two one two
She's trapped
Gonna need some help

She sits in her armchair
Looking into space
Looking for a reason
To find her lifes place
Feeling a little bit sad
But not really all that bad
Searchin' for a dream
A dream that she's never had

She knows
She should get it (But it ain't that easy)
Her life
Kinda full of it (Cuz it's all to sleezy)
She's going out of her mind
(But she still can't hide she can't leave her life)

Trapped by your love
(Life is unavoidable)
Just to get by
(To make it more affordable)
Trapped by your love
(Life is unavoidable)
Just to get by
(To make it more affordable)

She can't afford that at
Cuz the park it seemed packed
She can't afford that at
So what she gunna do now

She looks in the mirror
Her reflections someone old
Seeing days go by
She don't need to be told
feeling a little bit sad
She cries and packs her bags
remembering now a dream
A dream that she never had

Where will she go (But it ain't that easy)
How long till she comes home
(But It's all to sleazy)
Maybe she'll make it
(Will she hear or maybe not)

Trapped by your love
(Life is unavoidable)
Just to get by
(To make it more affordable)
Trapped by your love
(Life is unavoidable)
Just to get by
(To make it more affordable)

Trapped to by your love
