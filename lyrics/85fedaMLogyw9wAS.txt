God is all of the time
Red box wood Baptist sign tonight
So uncle.lit a fire
They burned down everything inside
I won't leave indentions of me
God is watching tonight
How long can you be not enough?
So all the progress you made
won't end meaning anything
I won't leave indentions of me... me
I won't leave intentionally... leave
Doesn't matter to me
I tell myself repeatedly
What a nightmare it seems
To honestly think anything
I won't leave indentions of me
I won't leave intentionally
