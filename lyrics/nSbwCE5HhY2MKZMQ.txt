I'm
Counting back
The number of the steps
It took for me to get
Back on
The wagon of the weekend

I'll
Use the autoti-
-mer to prove that I'll
Get home
With my imagination

If
They find
The body in the basement
"In
The ve-
-ry house that she was raised in!"

I'm
Taking down
The number of the Times
So when we get the sign
From God
I'll be the first to call them

I'm
Taking back
The number of the Beast
'Cause six
Is not a pretty number
Eight
Or three
Are definitely better
A
Is for
The address on the letter
To my alcoholic friends

I'm
Trying hard
Not to be ashamed
Not to know the name
Of who
Is waking up beside me
Or
The date
The season or the city
But
At least
The ceiling's very pretty
And
If you
Are holding it against me

I'll be on my best behavior
Taking shots for Mother Nature
Once my fist is in the cupboard
Love is never falling over

(One, two, three, four!)

Should
I choose
A noble occupation?
If
I did
I'd only show up late and
Sick
And they
Would stare at me with hatred
Plus
My o-
-nly natural talent's wasted
On my alcoholic friends
My alcoholic friends
The party never ends
My alcoholic friends
