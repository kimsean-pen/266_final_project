Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
I'm fine
I'll be fine until the morning comes
Then unmask me in the blistering sun

Oh let me go
Just let me go
Just let me go
or I'll
Burst in front of your eyes
Then collect myself from the ground

And when I go
And when I go
Just let me go
Like a light
Flickering out in the skies
Lost as fast as was found

Everything's easy when you never have to choose
With the balances shifting it refers to you
Like the sun and the moon I will circle you 'til you bloom
I will crush our love let it burn until I get to you

Lay low
Don't let me know what is real
We'll be quietly following you
Will they take me as their own
Now I will hold you I will keep you up and show my love
Until it folds in my hands
But I'll build it back to the top

Everything's easy when you never have to choose
With the balances shifting it refers to you
Like the sun and the moon I will circle you 'til you bloom
I will crush our love let it burn until I get to you

Feel it rain
Feel it rain
My love
Feel it rain
