From the moment I met you I just knew you'd be mine
You touched my hand and I knew that this was gonna be our time
I don't ever wanna lose this feeling,
I don't wanna spend a moment apart

'Cos you bring out the best in me,
like no-one else can do
That's why I'm by your side,
that's why I love you

Everyday that I'm here with you,
I know that it feels right, (so right, so right)
and I've just got to be near you every day and every night,
(every night)
And you know that we belong together
It just had to be you and me

'Cos you bring out the best in me, like no-one else can do
That's why I'm by your side and that's why I love you

And you know that we belong together
It just had to be you and me

'Cos you bring out the best in me,
like no-one else can do
That's why I'm by your side
'Cos you bring out the best in me,
like no-one else can do
That's why I'm by your side
That's why I love you
'Cos you bring out the best in me,
like no-one else can do
That's why I'm by your side
And that's why I love you
