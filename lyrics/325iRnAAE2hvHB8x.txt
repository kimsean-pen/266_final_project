Life in the fast lane
This is dedicated to you Ben Stiller
You are my favorite mother fucker
I told you, didn't I?

Drama makes the world go around
Does anybody got a problem with that? (Yeah)
My business, is my business
Who's guilty, can I get a witness?
First things first
The chocolate starfish is my man Fred Durst
Access Hollywood, license to kill
A redneck fucker from Jacksonville
Bringing on the dumpster funk
A microphone, machete's in the back of my trunk
Rock'in so steady with the he says, she says
And don't forget about the starfish navigation system
Don't hate me, I'm just an alien
With thirty-seven tons of new millenium
Dum ditty dum, where's it coming from?
Misses Aguilera, come and get some
Oh no, which way to go to the dance flow
In stewa-stereo
Pay me no mind
I seen The Fight Club about twenty-eight times
And I'm a keep my pants saggin'
Keep a skateboard, a spray can, for the taggin'
And I'm a keep a lot of girls on my band wagon
'Cause I don't give a fuck livin' life in the fast lane

(Life in the fast lane)
I'm just a crazy mother fucker livin' it up
Not givin' a fuck livin' life in the fast lane
(Life in the fast lane)
Another crazy mother fucker livin' it up
Not givin' a fuck in the fast lane

Take two (why)
Now who's the starsucker?
I'm the starfish, you silly mother fucker
Puff puff, give the marijuana cig
Oops, I don't even smoke but I love the way it smells
Here's a toast to the females
Sippin' Mumm champagne from a seashell
I take a counterfeit
And pop his ass like a zit
With starfish navigation system
No cheap thrills baby
Fill the briefcase with three dollar bills
I'm just an ordinary run of the mill
Fella spittin' out hella mic skills
And I'm a keep my pants saggin'
Keep a skateboard, a spray can for the taggin'
And I'm a keep a lot of girls on my band wagon
'Cause I don't give a fuck livin' life in the fast lane

(Life in the fast lane)
I'm just a crazy mother fucker livin' it up
Not givin' a fuck livin' life in the fast lane
(Life in the fast lane)
Another crazy mother fucker livin' it up
Not givin' a fuck in the fast lane

'Cause it's so easy to tell a lie
And it's so easy to run and hide
But it's not easy to be alive
So don't be wasting none on my time

This world is like a cage
And I don't think it's fair
And I don't even think
That anybody cares
It'll eat a hole (what)
Down inside of me (what)
And it will leave a scar (what)
Can anybody see (what)
That we gotta get it out (gotta get it out)
We gotta get it out (gotta get it out)
We gotta get it out (gotta get it out)
And I'm a get it out with a mother fuckin' microphone
Plug it in my soul
I'm a renegade riot gettin' out of control
I'm a keepin' it alive and continue to be
Flyin' like an eagle to my destiny
So can you feel me? (hell yeah)
Can you feel me? (hell yeah)
Can you feel me? (hell yeah)
If you feel me mother fucker then you say (hell yeah)
Then you say (hell yeah)
Then you say hell yeah I'm livin' life in the fast lane

'Cause it's so easy to tell a lie
And it's so easy to run and hide
But it's not easy to be alive
So don't be wasting none on my time

Yeah, bring it on
I'm just a crazy mother fucker livin' it up
Not givin' a fuck livin' life in the fast lane
(Life in the fast lane)
Another crazy mother fucker livin' it up
Not givin' a fuck in the fast lane
