Remember how I said I'd come someday, baby?

How I said I'd come around to see you one day?
I said I'd try to find a way to run away, I'd get away some day
Gonna come someday, baby
Gonna fly around the world to hear you say
I'm gonna fly around the world to try to find you again and say:
"I never thought I'd see you again
I never thought I'd get to be with my best friend
Never thought I had to tell you again
Never thought I had to tell you how I lost my mind again"

I left alone
I left the world, I was running
To be by your side
I was dying, alone by your side
I was flying
I came alone

I've come a long way to get here
The leaves that fall to my feet
At home, they mean nothing to me

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah, yeah

Remember everywhere, everything is in this place
Take a place if you find a place to take
Take away the way you want to walk away
Make a way with my mind my mind's away
Wake me up when I'm on the throw to paradise
Lift me off the ground and take me to the garden of paradise
Remember everywhere, everything is in this place
Take a place if you find a place to take
And if you don't have anything nice to say
You can tell it while you take it to your grave
Wake me up when I'm on the throw to paradise
Lift me off the ground and take me to the garden of paradise

I left alone
I left the world, I was running
To be by your side
I was dying alone by your side
I was flying
I came alone
I've come a long way to get here
The leaves that fall to my feet
At home, they mean nothing to me

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
