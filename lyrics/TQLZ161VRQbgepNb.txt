The carpet still holds
The shape of your feet
from the last time i saw you
when you walked away from me

oh annie,
what's it all been for?
if i told you i was changing
would you love me more?

i went before the morning
in the middle of the night
left you with a letter
i never thought i'd write

oh annie,
it only read goodbye
i guess it needed to be said
it just ain't a word of mine, no

(vocalizing)
annie

this war has seen its roses
and share of defeat
oh love can be a poison
or the sweetest remedy

oh annie,
you were something good to me
yeah you broke me down right till the end
and i'll do it all again

(vocalizing)
annie

now everyday i'm searching
for a bit of you and me
the only things left are these bitter memories

oh annie,
at least you took your keys (at least i took my keys)
that way if you ever change your mind
you can come home to me
Darling if you ever change your mind
(if i ever change my mind)
just come home to me

oh annie,
annie,

the carpet still holds
the shape of your feet
from the last time i saw you
when you walked away from me

oh annie
