I wanna keep you like this.
The perfect symbionts.
But we, we all seem to change.
We don't stay the same .
I wanna freeze the frame.
Yeah, you simply know what you do.
And I'm so 'fraid to lose.
I remember you used to light up the room.
And to me you still do.
I feel like I'm losing you.
I'm starting to feel desperate.
Thinking that you'd forget.
Falling for me when I said.
Reciting novels that you read.
Starting to feel desperate.
Thinking that you'd forget.
Falling for me when I said.
Reciting novels that you read. (Guitar solo) I'm starting to feel desperate.
Thinking that you'd forget.
Running from me when I said.
Reciting novels that you read.
Starting to feel desperate.
Thinking that you'd forget.
Falling for me when I said.
Reciting novels that you read.
