Sad, sad lover
Being true
Falling out a window
For the view
All of us laugh
How many of us sing?
This sky where we live
Is no place to lose your wings
So love, love, love

Lose your body
And your mind
And the bitter
Taste of time
All of us cry
While we should be dancing
This sky where we live
Is no place to lose your wings
So love, love, love

Fly, fly away
Do you remember?
All of us sleeping
How many of us dream?
This sky where we live
Is no place to lose your wings
So love, love, love
