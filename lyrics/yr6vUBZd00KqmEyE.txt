Let's all go downtown
I got friends doin' nothin' but hangin' around, well
I feel like there's somethin' I could be missin'
You know you look alright
You got cheap shoes and Malibu and big public fights, well
There's no one else I would rather be kissin'

And baby when you start to bleed, you look so sweet
(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
Everybody's watchin' you 'cause everybody wants to be
(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
Little superstar, yeah baby, that's what you are
Little superstar, oh honey, that's what you are

I got a backstage line
I call you up, been watchin' you for quite some time, well
I beat around the streets like Bandidi looking for Camilla
I'll be satin and speed
And you and I are still alive, we'll get off these streets, well
There was a time I would have hung around just to be seen

Hey man, it's a shame when you start to fade
(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
Diamond rings and sparkly things won't make your shine stay
(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
My little superstar, oh baby, that's what you are
My little superstar, oh honey, you break my heart
My little superstar, oh honey, you know you are
My little superstar, oh honey, you break my heart, yeah

Oh, hey man, it's a shame when you start to fade
(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
Diamond rings and sparkly things won't make your shine stay
(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
Oh, won't make your life glaze
(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
My little superstar, baby, that's what you are
My little superstar, oh honey, you break my heart
(Superstar)
My little superstar, baby, that's what you are
(Superstar)
My little superstar, oh honey, you break my heart
(Superstar)
Oh my little superstar, oh honey, you break my heart
(Superstar)
My little superstar, oh honey, you break my heart
(Superstar)
Oh my little superstar
(Tu, ru, tu, ru, tu ru)
(Superstar)
(Superstar)
