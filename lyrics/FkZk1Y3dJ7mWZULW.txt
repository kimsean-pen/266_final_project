I keep my head uptight
I make my plans at night
And I don't sleep I don't sleep I don't sleep 'til it's light
Something's flowing, someone buried alive
There is an awful sound
This haunted town
And it will not it will not it will not just be quiet
Some ghosts sing. Someone get called to the life

Spend boring hours in the office tower
In a bus on a bus back home to you and
That's fine I'm barely alive
It's just a matter of time
No one gets out alive
And I'm content I'm content I'm content to be quiet
It's only six. Someone get called to the life

You know our hearts beat time out very slowly
You know our hearts beat time
They're waiting for something that'll never arrive

You know our hearts beat time out very slowly
You know our hearts beat time
They're waiting for something that'll never arrive

I keep my head on tight
I make my plans at night
And I don't sleep I don't sleep I don't sleep 'til it's light
Pulse flowing, someone buried alive
And if that head opens we built a life of work
Where we're chain chain chain chain, chained to the life
But that's fine, our blood is alive

You know our hearts beat time out very slowly
You know our hearts beat time
They're waiting for something that'll never arrive
