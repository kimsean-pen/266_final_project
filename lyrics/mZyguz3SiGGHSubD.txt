Spend your lazy, endless crazy days, inside my head
You're so selfish, you're not the only one who thinks he's dead
I'm paid to smile, now I'm on trial for what you think I said
But I never said that everything would be ok
And I never said that we would live to see another day

Motivate me, I wanna get myself out of this bed
Captivate me, I want good thoughts inside of my head
If I fall down would you come around and pick me right up off the ground?

I'm realistic and narcissistic
You say I'm selfish and absurd
You try to change me, you try to save me
You say I'm gonna learn, I'm so blind
I'm out of time, You're so unkind sometimes
I never lied, I never lied, I never lied
Cuz I never said that everything would be ok
and I never said that we would live to see another day

Motivate me, I wanna get myself out of this bed
Captivate me, I want good thoughts inside of my head
If I fall down would you come around and pick me right up off the ground?

(Right up off the ground. Pick me right up off the ground)

Yeah, 'Cause everything, it'll be ok
You know we're gonna live to see another day
Yeah... yeah... yeah... yeah...
Motivate me... yeah
(I wanna get myself outta this)
Motivate me... yeah
(I wanna get myself outta this)
Motivate me... yeah
(I wanna get myself outta this)
Motivate me... yeah
(I wanna get myself outta this bed!)
