So far away
We lost the way
There's no oxygen left on our planet

Empty words
Break on our lips
There's no oxygen left on our planet

Everyone sleeping with their guns
Someone's going to die

So much noise
We're a bunch of boys
We were born to lie

I feel alive
Just when I cry
There's no oxygen left on our planet

Things we've said
And then regret
There's no oxygen left on our planet

Everyone sleeping with their guns
Someone's going to die

So much noise
We're a bunch of boys
We were born to lie

Everyone...
Everyone sleeping with their guns
Someone's going to die

So far away
We lost the way
There's no oxygen left on our planet
