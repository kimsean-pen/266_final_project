Hm hm

And something's up in the clouds to let go
I was wondering why you heard so
Why don't you get along?
Why don't you get along with me?
Why don't you get along, oh, oh, oh why?

Why, why you're gonna fucking hold me back?
All I wanna know is why you're gonna fucking hold me back?
Why, why, why, why
I wonder why you even try

I wonder why, why you waste your time
I wonder why
I wonder why, why you waste your time
I wonder why
(One, two, one two three four)

Something is pushing me down to the floor
I don't need you and I want you to know
Why don't you get along?
Why don't you get along with me?
Why don't you get along, oh, oh, oh, why, why, why?

Why, why you're gonna fucking hold me back
All I wanna know is why you're gotta fucking hold me back
Why, why, why, why
I wonder why you even try

I wonder why, why you waste your time
I wonder why
I wonder why, why you waste your time
I wonder why

I wonder why, why you waste your time
I wonder why
I wonder why, why you waste your time
I wonder why
