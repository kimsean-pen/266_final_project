It's cold in here
I wanna get out
I'm slowly dying could it be I'm in my watery grave

Black water
No quarter
Now I'm stuck in here, screaming
coz my times running out

I told you not to play my game
now you're

GONE!

I'm scratching off my nails
Keep on kicking the walls
seems I'm never gonna find my way out

Started off as a game
but now I'm floating in a coffin
as my breath is running out

I told you not to play my game
now you're

GONE!
