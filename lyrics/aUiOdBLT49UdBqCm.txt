What have I done? What have I done?
Above the grave of a stranger
These words were never heard

I put my feet in the shoes of another man
You were wronged, let down and defeated
Death cheated and played you like a fool
I should have built a tower to hold you high
Should have built a tower to hold you high

(I died, I died)
I died inside when I, when I
When I cut You down
Death has come to destroy
Defeat shows its face

I failed You, I threw You away
I cut You down, I cut, I failed You
I threw You away, I threw You away
I threw You away, I failed You

Sometimes I need to hit a little harder
Sometimes I need to speak a little quieter
I made you carry the casket of an innocent man
When it should have been me, it should have been me

Oh God, I'm speaking to You
You said we are redeemed
Oh God, I'm speaking to You
You said we are set free, You said

We are the weak
The pain is the devourer, the devourer
We are the weak
The pain is the devourer, it's devouring me
I said, we are the weak
The pain is the devourer, it's devouring me

Forgive me
