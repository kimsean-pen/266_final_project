I loved you once, I loved you twice
I loved you in my previous lives
I know your voice, I know your eyes
You haunt me through my dreams at night
Oh my love, we'll meet again
We always do in the end
Our two souls destined to be
You and I until eternity

We live on and on and on, death is weak and we are strong
On and on and on, time is weak and we are strong

And I see you and you see me
Your eyes are like a raging sea
I know it's you, I know it's true
I gazed into them once in a dream
Oh my love, come take my hand
Like you did in my dreamland
You feel the immortality
It's you and I until eternity

We live on and on and on, death is weak and we are strong
On and on and on, time is weak and we are strong

I loved you once, I loved you twice
I loved you in my previous lives
And when I die, just keep in mind
I'll love you in another life
Love you in another life

We live on and on and on, death is weak and we are strong (we are strong)
On and on and on, we are strong (we are strong)
On and on and on, death is weak and we are strong (we are strong)
On and on and on, time is weak and we are strong (we are strong)
