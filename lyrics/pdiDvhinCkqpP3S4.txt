A hospital bed
A room filled with flowers
Every monitor beep keeps the time
As I count down the hours
The petals they weep
They're uprooted like me
Cut from the cord of their mother
Who created everything

If You won't save her
Please just take her away

She pulls me close
Says that she loves me
That she wishes to still be around
On the day that I marry
Tightly she holds
But the plan still unfolds
Cutting the cord from the mother
Who gave me everything

If You won't save her
Please just take her
Nothing breaks her away
From the promise of a better day

This is the moment of glory
Hallelujah
This is the moment of glory
Hallelujah
This is the moment of glory
Hallelujah
This is the moment of glory
Hallelujah

It may feel like God went north
And left you to be
But all you need to know
Is you have everything you need
It's just a blink of an eye
Until the next time we meet
I'll hold you 'til the end
I'll hold you 'til you're free

If You won't save her
Please just take her
Nothing breaks her away
From the promise of a better day

If You won't save her
Please just take her
Nothing breaks her away
Because she'll keep holding on

I'll hold you 'til the end
I'll hold you 'til the end
I'll hold you 'til the end
I'll hold you 'til the end

Keep holding on
Keep holding on
Keep holding on
Keep holding on
Keep holding on
Keep holding on
Keep holding on
Keep holding on
Keep holding on
Keep holding on
