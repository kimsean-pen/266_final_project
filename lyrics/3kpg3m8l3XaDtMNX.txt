cary me back
bury the hatch, pushing a tack in LA detach this beaten path
i'm losing track of all the days i'm wasting on winning one thought
i'm a real player but i forgot all the rearranging my Gordian knot.
cary me back, show me my past
looking through rose glass
missing my ma, missing my pa
i'm losing track of all the day i've wasted in hollywood land
all the cars and pavement driving me mad
but theres still a place i understand
yes i must be patient
playing this band, got a couple aces
maybe a chance, but the lonely feeling... is it gonna last?
