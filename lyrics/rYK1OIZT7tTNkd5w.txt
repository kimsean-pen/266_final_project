Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday
When I caught your eye
We caught onto something
I hold on to the night

You looked me in the eye
And told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down

We almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened?

Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
You can't feel nothin' at all

And you flashback to
When he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong

It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when

You said forever and always
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest
That made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes

Thought I knew you for a minute
Now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything
Coming down to nothing

Here's to silence
That cuts me to the core
Where is this going?

Thought I knew for a minute
But I don't anymore
And I stare at the phone

He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
You can't feel nothin' at all
And you flashback to
When he said forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when
You said forever and always
You didn't mean it, baby
I don't think so
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Please back up
Oh back up
Back up, baby, back up
'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when
You said forever and always
And I stare at the phone
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
You can't feel nothin' at all
And you flashback to
When we said forever and always
'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when
You said forever and always
You didn't mean it, baby
You said forever and always
Yeah...
