Will you listen to what I said?
Do you believe that i'm worth it?
I can't fall asleep
I can't live with my dreams

It's hard to know myself, trapped in my own head
I'm trapped I'm trapped trapped in my head
It's hard to know myself, trapped in my own head
I'm trapped I'm trapped trapped in my head

You're running from everything
That's seeping from the depths of me
You're begging for anything
That's a life I'll never see
I'll keep searching, I'm angry
I've been haunted by my dreams

It's hard to know myself, trapped in my own head
I'm trapped I'm trapped trapped in my head
It's hard to know myself, trapped in my own head
I'm trapped I'm trapped trapped in my head

It's hard to know myself trapped in my own head
It's hard to know myself trapped in my own head

It's hard to know myself, trapped in my own head
I'm trapped I'm trapped trapped in my head
It's hard to know myself, trapped in my own head
I'm trapped I'm trapped trapped in my head

I'm trapped I'm trapped trapped in my head
(It's hard to know myself, trapped in my own head)
I'm trapped I'm trapped trapped in my head
