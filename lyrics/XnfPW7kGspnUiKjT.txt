Hide my money, none less
Or I'll put a treasure in your chest
Hoes faces say they need rest
[?] bitches is a mess
I'm fly as hell so he wanna smash
Got me feeling like an insect
That 40 give a nigga choices
Wanna go in, you're deaf or in debt
Man, I'm rolling and I'm loaded
Shotgun with me, bitch, I tote it
It's so big two people hold it
Slap your casket with some roses
Weak bitches tryna tear me down
But I never frown 'cause I'm still open
Niggas roll up on the roam
When they gon' roll out in a wheelchair
That's all I know, I gotta go
Business cannot be running slow
Taking straight L's, that's a no no
That's a lame nigga on the honor roll
Anyone can get popped in the mouth
Ain't talking 'bout soda, soda
Black guy with your blood leaking
That shit looking like Coca Cola
All you 'bout to see is yellow tape
So I shoulda came in a taxi
Put the MAC to a bitch face
Like a bitch lips look chappy
Only time a bitch can tell me "have a seat"
Is if I'm on the Ellen Show
Otherwise, me, my chopper, bitch
Same size as a telescope

Meet and greet, meet and greet
Chop a freak, meet a bitch, put her to sleep
Meet and greet, meet and greet
Chop a freak, meet a bitch, put her to sleep

Shawty can't teach me shit
I'm like hell naw, I been expelled
No joke, these nigga's broke
They'd fuck around and rob a wishing well
I won't put it past none
What nigga's do for the funds
You wearing Air Forces to the club, nigga?
That's a sign you 'bout to throw ones (broke ass!)
Say what I want, I'm no coward
Bitch I still pee in the shower
I make 10k in an hour
He callin' me baby like powder
Double it, double it, double it, money bag so heavy I double it
Loudest bitches on the internet be the ones mumblin' when they in public
Threats on the net, do you really think I fear that?
Dirty ass bitch, wax her pussy with her earwax
C'mon my nigga you gotta be stupid if you really think I'm not sitting on ready
They know I'm hot, and I'm stirring a pot
They might fuck around, think that I'm making spaghetti
Wake up, no makeup and I still look like I'm worth gold
You wake up, y'all break up
'Cause you Annabelle with no makeup on
That's not a good look, bitch get lost
6 figures, still taking off
Shoot until I see tomato sauce
Swerve through your body that's a cross

Meet and greet, meet and greet
Chop a freak, meet a bitch, put her to sleep
Meet and greet, meet and greet
Chop a freak, meet a bitch, put her to sleep
Meet and greet, meet and greet
Chop a freak, meet a bitch, put her to sleep
Meet and greet, meet and greet
Chop a freak, meet a bitch, put her to sleep

Cho-cho-chop a freak
Cho-cho-chop a freak
