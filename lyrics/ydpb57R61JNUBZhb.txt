I'm not alone
I'm not alone
I'll eat your memories
Don't fake a restless heart
You're not alone
You're not alone
We're shedding enemies
Something peeling off

Tell me when you know, when you know
Why would you quiet your need, just let it go
I'll tell you when I know, when I know
I wouldn't quiet my need
Shadows gross

I wouldn't love you wrong
We're not alone
I wouldn't love you wrong
We're not alone, you're my sinful

I wouldn't love you wrong
We're not alone, you're my sinful
I wouldn't love you wrong
We're not alone, you're my sinful
