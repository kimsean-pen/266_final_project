Hold me closer to the sun
Lay me down with everyone
I wanna be the only best friend that you have
I wanna be the only best friend that you have

Hold me closer to the sun
Lay me down with everyone
I wanna be the only best friend that you have
I wanna be the only best friend that you have, yeah

Hold me closer to the sea
Drag me down from underneath
I wanna see configurations of my dreams
I wanna see configurations of my dreams

Hold me closer to the sea
Drag me down from underneath
I wanna see configurations of my dreams
I wanna see configurations of my dreams

Hold me closer, hold me closer now
Hold me closer, hold me closer now
Hold me closer, hold me closer now
Hold me closer, hold me closer now
