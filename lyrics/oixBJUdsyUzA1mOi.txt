You were my fire
So I burned 'til there was nothing left of me
I, I touched your face
I held you close 'til I could barely breath

Why give me hope
Then give me up
Just to be the death of me?
Save the rest of me

'Cause I see you, but I can't feel you anymore
So go away
I need you, but I can't need you anymore
You hesitate

Now, now and then
You come around like there's something left for me
We were one, We were everything
I'm still here, but I'll just keep the rest of me

'Cause I see you, but I can't feel you anymore
So go away
I need you, but I can't need you anymore
You hesitate

Could we never make up?
You hesitated
Ooh, I don't believe

That I see you, but I can't feel you anymore
So go away
I need you, but I can't need you anymore
You hesitate

'Cause I see you, but I can't feel you anymore
So go away
I need you, but I can't need you anymore
You hesitate, hesitate
You were my fire
So I burned
Now there's nothing left of me
