Oh city lights hace led you all this way
Where did they go tonight?
The sun is in my eyes
And I'm here to find
My new disguise

See the magic shinning in your eyes
And that you're looking for, tonight!

You forgot
You forgot
You forgot about the city lights.

No multi-talented dominions
Building mansions without doors.
The neon of the lizard dancing on his
Technicolor glow.

See the magic shinning in your eyes
And that you're looking for, tonight!

You forgot
You forgot
You forgot about the city lights.

Her street sweeper is watering flowers
That you photographed last night.
The butterfly has landed on the
Psychedelic satellite.

See the magic shinning in your eyes
And that you're looking for, tonight!

You forgot
You forgot
You forgot about the city lights.

You forgot about the city lights
You forgot about the city lights.
