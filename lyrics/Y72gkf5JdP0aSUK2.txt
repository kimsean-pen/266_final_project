Some kind of doubt poisons my mind
Some kind of hope we struggle to find
Dreams die young, so don't forget to chase them

The devil on my shoulder hums an old drone
My fingertips are just blood, nerve, and bone
I'm seeking solace in the promise
That there is more to life than this

All of the blood, sweat, and tears
I shed to drown out the fears

It's been 1000 weeks of grinding my teeth
The salt of the earth has started tasting bittersweet
A silver spoon will only choke you in your sleep
I earned my heart, I'm proud of every beat
And if you hear through the grapevine
That I fell from a great height
The fire in my heart has lived a lifetime
So I don't mind, no, I don't mind
I'm still here to make my loved ones proud
To make everyone who ever walked away turn around
From dust, we must return to the ground
You owe it to yourself, you are eternally bound
To face the facts and face the truth
That the hand that you're dealt is determined by you
And if the breath in your lungs isn't reason to sing
Realise you're enough, you are everything

The devil on my shoulder hums an old drone
My fingertips are just blood, nerve, and bone
I'm seeking solace in the promise
That there is more to life than this

And if you hear through the grapevine
That I fell from a great height
The fire in my heart has lived a lifetime
So I don't mind, no, I don't mind

All of the blood, sweat, and tears
I shed to drown out the fears

Over and over again
Blessed are the beasts that we make of ourselves
Over and over again
Over and over again and again and again
