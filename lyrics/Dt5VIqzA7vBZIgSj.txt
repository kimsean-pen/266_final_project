Maybe I'll forget and maybe I won't
I'm stuck in the moment
And so far from home
'Cause loving nobody
It's breaking my heart
But you'll never know this
Wherever you are

Well maybe I don't give up easily
But I know this is hard to see
But I wish time would slow down
So I could keep your heart around
If I can make you stay another day
I'll wait another day for you, and for you

Maybe I'm love drunk, I wish that I'd known
What you would say if time would slow down
So I could keep your heart around
If I can make you stay another day
I'll wait another day for you

Well maybe I don't give up easily
Oh, but I know this is hard to see
But I know time won't slow down
So I can keep your heart in my hands
Oh, but maybe if you stay a little while
You might feel like I do for you
