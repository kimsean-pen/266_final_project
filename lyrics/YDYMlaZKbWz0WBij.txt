You
You
You

I laughed so much that I cried
I dance so much till I was tired
I drank some red wine
And now I'm walking on the sky
I had the time of my life

And you know I
I'm feeling alright
Cause I don't got to worry about a thing
And you know I
I'm feeling alright
Cause I don't got to worry about a thing

When I'm with you
I'm chilling I'm chilling
When I'm with you
I'm chilling I'm chilling
When I'm with you
I'm chilling I'm chilling
When I'm with you
I'm chilling I'm chilling
I'm chill

I sing so loud that I smiled
I made it worth my while
I drank some white wine
And now I'm walking on the sky
I had the time of my life

And you know I
I'm feeling alright
Cause I don't got to worry about a thing
And you know I
I'm feeling alright
Cause I don't got to worry about a thing

When I'm with you
I'm chilling I'm chilling
When I'm with you
I'm chilling I'm chilling
When I'm with you
I'm chilling I'm chilling
When I'm with you
I'm chilling I'm chilling
I'm chill

Every day, every day, every day chilling with you
Every day, every day, every day chilling with you
I'm chilling with you

I'm chilling with you
I'm chilling with you
I'm chilling with you

I'm chilling with you
I'm chilling with you
I'm chilling with you
And you know I
I'm feeling alright
Cause I don't got to worry about a thing
When I'm with you
I'm chilling I'm chilling
When I'm with you
I'm chilling I'm chilling
When I'm with you
I'm chilling I'm chilling
When I'm with you
I'm chilling I'm chilling
I'm chill
