It was a hot summer night and the beach was burning
There was fog crawling over the sand
Oh, when I listen to your heart, I hear the whole world turning
I see the shooting stars falling through your trembling hands

Oh, you were licking your lips and your lipstick's shining
I was dying just to ask for a taste
Oh, we were lying together in a silver lining
By the the light of the moon, you know there's not another moment
Not another moment
Not another moment to waste

Oh well, you hold me so close that my knees grow weak
But my soul is flying high above the ground
I'm trying to speak but no matter what I do
I just can't seem to make any sound

And then you took the words right out of my mouth
Oh, it must have been while you were kissing me
You took the words right out of my mouth
Oh, and I swear it's true
I was just about to say I love you (Love you)

And then you took the words right out of my mouth
Oh, it must have been while you were kissing me
You took the words right out of my mouth
Oh, and I swear it's true
I was just about to say I love you (Love you)

Now my body is shaking like a wave on the water
And I guess that I'm beginning to grin
Oh, we're finally alone and we can do what we want to
Oh, the night is young, ain't no one gonna know where
No one gonna know where
No one's gonna know where you've been

Oh, you were licking your lips and your lipstick's shining
I was dying just to ask for a taste
Oh, we were lying together in a silver lining
By the the light of the moon, you know there's not another moment to waste

And then you took the words right out of my mouth
Oh, it must have been while you were kissing me
You took the words right out of my mouth
Oh, and I swear it's true
I was just about to say I love you (Love you)

And then you took the words right out of my mouth
Oh, it must have been while you were kissing me
You took the words right out of my mouth
Oh, and I swear it's true
I was just about to say I love you (Love you)

And then you took the words right out of my mouth (Must have been while you were kissing me)
Oh, you took the words right out of my mouth (Must have been while you were kissing me)
Ooh, you took the words right out of my mouth (Must have been while you were kissing me)
Oh, you took the words right out of my mouth (Must have been while you were kissing me)
Oh, you took the words right out of my mouth (Must have been while you were kissing me)
Oh, you took the words right out of my mouth (Must have been while you were kissing me)
Oh, you took the words right out of my mouth (Must have been while you were kissing me)
Oh, you took the words right out of my mouth (Must have been while you were kissing me)
You took the words right out of my mouth
Oh, it must have been while you were kissing me
You took the words right out of my mouth
Oh, it must have been while you were kissing me
You took the words right out of my mouth
Oh, it must have been while you were kissing me
You took the words right out of my mouth
Oh, it must have been while you were kissing me
