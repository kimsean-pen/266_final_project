We'll scream it loud!
This is a melody; it's time to sing it out
So give us words before we all forget!

This is where I lift my hands and say enough is enough!
So many people are broken and they're not getting up
This is our offering; this is our hope!
This is what we believe in, and we're not giving up
This is our song

So sing out loud a for us.
It's all too much; I can feel my lungs collapse on me
Bitter soul why are you weeping tears that fall only for you?
This is our song

So sing out loud a for us
It's all too much; I can feel my lungs collapse on me

This is my worship; this is my life
To bring hope into this broken world
This is my worship; this is our worship!
This is our song
We'll scream it loud!
