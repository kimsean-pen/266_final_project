I tried to run but didn't get far
Before I heard them calling
I kissed her in a crowded bar
Stayed the night, left in the morning
I, I wish I could stay

You said you would wait
It's written all over your face
You're just like the rest, so heartless
I said I would wait but they keep dragging me away
Different places every day
Why go through this?

I go running to my friends
They always make it better
I've been sitting on the fence
Need to forgive or forget her
I, I can't walk away

I said I would wait but they keep dragging me away
Different places every day
Why go through this?
You said you would wait
It's written all over your face
You're just like the rest, so heartless

She'll search for another
And she'll never look back
And she's so pretty
I'm just not like that

You said you would wait
It's written all over your face
You're just like the rest, so heartless
I said I would wait but they keep dragging me away
Different places every day
Why go through this?
And it's so heartless
