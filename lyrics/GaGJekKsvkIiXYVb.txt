Bond of brothers
Jomsborg warriors

A legendary place
A stronghold big and proud
300 ships are sailing
Into the foreign lands
Brave ocean travelers
300 sails are moving

See their men
Jomsvikings come across the baltic sea
Blood of brothers
Jomsborg warriors

At night and day
We are sailing our way
We fear no storm tonight
Jomsborg

Our home and wives
We leave it all behind
We hold our banners high
Jomsborg
Beware the Norseman

Men of the baltic sea
Feared by their enemies
300 ships are sailing
Order of no retreat
Rule of the brotherhood
300 sails are moving

See their men
Jomsvikings come across the baltic sea
Bond of brothers
Jomsborg warriors

At night and day
We are sailing our way
We fear no storm tonight
Jomsborg

Our home and wives
We leave it all behind
We hold our banners high
Jomsborg

Jomsborg
Beware the Norseman
Beware the Norseman

One shield
One brotherhood
One order
Blood of brothers
Jomsborg warriors

See their men
Jomsvikings come across the baltic sea
Longships with dragonheads

Night and day
We are sailing our way
We fear no storm tonight
Jomsborg

Our home and wives
We leave it all behind
We hold our banners high
Jomsborg

Beware the Norseman
We fear no storm tonight
Jomsborg

Our home and wives
We leave it all behind
We hold our banners high
Jomsborg

Beware the Norseman
Blood of brothers
Jomsborg warriors
