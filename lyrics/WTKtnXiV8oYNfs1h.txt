I keep pushing, for more pulling
Finally grab the rope just to let go
I'm still searching, for more feeling
Look inside myself to find a black hole
I know I have issues
But I don't need to hear it coming from you
It's something that I work through?
The beating of my heart's not stopping any time soon
It's not stopping any time soon
Well I'm sick of it, over it, however you want it said
I'm telling it straight 'cause it might be the only chance I get
Just shut up
Just shut up
Would you stop telling me who I am
I'm sick of it, over it, however you want it said
I want closure on this chapter
Don't want to spend life looking out the window
I'm outta patience, I'm done waiting
Getting on my feet is what it comes to
I know I have issues
But I don't need to hear it coming from you
It's something that I work through?
The beating of my heart's not stopping any time soon
It's not stopping any time soon
Well I'm sick of it, over it, however you want it said
I'm telling it straight 'cause it might be the only chance I get
Just shut up
Just shut up
Would you stop telling me who I am
I'm sick of it, over it, however you want it said
I know I have issues
I know I have issues
I know I have issues
But I don't need to hear it coming from you
Well I'm sick of it, over it, however you want it said
I'm telling it straight 'cause it might be the only chance I get
Just shut up
Just shut up
Would you stop telling me who I am
I'm sick of it, over it, however you want it said
