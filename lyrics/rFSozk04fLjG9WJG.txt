I would kill to be your clothes
Cling to your body and hang from your bones
But I could make a mark If you would let me start

You've been feeling smaller
Take a different number
Like you do
Like you do
When you talk about it
You don't want to hear it
Tell me more, tell it all, can you take it

I would kill to be the cold
Tracing your body and shaking your bones
But I can't sleep at night
I can't sleep at night

You've been feeling smaller
Take a different number
Like you do
Like you do
When you talk about it
You don't want to hear it
Tell me more, tell it all, can you take it

I can find the things that I have left behind tonight if I try
If I try
I could find the things that I have left behind tonight if I tried
If I tried

You've been feeling smaller
Take a different number
Like you do
Like you do
When you talk about it
You don't want to hear it
Tell me more, tell it all, can you take it
