You woke up two hours too late
There's nothing but white and grey
Your plans they seem to have changed
This plane begins to elevate

Now we have reached our strain
I saw you used out for gain
This recycled air tastes plain
This body seems to levitate

It's so high it's almost outer space
I'm so tired I'm starting to lose face
