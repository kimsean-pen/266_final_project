Do you, do you, do you
Get sad and lonely?
That's what, that's what, that's what
Somebody said to me
Well I do, I do
She needs to know that there are tears behind these eyes
We've taken off our clothes, let's take off our disguise
It takes two, two

Love like nirvana
Fly high like Superman
Don't mask the monster
Why can't we just have the truth
Spill all our secrets in the room
Woah, oh, oh

It's you, you're my saving grace
My hideaway and
You, you're my sweetest taste
My hideaway
It's you, you're my saving grace
My hideaway and
You, you're my sweetest taste
My hideaway

We've all got something that bumps in the night
It's always loneliest before the light shines through, through
The city's burning but we play pretend
It's hard to feel when your back's in the [?] out of view, view

Love like nirvana
Fly high like Superman
Don't mask the monster
Why can't we just have the truth
Spill all our secrets in the room
Woah, oh, oh

It's you, you're my saving grace
My hideaway and
You, you're my sweetest taste
My hideaway
It's you, you're my saving grace
My hideaway and
You, you're my sweetest taste (oh)
(My hideaway)

Ay, ay, ay, ay-ay, ayy (my hideaway)
Ay, ay, ay, ay-ay, ayy (my hideaway)

It's you, you're my saving grace
My hideaway and
You, you're my sweetest taste
My hideaway
It's you, you're my saving grace
My hideaway and
You, you're my sweetest taste
My hideaway
It's you, you're my saving grace
(My hideaway and)
You, you're my sweetest taste
My hideaway
