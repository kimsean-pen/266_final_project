Sweetest scent
blinding spell
where you go
I will always follow

But I fell
I looked away
and at that very moment
every sign fell apart

Take me
from this empty road
and keep me by your side
if you read
through these colorless words
they will let you know
they will let you know I'm lost
I'm lost

Not a sound
not a soul
I walk on with no direction.
Every trace
of my home
was gone at the very moment I lost my faith.

Take me
from this empty road
and keep me by your side
if you read
through these colorless words
they will let you know
they will let you know I'm lost
I'm lost

Take me
from this empty road
and keep me by your side
if you read
through these colorless words
they will let you know
they will let you know I'm lost
I'm lost
