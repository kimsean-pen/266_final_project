That's the man you gotta give it to
we pay him our rent to have a hole in our roof
and when our neighbors burned
it was only because of telephone cords

Trash on sidewalks, broken windowpanes,
the pipes are leaking
they ain't gonna fix it 'til it's too far gone
they're gonna wash us away
we've got to say

you've got to fan the flames
you've got to stand up and break the chains
make a plan and demand what the damage pays
fan the flames

in the dark and the bitter cold
they're freezing us out, it's as good as gold
between the vacant homes
are fancy doorbells wrapped with ribbon and bow

getting hard to stay in tune
the boys are getting me down, i'll be staying in my room
but when the yuppies push us out
the boys are picking me up and sticking around

that's the man you gotta give it to
time and time again he plays us for a fool
and when our neighbors burned
the realtors shands with their backs turned
