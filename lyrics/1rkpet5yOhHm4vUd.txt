You act like you don't wanna listen
When I'm talkin'to you

You think yououtta do, baby
Anything, you wanna do
You must be crazy
Baby

You just gotta be out of your mind
As long as I'm payin' the bill, woman
I'm payin' the cost to be the boss

I'll drink if I wanna
And play a little poker too
Don't you say nothing to me
As long as I'm takin' care of you

As long as I'm workin', baby
And payin' all the bills
I don't want no mouth from you
About the way I'm supposed to live

You must be crazy, woman
Just gotta be out of your mind
As long as I'm footin' the bill
I'm paying the cost to be the boss

Now, that you've got me
You act like you're a shame
You don't act like my woman
You're just usin' my name

I tell you I'm gonna handle
Sll the money
And I don't wanna no back talk
'Cause if you don't like the way
I'm doin' just pick up your things
And walk

You gotta be crazy, baby
Oh, you must be out of your mind
As long as I'm payin' the bill
I'm payin' the cost to be the boss
