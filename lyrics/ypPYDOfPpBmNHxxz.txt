Breath in the advice
I wasn't meant for this world
And it's the only life I will ever have
Checking your teeth in the mirror
No one will ever know
That the only people you know
Are Mum and Dad...

When I look out of the window I see a silhouette
I'm stuck in this world
I'm bored of this life
But autumn's not for ever
Only the trees and feelings in my mind
