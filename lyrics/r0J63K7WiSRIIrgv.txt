You're so impossible, scream and moan it chills my soul
Don't wanna hear you got left behind
All those times you stayed up and cried it's no lie
You did it to yourself like chewed up gum under my shelf
Don't look surprised you must have know all along

It's just another love song, another love song

It's never easy it's not hard when you've lost your mind
With you it's sleazy don't tell me your worries
I'm sick, I'll leave you blind
Now the time has come to leave this love that's left you dry
No need to work this out now 'cause you know there's no reason why

It's just another love song, another love song
Another love song, it's just another love song

Never told you it would last forever
You can't hold this boy for long, dig it
By the time you read my letter
Baby, I'll be gone

You're just another love song, another love song
Another love song, you're just another love song
You're just another love song, another love song
Another love song, you're just another love song
