You'll be given love
You'll be taken care of
You'll be given love
You have to trust it

Maybe not from the sources
You have poured yours into
Maybe not
From the directions
You are staring at
Twist your head around

It's all around you
All is full of love
All around you

(All is full of love)
You just ain't receiving
(All is full of love)
Your phone is off the hook (All is full of love)
Your doors are all shut
(All is full of love)
And be the little angel
All is full of love (All is full of love)
All is full of love (All is full of love)
All (All is full of love)
All is full of love (All is full of love)
(All is full of love)
(All is full of love)
(All is full of love)
