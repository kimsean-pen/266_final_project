Been driving all night
It's stuck in my mind
Burning through lights
All I can find
Is lonely in a guarded room
But I don't wanna leave too soon
In case I miss someone like you

They are my goodbyes
I'm done for the night
Saw you outside
And I look in your eyes
Falling in a deep unknown
Getting late, I have to go
I can't leave, I have to know

Get into my car, get into my life
Get into my heart, you know what I like
Can give me something that I don't know how to live without
I don't wanna miss and I can't let this could pass me now

It's taking me up
You're talking me down
Your love is so loud
And it's drowning them out
Voices in my head again
Where you start is where they end
Never gonna wanna let you live, yeah

Get into my car, get into my life
Get into my heart, you know what I like
Can give me something that I don't know how to live without
I don't wanna miss and I can't let this could pass me now

And I, and I, and I've got my head spinning, spinning
And I, and I, and I feel like I've been running
And I, and I, and I've got this feeling, feeling
That you and I, that you and I will just keep driving

Get into my car, get into my life
Get into my heart, you know what I like
Can give me something that I don't know how to live without
I don't wanna miss and I can't let this could pass me now

I just wanna drive
I just wanna drive
I just wanna drive
I just wanna drive, drive, drive

So get into my car
