You catch my eye and I am frozen in conversation,
'Cause for a moment I can see,
You lead me in and down this road with an invitation,
A promise you could never keep.

Why would you say I am the one you want?
What game you playing?
How could you say I'm not the one you need?
Why would you say I am the one you want,
See the toll it's taking?
How could you say I'm not the one you need?

So even if you try to say there's a way to save us,
I'll have to wonder what is true.
'Cause you deny the look that lies over both your faces,
You show me one but I see two.

Why would you say I am the one you want?
What game you playing?
How could you say I'm not the one you need?
Why would you say I am the one you want,
See the toll it's taking?
How could you say I'm not the one you need?
