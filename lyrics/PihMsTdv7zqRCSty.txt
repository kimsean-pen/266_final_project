You think that you can just count me out
No indecision left to think about
I'm done with keeping silent in my mouth
This thoughtless drought
You're so out of touch with the things you confide in
You play games in your head
While I'm stuck losing them
Hold your knife to my throat
No content, all for show
Jump in and out of place
No room to fall and bruise
Kept all my focus strained
Yet I'm still last to move

Why do I pretend to keep caring
When I know I'll never keep my peace?
I pretend to keep caring
When I know you'll never let this be

I know you'll never let this be

What makes you my thoughts so nice enough to hurt everytime
Locked away inside my own grave
Tear down something great,
patch it up with hate just to fill the space
I'm staring at the floor
But I'll never understand it

Why do I pretend to keep caring
When I know I'll never keep my peace?
I pretend to keep caring
When I know you'll never let this be

Why do I pretend to keep caring
When I know I'll never keep my peace?
I pretend to keep caring
When I know you'll never let this be
