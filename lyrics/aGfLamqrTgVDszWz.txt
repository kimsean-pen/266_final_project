My beautiful liar
Why are you crying
On your knees
You've crucified yourself
And now denial is rising

Why. Why
So tell me

So tell me how did you
lose yourself at sea
Drifting within
So tell me why did you
cast yourself away
It's such a sweet addiction
You should celebrate

My beautiful liar
You are drowning
In your fear
You're cutting into me
You think if I bleed
It can save you

Why. Why
So tell me

So tell me how did you
lose yourself at sea
Drifting within
So tell me why did you
cast yourself away
It's such a sweet addiction
You should celebrate

And you know if I could
I'd take your pain
But will you turn and
face your disease

So tell me how did you
lose yourself at sea
Drifting within
So tell me why did you
cast yourself away
It's such a sweet addiction
You should celebrate

So tell me why
You should celebrate
So tell me why
You should celebrate
