Way after lion's in here
There's lions in here, there's lions in here
In after seas, no fear
Just seems so frail, there's lions in here
Way after lion's in here
There's lions in here, there's lions in here
In after seas, no fear
Just seems so frail, there's lions in here

Extra, extra, read all about it
You think you slow me down? I highly doubt it
I own the paper boys, and you're the buyer
Your world is my world now to live and die in

Does anybody need to eat?
Does anybody need to breathe?
Got you blindfolded on your knees
Run, run, run, come undone

Falling into a swarm of bees
Swallow everything you don't believe
Drink away all of your memories
Say goodbye to your family
It's bigger than life, it's bigger than love, it's bigger than us, bigger than love
It's bigger than life, it's bigger than love, it's bigger than us, bigger than love

Way after lion's in here
There's lions in here, there's lions in here
In after seas, no fear
Just seems so frail, there's lions in here

Quicksand, quicksand
What's so surprising?
Make your decision, man
Sinking or rising?
Sew up your eyelids
Now you're divided
Money for loyalty, that's how I like it

Does anybody need to eat?
Does anybody need to breathe?
Got you blindfolded on your knees
Run, run, run, come undone

Falling into a swarm of bees
Swallow everything you don't believe
Drink away all of your memories
Say goodbye to your family
It's bigger than life, it's bigger than love, it's bigger than us, bigger than love
It's bigger than life, it's bigger than love, it's bigger than us, bigger than love

Falling into a swarm of bees
Swallow everything you don't believe
Drink away all of your memories
Say goodbye to your family
It's bigger than life, it's bigger than love, it's bigger than us, bigger than love
It's bigger than life, it's bigger than love, it's bigger than us, bigger than love

Way after lion's in here
There's lions in here, there's lions in here
