She's about to walk away
So if you're gonna make her wanna stay
Tell her she's your moon and sun
Tell her that she's always been the one
You've gotta say it from the heart
'Cause she will know a fake right from the start
A girl like that deserves the best
You've got to show her (show her!) that you're not like all the rest

It's about time that you put your cards back on the table
Oh, It's about time that you show her you're willing and able
Oh, It's about time that you get the girl back
That you get the girl back on your side, ooh
You've got to get the girl back, get the girl back, yeah

(You've got to get the girl back)

Tell her she was always right
You were in the wrong, you can't deny
'Cause when she's caught somebody's eye
It'll be too late to apologise
Before she shuts you out, oh yeah!
You've got to tell her (tell her!) tell her that there is no doubt

It's about time that you put your cards back on the table
Oh, It's about time that you show her you're willing and able
Oh, It's about time that you get the girl back
That you get the girl back on your side, ooh
You've got to get the girl back, get the girl back, yeah

You've got to get the, you've got to get the girl back

You've got to get the girl back, get the girl back, back on your side
Get the girl back, get the girl back, you've got to, you've got to
Get the girl back, get the girl back, back on your side
Get the girl back, get the girl back, cause it's...

It's about time,
You get the girl, oh
It's about time, ooooooh no, ooooooh no

You've got to get the girl back, get the girl back, back on your side
Get the girl back, get the girl back, back on your side
Get the girl back, get the girl back, back on your side
Get the girl back, You've got to get the girl back!
