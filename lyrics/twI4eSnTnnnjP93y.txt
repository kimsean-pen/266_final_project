i've been having these dreams
i've been dreaming

i'm on the beach, oh yeah
to rest my feet, oh yeah
those poets grin(?), oh yeah
who never sin, oh yeah
they fight with russians, oh yeah
and have discussions, oh yeah
with the kgb, oh yeah
at the baltic sea, oh yeah
they know the pope, oh yeah
he's a regular joe, oh yeah
they say 'give it to me' (x 24)

i, i and when i woke up
i had a tear in my eye
i was crying

i've been having these dreams
i know this woman, oh yeah
lives in a tomb, oh yeah
she played a song, oh yeah
but she can talk, oh yeah
the things she says, oh yeah
could raise the dead, oh yeah
she says that god, oh yeah
he turned her bod, oh yeah
from a chocolate malt, oh yeah
to a pillar of salt, oh yeah
she says 'one, two, three, four
give it to me' (x 20)

and when i woke up
i had a tear in my eye

in my last dream, oh yeah
i made the scene, oh yeah
with tomahawk, oh yeah
we took a walk, oh yeah
down lover's lane, oh yeah
to serenade, oh yeah
in passion view, oh yeah
in cowboy suits, oh yeah
they say 'one, two, three, four
give it to me' (x 13)

and i was crying
