Do I stress you out?
My sweater is on backwards and inside out
And you say, "How appropriate"

I don't dissect everything today
I don't mean to pick you apart you see
But I can't help it

An' there I go jumpin' before the gunshot has gone off
Slap me with a splintered ruler
And it would knock me to the floor if I wasn't there already
If only I could hunt the hunter

And all I really want is some patience
A way to calm the angry voice
And all I really want is deliverance
Ah, aao, aao, aao, aa, aah

Do I wear you out?
You must wonder why I'm relentless and all strung out
I'm consumed by the chill of solitary

I'm like Estella
I like to reel it in and then spit it out
I'm frustrated by your apathy

And I am frightened by the corrupted ways of this land
If only I could meet the maker
And I am fascinated by the spiritual man
I am humbled by his humble nature, ya

An' what I wouldn't give to find a soul mate?
Someone else to catch this drift
An' what I wouldn't give to meet a kindred?
Ah, aao, aao, aao, aa, aah

Enough about me, let's talk about you for a minute
Enough about you, let's talk about life for a while
The conflicts, the craziness
And the sound of pretenses is fallin'
All around, all around

Why are you so petrified of silence?
Here can you handle this?

Did you think about your bills, your ex, your deadlines
Or when you think you're gonna die?
Or did you long for the next distraction?

An' all I need now is intellectual intercourse
A soul to dig the hole much deeper
And I have no concept of time other than it is flyin'
If only I could kill the killer

An' all I really want is some peace man
A place to find a common ground
And all I really want is a wavelength
Ah, aao, aao, aao, aa, aah

An' all I really want is some comfort
A way to get my hands untied
And all I really want is some justice
Ah, aao, aao, aao, aa, aah

'Cause all I really want is some patience
And all I really want is deliverance
A place to find a common ground
And all I really want is some justice
