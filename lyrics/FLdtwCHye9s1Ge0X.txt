I was cold and lonely
And I took you in just trying to be kind
Tired of lifelong solitude
My senses undermined
I've kept things under strict control
Resisted all diversion
Endless years of false rewards
Lie wrecked in this subversion

I've got games to play
I've got places to go
I want to surrender
I want you to go
If I were you
I'd be out on the town
Oh why, oh why
Are you hanging around?

A fool like me
Don't be seen with me
A fool like me
Don't be seen with me

Order and duty thrown to the winds
I've lost all sense of reason
In the heat of the day, I'm a stowaway
On a sinking ship of treason
I've too much to do, I can't stop now
Distraction brings me down
Drag me deeper into murky waters
Smile and watch me drown

Fresh from the cradle and you're a passion lethal
Innocence smiles down nasty evils who are a fool like me
Don't be seen with me
I've got games to play
I've got places to go
I want to surrender
I want you to go
If I were you
I'd be out on the town
Oh why, oh why
Are you hanging around?

A fool like me
Don't be seen with me
A fool like me
Don't be seen with me
