Oooohhhh ahhhh,
Stuff like that, ahhhh
Oooohhhh ahhhh, stuff like that

Where did you come from
Out of the blue
You must have read my mind
I was thinking of you

You whispered sweet nothings
(You whispered sweet nothings)
I longed to hear (I longed to hear)
I want you near

Keep saying, keep saying to me
Stuff like that
I'm waiting, I'm waiting for
Stuff like that
Can't help it, can't get enough of
Stuff like that
Keep saying, keep saying to me
Stuff like that

Nothing but pleasure
Just me and you
Let's join the party yeah
Let's raise the roof
You whispered sweet nothings
(You whispered sweet nothings)
I longed to hear (I longed to hear)
I want you near

Keep saying, keep saying to me
Stuff like that
I'm waiting, I'm waiting for
Stuff like that
Can't help it, can't get
Enough of stuff like that
Keep saying, keep saying to me
Stuff like that

I can't help it, I can't get enough
You've got to give it to me sometime
I can't help it, I can't get enough
You've got to say it to me

Keep saying, keep saying to me
Stuff like that
I'm waiting, I'm waiting for
Stuff like that
(You've got to give it to me sometime)
Can't help it, can't get enough of
Stuff like that
(You've got to say it to me all night)
Keep saying, keep saying to me
Stuff like that
You've got to say it to me
