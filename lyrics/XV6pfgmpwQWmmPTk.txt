I am a mountain,
I am a tall tree, oh,
I am a swift wind sweeping the country.
I am a river down in the valley, oh,
I am a vision and I can see clearly.

If anybody asks you who I am
Just stand up tall
Look 'em in the face and say

I am a giant,
I am an eagle, oh,
I am a lion
Down in the jungle.
I am a marching band,
I am the people, oh,
I am a helping hand.
I am a hero.

If anybody asks you who I am
Just stand up tall
Look 'em in the face and say

I'm that mountain peak up high,
I'm that star up in the sky.
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest.
I'm that little bit of hope
With my back against the ropes.
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest.

I'm that mountain peak up high,
I'm that star up in the sky.
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest.
I'm that little bit of hope
With my back against the ropes.
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest.

In the ring of life, I'll reign, love,
And the world will notice a king.
