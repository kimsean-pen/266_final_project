And if there's nothing left to say
I'll string you along until I get my way
Use all those subtle inquiries
Like I want to know if you aim to please

And if you want to dance
If she wants to lead, I won't mind
Let's try this all again only faster now
Now go ahead and pretend I'm your master now
And if you want to dance, if she wants to lead
I'll go out of my way, I'll do anything
And one word is all I need

And if
You know it's all in your mind
Take your time with this one

You both deserve a good time
In every position that I can think of

If you want to dance, if she wants to leave
I'll go out of my way. I'll do anything
And one word is all I need

Let's try this all again, only faster now
Now go ahead and pretend I'm your master now
And if you want to dance, if she wants to lead
I'll go out of my way to make you believe
That your love is all I need
