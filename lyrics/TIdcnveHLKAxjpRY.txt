Pause to repeat.
Act out, lose sleep.
Your prayers, loose leaf,
cut your teeth.

No big surprise.
Bat eyes, that's nice,
you're past, past prime.
Fold your knife.

Some get it wrong.
Stand by and smile
for you to appease,
side by side.

I'll take it back
when you're built to last.
And although I'd love to be head first,
while keeping it nice and neat,
what's worse?
