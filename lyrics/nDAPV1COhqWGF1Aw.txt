Ba da da, ba da da, ba da.

He was a star collector, she knew about the skies.
He was a tight-rope walker, she was the talk of the town.
While he was in the clouds
he'd show her the signs and he'd know what they mean...
Twinkle twinkle, little dream.

Stargazer, heartbreaker.
Wish you were here.
How will I shine anymore without your atmosphere?
My dear stargazer, don't disappear.
How will shine anymore when you're not here?

Ba da da, ba da da, ba da.

She had it all and lost it, now he's forever in space.
He circles Haley's comet, lights up the sky like a flame.
Now she's the star collector,
she knows the signs and she knows what they mean...
Twinkle twinkle, little dream.

Stargazer, heartbreaker.
Wish you were here.
How will I shine anymore without your atmosphere?
My dear stargazer, don't disappear.
How will shine anymore when you're not here?

You're my every day and the moment I wake up lonely;
You're the only one who can restart for me...
Twinkle twinkle, little dream.

Stargazer, heartbreaker.
Wish you were here.
How will I shine anymore without your atmosphere?
My dear stargazer, don't disappear.
How will shine anymore when you're not here?

(Ba da da, ba da da, ba da) Give me a shooting star.
(Ba da da, ba da da, ba da)
And I'll make a wish, I'll make a wish for you.
(Ba da da, ba da da, ba da)
(Ba da da, ba da da, ba da) How will I shine anymore when you're not here?
