See how the world goes round
You've got to help yourself
See how the world goes round
Then you'll help someone else

See how the world goes round
You've got to help yourself
See how the world goes round
Then you'll help someone else

ピカピカのクツを脱いで
煙草を消して
大事な指輪をはずしたら
七つのボタンをはずし
生まれたままに
生きてる自分を
愛してみよう

See how the world goes round
You've got to help yourself
See how the world goes round
Then you'll help someone else

See how the world goes round
You've got to help yourself
See how the world goes round
Then you'll help someone else

自慢のバッグを置いて
ルージュをとって
涙の真珠をふいてみて
上手な化粧をおとし
心の奥を
鏡の中に
映してみよう

See how the world goes round
You've got to help yourself
See how the world goes round
Then you'll help someone else

上手な化粧を落し
生まれたままに
生きてる自分を
愛してみよう

See how the world goes round
You've got to help yourself
See how the world goes round
Then you'll help someone else

See how the world goes round
You've got to help yourself
See how the world goes round
And you may help me

See how the world goes round
You've got to help yourself
See how the world goes round
Then you'll help someone else

See how the world goes round
You've got to help yourself
See how the world goes round
Then you'll help someone else
