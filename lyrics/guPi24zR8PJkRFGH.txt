You're freaking
You're a flipper
Woah! All kinds of shit
(You think you know me)
Weed, crack, and dope
(Damn, Peggy!)

All I need is rest
I am uncontested
How can I confess this
Watch how I finesse
How you so invested
This can't be your best, 'cause
I am not impressed
Bullets through my body
I'm a different shotty
You my favorite mess
Bitch I'm never pressed
Keep a fresh bic
Ride down 86
Hit!
Roll deep like the kettt
Bitch I'm "Smoke"
Too fly in the whip
Hit!
Fake news
We ain't pressed
Is it safe now?
Got my trey pound
In case a pig wanna test
Yeet! (Work)

I'm bout yeet on these niggas! (Work hard...)

Work hard
Twerk hard
26 no kids, yea
Talk shit, back it up
No fades
Throw shade
Whole game
Look a damn mess
Aye, fuck the cappin'
No stress
I'm vexed
What the fuck is my appearance
I keep a ratchet
I like em YesJulz moaning
Like a actress
Ain't got no standards
I'm kinda passive
Young Rich Swann
We gon' cash in
Dust off the ratchets

We got some action

I'm on the main line
I'm tryna catch 'em

I wish, I wish a nigga would, man
I wish a nigga would try to test me

I wish a nigga would go against me
I'm a thug, I don't play with no rap beef

Fuck around, end up on backstreet
And I done cried so many times
Look

I wish, wooosh
I wish a nigga would try to test me
I wish a nigga would go against me
I'm a thug, I don't play with no rap beef
Fuck around, end up on backstreet
And I done cried so many times
I done did so many crimes
No time, y'all gassed up for the new line
Ugh
I'll make a nigga cry at his own pad
I'll make a nigga cry for his dead dad
I'll make a nigga cry for his fat wife
I'll make a nigga cry for...
I'll make a nigga cry for help
I'll make a nigga cry for himself (thug tears!!)
