Adolescent dreams running in stride with me
Reason for misbehaving indulging all my cravings
Making time for daydreaming and never really seeing
I sit around just teeming
Everything losing meaning

Is this the meaning of being free?
The only one of, this island is me
Is this our one true destiny?
Everywhere I look on the scene
Are islands of me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me
Islands of me

The custom of my country is to never grow up
Run away from everything 'til I get better luck
Why should I have to look and never touch?
What I wanna touch, what I wanna touch
What I wanna touch?

Is this the meaning of being free?
When only one of, this island is me
Is this what where all meant to be?
Everywhere I look on the scene
Are islands of me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me

Adolescent dreams breaking out of me
But the sun is coming and the world is running
Kool-Aid I drink, pour it on the street
In memory of my melancholy

Is this the meaning of being free?
The only one of, this island is me
Is this our one true destiny?
Everywhere I look on the scene
Are islands of me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me
Islands of me
