The world was on fire and no one could save me but you
strange what desire will make foolish people do
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you

now I don't want to fight anymore
no, I don't want to fight anymore
with you
with you

What a wicked game to play
to make me feel this way
what a wicked thing to do
to let me dream of you
what a wicked thing to say
you've never felt this way
what a wicked thing to do
to make me dream of you

and I don't want to fight anymore
no, I don't want to fight anymore
with you
with you

the world was on fire and no one could save me but you
strange what desire will make foolish people do
I never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you
I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you

now, I don't want to fight anymore
no, I don't want to fight anymore
with you
with you

nobody loves no one
