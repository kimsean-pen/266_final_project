Love this place, but I gotta keep moving
You got the best thing right now, it's no illusion
It's time for fun, love's only when young
The time has come for new romance

And we'll be singing this song when you're out
Everything will be better when you come out of it
Come out of it
Yeah everyone wants you out here

I want in, right all night LA calling
Bathe in sunlight
Coldest sky she's hot as lust is
I don't want them, I want you
I want you

Thought was all gonna end
I didn't want it to end
Cause I was feeling on top
I was feeling on top of the world
Thinking about you girl

And we'll be singing this song when you're out
Everything will be better when you come out of it
Come out of it
Yeah everyone wants you out here

I want in, right all night LA calling
Bathe in sunlight
Coldest sky she's hot as lust is
I don't want them, I want you
I want you

I want in, right all night LA calling
Bathe in sunlight
Coldest sky, she's hot as lust is
I know where my heart is
I want you
I want you
I want you

Thought was all gonna end
I didn't want it to end
Cause we're feeling on top
Cause we're feeling on toá¹— of the game
From now on it's never gonna be the same

Everywhere, everyone gather round the world,
Give thanks throughout the world
Everywhere, everyone gather round the world,
Give thanks throughout the world

I want in, right all night LA calling
Bathe in sunlight
Coldest sky, she's hot as lust is
I don't want them,

I want in, right all night LA calling
Bathe in sunlight
Coldest sky she's hot as lust is
I know where my heart is
I want you
I want you
