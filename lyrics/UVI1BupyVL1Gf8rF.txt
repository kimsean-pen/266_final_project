I dwell above the sea of flames

I dwell above the sea of flames
Waiting for the moment when my harness breaks
And I burn
Burn like my idols

Nothing is pure
No, nothing at all
(No, nothing at all)

Reality hurts
My demons stripped from the earth
Connected by flesh that I'm not comfortable in
It wasn't me but it should've been

I lost a stranger
And my heart is crushed

No longer blind
To deaths cold touch
No longer hurt
Just scared to burn like the rest

All my heroes went to hell
All my heroes went to hell
