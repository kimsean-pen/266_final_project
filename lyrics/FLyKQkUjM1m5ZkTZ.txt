the fire dies on it's own
leaving us to ourselfs but not exactly alone
I think that someone is out there waiting
anticipation has grown
the air is black as can be
can't even see that my hand is infront of me
I'm overhearind a whisper "they won't escape until the blood is set free"

so turn back the silence is deafening
turn back don't let them see you again
they make their rounds at the midnight hour and
on the clock it's just a minute away

so we're hours awake and our only mistake is we bleed
and the huger for the living helps them hunt it with the greatest of ease

now I'm finding my friends
hanging from trees, made a bed of a barb wired fence
I'm on the loose with my neck in the noose but hey...
I enjoy the intense

turn back the silence is deafening
turn back don't let them see you again
they make their rounds at the midnight hour and
on the clock it's just a minute awey

so we're hours awake and our only mistake is we bleed
and the hunger for the living helps then hunt it with the greatest of ease
no experience could never match the sight of when a person is through
if it's the last thing I will do i'll be the one who will escape from hellview... and I will

turn back the silence is deafening
turn back don't let them see you again
they make the rounds at the midnight hour and
on the clock it's just a minute away [twice]

so we're hours awake and our only mistake is we bleed
and the hunger for the living helps them hunt it with the greatest of ease
no experience could ever match the sight of when a person is through
if it's the last thing I will do I'll be the one that will escape from hellview... and I will.
