You and me were meant to be but it's a shame
We had everything and let it go to waste
Now we're all alone
Standing face to face
I wanna ask you something before you walk away

Can we forget about the sorry's?
Remember how we started?
Lost in love again tonight
So let's forget about the breakup
Remember how we made up
Lost in love again tonight

Before you go let's get lost one last time
Lay you down make you fly
Don't speak words, don't ask why
Before you go
Take you up to the clouds
Don't care who hears the sound
Are you hearing me now?
Before you go
Before you go
Before you go

Out into the world and leave me here alone
You said some things, I did some things
Nobody's wrong
Let's stop pointing fingers
Yeah we're all to blame
Just tryna ask you something before you walk away

Can we forget about the sorry's?
Remember how we started?
Lost in love again tonight

Before you go let's get lost one last time
Lay you down make you fly
Don't speak words, don't ask why
Before you go
Take you up to the clouds
Don't care who hears the sound
Are you hearing me now?
Before you go
Before you go
Before you go

You can't deny this
Don't wanna fight it
I know you feel it too
So before you go
You can't deny this
Don't wanna fight it
I know you feel it too

So before you go lets get lost one last time
Lay you down make you fly
Don't speak words, don't ask why
Before you go
Take you up to the clouds
Don't care who hears the sound
Are you hearing me now?
Before you go
Before you go
Before you go

You can't deny this
Don't wanna fight it
I know you feel it too
So before you go
You can't deny this
Don't wanna fight it
I know you feel it too
So before you go
