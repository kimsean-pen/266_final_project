All I believe in is a dream
I haunt the Earth though I am fully seen
In all my years I've never felt more sure than now
Well, I got to get off this rock somehow

I feel so homesick
Where's my home
Where I belong
Where I was born
I was taught to go
Where the wind would blow
And it blows away - away

Well, my eyes are full of stars
But I just can't reach 'em... oh, how high they are
I gotta believe what I'm thinking -?
But in a modern world that can be so hard to do

I feel so homesick
Where's my home
Where I belong
Where I was born
I was taught to go
Where the wind would blow
And it blows away - away

I wake up
Rise to the sun
I go to work
And I come back home
I wake up
Rise to the sun
I go to work
And I come back home

Come back home
