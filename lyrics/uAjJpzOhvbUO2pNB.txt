Play along
Missed the last bus home
So you come with me
Now I got my whole team
Heavyweight
Snap a vertebrae
If it keeps you here

It's got to be you
Got to be you
Priceless touch and I'll pay the cost
Oh to get close to you
I want to be used
I want to get used
Spit me out anytime you want
Spitting me out anytime you want

So easy
I could be replaced
You could bait fresh meat
Plenty fish in them seas
Play along
Fight long gone
You're a war machine
Let you hold it over me

Smother those that came before
Don't think about all the seven billion more
That could be
I don't want none

It's got to be you
Got to be you
Priceless touch and I'll pay the cost
Oh to get close to you
I want to be used
I want to get used
Spit me out anytime you want
Spitting me out anytime

Got to be you
It's got to be you

It's got to be you
It had to be you, you

It's got to be you
It's got to be you
Priceless touch and I'll pay the cost
Oh to get close to you
I want to be used
I want to get used
Spit me out anytime you want
Spitting me out anytime you want
You
It's got to be you
Priceless touch and I'll pay the cost
Oh to get close to you
I want to be used
I want to get used
Spit me out anytime you want
Spitting me out anytime you want
Spitting me out anytime you want
Spitting me out anytime you want
Spitting me out anytime you want
Spitting me out anytime you want
