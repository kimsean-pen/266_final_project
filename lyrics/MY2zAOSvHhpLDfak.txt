It's funny what you find
When you're not looking for it
I've known you all my life
Didn't know that I could feel this
Finding the perfect places only we can go
Driving in that old car on that dirty road
You were everybody's son
You watched me lose my way
And I didn't want to hear it
Made all the big mistakes
Didn't know I was being selfish
Lying to get more time in on that dirty road
Why am I so blind when it's you and I alone?
You were everybody's son
You were everybody's son
I didn't know before
But now I've seen it all
Give me some more
Give me some more
It took a little time to open up my eyes
And know you were mine
And know you were always mine
It's funny what you find
When you're not looking for it
Lying to get more time in on that dirty road
Why am I so blind when it's you and I alone?
Finding the perfect places only we can go
Driving in that old car on that dirty road
You were everybody's son
You were everybody's son
Everybody's son
Everybody's son
