Day outside grows black
I lie faceup in my shell
Squeeze my eyes shut and feel like
Falling into blank space

Had allowed that life to drift
For I've chosen a different trail
When light fades I feel like
Falling into blank space

So you realized, ingested real life
Grew up in the time of pushing through the crowds
So you realized, chose unreal life
Settled in the mobile handy pocket size

Wanted to be your light, illuminate your smiles
Wanted to be your cure, bridge between self and us
Wanted to be your prayer, wipe the tears from your eyes
But I turned my back... Come on!

Could have been a tree of dawn
Rooted deeply in the ground
Bearing fruits far away from
Falling into blank space

But I took refuge from myself
In the crowded solitude
Now I dash and feel like
Falling into blank space

Wanted to be your light illuminate your smiles
Wanted to be your cure, bridge between self and us
Wanted to be your prayer, wipe the tears from your eyes
But I turned my back
Got lost inside

Come on!
