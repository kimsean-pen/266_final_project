You've got a lot of nerve
I've got a little time
So try to make it hurt
It's nothing that I haven't heard a thousand times

And you've got your little girlfriends
So here we go again
See I don't ever care to know
The parts of you, you never show
You think a liar like yourself
Could go and bother someone else
So go, go away, take your things
Leave today
Finally get what you deserve
Oh, you have got a lot of nerve!

You've got your little campaign
A dirty, little smile
A snap inside my left brain
It's something that I haven't heard in quite awhile

And you've got your little girlfriends
So here we go again!
See I don't ever care to know
The parts of you, you never show
You'd think a liar like yourself
Could go and bother someone else
So go, go away, take your things
Leave today
Finally, get what you deserve
Oh, you have got a lot of nerve!
Oh!

The careful, careful lies you tell
And the campaign that your body sells
Is the careful carriage ride to hell
Enjoy yourself!

And I don't ever care to know
The parts of you, you never show
You think a liar like yourself
Could go and bother someone else
So go, go away, take your things
Leave today
Finally get what you deserve
Oh, you have got a lot of nerve!
You've got a lot of nerve!
