I sit at my table and wage war on myself.
It seems like it's all, it's all for nothing.
I know the barricades,
and I know the mortar in the wall breaks.
I recognise the weapons, I've used them well.

(Freedom)
This is my mistake,
let me make it good.
I raised the wall

and I will be the one to knock it down.
I've a rich understanding of my finest defences.
I proclaim that claims are left unstated,

I demand a rematch.
I decree a stalemate.
I divine my deeper motives.
I recognise the weapons,
I've practised them well,

I fitted them myself.
(Freedom)
It's amazing what devices you can sympathize.
Empathise.
This is my mistake, let me make it good.

I raised the wall
and I will be the one to knock it down.
Reach out for me.
Hold me tight.
Hold that memory.

Let my machine talk to me,
let my machine talk to me.
This is my world, and I am the World Leader Pretend.
This is my life, and this is my time.

I have been given the freedom to do as I see fit.
It's high time I razed the walls that I've constructed.
(Freedom)
It's amazing what devices you can sympathize.
Empathise.

This is my mistake, let me make it good.
I raised the wall,
and I will be the one to knock it down.
You fill in the mortar.
You fill in the harmony.
You fill in the mortar.
I raised the wall,
and I'm the only one,
I will be the one to knock it down.
