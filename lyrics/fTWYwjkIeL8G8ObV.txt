The useless drag of another day;
The endless drags of a death rock boy.
Mascara sure and lipstick lost,
Glitter burned by restless thoughts, of being forgotten.

And in your sad machines, you'll forever stay,
Desperate and displeased with whoever you are,
And you're a star.

Somewhere he pulls his hair down over a frowning smile.
A hidden diamond you cannot find;
A secret star that cannot shine, over to you.
May the king of gloom, be forever doomed.

And in your sad machines, you'll forever stay.
Burning up in speed, lost inside the dreams, of teen machines.

The useless drags, the empty days.
The lonely towers of long mistakes.
To forgotten faces and faded loves.
Sitting still was never enough.

And if you're giving in, then you're giving up.
'Cause in your sad machines, you'll forever stay.
Burning up in speed, lost inside the dreams, of teen machines.
