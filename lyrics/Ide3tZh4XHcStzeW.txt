quick shadow dribbling down me
i'm looking over my shoulder
justifying anything's easy
like, you look when you hear a sound

somebody once told me
"loosen up your eyes
because it feels nice"
then no more on that subject
i blindly led you on & me in the process

thick pupil dilating quietly
i'm looking over my shoulder
just if i'm within the interstices
then i'm looking for when you come 'round

somebody once told me
"loosen up your eyes
because it feels nice"
but then no more on that subject
i blindly led you on & me in the process

don't ask how my day was, don't ask anything else
(Where did all the time go? // Where'd you put my suitcase?)
