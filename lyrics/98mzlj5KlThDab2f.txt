The desert I wander lacks its mirage
There's no mistaking in the barrage
Of sand and wind that tears my skin (tears my skin)
Leaving what's without exposing what's within

Forsaken, left here
In my barren desolate

My soul is evaporating
Won't you saturate me, won't you saturate me?
Rain down on me with life
My soul is evaporating
Won't you saturate me, won't you saturate me?
Storm around me, bring the tide

My days stretch long into the heat
As the sun brightens my defeat
My lips are chapped, they're parched and dry (parched and dry)
My thirst it builds, with every day gone by

Forsaken, left here
In my barren desolate

My soul is evaporating
Won't you saturate me, won't you saturate me?
Rain down on me with life
My soul is evaporating
Won't you saturate me, won't you saturate me?
Storm around me, bring the tide

The dunes that shift, drift and lift in the wind
Cover up my hope, as I start to give in
To the cracks and creases and the dips in my will
As I am pushed toward the brink, I drink down there and swell

My soul is evaporating
Won't you saturate me, won't you saturate me?
(Won't you saturate me?)
Rain down on me with life
My soul is evaporating
Won't you saturate me, won't you saturate me?
Storm around me, bring the tide
My soul is evaporating
Won't you saturate me, won't you saturate me?
Rain down on me with life
My soul... oh...
