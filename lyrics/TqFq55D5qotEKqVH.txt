Everything's alone, it's just the way I left
I can't even trace where this other life began
Driving down the same old street
Sometimes I forget to breathe
You won't ever hear me sing this one again

Far back in my memory I hear your words
But somehow someone's poisoned me and now they're cursed
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
I would never let you go
The only way it'd work is if I were provoked

Ooooh, you had control
Ooooh, so long ago

As hard as you can try, this heart of mine won't break
Go 'head and knock me down, there's so much I can take
I know that you wish me well
But, darlin', I can never tell
It's tricky when your love is just some cry for help

Ooh you had control
Ooooh, so long ago
Ooooh, you had control
Ooooh, so long ago

Our peace is lingering in my head
Like rotten leaves, you're choking me with the stem
And now I see so far down this road ahead
It doesn't mean whatever the hell we said

Rain is falling here on this other side of town
I'm sure that it's clear wherever you are right now
Say you don't believe in me
Just so I can finally leave
'Cause you're the only thing that's keepin' me around
Ooooh, you had control
Oooh, so long ago
Ooh, you had control
Ooooh, so long ago
