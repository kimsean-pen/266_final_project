This is the central scrutinizer.
Joe has just worked himself into an imaginary frenzy
during the fade-out of his imaginary song.
He begins to feel depressed now.
He knows the end is near.
He has realized at last
that imaginary guitar notes
and imaginary vocals

exist only in the imagination of the imaginer.
And... ultimately, who gives a fuck anyway...?
so...
so...

excuse me...
so...
Who gives a fuck anyway?
So, he goes back to his ugly little room,
and quietly dreams his last imaginary guitar solo.
