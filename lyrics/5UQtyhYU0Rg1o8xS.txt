She came from outta the sky
A renegade lady, a future queen
She came singing the andromeda blues
Sweet lady, creole queen
She came with those lights in her eyes
Sweet, sexy lady I'm on my knees
She came in with those big, bright eyes
Sweet, sexy lady, shadazz
Sweet, sexy lady, shadazz
Sweet, sexy lady, shadazz
Sweet, sexy lady, just like jazz
Oh, shadazz, oh, shadazz
Oh, shadazz, oh, shadazz

She's there using her father's name
African Messiah, ahead of her time
She shaid I'm a black star singing queen
Flying for them, fighting for all
She's there for all of us to see
