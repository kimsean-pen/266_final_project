If affection spoke louder than words, you'd make me
deaf by now
you make it seem so easy to love me for who I really am

It'd break my heart, if we fell apart.
It'd be so hard to let you go
it d break my heart, if we fell apart.
It'd be so hard to watch you go

So let's not dwell on all those things we should of said
As piece by piece I can pick you up off of my floor
(off my floor)
So let's not dwell on all those things we should of said
As piece by piece I can pick you up off of my floor
(off my floor)

It's so crazy how it'd make my week just to hear
them mention your name
is it so hard to understand how you have my right
in the palm of your hand?

It'd break my heart, if we fell apart.
It'd be so hard to let you go
it d break my heart, if we fell apart.
It'd be so hard to watch you go

So let's not dwell on all those things we should of said
As piece by piece I can pick you up off of my floor
(off my floor)
So let's not dwell on all those things we should of said
As piece by piece I can pick you up off of my floor

You're first and foremost, you're always on my mind
through the songs that I'll sing I'll give you my heart

So let's not dwell on all those things we should of said
As piece by piece I can pick you up off of my floor
So let's not dwell on all those things we should of said
As piece by piece I can pick you up off of my floor
So let's not dwell on all those things we should of said
As piece by piece I can pick you up off of my floor
(off my floor)
So let's not dwell on all those things we should of said
As piece by piece I can pick you up off of my floor
(off my floor)
