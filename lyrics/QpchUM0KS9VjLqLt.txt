When you see an insect
Don't try to squash it
Things more powerful than you
Control the actions in your life

I have a problem
With no easy answer
But you see I'm trying
Very very hard to just let it slide

So I dream
Dream dream dream

Wasted by the daylight
Floating in the twilight

Ask me a question
I'll give you the answer
You want to know I'm saying
Every little thing that's on my mind

I am a body
Stuck in a story
Things more powerful than me
Control the actions in my life
So I dream
Dream dream dream
And I dream
Dream dream dream

Wasted by the daylight
Floating in the twilight
Wasted by the daylight
Floating in the twilight
Dream
Dream
