I wanna live outside, live outside of all of this
I wanna live outside, live outside of all of this

I keep calling, keep hauling, keep hauling them back
I can't stand, can't stand, can't stand this attack
This neuron buzz is on another level
I'm on thin ice, I'm dancing with the devil

Can't sleep with the noise in this house
It can't beat the allure of this now
I can't sleep with the noise in this house
Why won't they pipe me down?

I wanna live outside, live outside of all of this
I wanna live outside, live outside of all of this
I wanna live outside, live outside of all of this
I wanna live outside, live outside of all of this

I keep taming, keep training, keep taming the horse
But it's wild, it's feral, and it's running its course
Patiently, man just waits in line
In the receptionary of my mind

Waiting for the door to be left
Unattended and open for an unwanted guest
And it's so busy I'd be surprised
If I even noticed

I wanna live outside, live outside of all of this
I wanna live outside, live outside of all of this
I wanna live outside, live outside of all of this
I wanna live outside, live outside of all of this

No, they don't even know about us
They don't even know about us
No, they don't even know about us

I'm gonna live outside, live outside of all of this
I'm gonna live outside, live outside of all of this
I'm gonna live outside, live outside of all of this
I'm gonna live outside, live outside of all of this now

I'm gonna live outside, live outside of all of this
I'm gonna live outside, live outside of all of this
I'm gonna live outside, live outside of all of this
I'm gonna live outside, live outside of all of this now
