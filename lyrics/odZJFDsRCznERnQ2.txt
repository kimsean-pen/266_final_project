You're in my arms
And all the world is gone
The music playing on
For only two
So close together
And when I'm with you

So close to feeling alive
A life goes by
Romantic dreams must die
So I bid mine goodbye
And never knew
So close was waiting, waiting here with you

And now forever I know...
All that I want is to hold you so close

So close to reaching that famous happy end
Almost believing this one's not pretend
And now you're beside me, and look how far we've come
So far, we are so close
...
Oh how could I face the faceless days
If I should lose you now?

We're so close to reaching that famous happy end
Almost believing this one's not pretend
Let's go on dreaming, though we know we are
So close, so close, and still so far
