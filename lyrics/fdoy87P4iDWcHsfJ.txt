Feeling the way I do, it's hard to keep focus
One minute staring at the moon, next into your eyes
And it's no surprise that my knees weaken
At the lovely words you're speaking

La la la
It takes more than diamonds to woo me
La la la
It takes more than money to groove me

Feeling the way I do, it's hard to keep focus
One minute staring at the moon, next into your eyes
And it's no surprise that my knees get weaken
From the lovely words you're speaking

La la la
It takes more than diamonds to woo me
La la la
It takes more than money to move me
La la la
It takes more than material things

La la la
It takes more than diamond to move me
La la la
It takes more than money to groove me
La la la
It takes more than cars to get me
Where I need to go, don't stop the flow

La la la

It takes more than diamonds to move me
La la la
It takes more la la la than money, baby
It takes more, takes more than material things
It takes more, it takes more

La la la
It takes more than diamonds to move me
La la la
It takes more than money to woo me
La la la
It takes more than material things
To get me going, baby

La la la
