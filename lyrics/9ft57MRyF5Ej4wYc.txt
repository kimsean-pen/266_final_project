I know I brought it on myself and I shouldn't be mad
'Cause the door hit my ass on the way out
Is anybody else so sick of this routine?
These silly machines we never wanna lay down
Keep it to yourself, everybody knows
And these people came here to have a good time
But everyone's alone, I gotta turn it around
'Cause I'm down to one very last lifeline
I brought it on myself, oh, I brought it on myself

But you, you should know better than anyone
We're lying to ourselves
It's true, it's true that we've gotta find a new one
Here's to our health and the news
The news that this ship is never going down
We brought this on ourselves, oh, we brought this on ourselves

I know I always pull the strings, let the voices sing
But I don't know if it was just the medicine
I had to chase my dreams, but at what cost?
What I lost, I don't think I can get back again
That's the way it is, let's just smoke this
Are we crowned almost beautiful catastrophe?
I just wanna live, give the best that you got
It's not enough, but who's really counting anyway?

But you, you should know better than anyone
We're lying to ourselves
It's true, it's true that we've gotta find a new one
Here's to our health and the news
The news that this ship is never going down
We brought this on ourselves
We brought this on our, we brought this on ourselves
