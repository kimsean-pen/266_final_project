There's no way out of here
When you come in, you're in for good
There was no promise made
The part you've played, the chance you took
There are no boundaries set
The time and yet, you waste it still

So, it slips through your hands
Like grains of sand, you watch it go
There's no time to be lost
You'll pay the cost, so get it right
There's no way out of here
When you come in, you're in for good

And never was there an answer
There an answer
Not without listening
Without seeing

There are no answers here
When you look out, you don't see in
There was no promise made
The part you've played, the chance you took
There's no way out of here
When you come in, you're in for good

And never was there an answer
There an answer
Not without listening
Without seeing

There's no way out of here
When you come in, you're in for good
There are no answers here
When you look out, you don't see in
There was no promise made
The part you've played, the chance you took

(There's no way out of here)
(When you come in, you're in for good)
(There's no way out of here)
(When you come in, you're in for good)
(There are no answers here)
(When you look out, you don't see in)
(There's no way out of here)
(When you come in, you're in for good)

(There's no way out of here)
(When you come in you're in for good)
