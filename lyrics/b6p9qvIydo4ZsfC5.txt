Oh, oh, oh

No matter what you say about love, I keep coming back for more
Keep my hand in the fire, sooner or later
I get what I'm asking for
No matter what you say about life, I learn every time I bleed
That truth is a stranger, my soul is in danger
I gotta let my spirit be free
To admit that I'm wrong, and then change my mind
Sorry, but I have to move on and leave you behind

I can't waste time, so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
Don't need to worry 'bout everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back, got a new direction
I loved you once, needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart, just like a tattoo

Just like a tattoo, I'll always have you
(I'll always have you
I'll always have you)

I'm sick of playing all of these games
It's not about taking sides
When I looked in the mirror, didn't deliver
It hurt enough to think that I could stop
Admit that I'm wrong and then change my mind
Sorry, but I've gotta be strong and leave you behind

I can't waste time, so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
Don't need to worry 'bout everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back, got a new direction
I loved you once, needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart, just like a tattoo

Just like a tattoo, I'll always have you
(I'll always have you)

If I live every moment
Won't change any moment
It's still a part of me and you
I will never regret you
Still the memory of you
Marks everything I do

Oooh

I can't waste time, so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
Don't need to worry 'bout everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back, got a new direction
I loved you once, needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart, just like a tattoo

I can't waste time, so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
Don't need to worry 'bout everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back, got a new direction
I loved you once, and I needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart, just like a tattoo

Just like a tattoo, I'll always have you
