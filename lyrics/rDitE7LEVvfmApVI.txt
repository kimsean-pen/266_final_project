And i'm rushing when i go to sleep
I think too much about the thinks that keep me all straigh out
Lieing in the night with the eyes wide open
And my images is screaming now
Running over and over
Stay away
Stay away
I heard in a song
I knew that it was wrong
On every face
On every paper
Something good in everyone
In the night when you're feeling lost
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Climbing out and stares me
Theres way out of the door
From the man on the street
Make you feel the same
And you never feel complete
By everyone
Stay away
Stay away
