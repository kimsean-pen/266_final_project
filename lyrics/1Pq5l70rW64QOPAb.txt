Don't lie to me
Don't lie to me
Don't lie to me
Don't lie to me

I know where you been
And I know
What you been doin'
Don't lie to me

Don't push me 'round
Don't push me 'round
Don't push me 'round
Don't push me 'round

I don't like that
And now, I'm telling you
Don't push me 'round

Don't cross me babe
Don't cross me babe
Don't cross me babe
Don't cross me babe

Think you won't
Don't do it
For sure, sure
Don't cross me babe
