gimme gimme gimme
i need some more
gimme gimme gimme
don't ask what for

sitting here i'm a loaded gun
waiting to go off
i've got nothing to do
but shoot my mouth off

gimme gimme gimme
i need some more
gimme gimme gimme
don't ask what for

you know i'm gonna go out
get something for my head
if i keep on doing this
i'm gonna end up dead

gimme gimme gimme
i need some more
gimme gimme gimme
don't ask what for
i know the world's got problems
i've got problems of my own
not the kind that can't be solved
with an atom bomb

gimme gimme gimme
i need some more
gimme gimme gimme
don't ask what for
