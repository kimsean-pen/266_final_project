Voracious children and wolves
Sharpen their teeth on our bones
Carrion feeds the wretched
Vacant eyes peer through the hole
Beggars and thieves
Bring down a common enemy
While pawnshop kings and corner queens
All hawk their souls for gold
Lifelong victims pound and claw at the ground
Searching for a way out of their skin
Writhe in the cruel bloom
Trying to find beauty in flesh torn from me
Trying so hard not to lose you
In cobwebs and empty hearts
Lifelong victims pound and claw at the ground
Searching for a way out of their skin
Writhe in the cruel bloom
Witness the ghostlike shades of ourselves
Searching for any way out of our skin
Writhe in the cruel bloom
