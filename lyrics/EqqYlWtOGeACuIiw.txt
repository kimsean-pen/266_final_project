You watched his future turn to powder
As you looked down on the water
Put out a cigarette
Gave it a chance to go see some dance

He was born to die in a suicide casino
Pretty lights
Pretty lights
You see a soft and beautiful thing

Get lost

He was born to die in a suicide casino
Pretty lights
Pretty lights
You see a soft and beautiful thing

Get lost

How long is life emboldened [by the] Devil
He wore his best plaid tie
Time to suffer
Best to eat cook
And a house of flashing tricks

He was born to die in a suicide casino
Pretty lights
Pretty lights
You see a soft and beautiful thing

Get lost

He was born to die in a suicide casino
Pretty lights
Pretty lights
You see a soft and beautiful thing

Get lost
