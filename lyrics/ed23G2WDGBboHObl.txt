Boot on the start line
Pistol in the air
'Quila in the glass
And a cold dead stare
Two minutes in
Baby make your move
And if you won't do it
I'll do it for you

I ain't waiting on you
I ain't waiting for you

I jumped the gun
Oh, here I go again
I'm the one
Don't know when to say when
Here for fun, wasn't lookin' for a friend
Now were kissin' under covers
And it's all just because
I jumped the gun
Whoa

Checkers on the flag
Time to pay the tab
Hoppin' in a cab
It's time to be bad
Cigarette smoke
Lipstick on your face
My place or yours
I'm good either way

Oh, babe my meter's runnin'
So baby, are you comin'

I jumped the gun
Oh, here I go again
I'm the one
Don't know when to say when
Here for fun, wasn't lookin' for a friend
Now were kissin' under covers
And it's all just because
I jumped the gun
Oh, here I go again
I'm the one
Don't know when to say when
Here for fun, wasn't lookin' for a friend
Now were kissin' under covers
And it's all just because
I jumped the gun

Whoa
Whoa

Woke up in the morning
Pounding in my head
3 empty bottles
No sheets on the bed
When he rolled over
And this is what he said
He said, "babe I think I love you"
Whoa...
Man, you jumped the gun

Oh, here I go again
I'm the one
Don't know when to say when
Here for fun, wasn't lookin' for a friend
Now were kissin' under covers
And it's all just because
I jumped the gun
Oh, here I go again
I'm the one
Don't know when to say when
Here for fun, wasn't lookin' for a friend
Now were kissin' under covers
And it's all just because

I couldn't keep it in my pocket
Lit the fuse to the rocket
I'm sinnin' while I'm winnin'
Nights ending but beginnin'
And we'll see the risin' sun
because I jumped the gun

Whoa...

I jumped the gun

Whoa...

Boot on the start line
Pistol in the air
'Quila In the glass
Oh, here I go again.
