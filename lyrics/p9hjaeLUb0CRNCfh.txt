Oh this one’s gonna help you suffer
This one gonna help you bleed
Gonna make you cry for your mother
It’s gonna question your belief

Feel the hair on the back of your neck now
Stand up like a royal guard
This one’s gonna put you in check
Like a witnessed death in your own front yard

Your hollow bones
Your hollow bones
Your hollow bones
Your hollow bones

This one’s gonna steal your toe
This one’s gonna bruise your heel
Pick your teeth up off of the floor
Put them back in your mouth like it’s no big deal

Feel the heart beating in your chest now
Like a drum of a local war
You hear the knock and your legs go weak
To the devil ? side of the door

Your hollow bones
Your hollow bones
Your hollow bones
Your hollow bones

Your hollow bones
Your hollow bones
Your hollow bones
Your haaa….
