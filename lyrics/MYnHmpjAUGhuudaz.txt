Soon you'll not remember anything
But then, someday, neither will I
Tomorrow though is nothing to fear
Because father it's always today

Life won't flash before your eyes
Instead will fall away then melt like snow
The secret storms of your wild youth
Now just gentle breezes, warm and faint

Soon you'll not remember anything
But then, someday, neither will I
Tomorrow though is nothing to fear
Because father it's always today

I can ride on your coattails again
Like I always did as a little boy
We are standing on the home shores now
My whole hand hanging onto your thumb
There's a place in the palace of you
Where we can always be standing like that
And we can hide in there just as we were then
You're just my father and I am just your son

Your son
Your son
Soon
