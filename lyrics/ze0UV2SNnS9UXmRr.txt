Cupid,
Draw back your bow
I am begging your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart
For me, nobody but me

You better, please,
Hear my cry
And then your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart
For me.

I don't want to bother you
But I'm in distress
As danger love is losing
All my happiness
Oh, I love a man
Who doesn't know I exist
And this you can fix, so

Cupid
Draw back your bow
And lay your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart
For me, nobody but me

Cupid
Please hear my cry
I am begging your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart
For me.

Now, if your arrow makes
His love strong for me
I swear I'm gonna love him
Until eternity
I know between the both ofus
His heart we can steal
You can help me if you will

So, cupid
Draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Stragiht to my lover's heart
For me, nobody but me

Cupid, please hear my cry
And then your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart
For me

Yeah yeah yeah cupid
Oh oh cupid
I love him love him
