In midst of such madness I grasped that elusive real
You believe to know those surrounding your visual
So typical of life to slap me, to humiliate
Left irate I rely only on my hidden traits to stay the tide
All is mine to lose in my mind, although I have already lost all
I am appalled by these very friendly sights
I remain polite in proper society
They view me as the sewer

My yesterdays don't matter now, they're gone
Your careless expression left my wrists torn
Yesterdays don't matter now, you're gone
Shattered glass of empty bottles cut my palms

Saturated thoughts of you weigh so heavy
On a mind so weary
Always thought we'd have plenty
Never thought I'd be here now,
Without she who breaths for me
I gasp for that life
Oh, to lay my head 'mongst your curves
Oh, to speak those words

I stare from broken window
Eyes fixed upon your symbol
I suppose all things do pass
Wrist grazing glass,
White light at last gathers at feet caked in earth
My movements submerged by thickness in words
I laid my head 'mongst your curves
I've grown too old for your tones of voice to scold
Attempt evils untold
I'll fold when you laugh again
I'll smile when I'm dead

My yesterdays don't matter now, they're gone
Your careless expression left my wrists torn
Yesterdays don't matter now, you're gone
Shattered glass of empty bottles cut my palms

Does that keep you content?
My blood flows a velvet red
Into that familiar stream of tears
With passion I spit upon that empty face
Were you disgraced when I broke your sacred circle?
I must admit I was afraid this world would hurt you
As you hurt me

Crossed paths to speak but for an instant
Now gone without one trace
What is it about my vocal pattern which leaves me speaking to self?
Ugly blood pours from a warm heartfelt vase
Flowers scattered on a cold stone floor
Connect nevermore
I am torn by my lack of emotions and plentitude of tears
Callous heart hurts none, yet weeps
Am I dead lord?
Am I dead?

My yesterdays don't matter now, they're gone
Your careless expression left my wrists torn
Yesterdays don't matter now, you're gone
Shattered glass of empty bottles cut my palms

What happened to the times we spent dreaming of days to come?
So invincible then,
Before these times I learned to bleed
On my knees I prayed for us
As what we were slipped between my fingers
Those memories still linger

Anger permeates
It's not our idiosyncrasies which leave us ill
I wish to build, yet it seems all I touch dies
Endless drone of sighs to convince this world we exist
Loveless bliss
Content just to be spent at nights end
Fish for your reasons in the sea of ignorance
As if in trance, succumb to an ageless waltz of thought
Why were we brought together only to fall apart?

My yesterdays don't matter now, they're gone
Your careless expression left my wrists torn
Yesterdays don't matter now, you're gone
Shattered glass of empty bottles cut my palms

I gaze upon you one final time
I only gaze to truly know what was once mine
I toast with final swig of liquid life
Lay my head 'mongst familiar curves
And forever close my eyes
