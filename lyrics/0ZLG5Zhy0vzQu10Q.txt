Not everyone gets drunk, without a drop of wine
Or a sip of ninety proof, but I do
Not everybody loves, getting caught at red lights
They got no one to lean on to, but I do

You don't know how many times a minute you cross my mind
And I don't know, what I did so right

Just when I think it couldn't get any better
To be the man standing in my shoes
There you go walking in, in a new dress
Saying, "do you like this?"

Baby I do wanna hold you forever
No I ain't ever been so sure
Just when I think I couldn't love you any more
Baby, I do, I do, I do
Baby, I do, I do, I do

Yeah girl, you're beautiful
Just takes one look to see
But no one sees the side of you
That I do

Like your hair in a mess in the morning
That wake up no makeup smile
That I can't believe I open my eyes too
But I do

Just when I think it couldn't get any better
To be the man standing in my shoes
There you go walking in, in a new dress
Saying, "do you like this?"

And baby I do wanna hold you forever
No I ain't ever been so sure
Just when I think I couldn't love you any more
Baby, I do, I do, I do
Baby, I do, I do, I do

No I don't ever fall like this
I never found myself wanting to jump in so quick
But there's something different 'bout you
'Cause I do, I do

Just when I think it couldn't get any better
To be the man standing in my shoes
I start thinking 'bout you in a white a dress
Front of that church kiss

Saying, "I do wanna hold you forever
No I ain't ever been so sure
Just when I think I couldn't love you any more
Baby, I do, I do, I do
Baby, I do, I do, I do"

Baby, I do wanna hold your forever
I don't ever wanna let you go
And everyday I'm gonna let you know
How much that I do, I do, I do
'Cause baby, I do, I do, I do
