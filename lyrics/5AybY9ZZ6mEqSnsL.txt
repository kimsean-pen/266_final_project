I'm awake again at 3am
My head's so tired but I dont care, no I dont
Outside the sky looks like it's burning down but
I won't fear, no I won't

Falling down like angels fighting
Stars and lightning hold me tightly
Hold me tightly

Close your blinds tonight
They'll soften and disperse the light and
If you're lucky a car might drive by
And the headlights fill your ceiling with shooting stars
Works of art
Waiting for your arms to part
And welcome in my beating heart
Badum, badum, badum, badum

Falling down like angels fighting
Stars and lightning hold me tightly
Falling down like angels fighting
Stars and lightning hold me tightly
Falling down like angels fighting
Stars and lightning hold me tightly
Tightly

Hold me tightly
