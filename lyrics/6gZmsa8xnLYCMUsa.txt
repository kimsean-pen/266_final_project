Dance, dance, dance, dance
Keep on dancin'
Dance, dance, dance, dance

We're just dancin' to the beat, feel the heat
I'm movin' my feet
Headed towards the floor, gonna get down
A get down some more

Rumba and tango
Latin hustle, too
Yowsah, yowsah, yowsah
I wanna boogie with you

Bop bop bop bop bow
Bop bop bop bop bow
Bop bop bop bop bow
Bop bop bop bop bow

Ooh, what a treat, feels so sweet
Ahh, that body heat
When I'm dancin' with my baby, drives me crazy
Makes me hazy

Rumba and tango
Latin hustle, too
Yowsah, yowsah, yowsah
I wanna boogie with you

Bop bop bop bop bow
Bop bop bop bop bow
Bop bop bop bop bow
Bop bop bop bop bow

Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance

Dance, dance, dance, dance
Keep on, keep on
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Keep on dancing

Dance, dance, dance, dance
Keep on, keep on
Dance, dance, dance, dance

Dance, dance
