Try to sleep
you should
try to sleep
you're in every single part of me
i hope that you know

Try to sleep
you should
try to sleep
sister wet his lips
mother bless his trip

i hope that he knows
we'll follow

We are, we are
all here by your side
We are, we are
all here tonight
We are, we are
old here by your side
we are all here
in mourning light

Try to sleep
you should
try to sleep
warm summer wind
blows these white sheet sails
the sundial ship awaits him

Try to leap
you should
try to reach
into highest air
you're almost there
as long as you know
we miss you

We are, we are
all here by your side
We are, we are
all here tonight
We are, we are
old here by your side
we are all here
in mourning light
