Nothing going on. There is nothin' I can do
Nothing going on. There is nothin' I can say
Nothing going on. There is nothin' I can cry
Everybody hurts someday
Wake up!
Nothing going on. There is nothing' going on
Nothing going on. You swore you'd never give up
Nothing going on. Don't be afraid of what you are
The sorrow that you know will melt away
現状をもがき苦しむ だけど答えが出ぬ時
自分を責め続けないで?
Say goodbye say goodbye myself
"Brand new me" is waiting for you every time
涙の分だけ変われるよ It's our secret
Nothing going on. Close your eyes and take a breath
Nothing going on. It was not too long ago
Nothing going on. Every dream was coming true
Walls are closing in on you
Nothing going on. There is nothin' going on
Nothing going on. You swore you'd never give up
Nothing going on. Don't be afraid of what you are
Hold on. In time. You will find the way
現状は理解者ゼロだ
だけどその力はきっとずっと誰かを照らすよ
Say goodbye say goodbye myself
"Brand new me" is waiting for you every time
弱さを隠すのは強さじゃない
Say goodbye say goodbye myself
"Brand new me" is waiting for you every time
涙の分だけ変われるよ It's our secret
Say goodbye say goodbye myself
"Brand new me" is waiting for you every time
弱さを隠すのは強さじゃない
Say goodbye say goodbye myself
"Brand new me" is waiting for you every time
It's our secret
