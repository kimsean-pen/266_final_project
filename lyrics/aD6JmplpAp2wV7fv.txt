Pardon me, I didn't realize what's in your eyes
My arms are open wide, but I can't infer the sight what I wanna do.
I'm staring at the sky but I can't tell which way my thoughts are travelling.
I try to listen to your words but I can't feel my head and it's unraveling.

Sometimes I'm the one to know what it means to carry by the things you want it to
Everybody's living on the tell and I'm still in my bed, I don't have a clue.

I won't lie and tell you it's alright
I won't lie and tell you it's alright.
