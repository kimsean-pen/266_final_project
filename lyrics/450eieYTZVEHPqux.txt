Maybe you got soft
Flew out the door on a breeze
Maybe you got lost
On the way back home
On the way back home to me
Maybe we're just pretending
And maybe I don't mind
So now that it's ending
I don't wanna know
It was all a waste of time
It's the end of the world
It's the last taste of wine
When you were
When you were
When you were mine
You were lost, I was blind
And we swore it was time
When you were
When you were
When you were my waste of time
Waste of time
So I wrote one more story
I just don't know how it ends
'Bout all the boys you're seeing
The ones that you, that you call your friends
This nightmare keeps repeating
We'll never get to the end
Of this fire we're feeding
The hottest love has the coldest end
From the start of it all
To the end of the line
When you were
When you were
When you were mine
You were lost, I was blind
And we swore it was time
When you were
When you were
When you were my waste of time
Waste of time
Waste of time
Waste of time
Waste of time
From the start of it all
To the end of the line
When you were
When you were
When you were mine
You were lost, I was blind
And we swore it was time
When you were
When you were
When you were my waste of time
Waste of time
Waste of time
Waste of time
Waste of
(End of the line, last taste of wine)
Waste of
(When you were, when you were, when you were mine)
Start of it all
End of the line
When you were
When you were
When you were mine
