Forget all laws, all order and peace
Chaos is everything; no time or place
Now when all light and life ends
When the wind now is killing
The chains has broken...

The time has come
As the norns predicted
Nothing lasts forever
The battle at Vigrid shall come
There is no brothers
There is no strong bounds
The bound anger is loose
Inner coldness is free
A river of foam
Has dried up
The power of the wolf, obscure hate
No longer sees a limit

Angrboda beared
Her name justly
With Lauy√≠us son she breeded
Dread, hate and death
A cry of warning in the dark
The mountains roofs, bear tendors
Woman beard, the sound of catsteps
Breath from the fish, spit from the bird
Tamed forces from a forgotten time
Has held our world in chains
But not for ever!

Fenris is loose

Now our wisdom
Is swallowed by ancient hate
The nine steps are fulfilled
A new road is lain
