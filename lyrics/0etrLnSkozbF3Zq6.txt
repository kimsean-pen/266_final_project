You show me love, and then spit in my face
Making your money of all of my pain
You put an eagle inside of a cage
And you think i'm not strong enough to escape
But I refuse to let you make me feel like I can't fly
Not only will I soar again, along the fucking sky
yeah

So I put my middle finger up
I'm done being your slave
My generation's had enough
And you should be afraid
Oh woah oh, not your prisoner
Oh woah oh, better listen when I say
I put my middle finger up
I'm done being your slave

You couldn't even look me in the eye
When you let me go and then left me to die
But there was no question that I would survive
And honest I'm fire is one that's alive

You can't surround a lion with a bunch of lazy sheep
The one thing about royalty is that we love to feast

yeah
So I put my middle finger up
I'm done being your slave
My generation's had enough
And you should be afraid
Oh woah oh, not your prisoner
Oh woah oh, better listen when I say
I put my middle finger up

I'm done being your slave
Living like a riot
Setting off the sirens
Fists are clinched, I'm fighting
Soul has been ignited
Ain't got time for dying
I'm too busy thriving
More than just surviving

Heart is beating violent
Living like a riot
Setting off the sirens
Fists are clinched, I'm fighting
Soul has been ignited
Ain't got time for dying
I'm too busy thriving
More than just surviving
Heart is beating violent
So I put my middle finger up
I'm done being your slave
My generation's had enough
And you should be afraid
Oh woah oh, not your prisoner
Oh woah oh, better listen when I say
I put my middle finger up
I'm done being your slave
