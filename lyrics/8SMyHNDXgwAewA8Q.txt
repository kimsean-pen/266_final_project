Nothing wrong with going off in a daydream
In a daydream
Nothing broken in a hopeless sky
Never wonder, just go under and set free
Can you set free
All the hope that you can't hold inside?

It's safe to say that I'm...

Swimming in a deep devotion
Didn't heed the warning signs
Threw the flares into the ocean
Gave them to the waves this time

New horizon, let us lie in a daydream
In a daydream
On your dark side, there's a holy light
When it's over, pull it closer and set free
Can you set free
All the hope that you can't hold inside?

It fades away and I'm...

Swimming in a deep devotion
Didn't heed the warning signs
Threw the flares into the ocean
Gave them to the waves this time
Swimming in a deep devotion
Didn't heed the warning signs
Threw the flares into the ocean
Gave them to the waves this time

Never wonder, just go under and set free
Can you set free?
Can you set free?
Can you set free, free, free?
It's safe to say that I'm...

Swimming in a deep devotion
Didn't heed the warning signs
Threw the flares into the ocean
Gave them to the waves this time
Swimming in a deep devotion
Didn't heed the warning signs
Threw the flares into the ocean
Gave them to the waves this time
