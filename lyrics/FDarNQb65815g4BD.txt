And when I see the sign that
Points one way
The lot we used to pass by
Every day

Just walk away, Renée
You won't see me follow you back home
The empty sidewalks on my block
Are not the same
You're not to blame

From deep inside the tears that
I'm forced to cry
From deep inside the pain I
I chose to hide

Just walk away, Renée
You won't see me follow you back home
Now, as the rain beats down
Upon my weary eyes
For me it cries

Just walk away, Renée
You won't see me follow you back home
Now, as the rain beats down
Upon my weary eyes
For me it cries

Your name and mine
Inside a heart upon a wall
Still finds a way to haunt me
Though they're so small

Just walk away, Renée
You won't see me follow you back home
The empty sidewalks on my block
Are not the same
You're not to blame
