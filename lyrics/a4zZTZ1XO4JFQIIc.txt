Falling From The Sky
The Castout From Heaven's Light
Drenching The Soil With Blood
Baptized In The Firehole
The Devil's Spawn
No Longer Breathes
Descending Angels And Fallen Kings
Raise Your Hands
What Do You Hold?
The Devil's Bleeding Crown
Call Upon It's Father
Bless The Goat
The Womanizer
Take Him To Astaroth
Inanna's Temple Of Uruk
The Devil's Spawn
No Longer Breathes
Descending Angels And Fallen Kings
Raise Your Hands
What Do You Hold?
The Devil's Bleeding Crown
They Gathered All The Children
Outside The Church
And Never Would They Know
What Went On In There
Close The Door And Hear
All The Angels Scream
Oh Mercy Mercy Mercy
Oh Mercy Please
Down Down Down
Down Below
You Can Hear His Hoof
Digging Through The Ground
Oh Lord Lord Lord
The Horned One Is Back
And He Wants His Crown
The Devil's Spawn
No Longer Breathes
Descending Angels And Fallen Kings
Raise Your Hands
What Do You Hold?
The Devil's Bleeding Crown
