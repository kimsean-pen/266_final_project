Hey little girl on your way to class
Loved by all cause you got that ass
cutest eyes and the greatest smile
for a year for a time for a little while
Somebody told me that you got old
looking for someone thats made of gold
Hey little girl on your way to class
In a year they'll be gone cause you are an ass
no one's gonna love you when you're old
Thats what they told you better stay young baby
No one's gonna care when you are gone
So if you're done you better die young baby
Hey little girl on your way to prom
One little night then your life is gone
All that you had is a fairytale
now you're standing alone wonder why did you fail
Somebody told me that you're ok
Somebody told me you passed away
Life aint coming back for you
no one's gonna love you when you're old
Thats what they told you better stay young baby
No one's gonna care when you are gone
So if you're done you better die young baby
Why don't they ever speak of you now
is it to much to do who gives a shit about you
Why do you remember me now when you're old and you're blue
wont give a shit about you
One little boy on his way to school
No body likes him cause he's not cool
thin little arms and an ugly smile
for a year for a time for a little while
how could you leave him alone
Now when he's gone
no one's gonna love you when you're old
Thats what I'm told you better stay young baby
No one's gonna care when you are gone
So if you're done you better die young baby
I cant love you anymore
I got so much to do wont give a shit about you
So baby now lately You remember me
no one's gonna love you when you're old
Thats what they told you better stay young baby
No one's gonna care when you are gone
So if you're done you better die young baby
Why don't they ever speak of you now
is it to much to do who gives a shit about you
So baby now lately You remember me too
