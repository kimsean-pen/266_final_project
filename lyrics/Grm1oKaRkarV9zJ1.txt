What is it on your mind, eyes close shut, with words?
What is it on your mind, ears tight shut, overwhelming
The proof that you want to cry
Afriad of the present; loaded with the past,
and you suffer from thirst
Afraid of the future, losing "the present"
and you lose and you suffer from thirst
Think of THERE ONE THAT RULES and superimpose the image remaining
What is it on your mind, with your eyes swollen up?
You know how to make a choice?
The world keeps dying, THE ONE keeps dying
If there is THE ONE, therefore I am
Reverse the meaning, question myself
All these meanings superimposed are covering up
and question my-self
See what is ahead after making a choice?
Get over the meaning, grab
Turning over, grab
Get over the meaning, brag
And question my-self
Agonizing noises are now put in a line
This bunch of strings are now roaring, dazzling
Blurred sights are now gone
I am here, and everywhere else
Blurred sights are now gone
I am there, and everywhere else.
