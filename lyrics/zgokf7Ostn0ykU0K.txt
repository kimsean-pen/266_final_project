Looking at me wide eyed, bouncing out the door
Goosebumps on your skin, while swimming at Clovelly
Looking straight ahead, sitting by me in the car
Been wondering what you're thinking, let's not go too far
Your hair stands up when I kiss the back of your neck
Been driving 'cross the country just to see

Those wide eyes, wide eyes
Wide eyes, those wide eyes
Wide eyes, those wide eyes
Those wide eyes, those wide eyes

When I hit South Dowling St, I know where I am
I have a fortunate life, gonna see what I can
One in every port, you know that's not who I am
You'll never see your kitchen floor the same way again

With those wide eyes, wide eyes
Those wide eyes, those wide eyes
Those wide eyes, wide eyes
Those wide eyes

When I hit South Dowling St, I know where I am
I have a fortunate life, gonna see what I can
One in every port, you know that's not who I am
You'll never see your kitchen floor the same way again

With those wide eyes, wide eyes
Wide eyes, wide eyes
Those wide eyes, wide eyes
Those wide eyes
