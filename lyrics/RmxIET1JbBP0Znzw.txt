She appeared in the distance, like a prayer I had uttered once
She appeared in my life, like a dream, only half-remembered
She entered my heart, stayed a while
She entered my heart, stayed a while, made me the smile then gone

Gone from my life, yeah
I heard her love was like a burning flame of desire, desire

Baby, just set my body free
Make me free to love
Make me free to know how it feels to be loved

How it feels to be loved in return

There's some things you just gotta learn on your own, yeah

Yeah, you gotta feel love?
I awoke from a nightmare, you're the only survivor to have felt love
Planets spinning madly and I'm the only one to see it
Fall through time, time do heal all wounds but mine
No-one but myself to love, no-one but myself to love

But then, I awoke to your touch
You said
Baby, everything's going to be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
