They didn't know where they was going, but they knew where they was wasn't it

We are everyday robots on our phones
In the process of getting home
Looking like standing stones
Out there on our own
We're everyday robots in control
Or in the process of being sold
Driving in adjacent cars
'Til you press restart

They didn't know where they was going, but they knew where they was wasn't it

Everyday robots just touch thumbs
Swimmin' in lingo they become
Stricken in a status sea
One more vacancy
For everyday robots getting old
When our lips are cold
Lookin' like standing stones
Out there on our own
Little robots in ringback tones
In the process of getting home
