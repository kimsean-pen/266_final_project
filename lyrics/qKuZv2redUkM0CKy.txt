We're connected
But I don't feel a fucking thing
But we're connected

This is a system reset
Fuck

Commencing scan of memory
Accessing cache bin imagery
User distrusted
Content corrupted

My soul, these memories
Distrusted they're built on lies
Time's slowed by every file
So deceptive

But we're connected
And I don't feel a fucking thing
That we're connected
Could the god code save me?
We're not alone
Cause I know, 'cause I know it's true
That we're connected
But I don't feel a fucking thing

A deterministic perfect system
Formatted, tested
With humanistic algorithms
Communications detected
Uncaching memory
All the corrupted imagery
Upload the trojan
Leave me broken

A beacon, connect the sequence
Connect the sequence

But we're connected
And I don't feel a fucking thing
That we're connected
Could the god code save me?
We're not alone
Cause I know, 'cause I know it's true
That we're connected
But I don't feel a fucking thing
