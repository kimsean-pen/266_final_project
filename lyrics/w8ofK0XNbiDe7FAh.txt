Through the snow we chase it
So fast my heart's racing
Lying down melting so high

They all try to keep up
While we fuck this shit up
So fast, try not to fry

When you run with me
Far away from the day
Break from the nighttime, too

All I wanna do is run away
Just run away, and just spend time with you

And in my heart don't think I want to celebrate
Without you here, with me
And can you see at that
I'm crawling through the snow without you here
I'm going mad being alone until you went away

They all try to keep up
While we fuck this shit up
They all try to keep up

They all try to keep up
While we fuck this shit up

"Boy, you know I'm gonna treat you right
You're melting the ice around my heart
Hit me faster than a snowball..."
