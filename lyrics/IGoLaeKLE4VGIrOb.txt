Where do I go?

Never had a very real dream before
Now I got a vision of an open door
Guiding me home, where I belong
Dreamland I have come
Never had a flesh and blood like this before
Got a new appearance when I passed the door
Is it a dream I am withing?
Oh what's going on?

Down, down, down
Go down, go down, go down
I roam into nowhere
Don't see an end
Eternal wastelands
And I hear the voice
The voice, the voice, the voice

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

Never been a fighter, never been a man
But I must help Vandroiy, he's my only friend
Nowhere to go and I know that he knows how
We will get her out

Magic of transcendence brought me to this place
A Vandroiy in reality lead me on my race
Told me to bring back the seal
But still I don't know where I shall go

Can't you feel the voice?
You don't have a choice
What a kind of life
Freedom in flesh shackles on your mind

Go all the way to the tower!
Find out the secrets behind!
Go all the way to the tower!
For all the wisdom of ages doesn't die

Men have good intentions on their way to the light
But some of them are venal and end up in the night
Maybe it's better for you
Mankind not to know what's going on

Sometimes we must go
Ways that seem to be wrong
What a kind of life
Freedom in flesh shackles on your mind

Go all the way to the tower!
Find out the secrets behind!
Go all the way to the tower!
Find out the name of the one
Who reigns from inside

You have come the long way through ages
To bring me the seven parts of the seal
So now throw it over the walls of the tower
Throw the seal!

But first Godfather
What about the prophecy?
What about your reward
The ultimate illumination
The gnosis and the power to defend
Your kingdom on earth with a strong hand?
What about the prophecy?

I realize

For the glory, for the glory, for the glory, for the glory
Oh, what is going on?
For the glory, for the glory, for the glory, I realize
What is going on?

For the glory, for the glory, for the glory, for the glory
Oh, what is going on?
For the glory, for the glory, for the glory, for the glory
Oh, what is going on?

Gabriel I can feel
You have it back, book and seal
Still no war is won, we have just begun

Go all the way to the tower!
Long for the secrets behind!
Go all the way to the tower!
Found out the name of the one
Who reigns from inside

Go all the way to the tower!
Long for the secrets behind!
Go all the way to the tower!
Found out the name of the one
Of the one

Oh, how could the stranger steal the seal away?
Was it my fault? Or was it no one's fault at all?
