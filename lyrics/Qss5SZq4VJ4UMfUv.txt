With this body, he is God and I am nothing

He has come for the blood of my only son
I can sense his heartbeat slowly fade
The sound of my voice is his way to me
I buried my tongue with my family's bones

As I lay me down to sleep
I pray to the Lord to put me six feet deep
Put me six feet deep

Father forgive me for I have sinned
I know that we will all meet our fate
Even the beast of the underworld
Burns eternally within his own flame

Sleep my son
Feel my embrace
Please don't forget my love
As the bullet goes through his brain
I wake up to live it again and again

As I lay me down to sleep
I pray to the Lord to put me six feet deep
Put me six feet deep
Pray to the Lord to put me six feet deep
