Where the cars go by
All the day and night
Why don't you say
What's so wrong tonight
Pray for me
Praying for the light
Baby, Baby, let's go out tonight

Where the lights all shine
Like I knew they would
Be mine all mine
Baby I'll be good
Pray for me
Praying for the light
Baby, Baby, let's go out tonight

I know a place
Where everything's alright, alright
Let's go out tonight

Where the cars go by
All the day and night
Why don't you say
What's so wrong tonight
I pray for love
Coming out alright, yeah
Baby, Baby, let's go out tonight, yeah
Baby, Baby, Baby, let's go out tonight

Tonight, tonight, yeah, tonight
