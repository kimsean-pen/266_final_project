Come break some hearts now, tear them out
Filing for amusements with the crowd
Oh, but be advised, participation is required
Doing things not typically allowed

Feels like we're having a good time
It's true, a wonderfully good time

When I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you

Defend your factions, cut the lines
Leagues of social climbers are abound
Oh, but be advised, no restitution comes tonight
Lest we lay unconscious in the ground

Feels like we're having a good time
It's true, a wonderfully good time

When I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
Hey!

But if the lights don't stop me
No one's got control of what I do
'Cause it's a good time

When I'm with you
When I'm with you, oh!
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
