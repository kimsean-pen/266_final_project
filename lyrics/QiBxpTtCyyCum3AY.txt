He Calls to me
and im the Seas awakening
Go silently
Like the clouds escaping

I long for the Rain to keep falling
let it wash all my tears to the ground
and wake in the arms of the dawning
when He returns to me

He calls to me
along the fields - remembering
go silently
with your wings, im ascending

I Long for the rain to keep on falling
let it wash all my tears to the ground
and wake in the arms of the dawning
when he returns to me
