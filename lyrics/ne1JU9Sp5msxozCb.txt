I got ambition
I did the rounds
You got invested
now you're taking me out
I'm nothing to you
That's what you like
I'm just a battery to keep you energized

But if you see me coming
Pretend that I'm the only one
I like your lies
If you see me coming
You better show me you're in love
I like your lies

There's a hollow inside you
And it won't disappear
Oh no, baby, the way we work we've got about a year
There's a hollow inside you
But don't worry I'm here
I don't care that you're looking for the next girl of the year
Girl of the year

Somebody younger
with longer hair
When you want someone
clap your hands and she's there
No expectations and no regrets
I knew what I was in for soon as we met

But if you see me coming
Pretend that I'm the only one
I like your lies
If you see me coming
You better show me you're in love
I like your lies

There's a hollow inside you
And it won't disappear
Oh no, baby, the way we work we've got about a year
There's a hollow inside you
But don't worry I'm here
I don't care that you're looking for the next girl of the year
Girl of the year
I'm here
I'm here
Girl of the year

Somebody gonna take my place
Somebody gonna take first place
You gotta keep your system going, going
Somebody gonna take my place
Somebody gonna take first place
You gotta keep your system going, going

There's a hollow inside you
And it won't disappear
Oh no, baby, the way we work we've got about a year
There's a hollow inside you
But don't worry I'm here
I don't care that you're looking for the next girl of the year
Girl of the year

If you see me coming
Pretend that I'm the only one
I like your lies
(Girl of the year)
If you see me coming
You better show me you're in love
I like your lies
(Girl of the year)
If you see me coming
Pretend that I'm the only one
I like your lies
(I'm here, girl of the year)
If you see me coming
You better show me you're in love
I like your lies
(I'm here, girl of the year)

I'm here
I'm here, girl of the year
I'm here
Girl of the year
I'm here
I'm here, girl of the year
I'm here
I'm here
