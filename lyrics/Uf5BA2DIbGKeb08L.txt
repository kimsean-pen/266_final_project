Hey what's your story
Hate to see ya lookin' worried
You know you can tell me
Cause I am understanding
Would you mind sharing
What's bothering your happiness
Turn that frown upside down
What's with all this madness

Is it somethin' (somethin), somethin' I should know?
(Somethin' I should know)
Is it somethin' (somethin), somethin' I should know?
(Somethin' I should know)
Cause I feel like (feel like) you should have some hope
(You should have some hope)
Then I feel like (feel like) you should have some hope
(You should have some hope)
Yeah, well

If things don't go your way
Use my shoulder to lean on
If things don't go your way
Use my pillow to lay on
If things don't go your way
Use my shoulder to cry on
That's what friends are for

I know it's a struggle
You gotta flex your muscle
Don't be scared to hustle
There's no reason to wrestle
Take your time
Clear your mind
You know I am here for you
Don't be scared
Pour out your heart
I'll be there wherever you want

Is it somethin' (somethin), somethin' I should know?
(Somethin' I should know)
Is it somethin' (somethin), somethin' I should know?
(Somethin' I should know)
Cause I feel like (feel like) you should have some hope
(You should have some hope)
Then I feel like (feel like) you should have some hope
(You should have some hope)
Yeah, well

If things don't go your way
Use my shoulder to lean on
If things don't go your way
Use my pillow to lay on
If things don't go your way
Use my shoulder to cry on
That's what friends are for

You can tell me (You can always tell me)
I'll help you when you help me
(Help you when you help me)
Oh baby I'll listen to you
Everything you're going through
I swear I will (I swear I will)
I swear I will
You can tell me (Tell me baby)
And you know you can trust me (Trust me)
Baby I'll listen to you
Everything you're going through
You know I will
You know I will

If things don't go your way
Use my shoulder to lean on (lean on me)
If things don't go your way
Use my pillow to lay on (lay on me babe)
If things don't go your way
Use my shoulder to cry on (you know, you know)
That's what friends are for

If things don't go your way
Use my shoulder to lean on
If things don't go your way
Use my pillow to lay on
If things don't go your way
Use my shoulder to cry on (I'm here)
