Silly me, look what I did again
I found what I want
Is what I cannot have
I didn't mean to be
so predictable
I blame it all on who made you irresistible

It isn't something I need
'Til you tell me I can't
Why wear my heart on my sleeve

It looks so good in your hand
My heart breaks in a heart beat
Warn me when you come and go
The taste of something so sweet
Shoulda warned me
'Bout the undertow

Oh, I couldn't find a better man to let me go
Little girl, I don't know why you stay
If I had a feather for every time daddy said that I could fly away
Old habits are so hard to break

It'd be a shame to stop now that I've started to make really good mistakes
And I don't know why I must ask
For the forbidden fruit
I saw the snake in the grass

But I had bitten too soon
My heart breaks in a heart beat
And you stole me when you come and go
Taste of something so sweet
Shoulda warned me
'bout the undertow

Oh, I couldn't find a better man to let me go

I should have seen you coming in
Should recognize the signs a wave's gonna break
Now, I've given in, why fight it when
I'm resigned to simply live in your wake

your wake
Heart breaks in a heart beat
You storm me when you come and go
The taste of something so sweet should have
Warned me 'bout the undertow
Oh, I couldn't find a better man to let me go
No no couldn't find a better man to let me go
I couldn't find a better man to let me go
