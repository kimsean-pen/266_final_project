Elsa was an acrobat
That went and fell in love with that
Horatio, the human cannonball

A wedding beneath the big top tent
With barkers, clowns, and elephants,
Sideshow and the oddities and all

The dogface boy
Howled out with joy
As the tattooed lady was cryin'

Ever since the beginning
To keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds

Thomas was a congressman
Whose closet's full of skeletons
And dresses that he wore on Friday nights

Phyllis was a pharmacist
A dap of that a pinch of this
Concocted to suppress her appetite
When the children were fiddlin'
She'd slip them some Ridlin
And wait for Thomasina to arrive

Cuz ever since the beginning
To keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds
All kinds of kinds

When I play this old guitar
At children's shows to smoky bars
I take a break and think about the past

When I stood up in geometry
And everybody stared at me
And I tossed my test into the trash

I scratched off my number
While hitching out under
That Bushly population sign

Ever since the beginning
To keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds

But at some point the finger
Let ignorance linger
And if they'd look in a mirror they'd find

That ever since the beginning
To keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds
All kinds of kinds
All kinds of kinds

Yeah yeah
Oh yeah
