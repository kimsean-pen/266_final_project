Silence in the yard
Doberman's asleep
You never have to lay your head down here
Watch them disappear
The truth is...
they never had no future
They never had no past
I was alone (alone alone)
I was alone again

This beatup London sky
Whiskey's almost dry
I smile 'cause I've already escaped
Just like to see how far I can take it

They never had no future
They never had no past
I was alone (alone alone)
I was alone again

They never had no future
They never had no past
I was alone (alone alone)
I was along again (That's how I like it)

(Musical interlude for 2: 53 with some muttering of the chorus)

Silence in the yard
Doberman's asleep
You never have to lay your head down here
Watch them disappear
