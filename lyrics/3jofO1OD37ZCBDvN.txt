there i was standing
standing by myself
a room full of strangers
my heart feeling hell

i didnt see you coming
but you came right on time
you couldnt lost
belong me
not a word was said
next day i was having
breakfast in your bed
the smell of your body
sweet peaches and whipped cream

very kinky
baby you made me natural
supernatural (supernatural)
supernatural
love
supernatural (supernatural)
supernatural
love

since the winter past
spring, summer, fall
you are my one desire
you are my all and all
i feel love inside me
this must be a dream

very kinky
baby you made me natural

here it comes
the power of love
wild as the wind
hotter than july
deeper than the night
