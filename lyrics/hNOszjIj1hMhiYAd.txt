I say we start again, far from this cold apartment
Find what it is to be alive
Anarchy is a friend
I've grown to become close with
We'll set fire to all we leave behind

So grab your sweater and my keys
Take my hand and breathe in deep
We've got a long way to ride

Don't look down, all the bridges are crumbling
The car's out of gas, so run fast
Feet on the ground in this city that's burning.
We'll find our way out
Chaos in motion
Chaos in motion
Chaos in motion
Chaos in motion

Emptied the bank accounts
Felt good to finally cash out
Told my old boss to fuck himself
Let's push that car in the ocean,
Fall back and take in the moment
This life is meant for no one else

So grab your sweater and my keys
Take my hand and breathe in deep
We've got a long way to ride
Leave your make up and your phone
Watch them all go up in smoke and let it burn through the night

Don't look down, all the bridges are crumbling
The car's out of gas, so run fast.
Feet on the ground in this city that's burning
We'll find our way out...
Chaos in motion
Chaos in motion
Chaos in motion
Chaos in motion

Follow the sound of my voice as it guides you
I won't let them find you, no way
I look around
My world is nothing without you
I won't let you down
