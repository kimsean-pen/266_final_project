Oh, this is the end of everything that I've known
Oh, this is the end of everything that I've known
So come on

White boy on the beat rocking Gucci sneaks
All I do is win, Charlie Sheen
Started out in '06 and revived the scene
So many motherfuckers wanna be like me
Came from the lowest of lows, rose to the top with a vision
My haters talking shit while washing dishes for a living
Fuck you, bitches, I'm a business, I'll be kissing on your missus
What you spend in 15 months is what I spend in 15 minutes

Oh don't give a fuck about you
You're feeling froggy, motherfucker? Ain't a damn thing you can do
You're a bitch, you're a punk, don't make me pull the pump
Cock it back and leave you slumped, now that's what I call bad luck

Oh, this is the end of everything that I've known
No way of knowing if I'll ever be home
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone
Oh, and if I try to make it out of this town
No way of knowing if I'll ever be found
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone

I got a lot of people talking nothing but chatter
"Why'd you switch your style up?" and that I don't matter
Man, I've been in rap since I was shitting in pampers
Climbed the ladder to the top, and now I'm shitting on rappers
All I do is work, straight up hustle and grind
So many people mad at me for crossing the line
I find it kinda funny, the shit you say in your tweets
But when we're face-to-face, you ain't got nothing to say to me

Oh, so fuck you too
You better take a step back before I call up the crew
You talk a lot of shit, but you spread nothing but lies
You keep on running your mouth, you better open your eyes

Oh, this is the end of everything that I've known
No way of knowing if I'll ever be home
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone
Oh, and if I try to make it out of this town
No way of knowing if I'll ever be found
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone

I'm on that wreck, fly like a jet
Switching my lanes like I'm racing a vet
I'm on that next, girl loves sex
No doubt I'm on top of the world, break your neck
So break your motherfucking neck
I'm on that wreck, fly like a jet
Switching my lanes like I'm racing a vet
I'm on that next, girl loves sex
No doubt I'm on top of the world, break your neck
I'm on that next, girl loves sex
No doubt I'm on top of the world, so break your motherfucking neck

Oh, this is the end of everything that I've known
No way of knowing if I'll ever be home
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone
Oh, and if I try to make it out of this town
No way of knowing if I'll ever be found
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone
Oh, this is the end of everything that I've known
No way of knowing if I'll ever be home
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone
Oh, and if I try to make it out of this town
No way of knowing if I'll ever be found
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone

Yo, it's 2013 motherfucker, Falling in Reverse
