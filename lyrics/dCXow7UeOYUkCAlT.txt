Easier to let go
Give in to yourself tonight
Get on with the show
Expect me not to be so pure
Give me one for the road
Got a fever for sure

Yeh, yeh, yeh
I'm on a mission
Yeh, yeh, yeh
If you're with me raise your hands
Yeh, yeh, yeh
Got no inhibitions
It's our decision
We're gonna have a good time

Yeh, yeh, yeh
Got a new religion
Yeh, yeh, yeh
Gotta take me as I am
Yeh, yeh, yeh
I've got expectations
Of gratification
We're gonna have a good time

So when this thing is through
If you wanna be with me
I'll be looking for you
Feel the energy tonight
Feelin' the groove
I feel it spinnin' the room, yeh

Yeh, yeh, yeh
I'm on a mission
Yeh, yeh, yeh
If you're with me raise your hands
Yeh, yeh, yeh
Got no inhibitions
It's our decision
We're gonna have a good time

Got a new religion
Yeh, yeh, yeh
Gotta take me as I am
Yeh, yeh, yeh

'N baby I don't wanna come down
And all I want is to be excited
So come on, get united
No more need to hide it
