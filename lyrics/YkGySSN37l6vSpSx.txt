isn't it a pity
you don't know what i'm talking about yet
but i will tell you soon
it's a pity

isn't it a pity
isn't it a shame
yes, how we break each other's hearts
and cause each other pain

how we take each other's love
without thinking anymore
forgetting to give back
forgetting to remember
just forgetting and no thank you
isn't it a pity

some things take so long
but how do i explain
why not too many people can see
that we are all just the same
we're all guilty

because of all the tears
our eyes just can't hope to see
but i don't think it's applicable to me
the beauty that surrounds them
child, isn't it a pity

how we break each other's hearts
and cause each other pain
how we take each other's love
the most precious thing
without thinking anymore

forgetting to give back
forgetting to keep open our door
isn't it a pity
isn't it a pity

some things take so long
but how do i explain
isn't it a pity
why not too many people
can see we're all the same

because we cry so much
our eyes can't, can't hope to see
that's not quite true
the beauty that surrounds them
maybe that's why we cry
God, isn't it a pity

Lord knows it's a pity
mankind has been so programmed
that they don't care about nothin'
that has to do with care
c-a-r-e

how we take each other's love
the most precious thing
without thinking anymore
forgetting to give back
forgetting to keep open the door

but i understand some things take so long
but how do i explain
why not too many people
can see we're just the same

and because of all their tears
their eyes can't hope to see
the beauty that surrounds them
God, isn't it a pity
the beauty that surrounds them
it's a pity

we take each other's love
just take it for granted
without thinking anymore
we give each other pain
and we shut every door

we take each other's minds
and we're capable of take each other's souls
we do it every day
just to reach some financial goal
Lord, isn't it a pity, my God
isn't it a pity, my God
and so unnecessary

just a little time, a little care
a little note written in the air
just the little thank you
we just forget to give back
cause we're moving too fast
moving too fast
forgetting to give back

but some things take so long
and i cannot explain
the beauty that surrounds us
and we don't see it
we think things are just the same
we've been programmed that way

isn't it a pity
if you want to feel sorry
isn't it a pity
isn't it a pity
the beauty sets the beauty that surrounds us
because of all our tears
our eyes can't hope to see

maybe one day at least i'll see me
and just concentrate on givin', givin', givin', givin'
and till that day
mankind don't stand a chance
don't know nothin' about romance
everything is plastic
isn't it a pity
my God.
