Somewhere in between the end and the beginning
I found a way to finally
Pick up the pieces of the mess I used to be
And sail away to nowhere

'Cause all this time, I've walked the line
But deep inside I was waiting for a sign

I lost my way but I found myself
Hear the sound of open lands
I guess I belong somewhere else
Than where the ground cracks where I stand

I spent too many nights looking back on my life
And faking smiles to everyone
I used to be the one wandering with lowered eyes
And trying hard to clear his mind.

'Cause all this time, I've walked the line
But deep inside I was waiting for a sign

I lost my way but I found myself
Hear the sound of open lands
I guess I belong somewhere else
Than where the ground cracks where I stand
Got lost and found myself doing much better
Went far from this town and I'm running ever further
Got lost and found myself doing much better
Went far from this town and I'm running ever further
