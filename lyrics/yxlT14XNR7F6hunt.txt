Am I part of a spreading fire?
Or am I going nowhere?
Will I bleed before I breathe?
Two hands to construct an anthem
And have it build a home
You need to assume control

Arcaedion, I see what you've become
If fate is sold then don't go giving up
Arcaedion, I've been searching all my life
But I couldn't find the robot's eyes

Dream of Novas
Far but listening
Hoping we collide

I fear for the story in which we're calling "Apocalyptic Ending"
Will the light make you afraid?
Two hands to rebuild a nation
And help this world to grow
When I assume control

Arcaedion, I see what you've become
If fate is sold then don't go giving up
Arcaedion, I've been searching all my life
But I couldn't find the robot's eyes

Arcaedion, I'll save you from your home again
Arcaedion, now I finally will confide that I wouldn't mind a robot's eyes
