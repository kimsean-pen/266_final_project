I picked a good day for a recreational percocet
I've got an itch to just get high
I'm in the middle of the worst of it
These are the best years of my life

I've got the hankering for intellectual emptiness
I've got the need to ease my mind
I'll watch some re-runs on the TV set
These are the best years of my life

I was looking forward to
Staying here forever
'Cause you asked me to
Didn't think that I could do better
So I settled down
In this ten-cent town
It's about to break me

I'm gonna mix a drink and try to drown this worthlessness
Call Mom and tell her I'm alright
Well he don't love me but he ain't gone yet
These are the best years of my life

Yeah I was looking forward to
Staying here forever
'Cause you asked me to
Didn't think that I could do better
So I settled down
In this ten-cent town
It's about to break me

I picked a good day for a recreational percocet
I've got an itch to just get high
I'm in the middle of the worst of it
These are the best years of my life
These are the best years of my life
These are the best years of my life
