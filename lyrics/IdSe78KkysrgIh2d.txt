Well I woke up
To an empty bed
And I swear I've got a freight train
Poundin' in my head
Down the bottle
And them cigarettes
Between you, him, and the Devil
I'm gonna end up dead

(Goin' down, down, down)

Well, I get high and end up fallin'
I get turn up drunk and always end up crawlin'
Baby, why ain't you callin'
All this smoke and whiskey I've been drownin' in
Tryin' to get me through
Is gonna pull me under
or get me over you

Well, all my friends
Said that it ain't right
They said, "Pull yourself together
And come on out tonight."
Twist my arm
Shit boys, I'm me
I told myself I wouldn't get down
But here I go again

Well, I get high and end up fallin'
I get turn up drunk and always end up crawlin'
Baby, why ain't you callin'
All this smoke and whiskey I've been drownin' in
Tryin' to get me through
Is gonna pull me under
or get me over you

All of the smoke
Bring me the whiskey
After all night
You're gonna miss me
All of the smoke
Bring me the whiskey
After all night
You're gonna miss me

All this smoke and whiskey I've been drownin' in, drownin' in
All this smoke and whiskey I've been drownin' in, drownin' in
All this smoke and whiskey I've been drownin' in
Tryin' to get me through
Is gonna pull me under
or get me over you

'Cause I get high and end up fallin'
I get turn up drunk and always end up crawlin'
Baby, why ain't you been callin'
All this smoke and whiskey I've been drownin' in
Tryin' to get me through
Is gonna pull me under
or get me over you

(To get me over you)
(To get me over you)
