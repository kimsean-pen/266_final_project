I knew the moment I walked through that door
I felt so close to a burning sensation
It got so warm as I moved across the floor
My body achin' with anticipation
I saw a dark silhouette at the table
I tried to talk, but I was unable
She drew me in right under her spell
I was hypnotized by the sudden temptation

Of that woman in black, she's a mystery
She's everything a woman should be
Woman in black, she's got a hold on me
She's in control, she won't set me free

She is a woman, she's not a girl anymore
The kind that stirs up a young man's imagination
She's dressed to kill and I'm so ready to fall
Into her world full of strange fascination
I see that dark silhouette at the table
I can't resist, my body's not able
She draws me in, but she teaches me well
I never need any explanation

From that woman in black, she's a mystery
She's everything a woman should be
I said woman in black got a hold on me
She's in control, she won't set me free
Oooh, woman in black
It's too late now, I can't turn back
Yeah that woman, woman in black
Oooh woman in black

Oooh, that woman in black she's a mystery
She's everything a woman should be
That woman in black, she got a hold on me
She's in control, she won't set me free

(She is my mysterious mistress,
my woman black
she leaves me so helpless,
my woman in black
my dark senorita,
my woman in black
no sunday school teacher,
my woman in black
we say we keep in a secret, we meet in the night
we are partners in silence, strangers in daylight...)
