I can be an engine buzzing like a bee,
I'm a real independent
Doing the laundry
and planning for the future
It's the nature of a renaissance girl
I can be your darling
cooking you dinner
and soothing your heartache
Having three kids and still remain a virgin
It's my version of a renaissance girl

Lift me, lift me up
where the air is thin
and my mind will take off
Pull me, pull me down
where my love is pure
and my feet are on ground

Come along, come, come along,
we can be your renaissance girls
Come along, come, come along,
move forward, move forward
Come along, come, come along,
tough like rocks and sweet like pearls
Come along, come, come along,
we can be your renaissance girls
girls

I can be an artist sculpting your face
like you always wanted
Making you believe it's just how I saw i
It's logic for a renaissance girl
I can be impressed by all the things
you know, I'm fan, I'm obsessed now
Knitting you a sweater
while I drive in your fast car
It's mastered by a renaissance girl

I'll release my money
you can be my back bone
I call you honey
you can cry on my shoulder
Let it all breath,
I got a degree in psychology

Lift me, lift me up
where the air is thin
and my mind will take off
Pull me, pull me down
where my love is pure
and my feet are on ground

Come along, come, come along,
we can be your renaissance girls
Come along, come, come along,
move forward, move forward
Come along, come, come along,
tough like rocks and sweet like pearls
Come along, come, come along
we can be your renaissance girls
girls

Lift me, lift me up
where the air is thin
Pull me, pull me down
where my love is pure
and my feet are on ground

Come along, come, come along,
we can be your renaissance girls
Come along, come, come along,
move forward, move forward
Come along, come, come along,
tough like rocks and sweet like pearls
Come along, come, come along
we can be your renaissance girls

Come along, come, come along,
we can be your renaissance girls
Come along, come, come along,
move forward, move forward
Come along, come, come along,
tough like rocks and sweet like pearls
Come along, come, come along
we can be your renaissance girls
