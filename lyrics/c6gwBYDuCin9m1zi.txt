Hold the gun
Way deep down
Look out young son
Look out young son

Good thing's coming
'Cause the good thing's coming
Shotguns with no guns
Shot army with no army at all

I don't know what is worse
And I can't tell what is the best
People emphasize the weight of the world
Demons despise the sound of shaking paper

Guess what I found out
You too

Hold the gun
Way deep down
Look out young son
Look out young son

'Cause the good thing's coming
'Cause the good thing's coming
Shotguns with no guns
Shot army with no army at all

I don't know what is worse
And I can't tell what is the best
People emphasize the weight of the world
Demons despise the sound of shaking paper

Guess what I found out
You too

'Cause the good thing's coming
'Cause the good thing's coming
'Cause the good thing's coming
'Cause the good thing's coming
