We're stepping stones
For privileged men that use your back to climb
Youth in revolt
Through telephones so keep it short and kind
A game of chess
Use race instead
They force us from inside
Strategize
A happy life
But only seeing
Black and white
Justify my actions
Rectify this war

They've torn us apart
Everyone and everything's losing the art
Of passion and heart
Where is your passion and heart?

What gives you the right
To decide my path in life?
Strip my will to carry on and fight
(With my will to fight)
A jealous man of sorts
Who plays his pawns for sport
The weakest kings will build a wall to hide

The highest powers want you to believe that the biggest difference between the human species is class or race. However, our only defining traits are passion and resistance

They've torn us apart
Everyone and everything's losing the art
Of passion and heart
Where is your passion and heart?

Like pieces to a puzzle
Your place is valued here
Speak your mind and show your worth
To make the image clear
We have passion
And heart
Yeah, we have passion and heart

They can silence my voice
Grip my throat and let my actions speak
I won't give in
Resist! Resist!
Resist until the very end

Where is your passion?
Where is your heart?
(Where is your passion?)
(Where is your heart?)
They've torn us apart
Where is your heart?
(Everyone and everything is losing the art)
Where is your passion?
(Of passion and heart)
Where is your heart?
(Where is your passion and heart)

Like pieces to a puzzle
The voices that you hear
Speak your mind and show your worth to make the image clear
We have passion and heart
Yeah, we have passion and heart

Where is your passion?
Where is your passion and heart?
