Here we come
Driving down
Deep and wide
Settle down
On the beach
Get the sun
Coming down
Wet and warm

Turn it down
Settle down
On the beach
Get the sun
On down
Jealous day
You can lounge
Turn it down

I wanna waste it playing
Spend all our day in a dream
Crystalline green, watch it rolling
Feeling the weight of the sun

Here we come
Driving down
Deep and wide
Blue and green
Breathing in
Come alive
Here we come
All the stars

Letting it slip through my fingers
Little rings float on your eyes
Try to forget who you are now
Stare into space, watch the sky
