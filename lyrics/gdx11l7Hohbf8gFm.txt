I once imagined a place
Where I would come around
I'd build this place like a church
With all the things I found

This place would be like a home
That loneliness has made
It will be just like a hotel
Where no one ever stays

So I run and I run and I run and I run and I run
And I run from the place where you said I should stay and was gone
Cause there's nothing to say if there's nothing that I could have done
So I run and I run and I run and I run
I once imagined this place

Now there's a crack in my heart
Where all the dirt gets in
There is a face in my mind
That I can't face again

So I run and I run and I run and I run and I run
And I run from the place where you said I should stay and was gone
Cause there's nothing to say if there's nothing that I could have done
So I run and I run and I run and I run

Staring from the cliff off the coast of my life
Seeing everything get smashed like bricks of ice
I'm watching it fall

So I run and I run and I run and I run and I run
And I run from the place where you said I should stay and was gone
Cause there's nothing to say if there's nothing that I could have done
So I run and I run and I run and I run

Staring from the cliff just off the coast of my life
Waiting for the tidal wave
Seeing everything get smashed like bricks of ice
Here it comes: the tidal wave
