Since the day that you were born
The wheels are in motion
Turning ever faster
Play your part

In the big machine
The stage is set
The road is chosen
Your fate
Preordained

We are watching you
...
Every step of the way
Yaw
...

Never too late
To stand your ground
Revolution
Begins

In you
In me
Revolution
Once lost
Lost in the game

Mental chains
Breaking now
Set yourself free
Who are they to tell you what to do?
This stage is not set

The road is not chosen

Your fate not preordained
They are losing control
Every step of your way
Yaw
...
Never too late

To stand your ground
Revolution
Begins
In you
In me
Revolution
(Solo)
...
(Solo)
...
Yaaw
...
Never too late
Too stand your ground
Revolution
Begins
In you
In me
This is revolution
(Solo)
Revolution!
(Solo)
