Every day you remind me
All the ways you let me down
Play the tape and rewind it

Say the reason that I'm leaving you now
And the way that you look at me
I must to you dress

You are too small to respect me
I'm not believing that the feeling is real

So I met some one
So i don't let go
So i met some one and I'm asking her stay
Cause you drove me away
Away away away away
Away away away away

For so long have you played me
I was for you your favourite song
Xxxx
We start to bleeding and the feeling is gone

So I met someone
So i dont let go
So i met someone and I'm asking her stay
So I met someone Cause you drove me away
Away away away away
Away away away away
It is hard to say
It could be different
How to say the feeling is gone
Awake it could be different
How to say the feeling is gone

So I met someone and I'm asking her stay
So I met someone
Cause you drove me away
Away away away away
Away away away away
Away away away away
How to say the feeling is gone
Away away away away
How to say the feeling is gone

Cause you drove me away
Away away away away
Away away away away
How to say the feelin is gone
