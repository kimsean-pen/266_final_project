Crawling under my skin
You're not like anyone
I got a needle and thread
To sew this feeling on

I need your poison
Got my fix til morning comes
Now I lay here feigning for more more more

My little light in the dark
Such a pretty drug
I wanna give you my heart
So you can beat it up

I need your poison
Got my fix til morning comes
Now I lay here feigning for more more more

I really want your poison lo-o-o-ove
I really want your poison lo-o-ove
I really want your poison lo-o-o-ove
I really want your poison lo-o-ove

Cover me in your sin
Take me in the night
Kissing my sweetest prince
You'll be my suicide

I need your poison
Got my fix til morning comes
Now I lay here feigning for more more more

I really want your poison lo-o-o-ove
I really want your poison lo-o-ove
I really want your poison lo-o-o-ove
I really want your poison lo-o-ove

Give it to me
Give me life
God it feels so good
I need it every night
Give it to me
Give me life
God it feels so good
I need it every night

I want your poison
I want your poison
I want your poison
Give me that poison

I really want your poison lo-o-o-ove
I really want your poison lo-o-ove
I really want your poison lo-o-o-ove
I really want your poison lo-o-ove
