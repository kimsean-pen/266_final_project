The planet queen perchance to dream
She used my head like an exploder
The planet queen

The worlds the same I am to blame
She used my head like a revolver
The world's the same

Well it's all right
Love is what she want
Flying saucer take me away
Give me your daughter

Well it's all right
Love is what she want
Flying saucer take me away
Give me your daughter

Dragon head machine of lead
Cadillac king dancer in the midnight
Dragon head

The planet queen perchance to dream
She used my head like a revolver
The world's the same

Well it's all right
Love is what she want
Flying saucer take me away
Give me your daughter

Well it's all right
Love is what she want
Flying saucer take me away
Give me your daughter

The dragon head machine of lead
Cadillac king dancer in the midnight
Dragon head

The planet queen perchance to dream
She used my head like a revolver
The planet queen

Well it's all right
Love is what she want
Flying saucer take me away
Give me your daughter

Well it's all right
Love is what she want
Flying saucer take me away
Give me your daughter

Well it's all right
Love is what she want
Flying saucer take me away
Give me your daughter

Give me your daughter
Give me your daughter
Give me your daughter
