No, your mom don't get it
And your dad don't get it
Uncle John don't get it

And you can't tell grandma
'Cause her heart can't take it
And she might not make it

They say: Don't dare, don't you even go there
Cutting off your long hair
You do as you're told

Tell you: Wake up, go put on your makeup
This is just a phase you're gonna outgrow

There's something wrong in the village
In the village, oh
They stare in the village
In the village, oh

There's nothing wrong with you
It's true, it's true
There's something wrong with the village
With the village
There's something wrong with the village

Feel the rumors follow you from Monday all the way to Friday dinner
You got one day of shelter,
then it's Sunday hell to pay, you young lost sinner
Well I've been there, sitting in that same chair
Whispering that same prayer half a million times
It's a lie though buried in disciples
One page of the Bible isn't worth a life

There's something wrong in the village
In the village, oh
They stare in the village
In the village, oh

There's nothing wrong with you
It's true, it's true
There's something wrong with the village
With the village
There's something wrong with the village

There's something wrong in the village
In the village, oh
They stare in the village
In the village, oh

There's nothing wrong with you
It's true, it's true
There's something wrong with the village
With the village
There's something wrong with the village
