Your ghost holds me close as I'm ravaged by the solitary that surrounds my former home
Use me until you've spent the rest of my remains
Then try to validate your actions
Cursing every empty vein that used to be inhabited by your impression

Paralyze me, to ensure I have no chance of knowing the feeling of affection
It's no secret that I've shed the common decency
That appoints the world with the burden of devotion to our kin
I gave you everything I had and the world has left me exhausted

So make me feel something
Anything that might change my mind
As worthless as I am, I know that I still serve a purpose
To leech off the light and absolve my insignificance

Lay me to rest

Lay me to rest inside of a glass casket
So you can remember me with a smile on my face
Adorning me in my own failures
So you can count them as you stand above my bones

I wish I were a better man, I am a coward masked in courage
And just admitting it will not save me this time
So free me from my tired mind and let me learn the difference
Between a single tear and the runoff of an ocean

Weak and weary from my predatory nature
So bless me with abandonment in my greatest time of need

Let me carry on knowing that I could never truly face my reflection
It's much easier to caress the broken glass (broken glass)
Though if I accidentally catch a glimpse of myself in the shards
I will put my faith in the shrapnel to correct my vision

I am a stranger when I stare into the eyes of those I love
Look away in disgust, protect yourself from the sound of my deception
I am a stranger when I stare into the eyes of those I love
Look away in disgust, protect yourself from the sound of my deception
