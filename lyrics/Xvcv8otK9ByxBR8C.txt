Come into my dreams where I first saw you
Please come to my dreams, I can't stop thinking of you

If I could find you out on the street, I would
If I could build you with a machine, I would
If I could dream you whenever I sleep, I would
Waste every day down under my sheets cause it feels so good

Come into my dreams where I first saw you
Please come to my dreams, can't stop thinking of you

Maybe I'll call the girl from last week, I could
Maybe I'll ask her out for a drink, I should
If she's ok I'll toss her a wink, I could
If I could just get over this dream, I would

Come into my dreams where I first saw you
Please come to my dreams, can't stop thinking of you
Come into my dreams where I first saw you
Please come to my dreams, can't stop thinking of you
