I've been to London, seen seven wonders
I know to trip is just to fall
I used to rock it, sometimes I'd roll it
I always knew what it was for

There can be no denyin' that the wind'll shake 'em down
And the flag we're flyin' is the new flag of the land
Just join hands
If we could just join hands
If we could just join

With fields aplenty when Heaven sent me
I saw the kings who ruled them all
Still by the firelight and purple moonlight
I hear the rustic river's call

And the wind is cryin' from a love that won't grow cold
My lover, she is lyin' on the dark side of the globe

Could just join hands
If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Do it, ow

You got me rockin' when I oughta be rollin'
Darlin', tell me, darlin', which way to go
Keep me rockin' baby, can you keep me strollin'
Won'tcha tell me, darlin', which way to go, that's right

Oh how I wonder, oh how I worry
and I would dearly like to know
How all this squander of earthly plunder
will leave us anything to show

And our time is flyin'
See the candle burnin' low
Is the new world risin'
from the shambles of the old

If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
If we could just, if we could just
If we could just, if we could just
If we could just join hands, hey

That's all it takes, that's all it takes
That's all it takes, that's all it takes
Hey-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, ooh yeah, ah, ah, yeah
That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right
