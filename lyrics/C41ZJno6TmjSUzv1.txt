This is it
It's time for you to go to the wire
You will hit
'Cos you got the burnin' desire
It's your time (time)
You got the horn so why don't you blow it
You are fine (fine)
You're filthy cute and baby you know it

Cream, get on top
Cream, you will cop
Cream, don't you stop
Cream, sh-boogie bop

You're so good
Baby, there ain't nobody better (ain't nobody better)
So you should
Never ever go by the letter (never ever)
You're so cool (cool)
Everything you do is success
Make the rules (rules)
Then break them all 'cos you are the best
Yes you are

Cream, get on top
Cream, you will cop
Cream, don't you stop
Cream, sh-boogie bop

Look up in the air, it's your guitar

Do your dance
Why should you wait any longer
Take a chance
It could only make you stronger
It's your time (it's your time)
You got the horn so why don't you blow it
(Go on and blow it)
You're so fine (you're so fine)
You're filthy cute and baby you know it (You know it)
(And you know it)
(Come on)

Cream, get on top
Cream, you will cop
Cream, don't you ever stop
Cream, sh-boogie bop

Cream
Cream
Cream, sh-boogie bop
Cream
Cream, right there
Cream (don't you stop)
(Cream) Sh-boogie bop
(Boogie)
