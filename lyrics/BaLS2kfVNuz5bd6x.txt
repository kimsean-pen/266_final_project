I made up a word that turned to flesh
Scaring all the birds back to the nest
The morning'd come and I would smile
And sway my head from side to side
With the wind and rain that traveled past
All the deer that cross, they cross in fear
Lay me back, I want to be right here
The light inside a silver birch
And through the smoke, you catch the sun
A boat is just some wood that wants to burn
Hung up on a pole and full of straw
We are not afraid of you no more
The crows fly down from their nests
To steal the grain you can't protect
The crows fly down and peck your face
Your eyes and hair and nose and lips
