I agree, when you tell me it's wrong
When you tell me we can't do this
I'm not playing along
I don't know how we'll get through this

We are both just a little afraid
Just a little afraid
And I forget I want to fight with this
Cause when we are alone
I'm under the influence of you

You you you you you you
Oh!
You, why?
You, why?
You got me feenin'
You got me feenin'
Oh you, why?
You, why?
You got me feenin'

I'm under the influence of you
Why? Why?
I'm under the influence of you
Why? Why?

I agree, when you say you're confused
But you feel like you, you can't help it
I'm not playing along
I agree when you tell me that you've
Never felt anything quite like... this

We are both just a little afraid
Oh we don't wanna change
No we don't wanna change
And I forget I want to fight
Cause when we're alone
I'm under the influence of you

You you you you you you
Oh!
You, why?
You, why?
You got me feenin'
You got me feenin'
Oh you, why?
You, why?
You got me feenin'

I'm under the influence of you
Why? Why?

You got me feenin' baby
