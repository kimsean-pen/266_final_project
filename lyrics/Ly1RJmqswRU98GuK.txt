Not enough, never too much
The woman look just like love
Rolling stone, gathers no moss
But leave a trail of busted stuff

I know she's gonna leave my broken heart behind her
I take what she's giving up
I know she's gonna leave this broken man behind her
I take what she's giving up

Sweet sugar lips
Push from the hips
Woman looks just like love
Without a care she floats above
Got me down here looking up

I know she's gonna leave my broken heart behind her
I take what she's giving up
I know she's gonna leave my broken heart behind her
Yeah, yeah

When she moves
She moves so cool
Make me feel just like a fool
But inside where the devil hides
Woman looks just like love

I know she's gonna leave her broken man behind her
I take what she's giving up
I know she's gonna leave my broken heart behind
I take what she's giving up
I know she's gonna leave my broken heart behind her
Yeah, yeah

Not enough, never too much
The woman looks just like love

I know she's gonna leave my broken heart behind her
Yeah, yeah
