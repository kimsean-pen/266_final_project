My love, she has chosen me
From my candor of speech
She takes me to the river
Like a child at play

She sees not this bitter man
But the promise of a lover
Once the darkness washes off
She moves into my arms

So too, my folks support me
Through my restless whims
They see not this failure
But the promise of a firstborn

When my darkness leaves
When my fall is complete
I shall cross this river
For them
