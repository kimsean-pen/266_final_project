Once, out in the rain
I was able to strangle my shadow then shackle the chain
What? What will you do?
Is it safe to play God in the garden and king of the zoo?
Holes, well they need to be filled
Positions available, yet some are quite hard to get out of or in

Spinning in the daffodils
Dizzy from a dozen twirls
Spinning in the daffodils

Cold, alone and alive
You're afraid but that's not what I asked. Wanna go for a ride?
Sharpen your teeth my darlings
Sharpen your minds
Take a finger if the hand feeds you shit. Take one scalp at a time

Fail as big as a whale
Like a canine that chases a bone, that's tied to his tail
I wish I was a beautiful balloon
I could rise up above it all and fade out of view
Gracefully, fade out of view
What have you turned me into?

Spinning in the daffodils
Dizzy from a dozen twirls
Spinning in the daffodils

What have you gone and done my love?
Incinerated in the morning sun

I am so high
I just may never come down
I am so high
I just may never come down

I am so high
I just may never come down
I am so high
I just may never come down
