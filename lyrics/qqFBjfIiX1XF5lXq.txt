ear for the minds of the weak
A parasitic form of a walking disease
Feeding children bullshit with a burnt belief
This is not the way life's supposed to be

Die tonight
An eye for eye
Makes the whole world blind
We don't need
One more thing
From your bigot fucking mouth
And the war it brings

Painting your illusions of hell
And what euphoria heaven sells
Slaughtered a million like they were to blame
When you should be the one devoured by flames

One purpose and its destruction
The earth is rotting under one instruction
Being taught from a fucking fraud
To manipulate everyone and kill for your god

Die tonight
An eye for an eye
Makes the whole world blind
Die tonight
An eye for an eye
Makes the whole world fucking blind
It makes the whole world fucking blind
It makes the whole world fucking blind

Hypocrisy
The ultimate disease
So sweet It makes us
Makes us weak to our knees
