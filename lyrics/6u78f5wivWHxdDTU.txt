Ashes on the ground
Keep the fire burning down
Keep us where we belong
Ashes on the ground
Keep the fire burning down
Keep us where we belong
It's not formula, single file, you and I
Through the borderline, fade into the night
It's not destined time, wasted wars, take the ones you love before
You go on, fade into the night
Ashes on the ground
Fire burning down
Kings who lost their crown
Wait for horns to sound
Ashes on the ground, ground, ground
Fire burning down, down, down again
Ashes on the ground, ground, ground
Fire burning down, down, down again
Start again, start again, build a new world up instead
Let the old one burn, you get what you deserve
Go in exile, go in vain, keep burning to the borderlands
We become all that we hate, start again, start again
Ashes on the ground
Fire burning down
Ashes on the ground
Fire burning down
Ashes on the ground
Fire burning down
Ashes on the ground
Fire burning down
