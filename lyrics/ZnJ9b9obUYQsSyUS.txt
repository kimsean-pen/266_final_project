It's like a dream to me
All the things that I see
Start from something small
I am the man now

It's like a dream to me
All the things that I see
Start from something small
I am the man now

See all of the things
They say could not be
Complete, so in control
Of who I want to be

Times have changed now
I've changed, a good difference
More champagne now
What I'm seeing now, I wouldn't miss it

It's like a dream to me
All the things that I see
Start from something small
I am the man now

It's like a dream to me
(It's like a dream to me)
All the things that I see
(All the things that I see)

Start from something small
(Start from something small)
I am the man now
(I am the man now)

Go far beyond
That my hopes can go
Fly, you got places to be
Can't let the time speed by

Times have changed now
I'm strong, a good difference
More champagne now
What I'm seeing now, I wouldn't miss it

It's like a dream to me
All the things that I see
Start from something small
I am the man now

It's like a dream to me
(It's like a dream to me)
All the things that I see
(All the things that I see)

Start from something small
(Start from something small)
I am the man now
(I am the man now)
