Can you figure out what I want?
Pull the trigger with a pop gun
Mindless fools that aggravate it
Pick at you in desperation

Oh it's a love pop suicide
Oh I'm in love pop suicide
Oh I really don't know

Pop life living is so real
Midwest farmers' kids are milkfed
Breed and incubate what you see
Ten years later here on TV

Oh it's a love pop suicide
Oh I'm in love pop suicide
Oh I really don't know
Oh I really don't know
Oh I really don't know
Oh I really don't know

Father can't you love your women?
Father can't you teach your children?
Long range love implosion short wicked
Short wave mind explosion [Incomprehensible]

Oh I'm in love pop suicide
About a pop star homicide
Oh I really don't know
Oh I really don't know
Tell me somethin' about you
Tell me somethin' about you

Oh I really don't know
Tell me somethin' about you
Tell me somethin' about you
Tell me somethin' about you
