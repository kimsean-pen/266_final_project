When you say in your mind that it's all the time
And you hope that you floated through the larger line
On the gaudy side of town
On the gaudy side of town

I'm not your money man
A thin coated satellite
And you wouldn't leave me, would you dear?
Not tonight
We see your back and forth
Fear in the company now
Put some fear in the company now
Don't lose your cold dear
Fear in the company now
Keep it right

She come in alone
A firestorm
Waitin' on a spark
Leaving me alone she feels it after dark
Keep it down boys
The fire inside
Figure it out sort it out
Your foot in the mouth
