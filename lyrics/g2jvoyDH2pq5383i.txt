I) JUDGEMENT

THIS TEMPLE MUST FALL

II) THE ABYSS

Breathe in... First Deeper...
Seethe in... Much Clearer...
I felt the change... Cataclysmic Beast...
Its origins pure...

THE GREAT ABYSS

Oh! We will never cross the ocean!
Oh! We will never part the sea!
Oh! We will never walk these lands!
Oh! We will never hunt these hands!

TODAY MARKS THE END OF THE WORLD

I shall, in this, holy form, destroy all

DESTROY

Soul escaping, the abyss awakening
Cruel hands, shifting sands
Creator of Mutant Soil

THE TEMPLE IS FALLING INSIDE OF ME

Signs and feelings combine
To instil the rites of the divine
Blessed be the blood of the Eye
Can you feel it?
So why do you ignore this Geometry?
Betrayers of Mutant Soil!

III) FRACTAL SUICIDE

"The stars bled that night,
As the cold wind chilled my heart.
The voices of my blood called me closer
Into their arms of fate...
I could see all my lives
And all my dreams rolled into one
And then did I feel it all die away...
From inside.

IV) THE FALL

Fall!
I compel my soul so that it may weep for Ea!
I compel my heart so that it may bleed for Ea!
And when the depths of my heart do crumble and fall
Will I ever see again, will this world evolve?
Will I reignite this poisoned blood?
No, no, no!
To Destroy this Temple and in three days...

RISE
