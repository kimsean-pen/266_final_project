Yesterday I got so old
I felt like I could die
Yesterday I got so old
It made me want to cry

So go on go on just walk away
Go on go on your choice is made
Go on go on and disappear
Go on go on away from here

And I know I was wrong
When I said it was true
That it couldn't be me and be her
In between without you, without you

Yesterday I got so scared
I shivered like a child
Yesterday away from you
It froze me deep inside

So come back, come back, don't walk away
Come back, come back, come back today
Come back, come back, why can't you see?
Come back, come back, come back to me

And I know I was wrong
When I said it was true
That it couldn't be me and be her
In between without you, without you
Without you, without you

Without you, without you
Without you, without you
