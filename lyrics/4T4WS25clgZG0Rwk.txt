So here's a little piece of my history
I already lost my v v virginity
And I'd get it back and lose it all
Over again and again and again and again

I'm coming up I feel it down my back
I gave my mum ma ma a a a heart attack
She knew I was lost and she hoped
I would find my way back
My way back, my way back
But this is power

That was the summer of no fucks given
Live fast, die young, stay out of prison
When you're high with your friends
And you're having a love attack
Tack tack tack tack tack
A love attack tack tack tack tack tack

That was the summer of no fucks given
To hell and back where are our children?
They're all high with their friends and
They're having a love attack
Tack tack tack tack tack
A love attack tack tack
Tack tack tack, alright

So goodbye dear dignity
You never meant that much to me
I'd get it back and lose it all over
Again and again and again and again

We get high cause we're broken people
But when you're loaded everybody's equal
We are not evil power to the people,
Power to the people,
Power to the people,
Give me strength

That was the summer of no fucks given
Live fast die young stay out of prison
When you're high with your friends
And you're having a love attack
Tack tack tack tack tack
A love attack
Tack tack tack tack tack

That was the summer of no fucks given
To hell and back where are your children?
They're all high with their friends
And they're having a love attack
Tack tack tack tack tack
A love attack
Tack tack tack tack tack, alright

Gimme gimme back
Gimme back that love attack
Gimme gimme back
Gimme back that love attack
Gimme gimme back
Gimme back that love attack

Gimme gimme back
Gimme back that love attack
Gimme gimme back
Gimme back that love attack
Gimme gimme back
Gimme back that love attack

That was the summer of no fucks given
Live fast die young stay out of prison
When you're high with your friends
And you're having a love attack
Tack tack tack tack tack
A love attack
Tack tack tack tack tack

That was the summer of no fucks given
To hell and back where are your children?
They're all high with their friends
And they're having a love attack
Tack tack tack tack tack
