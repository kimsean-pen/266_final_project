When hope and love has been lost
And you fall to the ground
You must find a way
When the darkness descends and
You're told it's the end
You must find a way

When God decides to look the other way
And a clown takes the throne
We must find a way
Face the firing squad, against all the odds
We must find a way

And dig down
And dig down
Dig down and find faith
When you're close to the edge
With a gun to your head
We must find a way

When friends are thin on the ground
And they try to divide us
We must find a way
We have entered the fray and we will not obey
We must find a way, yeah

And dig down
And dig down
Dig down and find faith
When they've left you for dead (dig down)
And you can only see red (dig down)
We must find a way

Ohh, ohh, ooh

Dig down (dig down)
Dig down (dig down)
Dig down, find faith (dig down)
We won't let them divide, we will never abide (dig down)
We must find a way (dig down)

Dig down
(Woah-oh-oh) (dig down)
Dig down
(Woah-oh-oh) (dig down)
Dig down
(Woah-oh-oh) (dig down)
Faith
(Woah-oh-oh) (dig down)
Dig down
(Woah-oh-oh) (dig down)
Dig down
(Woah-oh-oh) (dig down)
Faith
