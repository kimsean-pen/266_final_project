I walk ahead alone
you tell me not to go so fast
but i am slower than you think
i am as careful as your touch
when you want me to relax
i am as serious as your looks
when you want me to believe
ooh

i sneak around the corner
with a blueprint of my lover
with a blueprint of my life
i would better run for cover

i sneak around the corner
with a blueprint my lover
with a blueprint of my life
i would better run for cover, yeah!

I walk ahead alone
you tell me never ever leave me
but i am already gone
i am further than the wall
you have built around your future
you said that i'm higher than the tower
you climb in a suicidal mood
ooh
here is a blueprint of your past
here is a blueprint of your destiny
that all there is of you
and that's all there is of me, yeah!

i sneak around the corner
with a blueprint of my lover
with a blueprint of my life
i would better run for cover

i sneak around the corner
with a blueprint of my lover
with a blueprint of my life
i would better run for cover

i sneak around the corner
with a blueprint of my lover, yeah!
blueprint of my life
i would better run, run, run, run, run, yeah!

i sneak around the corner
with a blueprint of my lover
with a blueprint of my life
i should better run for cover...
