You never know, never know, never know
What you had until it's gone
I thought that for sure you'd stay the night
But I guess you still needed time

I didn't know, didn't know, didn't know
It would hurt 'til you were gone
I thought that we were just having fun
Didn't know you could be the one

You got the best of me
My arrogance took hold
And made me blind to see
To see you differently
Always thought that you'd come back
But I guess I got cocky
I got a little too cocky

Had you wrapped around my finger
Made believe we were in love
Took advantage of the fantasy
And ran off with your trust
Now all of it has turned around
And I'm the one who's lost
Got too cocky
I got a little too cocky, yeah

I couldn't tell that slipped and I fell
'Til I woke up in a daze
Fiending for something got the shakes
Repeating the lines I couldn't say

And from the day that you turned me away
There's a bitter I still taste
Don't know if I'll ever turn the page
I may be an addict to the chase

You got the best of me
My arrogance took hold
And made me blind to see
To see you differently
Always thought that you'd come back
But I guess I got cocky
I got a little too cocky

Had you wrapped around my finger
Made believe we were in love
Took advantage of the fantasy
And ran off with your trust
Now all of it is turned around
I'm the one who's lost
Got too cocky
I got a little too cocky, yeah

You had me under pressure
Didn't need no lecture
Said you needed answers
Didn't wanna waste your time
Now you don't wanna waste mine

Had you wrapped around my finger
Made believe we were in love
Took advantage of the fantasy
And ran off with your trust
Now all of it is turned around
I'm the one who's lost
Got too cocky
I got a little too cocky, yeah

You had me under pressure
Didn't need no lecture
Said you needed answers
Didn't wanna waste your time
I got a little too cocky
Yeah, yeah
