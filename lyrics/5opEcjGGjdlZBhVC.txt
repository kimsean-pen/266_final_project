Two hands
I wanna play the piano with two hands
Shoulda learned
To make some money it's the way of the world
Boy you gonna be good to me
You gave me a piano with all 88 keys
But two hands
What's a girl to do
With two hands
To make the money like the richest of man
What's a guy to do
With two hands
I can make you be so good to me
Give me all the time with my sensuality

So clap your hands if you're working too hard
Clap your hands if you're working too hard
Clap your hands if you're working too hard
Clap your hands if you're working too hard
And the beat's so hard, you're workin workin

Two hands
What your supposed to do with two hands
To get the life of the richest of men
Where you supposed to go with two hands
I can not but something in between
When i'm breaking my back and i'm on my knees

So clap your hands if you're working too hard
Clap your hands if you're working too hard
Clap your hands if you're working too hard
Clap your hands if you're working too hard
And the beat's so hard, you're workin workin

And I can't escape from the work in L.A.
And I can't sleep in my bed in U.K.
Clap your hands if you're working too hard

You see life and its falling away-ay-ay
Your slow down and the rest makes you pay-ay-ay
I see you lookin up
You want to think about it

Clap your hands if you're working too hard
Clap your hands if you're working too hard
Clap your hands if you're working too hard
And the beats so hard, you're workin workin

And I can't escape from the work in LA
And I can't sleep in my bed in U.K.
And clap your hands if you're working too hard
Clap your hands if your working too hard
