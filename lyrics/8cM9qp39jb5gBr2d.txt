I am of crimson blood
Nought shall hold me
Mirror mine the dark of night
Reflects me in water

Ablaze are my eyes
My soul consumed by woe
My braids weaved by the wind
An image, black in my mind

Leave I must now with haste
Me who tires of quiet life
Me whose path leads to war
Me who fears no death

I, I yearn for more
I yearn to rise
I yearn for everything
I yearn for you
I yearn to rise
