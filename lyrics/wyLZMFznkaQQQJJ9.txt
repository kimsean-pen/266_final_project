Seen through these dreamless eyes
Blind buildings stark to the sky
Silhouettes as dividing walls
Guarding the eternal secret

Where is the flame to haunt you
And who do you answer to
My lies are always wishes
Lies that make me

See beyond the rationale
We accept the fate that nothing is meant to be
Be the least connected
Stay true to the last original

Apply layers to reality
Things only you can see
Add a beat to normality
To tap the core of insanity

I let my dreams cross over
To days of endless grey
If I could merge the mundane and the magic
We'd forge a new unknown
I let my dreams cross over
To nothingness and back again
If I could merge the mundane and the magic
Where is the dark I came to find

In latter days as time will find you
Memories will never let you get closer
The silent sighs in useless company
Wish for darkness and death again
In the face of ignorance and fear
I cast it right back
Some things were never there to begin with
Objectivity is truth denied

Apply layers to reality
Things only you can see
Add a beat to normality
To tap the core of insanity

I let my dreams cross over
To days of endless grey
If I could merge the mundane and the magic
We'd forge a new unknown
I let my dreams cross over
To nothingness and back again
If I could merge the mundane and the magic
Where is the dark I came to find
