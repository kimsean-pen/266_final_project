Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down
Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down, da da da da da da

Record sales are on the mark
'Cause that's about the time the rumors start
Where all the people talking out of they ass
Well, someone gotta school you cause you got no class
Well I've paid my dues
I'm a seasoned dame
So why you gotta throw salt in my game
You hide behind the computer screens so that you don't have to be seen
How could a person be so mean

Who are you-and what do you do
To make you think you are above me
But have you walked in my shoes
The pedestal
You put yourself on
Well since I'm breaking it down now
It's gonna collapse and be gone-gone-gone-gone-gone

Probably one of them tag a longs down 4 the free t-shirt
'Cause you're a hanger on
You think you got my figured out
Never met me have no clue what I'm about
Maybe I got things you wish you had
You need to stop the hate and get a pen and pad
I work around the clock, so fill your smoth up with a sock
And get you head up off your jock
Tell me who you are and what your background is
Tell me how you're feelin' when you listen to this

Who are you-and what do you do
To make you think you are above me
But have you walked in my shoes
The pedestal
You put yourself on
Well since I'm breaking it down now
It's gonna collapse and be gone-gone-gone-gone-gone

Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down
Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down, dum dum dum dum
Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down
Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down, da da da da da da
Tell me who you are and what your background is
Tell me how you're feelin' when you listen to this
You think I dont see you on the internet, I read it, dont think I won't forget

Who are you-and what do you do
To make you think you are above me
But have you walked in my shoes
The pedestal
You put yourself on
Well since I'm breaking it down now
It's gonna collapse and be gone-gone-gone-gone-gone

Who are you-and what do you do
To make you think you are above me
But have you walked in my shoes
The pedestal
You put yourself on
Well since I'm breaking it down now
It's gonna collapse and be gone-gone-gone-gone-gone
