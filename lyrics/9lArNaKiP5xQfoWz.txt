Don't blame your daughter,
that's just sentimental
And don't blame your mom
for all that you've done wrong
Your dad is not guilty,
you came out a little faulty
And the factory closed,
so you can't hold them liable
You come from an island,
you're cutting diamonds with a rubbery knife

Your autograph's worthless,
so don't send me letters
And don't mail me cash
'cause your money is no good
What's left in your mattress is holes and lack of love left
Some hair from a horse and none of it is yours, man
You come from an island,
you're cutting diamonds with a rubbery knife

And the song you sing today wasn't always in your head
The words you're tryin' to say are the ones you shouldn't have said
They're glistenin' like diamonds,
go out and find 'em
But don't blame your daughter

Read me your tombstone,
tell me you're sorry
Fax me your will,
you owe me something still
Blood is like water,
the bath that you poured me
Has drained and it's gone,
don't blame it on your son

And the song you sing today wasn't always in your head
The words you're tryin' to say are the ones you should've said
They're glistening like diamonds,
go out and find 'em, boy
The world is full of diamonds, go out and find 'em
But don't blame your daughter
