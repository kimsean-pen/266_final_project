Brooklyn, uh uh uh uh
Huh Huh uh huh do it Yea
Uh Uh do it huh huh what ya'll want huh

Rollin, gold two seater
Stash in the dash
Hole through heaters
Blockahhhhh put holes through beaters
Ghetto Fab stroll through Cheetahs.

Ballin, Brooklyn dawn
Addicted to Cris, hooked on Don
15 G's hookers on
Ma, I wanna see how you look in thongs.

Hustlin, guys that send Po's
Cause I chop rocks the size of mentos
Blame me, I tried to hint those
Look at the hurt in your eyes they squint closed.

Pimpin' here's a new way to flirt
Ya listen to the two way alert
It goes -
Lets go VIP boo raise your skirt.

I'm Gangsta
Ya'll just wannabes
Federal Agents on their P's
30 grand, 28 on the keys
Gotta good lawyer I'm gonna squeeze.

Thuggin' jeans and Timb's
Fitted to the front lean the brim
Ride but never on teenage rims
And I keep a chick's face between my limbs.

Stylin ya'll heard about my kick game
I'm on the park where you see me at the Knick game
Probably seen this tatted on your chick frame
F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S.

Ridin ya'll know as well I do
That's the way you can tell I'm blue
So I got a deal I sell pot too
Cause before I hit the pens I'm gettin bailed by Clue.

Cruisin top down Mercedes low
Turn this up when you hear this on the radio
Blastin with the 18-90 flow
Make the necks on the ladies go (wooo wooop).

Holla that's what a pretty thug will do
Hit Branson get a fifty jug or two
Ya'll throwin on them gritty mugs for who
Like ya'll don't know what fifty slugs will do.

Hatin I just bought the booze
I put ya'll in the front page articles
I got em lookin at the billboard charts confused
And I still freestyle just to start the Clue's.

Rappin I'm that kid about the dough
I done copped coke and started droughts before
Ship Platinum out the door
Now I drop the top down just to shout to hoes

Holla back Young'n (Hoooo Hoooo!)
