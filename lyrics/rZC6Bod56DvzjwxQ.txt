I don't have any kitchenware
But I can walk around in my underwear
In my first apartment
Where I pay so much for rent

I check the mail
In my underwear
I don't where to put the pillows on my bed
Not sure what side is best to lay my head
Cars zoom by at early hours
And not even a shower curtain in my shower

But will you still come visit me on north front street
And will you still watch the simpsons on my floor
Pretend it's 1994
Dvd's weren't out yet
So please ignore my box set
