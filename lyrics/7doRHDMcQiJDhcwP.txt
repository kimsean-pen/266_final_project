Compass points north
You're polar magnetic
I shift from you
Our plates are tectonic
Tectonic
Tectonic

On a different coast
When thats the most
When I'm getting closer all the time
When the feeling goes
God only knows

When I'm getting closer all the time

Closer all the time

Closer all the time

I shake, burn, break
It's just my reaction

Careful you say
We are plate tectonic

Tectonic
Tectonic

On a different coast

When thats the most
When I'm getting closer all the time
When the feeling goes

God only knows
When I'm getting closer all the time

Closer all the time

Closer all the time
Closer all the time

Closer all the time

Gravity is pulling us down
Tidal waves can pull us apart

Always find a signal to send
Only holding on by the heart
When I'm getting closer all the time
When I'm getting closer all the time

On a different coast
When thats the most
When I'm getting closer all the time
When the feeling goes
God only knows
When I'm getting closer all the time
Closer all the time
Closer all the time
Tectonic
Closer all the time
Tectonic
Closer all the time
Tectonic
Closer all the time
Tectonic
