I remember life before
Faraway dreams and locking doors
Then you came, then you came
Afraid to fall, to be free
Always were our worst enemy
Isn't what, what you see
I took time to realize
That I couldn't do it by myself, myself

There's no gravity when you're next to me
You always break my fall like a parachute
When you're holding me swear this I barely breathe
You always break my fall, my fall
Like a parachute
You're my parachute

With you it all begins
Feeling okay in my own skin
So alive, I'm so alive
I know this life isn't gonna be perfect
The ups and downs are gonna be worth it
As long as I'm, I'm with you

There's no gravity when you're next to me
You always break my fall like a parachute
When you're holding me swear this I barely breathe
You always break my fall, my fall
You're my parachute

When I'm standing at the edge
It's just a long way down
And I second-guess myself
You better catch me now
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Never touch the ground

There's no gravity when you're next to me
You always break my fall like a parachute
When you're holding me swear this I barely breathe
You always break my fall, my fall
Like my parachute
You're my parachute
