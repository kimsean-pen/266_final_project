Girl I got a problem
Unless we trust
You could be the best friend
Or you could be the one
But girl I got a problem
Unless we trust in love

Don't wanna put my love there, you
Don't wanna make a headline and lose
Don't wanna be the one that you choose
'Cause I'm the one, the one, the one that
You wish you knew
You wish you knew
You wish you knew
You wish you knew
You wish you knew
Don't wanna be the one that you choose
'Cause I'm the one, the one, the one that
You wish you knew

They say one thing
When you mean that
Holding onto nothing
Why you holding back?
'Cause girl I got a problem
Unless we trust
Girl I got a problem
Trust in love

Don't wanna put my love there, you
Don't wanna make a headline and lose
Don't wanna be the one that you choose
'Cause I'm the one, the one, the one that
You wish you knew
You wish you knew
You wish you knew
You wish you knew
You wish you knew
Don't wanna be the one that you choose
'Cause I'm the one, the one, the one that
You wish you knew

Do you hear yourself?, Do you speak
Do you see yourself desperately?
Talking shit trying to act like you mad
I don't know you like that
I don't know you like that

Don't wanna put my love there, you
Don't wanna make a headline and lose
Don't wanna be the one that you choose
'Cause I'm the one, the one, the one that
You wish you knew
You wish you knew
You wish you knew
You wish you knew
You wish you knew
Don't wanna be the one that you choose
'Cause I'm the one, the one, the one that
You wish you knew
