You'll never find, as long as you live
Someone who loves you tender like I do
You'll never find, no matter where you search
Someone who cares about you the way I do
Whoa, I'm not braggin' on myself, baby
But I'm the one who loves you
And there's no one else, no-oh-oh one else

You'll never find, it'll take the end of all time
Someone to understand you like I do
You'll never find the rhythm, the rhyme
All the magic we shared, just us two
Whoa, I'm not tryin' to make you stay, baby
But I know somehow, some day, some way

You are (You're gonna miss my lovin')
You're gonna miss my lovin'
(You're gonna miss my lovin')
You're gonna miss my lovin'
(You're gonna miss my lovin')
You're gonna miss, you're gonna miss my love (Miss my love)

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
(You're gonna miss my lovin')
Late in the midnight hour, baby
(You're gonna miss my lovin')
When it's cold outside
(You're gonna miss my lovin')
You're gonna miss, you're gonna miss my love (Miss my love)

You'll never find another love like mine
Someone who needs you like I do
You'll never see what you've found in me
You'll keep searching and searching your whole life through
Whoa, I don't wish you no bad luck, baby
But there's no ifs and buts or maybes

You're gonna miss my (You're gonna miss my lovin')
You're gonna miss my lovin'
(You're gonna miss my lovin')
I know you're gonna miss my lovin'
(You're gonna miss my lovin')
You're gonna miss, you're gonna miss my love (Miss my love)

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
(You're gonna miss my lovin')
Late in the midnight hour, baby
(You're gonna miss my lovin')
When it gets real cold outside
(You're gonna miss my lovin')
I know, I know that you are gonna miss my love (Miss my love)

Let me tell you that you're gonna miss my lovin' (You're gonna miss my lovin')
Yes you will, baby (You're gonna miss my lovin')
When I'm long gone (You're gonna miss my lovin')
I know, I know, I know that you are gonna miss my love (Miss my love)
You're gonna miss my lovin'
