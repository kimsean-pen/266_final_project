My ticket
exploded
when you came
from nowhere
and left me
in static
now i just hang around

i got seizures
uploaded
in life size
and they're gonna blow
like see through
like stupid
just like at home

so
you missed the getaway
and
you crashed the stolen plane
now everyone can say

your keys are
already
in heaven
on radar
they're restless
they're waiting
for you to go
let me go round
your making me out

so
you missed the getaway
and
you crashed the stolen plane
now everyone can say

a hideout in the brush
to heal a broken mind
i heard the crooked words falling
down
