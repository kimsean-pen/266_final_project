Your softly spoken words
Release my whole desire
Undenied, totally
And so bare is my heart,
I can't hide
And so where does my heart
Belong

Beneath your tender touch
My senses can't divide
Oh so strong
My desire
For so bare is my heart
I can't hide
And so where does my heart
Belong

Now that I've found you
And seen behind those eyes
How can I carry on?
For so bare is my heart
I can't hide
And so where does my heart
Belong
Belong, belong, belong
