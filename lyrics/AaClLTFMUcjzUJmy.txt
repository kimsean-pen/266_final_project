That's where I'll be
Where the girls are
That's where I'll be

Girl I'll even tell your sister
Girl I'll love you like no other
I'll be your mistress, be your mistress
Girl, I'll even tell your mother

When I'm right, I say I'm right
If I'm wrong, please tell me I'm wrong
Come on home with me tonight
Let me love you all night long

Girl I'll even tell your sister
Girl I love you like no other
I'll be your mistress, be your mistress
Girl, I'll even tell your mother

When I'm right, I say I'm right
If I'm wrong, please tell me I'm wrong
Come on home with me tonight
Let me love you all night long

Girl I'll even tell your sister
Girl I love you like no other
I'll be your mistress, be your mistress

When I'm right, I say I'm right
If I'm wrong, please tell me I'm wrong
Come on home with me tonight
Let me love you all night long
