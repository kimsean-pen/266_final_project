We always dreamed about this better life, this better life
We always felt it coming all along, yeah all along
We've got the keys to open paradise, yeah paradise
Now let's go walking hand in hand

Come on baby we can hit the lights
Make the wrongs turn right
We can smash the clock
make the pop go rock
With a love this deep
we don't need no sleep
And it feels like

we could do this all night
We could do this all night

Yeah everything is alright

We've got the keys to open paradise, yeah paradise
It feels like...
we could do this all night
(we could do this all night)

Oh winter melts under the summer skies, the summer skies
The seasons change, our hearts will stay the same, yeah stay the same
We got that burning feeling, start a fire, start a fire
Give it a shout, let's make it hot
Come on baby we can hit the lights
Make the wrongs turn right
We can smash the clock

make the pop go rock
With a love this deep

we don't need no sleep

And it feels like

we could do this all night
We could do this all night
Yeah everything is alright
We've got the keys to open paradise, yeah paradise
It feels like...
we could do this all night
Feels like...
we could do this all night

Come on baby we can hit the lights
Make the wrongs turn right
We can smash the clock
make the pop go rock
With a love this deep
we don't need no sleep
And it feels like...
we could do this all night
We could do this all night
We could do this all night
we could do this all night
Yeah everything is alright
We got the keys to open paradise, yeah paradise
It feels like...
we could do this all night
