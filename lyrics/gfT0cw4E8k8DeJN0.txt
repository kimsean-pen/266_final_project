Do you feel how it's all lies?
Come walk with me and you'll see
And bring whoever who can't be
Stuck in this reality

I've been stuck for some time
Been chasing lies most of my life
'Cause I'm a daydreamer stuck in a nightmare
Been chasing lies most of my life

Try to see it through my eyes
No longer care for your demands
No time to catch up my mind
I am tired of your advice

Come walk with me and you'll see
And bring whoever who can't be
Stuck in this reality

I've been stuck for some time
Been chasing lies most of my life
'Cause I'm a daydreamer stuck in a nightmare
Been chasing lies most of my life

These restless nights they wear me out
Let's get away, I lose my mind
Everything here is blind
So I'm opening my eyes
