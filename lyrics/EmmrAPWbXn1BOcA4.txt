I'll show ye God on the highest
Up where no one can see
Up where no one can find us

As you look thorugh the window
On your mind getting high
You won't know that we're all have to DIE

They don't know
They don't know there's nothing up there at all
They don't know
They don't know there's nothing up there

As we climb up the mountain
Through the clouds and the snow
Through the BLOOD in the mountain
We'll go

As we all reach the zenit
Where the teeth shall afire
To the darkness below us
Afire
