Some call it magic
The things I see
And I don't understand it
Why it happens to me
Some call it magic
And I don't know how
But I know that I have it
And it all works out

I've got my family and my friends with me
They the only ones who know my secret (only they do)
Trynna find a way bring it out and say
That you know you're special and believe it (stay true to you)

Some call it magic
The things I see
And I don't understand it
Why it happens to me (ohhh)
Some call it magic and I don't know how
But I know that I have it
And it all works out

My girl Chelsea, my boy Eddie
They help me in and out a situation (since the future I see)
But I understand
It's part of who I am
I don't have to give an explanation (i'll just be me)

Some call it magic (some call it magic)
The things I see
And I don't understand it
Why it happens to me (why it happens to me)
Some call it magic
And I don't know how
But I know that I have it (know that I have it)
And it all works out

See the future through my eyes
I can't control it
But it all seems to work out right
Cause there's a reason for everything
And I know with my powers and dreams future looks good to me
Ooohhh uhhh

Some call it magic
The things I see (ohhh)
And I don't understand it (I don't understand)

But I know that I have it
And it all works out (and it all works out)
