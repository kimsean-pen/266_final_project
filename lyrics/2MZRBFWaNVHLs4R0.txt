Could you tell the enchantment I said goodbye
I met a girl called disillusionment
Could you tell her I made the headlines
This boy drawed wings on everything

Could you tell her to check the headlines
This boy burns angels in the river
You know I dreamed about you
For 29 years before
I saw you

You know I dreamed about you
I missed you for 29 years
Bird that flys out of order
Underneath the sky

I run up to the rainbow, girl
Just to pass it by
I'll never have a change of heart
I swore I'd never sing

I have no heart this one is gone
And now I wear the wings
You know I dreamed about you
For 29 years before
I saw you

You know I dreamed about you
I missed you for 29 years
You know I dreamed about you
For 29 years before
I saw you

You know I dreamed about you
I missed you for 29 years
You know I dreamed about you
For 29 years before
I saw you
