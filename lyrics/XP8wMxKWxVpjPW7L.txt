You can tell by her smile, she's such a love child
And every man in this place, would love to be in her space
As the night settles down, she'd meet a lot of clever clowns
And I'll do my best to be better than the rest

She is so (So sweet and tender)
And I'm glad (So glad we made it girl)
She is so (So sweet and tender)
And I'm glad (So glad we're makin' love)
Oh I, oh I love that girl
Oh-oh

Then she walks my way, and said boy I hope you're free
I'm thinking, how could this be? Feels like a dream to me
Then she gives me this kiss, that gave my whole body a twitch
See you're just so much more than pretty, gave my heart an eclipse

She is so (So sweet and tender)
And I'm glad (So glad we made it girl)
She is so (So sweet and tender)
And I'm glad (So glad we're makin' love)
Oh I, oh I love that girl
Oh-oh

Darling (Darling)
I'm so glad we found each other (I'm so glad we found each other)
Holding hands (Holding hands)
Kissing, and making love and saying

She is so (So sweet and tender)
And I'm glad today (So glad we made it girl)
Glad somebody sent you my way (So sweet and tender)
'Cause you're so sweet I could never imagine somebody like you
(So glad we're makin' love)

So glad that we're making love, baby (So sweet and tender)
So (So glad we made it girl)
So wonderful baby
I'm in love with you baby (So sweet and tender)
I love you baby
