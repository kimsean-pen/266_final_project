We make an end
It seems short-sighted
But in all defense
We were pretty damn young and unspent
Making choices with our innocence
And October ends
We grow closer to our other friends
Where I sat beside you
I sit now, reflect
And walk by buildings
Til it makes no sense

And I know you should take yourself
Feel the rhythm life goes on again
Though I ain't sure it's really how we meant
I'll feel settled in a simple sense
'Cause I think of you
Less and less

See the grey fruit moon
By the willows
Where you clutched my youth
I recall the end we always knew
We drift apart
But it's the right way through
Yes, I know

You should take yourself
Feel the rhythm life goes on again
Though I ain't sure it's really how we meant
I'll feel settled in a simple sense
'Cause I think of you
Less and less

And though it's fading with time
I remember the warm nights
With love in your eyes
Passing the days
Watching rains as it dries
Staring at your eyes
I know it's the time

When you should take yourself
See the daylight and the change that spins
Though I ain't sure I'll ever feel nothing
I'll feel settled in a simple sense
'Cause I think of you
Less and less

'Cause I think of you
Less and less
