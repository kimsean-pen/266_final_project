When you've arrived then you go
You don't want to live like a real gone Eskimo
Or maybe you do

I scan the corners
Spun the metal globe
Pointed down the index
It knows where to go

Tested, invested waters
Move local as you know
When the idea of fast can be
Excruciatingly slow
Excruciatingly so

Moving units, testing time
Saying nothing, make it rhyme
All in preparation for
My future in Barcelona

When playing the bull in the ring
Don't wanna freeze like a spider in a spotlight
Or maybe you do

I've crossed the borders
Dodged the customs probes
Diving the under current
To know where it flows

Studied current trends
Thought global as I am told
On local streets
Anticipating them gold
Cause that's what I've always been told

Moving units, testing time
Saying nothing, make it rhyme
All in preparation for
My future in Barcelona

Moving units, testing time
Saying nothing, make it rhyme
All in preparation for
My future in Barcelona

Moving units, testing time
Saying nothing, make it rhyme
All in preparation for
My future in Barcelona

It's time tested
And a successful proven hiatus
They always beat us
