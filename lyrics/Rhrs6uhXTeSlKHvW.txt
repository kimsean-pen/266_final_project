Come, sleep, nothing's changing
I'll be right here by your side
Great teens, colors fading
In the stillness of the night

You're thick-skinned, but it seems
You're hiding in daydreams
Can't find our way to the light
And when this routine ends, through nights and weekends
We'll see daylight through the blinds

Drifting in a cold state, the glowing cracks of old days,
Bodies slack and pressed beneath the hour in your eyes
Fingernails and cold skin, your parents' bed we lay in,
arms outstretched to emptiness, the space you left behind

Go to sleep nothing's changing
I'll be right here by your side
Tear the seams, we're not aging
Beneath these trembling starlit skies

You're thick-skinned, but you know
It's beyond our control
Shadows gleaming through our eyes
Been living the past, dear
Be free from those dull years
And we'll see daylight through the blinds

Drifting in a cold state, the glowing cracks of old days,
Bodies slack and pressed beneath the hour in your eyes
Fingernails and cold skin, your parents' bed we lay in
arms outstretched to emptiness, the space you left behind

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
