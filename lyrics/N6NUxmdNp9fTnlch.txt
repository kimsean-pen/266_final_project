Those were last nights having you
Smoked another Camel blue
Your apartment was my world
A lightball with the stars, the fire burn like our HEARTS
Time would pass without a trace,
Watch the sunset on your face
Making love as MORNING comes,
Whispers something worn
Wanting more and more and more
I still feel your KISSES breath with PEPPERMINT

Can't forget this interview, let it linger
No one ever came closer, your movements in the dark
Does it hurt to be apart?!

Don't say it's over
Don't say it's over
Don't say!
Don't say it's over
Don't say it's over
Don't say!

Don't say it's over
Don't say it's over
Don't say!
Don't say it's over
Don't say it's over
Don't say!

Don't say it's over
Don't say it's over
Don't say!
Don't say it's over
Don't say it's over
Don't say!

Something in your touch was different,
I still feel your KISSES burn with PEPPERMINT
There was something in your touch that felt different
I still feel your KISSES burn with PEPPERMINT
Something in your touch was different,
I still feel your KISSES burn with PEPPERMINT
There was something in your touch that felt different
I still feel your KISSES burn with PEPPERMINT
