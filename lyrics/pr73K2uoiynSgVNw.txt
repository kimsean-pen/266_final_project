I'm on the road
I been here so long
Just like one of them stars in the black sky

I'm on the road
I've drunk from skulls
I'm on the road
I've covered myself in bones

And I've kissed life
And I've embraced Death
I've ridden love, love
I've ridden love to its very last breath

I'm on the road (he's on the road)
And I've seen the light
I'm on the road (he's on the road)
Many souls have passed me by
I felt the wonder, the wonder, the wonder
Been washed up by the tide
I've ridden love, love
I've ridden love over to the other side

(I'm on the road)

I've killed the gods
The spirit has entered within me
And all my love, oh my love
Is where I end and where I begin

I'm on the road

And you gotta take it down to the wire
There's no mercy in this eternal fire
