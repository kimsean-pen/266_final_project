Just for now (x6)

It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside
If just for a little while
Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
I'm secretly on your side

How did you know?
It's what I always wanted
You can never have had too many of these
Will ya quit kicking me under the table?
I'm trying, will somebody make her
Shut up about it?
Can we settle down please?

It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside
If just for a little while
Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
I'm secretly on your side

Bite tongue
Deep breaths
Count to ten
Nod your head

(sniff sniff)
I think something's burning
Now you've ruined the whole thing
Muffle the smoke alarm
Whoever put on this music
Had better quick sharp remove it
Pour me another
Oh, don't wag your finger at me

It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside
If just for a little while
Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
I'm secretly on your side

Get me out of here (x12)

Just for now...
