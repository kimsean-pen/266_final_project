I bring the weather with me

It's time to lay my head down, I can hear the weeping song
There are sirens in the distance as the church bells sound along
Mourning ushers in the rain, clouds are heavy like their hearts
I sing to them their weeping song until their world is dark

We are all stars in the sky, we all shimmer then decay
So I wonder: did I burn out, make a mark, or fade away?

Will you miss me when I'm gone?
I am the storm that never leaves
Will you miss me when I'm gone?
I bring the, I bring the weather with me

I'm the ship in the bottle, rain pouring down on me
I sing songs for my funeral that I will never see
You were my shining light, oh, you were heaven sent
But now I'm not afraid of leaving, not of God and not of Death

We are all stars in the sky, we all shimmer then decay
So I wonder: did I burn out, make a mark, or fade away?

Will you miss me when I'm gone?
I am the storm that never leaves
Will you miss me when I'm gone?
I bring the, I bring the weather with me

Place the pennies on my eyes
I'll sleep with the stars tonight
Place the pennies on my eyes
I'll sleep with the stars tonight
Place the pennies on my eyes
I'll sleep with the stars tonight
Place the pennies on my eyes
I'll sleep with the stars tonight

Will you miss me when I'm gone?
I am the storm that never leaves
Will you miss me when I'm gone?
I bring the, I bring the weather with me
