Young, young, young

Young and old, gather round
Have you heard
My latest sound
This was ringing
Down the house
Down, down,
Down the house
Girls and queens
And in-betweens
In miniskirts, skinny jeans
If you're with me
Let me hear you scream
Scream, scream like a queen

We're turning off
Our telephone
'Cause we can
Party all night long
And know no one
Ccan tell us no
We'll do what we want
We'll play this
Game in our own way
And treat life like a holiday
Show the world
We're here to stay
Keep going strong

This one's for all my girls
Ladies around the world
You know what you deserve
Together, we'll triumph

This one's for all my girls
Ladies around the world
You know what you deserve
Together, we'll triumph

Together, we'll triumph

We're turning off
Our telephone
'Cause we can party
All night long
And we're about to
Steal the show
We'll triumph
We'll live like we're
On holiday
It ain't your
Problem anyway
When all the girls
Come out to play
We'll triumph

This is it, now's the time
Time for them to see us shine
We're about to cross the line
Cross, cross, cross the line
Your beauty queens
From silver screens
Cover girls from magazines
Let's fulfill our wildest dreams
Wild, wild, wildest dreams

Show the goddess underneath
Wear your heart
Upon your sleeve
We might go down in history
As we shake down this town
Let's be who we
Were meant to be
Get their R-E-S-P-E-C-T
And if you feel
The same as me
Then sing it out loud

This one's for all my girls
Ladies around the world
You know what you deserve
Together, we'll triumph

This one's for all my girls
Ladies around the world
You know what you deserve
Together, we'll triumph

Together, we'll triumph

We're turning off
Our telephone
'Cause we can
Party all night long
And we're about
To steal the show
We'll triumph
We'll live like
We're on holiday
It ain't your
Problem anyway
When all the girls
Come out to play
We'll triumph

Together, we'll triumph
