You say you needed someone
But you just needed somewhere to stay
Oh any other time
Any other time
I'd have told you to be right on your way
You say you needed a friend
But you just needed sympathy
Oh any other time
Any other time
I'd have told you just to let me be
But I was so alone
So alone.

Don't say you love me baby
Don't say you love me
Don't say you love me
'cause I know it would be just a lie.

I lost the warmth in my life
And you came and helped me up
When I was down
Oh any other time
Any other time
I'd have let you carry on
Fooling around
I let you into my home
And I even let you into my heart
Oh but any other time
Any other time
I'd have let you carry on
From the very start
But I was so sad and blue
And I just didn't know what to do

Don't say you love me baby
Don't say you love me
Don't say you love me
'cause I know it would be just a lie.

Time
Has told me what I need to know
Time
Has showed me now what love is for
Time
Keeps telling me that I have got to go
Yeah I needed someone
But that time's gone
Now baby I'm gonna try and do it
All on my own.

So don't say you love me
Don't say you love me
Don't say you love me
'cause I know it would be just a lie.

Don't say you love me baby
Don't say you love me
Oh don't say that you love me
'cause I know it would be just a lie
I don't want you to tell me that you love me
Because I know, because I know
Yeah I know, yes I know
I know that it would be just a lie
