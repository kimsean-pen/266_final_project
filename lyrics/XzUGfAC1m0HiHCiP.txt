You're the kind of friend
Who always bends when i'm broken
Like, remember when
You took my heart and put it back together again

I've been wasting time with clueless guys
But now it's over let me tell you why I'm through
I've got someone new he's just like you
You're it

You're the ultimate
It's automatic I'm sure of it
No lie so don't even try
To tell me that you're not the guy

'Cause I've been waiting all my life
For someone just like you
But you're it
You're the ultimate

You

You're the kind of guy who's hand in mine
Sends shivers up and down my spine

You took my heart and put it back together again
You're the kind of guy
That blows my mind
And now it's my turn

You've been right in front of me
Everything I need why didn't I see?
You're it
You're the ultimate

It's automatic I'm sure of it
No lie so don't even try
To tell me that you're not the guy
'Cause I've been waiting all my life

For someone just like you
But you're it
You're the ultimate
You

You're it
You're the ultimate
It's automatic I'm sure of it

No lie so don't even try
To tell me that you're not the guy
You're it
You're the ultimate

It's automatic I'm sure of it
No lie so don't even try
To tell me that you're not the guy
'Cause I've been waiting all my life
For someone just like you
But you're it
You're the ultimate
You
You're it
You're the ultimate
You
