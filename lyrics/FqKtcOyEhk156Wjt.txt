Farewell
It's long gone, gone away
Words were almost lost and gone
I felt it was far away, even if it was near
I felt I could reach at least
Ready made answers are here, sitting like a guidepost
And always tries to deliver
I turn away from those kinds of things
Go up and go my will
Just wave a good-bye
Farewell
