Now you don't have to say a word
Cause I can feel it
I can see right through your eyes

So you only want the wrong thing
But I can't give you
Well it comes to me as no surprise

I see the look on your face
The movements you make

I know you just can't figure me out
But don't you worry bout me

It's you that i need
I'm not afraid to scream and shout

That my love grows in the dark
My love grows in the dark

Take me away just take me there
Or give me your love just pretend to care

That my love grows in the dark
My love grows in the dark

Tonight is not forever
Dont believe what you heard

Tonight was made for you and me
And all the things we want to feel

Make your move
If you've got something to prove

I wanna know you inside and out
Cause im not joking, i never do
Have i given you a reason to doubt

That my love grows in the dark
My love grows in the dark

Seal the deal before its to late
I've got alot to give and i cant wait

Because my love grows in the dark
My love, my love, my love
My love, my love

I shaved my head, what else is new
Nothing compares
To you you you you you
