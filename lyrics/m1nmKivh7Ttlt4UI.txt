Home
Reflections of eyes shine bright
In my mind, remind me
I long
to be cold and feel alive
For that's what inspires me
Home
to be free, just to breathe
only seen in the eyes that know me
Home
like a dream, out of reach,
I can't see through the film that clouds it

Memories fade to dust
Slowly losing touch

To belong is the feeling I want
Is it wrong to miss the time that we had?
Now it's gone
Didn't plan for this
Home is where my heart is
It's the feeling I want
Is it wrong to miss the time that we had?
Now it's gone
Didn't plan for this
Home is where my heart is

Home
Used to wish to be gone,
To be far from the ones who choked me
Now
All I want is to hear, to be near,
Feel them all surround me

Memories fade to grey
Take me to the place

Where I belong, it's the feeling I want
Is it wrong to miss the time that we had?
Now it's gone
Didn't plan for this
Home is where my heart is
It's the feeling I want
Is it wrong to miss the time that we had?
Now it's gone
Didn't plan for this
Home is where my heart is

I'm grateful for the chance that is mine
So I'll cherish every second of time

To belong is the feeling I want
Is it wrong to miss the time that we had?
Now it's gone
Didn't plan for this
Home is where my heart is
It's the feeling I want
Is it wrong to miss the time that we had?
Now it's gone
Didn't plan for this
Home is where my heart is

Didn't plan for this
Home is where my heart is
