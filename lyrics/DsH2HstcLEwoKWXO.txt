I've got a feeling in my gut there's more than this
More than I've heard, and more than you're telling

One day, we're gonna burst right out of here
Get out of this town, not know where we're heading

You count on luck, somehow it won't add up
And what you have, just has to be enough

I feel knocked down but I won't be broken, I won't be broken
My spirit's reeling, but my arms are open, I won't be broken

And straining at the least you'd be a better man
But each time I try to climb I start sliding
Some days I think someone's trying to keep me down
But no it's just my own fear that I'm fighting

I need you now like I never did
I need something that only you can give

I feel knocked down but I won't be broken, I won't be broken
My spirit's reeling, but my arms are open, I won't be broken

You count on luck, somehow it won't add up
And what you have, just has to be enough

I feel knocked down but I won't be broken, I won't be broken
My spirit's reeling, but my arms are open, I won't be broken
Got a feeling someday you and I- you're gonna blow this town wide open
Got a hunger snapping at my heels, my mind that can't be changed- the wheel
That won't be broken
