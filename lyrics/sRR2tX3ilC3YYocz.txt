You say you love me and you're thinkin' of me
But you know you could be wrong
You say you told me that you want to hold me
But you know you're not that strong

I just can't do what I've done before
I just can't beg you anymore
I'm gonna let you pass
And I'll go last

Then time will tell
Just who has fell
And who's been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine

You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me
But you know sometimes you lie
You say you're shakin' and you're always achin'
But you know how hard you try

Sometimes it gets so hard to care
It can't be this way everywhere
And I'm gonna let you pass
Yes, and I'll go last

Then time will tell
Who has fell
And who's been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine

Well, the judge, he holds a grudge
He's gonna call on you
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts
Watch out he don't fall on you

You say you're sorry for tellin' stories
That you know I believe are true
You say you got some other kind of lover
And yes, I believe you do

You say my kisses are not like his
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is
I'm just gonna let you pass
Yes, and I'll go last

And time will tell
Who has fell
And who's been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine
