I do not understand.
The things I've been given in life aren't there.
And everything seems against me all the time.
I dont know how to stand up.
But I've got faith in myself, and all of the things I do.
I don't need no one else, to tell me what I can do.

If you don't realize, all of the things your life can do.
You will be left behind, swept up by the storm of those you knew.

I'm just out here chillin' with my fam peeps,
you don't understand me
If you listen to my songs just a little bit deeper,
you might release my dreams
or might release my inner demons,
that's just a little scary
cause I don't know them, but they all know me
and that's just a little weird so i'll keep that to myself
I don't have any real hype right now
I don't even have a real mic right now but
I'm just singing on my laptop cause I want to
I swear no one else can stop you so, just do what you want to
just do what you want, yeah.
just do what you want to,
you know that you want to

If you don't realize, all of the things your life can do.
You will be left behind, swept up by the storm of those you knew.
