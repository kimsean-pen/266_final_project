I was born an April fool
Full of gold to a brothel

And saved all my sins!

I don't care if you and I are naked bare
And wrapped up in the sun
All I need is one one one one one one one one
one one one one one one one ...

I don't know where I've been, what I've done
I am the once now irreplaceable son whoaaaa!
I'm antichrist in your home
I'll come around this time to lay it sck from my soul
Let me go

And I have time, those blinking lights
Controlled my sight and blinded me in spite
And I waited here for you (here)

I don't care, the salvaged prayer
But a dent so big comes once a few years
And again I'm left to wait for you

And I don't know where I was going
I tried again to break you down for everyone's know
Crying, let me go back to my failures
And come around this time to stop and finally let go
Let me go!

(Ooooh oooooh)

Leaves are dead but I am here
Waiting on another good year
I hope we don't lose it all here

I tried once, I tried twice and I'm done
I am the once and irreplaceable son
I've got that rock and that roll
I've come around this time to set fire to your bone

I tried once, I tried twice, I am done
I am the once now and irreplaceable son
I've got that rock and that roll
I've come around this time to set fire to your homes
And let you go!
