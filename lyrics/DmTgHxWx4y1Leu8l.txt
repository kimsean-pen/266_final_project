I ran out of dreams and now
I sit inside my room and think
These tolls wait on my backyard
Candle-lit lights, I try to sleep

I only half-figured it out
I only half-figured it out

In my room, my soul consumed
By things that haven't happened yet
Sunlight drips in, night-time slips in
And I'm still here overthinking

I only half-figured it out
I'm only gonna let you down
