I used to adore you
The lies made sense somehow
Gave myself away without a fight
But betrayal claims its price
At first I was scared
Not used to a murderer's mind
But there was something beautiful
So powerful, so definite, so divine

Pushing the faith...
Built out of rage

Falling ideals
Broken seals
March to the shore
You are a killer!

Is it something that's always been there?
Was it destined to leave its cage?
Oh, I'm glad we met though
I love to release the rage
But everything has its end
And I've done my deed
The final bullet was always meant for me

Pushing the faith...
Built out of rage

Falling ideals
Broken seals
March to the shore
You are a killer!

But everything has its end
I've done my deed
The final bullet - always meant for me

Falling ideals
Broken seals
March to the shore
You are a killer!

Falling ideals
Broken seals
March to the shore
You are a killer!
