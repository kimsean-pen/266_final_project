Wake slumbering giant
Melt and show remorse
among the gods we are
you had it all wrong.
I'll wait, watch, wonder, and weep.
I'll scream until the sobs flow
Until Europa swells again
Breathe
Breathe and the sea will teem with life
Breathe and the land will sink into a flow
Wake you slumbering satellite
Wake you satellite wake
Among gods you scream, wait, watch, and wonder.
What have you of Time?
How many cycles?
How many years since descending
You're the last of your kind
The last... 'O little prince'
Sleep
