Seems I've got to have a change of scene
'Cause every night I have the strangest dream
Imprisoned by the way it could have been
Left here on my own or so it seems
I've got to leave before I start to scream
But someone's locked the door and took the key

You feelin' alright?
I'm not feelin' too good myself
Well, you feelin' alright?
I'm not feelin' too good myself, oh yeah

Well, boy you sure took me for one big ride
And even now I sit and wonder why
That when I think of you I start to cry
I just can't waste my time, I must keep dry
Gotta stop believin' in all your lies
'Cause there's too much to do before I die

You feelin' alright?
I'm not feelin' too good myself, oh yeah
Well, you feelin' alright?
I'm not feelin' too good myself, wait for me yeah

Alright, yeah

Don't get too lost in all I say
Though at the time I really felt that way
But that was then and now it's today
I can't get off yet and so I'm here to stay
'Til someone comes along and takes my place
With a different name, yes, a different face

You feelin' alright?
I'm not feelin' too good myself
Well, you feelin' alright?
I'm not feelin' too good myself, alright

You feelin' alright?
I'm not feelin' too good myself
Well I hope you feelin' alright
I'm not feelin' too good myself

Oh, you feelin' alright?
I'm not feelin' too good myself
Well, I hope you feelin' alright

Alright
Alright
Alright
