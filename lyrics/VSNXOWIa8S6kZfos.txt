You were just a fire, burning in the rain
Looked at you and I got turnt
Blinded by desire, caught up in the flame
Let you in and I got burned

Such a fool to think you changed
Never shown me love, just another drug
Someone to heal your pain
Such a foolish thing to say
Never want to grow up, you were just a burden
Burning in the rain

I don't wanna go down in your fire, fire
Down in your fire
I don't wanna go down in your fire, fire, fire
Down in your fire, fire

You were just a fire, I've gone through pain
Took it all to no return
Blinded by desire, caught up in the flame
Let you in and I got burned

Such a fool to think you changed
Never shown me love, just another drug
Someone to heal your pain
Such a foolish thing to say
Never want to grow up, you were just a burden
Burning in the rain

I don't wanna go down in your fire, fire
Down in your fire
I don't wanna go down in your fire, fire, fire
Down in your fire
I don't wanna go down in your fire, fire
Down in your fire
I don't wanna go down in your fire, fire, fire
Fire
