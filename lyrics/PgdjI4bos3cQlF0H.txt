When I ran from the hounds of hell
Twisted my foot, I nearly fell
I was lucky, I was alive
One look back I could have died

I was the sole survivor
Sole survivor
Sole survivor
Solitary fighter

When I saw it I was amazed
One time glory right in my gaze
I saw the sorrow, I saw the joy
Right in the darkness none could destroy

I was the sole survivor
Sole survivor
Sole survivor
Solitary fighter

And from the wreckage I will arise
Cast the ashes back in their eyes
See the fire, I will defend
Just keep on burning right to the end

I was the sole survivor
Sole survivor
Sole survivor
Sole survivor

Sole survivor
Sole survivor
Sole survivor
Sole survivor
Sole survivor
Sole survivor
Sole survivor
