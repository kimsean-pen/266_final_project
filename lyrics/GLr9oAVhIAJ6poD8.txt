At the doorway of my heart
All the leaves are falling down
And though I try to pick them up
There's so many I think I'll drown

Ten days have come and gone
Ten days and I'm all alone
And all that I can do is pray, and pray

Ten days I've seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day
But all I gotta do is pray, and pray
And pray

At a doorway of my life
I feel the pain, but feel no shame
What I've got, I keep inside
Some things have changed, but I'm still the same

Ten days have come and gone
Ten days and I'm all alone
And all that I can do is pray, and pray

Ten days I've seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day
But all I gotta do is pray, and pray
(That's right) And pray

And if you're goin' my way
Don't think that I'll bend
'Cause this is where I'll stand
I think it's the end

Ten days have come and gone
Ten days and I'm all alone
And all that I can do is pray, and pray

Ten days I've seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day
But all I gotta do is pray, and pray

Ten days have come and gone
Ten days and I'm not alone
And all that I have to do is pray, and pray

Ten days there's no rain
Comin' down on a sunny day
And all that I do is pray, and pray
And pray
Ten days
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
