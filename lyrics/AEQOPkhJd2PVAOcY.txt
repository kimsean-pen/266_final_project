It's been a great ride but here we sit tonight
The look in her eyes says something's wrong
This ain't a wild bull, it's just a bar stool
But it's all I can do to just hang on
And George Strait's on the jukebox in the corner
Singing about cowboys riding away, but

This ain't my first rodeo
Someone's gonna get hurt
Whenever someone says we need to talk
It feels like there's a number
Pinned on to the back of my shirt
'Cause this is where the cowboy gets bucked off
Yeah, this is where the cowboy gets bucked off

You can go to Houston, Vegas or San Antonio
And watch a bull rider hit the dirt
Or head down to this bar for a little cover charge
You can watch me get thrown by her
George Strait's on the jukebox again
Says if I leave now I can still make Cheyenne, but

This ain't my first rodeo
Someone's gonna get hurt
So hey bartender, give me one more jug
It feels like there's a number
Pinned on to the back of my shirt
'Cause this is where the cowboy gets bucked off
Yeah, this is where the cowboy gets bucked off

I think about those nights in Marina Del Rey
As this beautiful cowgirl slips away
But the pain only lasts so long
And when you get bucked off you get back on

It feels like there's a number
Pinned on to the back of my shirt
'Cause this is where the cowboy gets bucked off
Yeah, this is where the cowboy gets bucked off
