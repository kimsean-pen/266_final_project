Down Hearted man where do you come from
You're troubled by the world and your situation
How can you justify what's so clear in your eyes
The operator is gone

Through all your contemplation you still don't understand
That the plight of your life was built by your own hands
How can you navigate the maze in your medicated haze
While the operator is gone

You've got the cure for your disease growing in your backyard, whoa
You've got the answers that you need right up in your backyard, whoa

Downtrodden man how do you feel right
You complicate it through your western made sight
How can you justify what's so clear in your eyes
That you don't wanna go on

Through all your contemplation you haven't found a way
To your own salvation the start of a new day
I know you feel the pain as you walk alone
And you just wanna go home

You've got the cure for your disease growing in your backyard, whoa
You've got the answers that you need right up in your backyard, whoa
You've got the cure for your disease growing in your backyard, whoa
You've got the answers that you need right up in your backyard, whoa

So think of your true self, break it down
Remember there's still hope that can be found
Hold on to the dream that once was so clear
And let go of your fear

Realize that this is one train you can't get off
Your dependency grows as your mind gets soft
Unlock the doors and let your soul back in
And wake up, wake up, wake up

Ho, cure for your disease growing in your backyard, whoa
You've got the answers that you need right up in your backyard, whoa

You got the cure, you got the cure, you got the cure
You got the cure, you got the cure, got the cure
To wake up, wake up, wake up
