Stop!
oooh, oooh

With your feet in the air and your head on the ground
you try this trick and spin it, yeah
your head will collapse
and there's nothing in it
and you'll ask yourself

Way out in the water

I was swimmin' in the carribean
animals were hiding behind the rocks, yeah
except the little fish
but they told me, he swears
tryin' to talk to me to me to me
Where is my mind x4
Way out in the water
see her swimmin'
With your feet in the air and your head on the ground
try this trick and spin it, yeah
your head will collapse
if there's nothing in it
and you'll ask yourself
Where is my mind x4
Way out in the water
see her swimmin'
Oooh, oooh
oooh, oooh
