I'm walking young and strong
But just a little too thin
I may be happy but I haven't clue
to this life in my mind

Stay with me
We could learn to fight
like every good boy should
Cling to me
We are blacked out in visions of China
Tonight

I'm building heroes again
I never thought of before
I remember the fashion but don't have a clue
to your life in my mind

Stay with me
We could learn to fight
Like every good boy should
Cling to me
We are blacked out in visions of China
Tonight

We walk backwards say nothing
My visions of China
We're young and strong in this party
We're building our visions of China

We walk backwards say nothing
Visions of China
We're young and strong in this party
We're building our visions of China
We walk backwards say nothing
Our visions of China

We're young and strong in this party
We're building our visions of China
