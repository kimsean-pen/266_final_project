Another day all alone again
Someone please love me
Another game another broken heart
Why do I do this to myself
I could look and try to find someone who won't leave me lonely
Then I found I didn't need to search
'Cause you were the one and you came to me
You fought for my heart and you have won it
You've taken me over and I like that
I tried other love but I couldn't feel it
I'm so glad you found me because
I need you so close to me
'Cause you're the only one who makes my life complete
(Oh Lord I) I know it took so long to see
You are my security
You won't go away from me
And now I know that I don't ever have to worry
'Cause my heart feels so very free
You're my security
You're my security
You're my security
Another day here I go again, drive my self insane
Stop to think how could I forget
You're with me every single day
Now I look and I see the world
You're the only one for me
'Cause I don't need to search for a way to try to be more
I found a love that is so secure
You fought for my heart and you have won it
You've taken me over and I like that
I tried other love but I couldn't feel it
I'm so glad you found me because
Other relationships confuse me
The thought of a simple love is crazy
You make me feel like no one has loved me before
I need you so close to me
'Cause you're the only one who makes my life complete
(Oh Lord I) I know it took so long to see
You are my security
You won't go away from me
And now I know that I don't ever have to worry
'Cause my heart feels so very free
You are my security
I need you so close to me
'Cause you're the only one who makes my life complete
(Oh Lord I) I know it took so long to see
You are my security
You won't go away from me
And now I know that I don't have ever to worry
'Cause my heart feels so very free
You are my security
I need you so close to me
'Cause you're the only one who makes my life complete
(Oh Lord I) I know it took so long to see
You are my security
You won't go away from me
And now I know that I don't ever have to worry
'Cause my heart feels so very free
You are my security
I need you so close to me
'Cause you're the only one who makes my life complete
I know it took so long to see
You are my security
You won't go away from me
And now I know that I don't ever have to worry
My heart feels so very free
You are my security
