In a cloud of mania
Taking me up, taking me up and putting me down
I had a glimpse of Eureka
Chewing me up, chewing me up and spitting me out

-Jected, I was rejected
I wasn't good enough to be elected
Lava, it was like lava
Moving through my body like fire
-Jected, I was rejected
I wasn't good enough to be elected
Watch me take over the spotlight

I will be all the rage tonight
Watch me shimmy into the light
Filled with fury and starry eyed
I will be all the rage

Give my regards to Mary Lou
Cheering me up, cheering me up when I was blue
Only the babysitter knew
Nobody else, nobody else, had even a clue, even a clue, no

-Jected, I was rejected
I wasn't good enough to be elected
Lava, it was like lava
Moving through my body like fire
-Jected, I was rejected
I wasn't good enough to be elected
Watch me take over the spotlight

I will be all the rage tonight
Watch me shimmy into the light
Filled with fury and starry eyed
I will be all the rage

Hey, oh, all right
Alright, I will be all the rage

-Jected, I was rejected
I wasn't good enough to be elected
Lava, it was like lava
Moving through my body like fire
-Jected, I was rejected
I wasn't good enough to be elected
Watch me take over the spotlight

I will be all the rage tonight
Watch me shimmy into the light
Filled with fury and starry eyed
I will be all the rage
