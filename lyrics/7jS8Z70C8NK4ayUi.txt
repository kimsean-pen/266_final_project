Why are you the one

I can't lose

What's the reason that I'm here again it's crazy
I keep waiting but I'm foolish cause you'll never change
Wasted all my time and here I am still crying over you
Over you

Loving you was so hard
(But I keep Trying Baby)
I just end of with scars
(Cause I keep fighting Baby)
Loving you is like a battle that I can't afford to lose
I can't lose

But I'm asking you
Why are you the only thing that I care about
Why are you the only thing that I care about
Why are you the only thing I think about
Why are you the only one

Baby you're no good for me, no
You can be, You can be, You can, You can be the only one
You can be, You can be, You can, You can be the only one

And though I hate it
Hate it that I can't forget you
I try my best but I'm a mess cause I can't shake you
Wanna call ya but my pride won't let it get the best of me
The best of me, no

Loving you was so hard
(But I keep Trying Baby)
I just end of with scars
(Cause I keep fighting Baby)
Loving you is like a battle that I can't afford to lose
I can't lose

But I'm asking you
Why are you the only thing that I care about
Why are you the only thing that I care about
Why are you the only thing I think about
Why are you the only one

Baby you're no good for me, no
You can be, You can be, You can, You can be the only one
You can be, You can be, You can, You can be the only one

No, can't believe that I'm still crying
And no, It ain't because I ain't been trying
(Losing sleep cause I can't help but think about the past)
And how we didn't last
How we didn't last

Why are you the only thing that I care about
Why are you the only thing that I care about
Why are you the only thing I think about
Why are you the only one

Baby you're no good for me, no
You can be, You can be, You can, You can be the only one
You can be, You can be, You can, You can be the only one

Why are you the only thing that I care about
Why are you the only thing that I care about
Why are you the only thing I think about
Why are you the only one

Baby you're no good for me, no
You can be, You can be, You can, You can be the only one
You can be, You can be, You can, You can be the only one
