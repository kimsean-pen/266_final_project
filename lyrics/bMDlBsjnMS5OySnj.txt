Red it is time for action
Time for us to play our part
If we unite what's divided
We tighten the social knot
Now is the moment to destroy
All that tears us apart
Not all the problems can be solved with a gunshot

Union The path of globality
Reason the crown of humanity
Red planet, Red sky
This world ends in a blast
Red planet, Red sky
We're one people at last (At last)

Finally we found a way
To resolve the argument around which to revolve
Our global quest for harmony
Is the pinnacle of our society
Yes in each other we trust
And we do what we must
Red dust under our feet
We're blessed to be cursed
We enlist to resist

Union The path of globality
Reason the crown of humanity
Red planet, Red sky
This world ends in a blast
Red planet, Red sky
We're one people at last

We want more
Currently we inherit privileges
That once were attributed to the elite
Certainly we become better than they ever were
Right, to do whatever we want
Pride. We are who we wanted to be
Wide, there are no more borders
Once we're together

Red planet, Red sky
This world ends in a blast
Red planet, Red sky
We're one people at last

Red planet, Red sky
This world ends in a blast
Red planet, Red sky
We're one people at last
Red planet Red Sky
One people, one people at last
