Although I like the taste of something new
I know that I could get used to you
But maybe I'm afraid 'cause I can never say, never say
Say that we're more, more than just friends
My shoulder's cold, but it's just a defense
I say that I'll see you, but I never say when
'Cause I don't wanna make the same mistake again

I don't need to learn the lesson
I don't need to know the reason
'Cause they only make it worse
I don't need to learn the lesson
Tell me if we're gonna do this
Are we gonna make it work?
'Cause lessons in love hurts, yes
'Cause lessons in love hurts

I'm tired of defeat, promised myself
That I would never let another in
Till I can really tell until they proved themselves
Proved themselves
So we can be more than, more than just friends
So I believe in that feeling again
So when you ask me I don't have to pretend
Knowing that it's you and me until the end

I don't need to learn the lesson
I don't need to know the reason
'Cause they only make it worse
I don't need to learn the lesson
Tell me if we're gonna do this
Are we gonna make it work?
'Cause lessons in love hurts, yeah
'Cause lessons in love hurts, they hurt

Tell me if you got the recipe
Tell me if you find the rest of me
Loosing myself to all the others
Messing me up, can you make it up to me?
Tell me if your love can go that far
It's better if you show me who you are
'Cause I never wanna learn the lesson

I don't need to learn the lesson
I don't need to know the reason
'Cause they only make it worse
I don't need to learn the lesson
Tell me if we're gonna do this
Are we gonna make it work?
'Cause lessons in love hurts, yes
'Cause lessons in love hurts, mm
