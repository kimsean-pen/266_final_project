Love is a catastrophe
Look what it's done to me
Brought me down here so low
stranded, nowhere to go

No concentration
just rerunning conversation
Trying to understand
how I fell into this quicksand

What happens next?
With life I'm unimpressed
Pain like a cutter's knife
Never been lonelier in my life

Who issued the instruction
for this mad act of destruction?
An end to equilibrium
Fate laughs:
Look what we've done to him!

High wind through the trees
Falling November leaves
A weak sun hanging low
Summer seems so long ago

All my former dreams
tender romantic schemes
revealed as so naive
To think I could believe

In love as the kindest law
not as a declaration of war
on my life and sanity
Now I know at last for me
love is a catastrophe
