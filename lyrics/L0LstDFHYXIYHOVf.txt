You come, I go
When I'm high, you're low (lo-w)
Taking shots on the frontline
Not love, but we had the time

You're such a fool but so am I (La la la)
I'm maybe twisted, you're unkind (La la la)
I wanna know what's on your mind (La la la)
You do the same thing every night (La la la)

We're falling to pieces
All of the pieces come undone
We're falling to pieces
All of the pieces one by one

Falling to Pieces
One by one

Kind of silver line, intend gold
Another story untold
Why do we even try?
Not outta love, but we had the time

You're such a fool but so am I (La la la)
I'm maybe twisted, you're unkind (La la la)
I wanna know what's on your mind (La la la)
You do the same thing every night (La la la)

We're falling to pieces
All of the pieces come undone
We're falling to pieces
All of the pieces one by one

Falling to Pieces (La La La)
Falling to Pieces (La La La)
One by one

Da da da!
Da da da!
Bum bum!

You're such a fool but so am I (La la la)
I'm maybe twisted, you're unkind (La la la)
I wanna know what's on your mind (La la la)
You do the same thing every night (La la la)

We're falling to pieces
All of the pieces come undone
We're falling to pieces
All of the pieces one by one

Falling to Pieces
Falling to Pieces
One by one
Falling to Pieces
Falling to Pieces
