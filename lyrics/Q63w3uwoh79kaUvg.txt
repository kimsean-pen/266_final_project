Hold my breath before I take a helping hand
'Cause I've seen death that only you can understand
Am I gonna survive when I'm out in the wild, am I gonna belong?
Am I gonna believe, am I gonna stay or am I gonna go?
Walked on wires as long as I've recalled your name
Stayed my tone for fear of sounding all the same
And you're beckoning me,
will you ever retreat, will you let me forget?
Am I there in your mind? Ditchin' every time that you've got to admit
No more, no less
This time it's best
If I just look the other way
I found my home
I'll drift alone
Doesn't matter what you say
Eyes up, ink down
I write you out
Of past and present, future days
I'll go, I'm gone
You wait, you fall
Where you land is where you live
Hold my breath before I take a helping hand
'Cause I've seen death that only you can understand
Am I gonna survive when I'm out in the wild, am I gonna belong?
Am I gonna believe, am I gonna stay or am I gonna go?
