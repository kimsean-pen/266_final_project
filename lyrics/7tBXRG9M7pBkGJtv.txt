There's always something you won't dare to say
your good intentions, are boring, take me away
if it keeps you sane, well then it's ok
but, if I played it safe, would it save me?

I'd like to get some rest now, if I can just ignore the truth
scratching at my window, this time I got to make a move
ego ibliteration, stand back and watch me melt away
dissolve all recognition

but, I got to, Burn this wait, out of my mind
running through my veins, until I dissapear

This feeling is over, this felling is over me

There's always something, you won't dare to say
(Climbing up my wall, gonna creep between the cracks,
get out on my skull, tie the rope around my neck)
your good intentions are boring, take me away
(Destroy all emotion, wanna rip my face to shreds
cut my eyeballs open)

you know, i got to, Burn this wait, out of my mind
running through my veins, until I dissapear

This feeling is over me.
