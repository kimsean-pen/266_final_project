I can't say I was strong before I met you
I can't say that I stood very tall
I'm not sure if you exactly gave me the courage
But you picked me up when I didn't know I was about to fall

You drove out all my tendencies and contents
Said goodbye to my shell for once and for all
You drove me to abandon the temporary but I didn't know
that you wouldn't always be here to watch me finish it off

And let me tell you that I am thankful for it every day
It may be over now, but to hell 'cause it's not too late
You had your place here but now I'm stuck carrying all the weight
But it's alright, 'cause you taught me to shoulder it

And let me tell you that I am thankful for it every day
It may be over now, but to hell 'cause it's not too late
You had your place here but now I'm stuck carrying all the weight
