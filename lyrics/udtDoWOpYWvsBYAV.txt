Marking every place I've been
Marking every place I've been (every other place I've been)
Marking every place I've been
Marking every place I've been (every other place I've been)

We are the sad escape
Too strong a ghost at will
The wrong people are the genuine
Marking every other place I've been

We are the sad escape
Too strong a ghost at will
The wrong people are the genuine
Marking every other place I've been

We are the sad escape
Too strong a ghost at will
The wrong people are the genuine
Marking every other place I've been

We are the sad escape
Too strong a ghost at will
The wrong people are the genuine
Marking every other place I've been

We are the sad escape
Too strong a ghost at will
The wrong people are the genuine
Marking every other place I've been

We are the sad escape
To stung along a ghost at will
For all those who are the genuine
Marking every other place i've been
