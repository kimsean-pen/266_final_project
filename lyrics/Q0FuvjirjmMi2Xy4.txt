Long before the colors start to bleed
I can see the painting come alive
Clever like an angel in disguise
Moving in and out of reach

If the candle lights this crooked path
Like a lighthouse peering through the haze
I will find the river through the rain
And Ill reach the waters edge

Shed your light on me
Be my eyes when I cant see
Shed your light on me
Be my guide so I can see

Like a moth burned by the fire
And driven to the flame
(Prophecy's a blessing and a curse)
I must bear this cross alone
Theres no one else to blame
With each treasure found
Another shipwrecks washed ashore
I am carried by the current
On a slow and steady course

Shed your light on me
Be my eyes when I cant see
Shed your light on me
Be my guide so I can see

What if caught in a moment
I get lost and can't find my way
What if all along I was wrong
In every turn, in every way

Would you talk me off the ledge
Or let me take the fall
Better to try and fail
Then to never try at all

You look but cannot see
Talk but never speak
You live but cannot breathe
See but dont believe

Wounds that never heal
A heart that cannot feel
A dream thats all too real
A stare as cold as steel

Ive listened to the stories of resentment and disdain
Ive looked into the empty eyes of anger, fear, and shame
Ive taken blood from every stone
And traveled every road

When I see the distant lights illuminate the night
Then I will know I am home
