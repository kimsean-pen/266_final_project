We, we don't have to worry 'bout nothing
Cause we got the fire, and we're burning one hell of a something
They, they gonna see us from outer space, outer space
Light it up, like we're the stars of the human race, human race

When the lights started out they don't know what they heard
Strike the match,
play it loud,
giving love to the world

We'll be raising our hands,
shining up to the sky

Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah we got the fire, fire, fire

And we gonna let it burn,
Yeah we're gonna let it burn,
We're gonna let it burn,
Yeah we're gonna let it burn

We don't wanna leave, no.
We just wanna be right now (right now)
And what we see
Is everybody's on the floor acting crazy, getting loco 'til the lights out

Music's on,
I'm waking up,
we stop the fire,
then we bump it up

And it's over now,
we got the love,
there's no secret now, there's no secret now

When the lights started out they don't know what they heard
Strike the match,
play it loud,
giving love to the world

We'll be raising our hands,
shining up to the sky
Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah we got the fire, fire, fire

And we gonna let it burn
Yeah we're gonna let it burn
We're gonna let it burn
Yeah we're gonna let it burn

Gonna let it burn

We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out

We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out

We can light it up, up, up

When the lights started out they don't know what they heard
Strike the match,
play it loud,
giving love to the world

We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah we got the fire, fire, fire

We're gonna let it burn
We're gonna let it burn
We're gonna let it burn
We're gonna let it burn

Yeah we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah we got the fire, fire, fire

Yeah we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah we got the fire, fire, fire
