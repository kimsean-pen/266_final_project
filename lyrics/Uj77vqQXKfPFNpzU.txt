If that's the way it's gonna be
Leave your shiny yellow key on the doorstep
And start burning up your ties
And take your coat, I guess, and the shirt right off my back
I don't mind, 'cause I'm gonna set this house on

Don't have to hit below the belt
With those leather shoes you wear so well
No, you don't have to kiss and tell
'Cause you're only gonna hurt yourself

The minute that I walk in, you're trying to hold me down
[?] your closet, 'til I'm face flat on the ground
Don't know what you've been drinking
Every time you come around
So let me down

If that's the way it's gonna be
Leave your shiny yellow key on the doorstep
And start burning up your ties
And take your coat, I guess, take the shirt right off my back
I don't mind, 'cause I'm gonna set this house on

I sent you running for the hills
I guess by now you know the drill
The type that only shoots to kill
And you only do it for the thrill

The minute that I walk in, you're trying to hold me down
[?] your closet, 'til I'm face flat on the ground
Don't know what you've been drinking
Every time you come around
So let me down

If that's the way it's gonna be
Leave your shiny yellow key on the doorstep
And start burning up your ties
And take your coat, I guess, take the shirt right off my back
I don't mind, 'cause I'm gonna set this house on
Set this house on
Set this house on
Set this house on
Set this house on fire
Set this house on fire
Set this house on fire
Set this house on fire

If that's the way it's gonna be
Leave your shiny yellow key on the doorstep
And start burning up your ties
And take your coat, I guess, take the shirt right off my back
I don't mind, 'cause I'm gonna set this house on
