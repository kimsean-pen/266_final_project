Do I remind you of the pain
That he put you through, girl?
Is that the reason I'm to blame
Before I do it?

Is it because he treated you badly
I always stand accused?
Protecting yourself from somebody else
I'm not who's hurting you, girl

And it's killing me girl, knowing
You compare me to him
Always guilty before the sin
I can't win, I can't win, no

I'll do anything to prove I love you
Baby girl, but I refuse to
Pay for something I didn't do, I love you, girl
But I refuse to stay paying for his mistakes

He left a scar across your heart
I understand, girl
Don't let his wrongs tear us apart, no
Girl, I'm your man

Just because he did, you swear I'm cheating
You think I just don't care
Why must I do time for another man's crime?
Girl, you know that ain't fair, no, no

And it's killing me, girl
Knowing you compare me to him
Always guilty before the sin
I can't win, no, I can't win

I'll do anything to prove I love you
Baby girl, but I refuse to
Pay for something I didn't do, I love you, girl
But I refuse to stay paying for his mistakes

I know he did you wrong
But tell me, what does that have to do with me?
Trying to show you something real
Figure out what is going on
Before you look up and I'll be gone

Oh, I'll do anything to prove I love you
Baby girl, but I refuse
To pay for something I didn't do, girl
I love you and I love you, I love you

I'll do anything to prove I love you
Baby girl, but I refuse
To pay for something I didn't do, no
I love you, girl
But I refuse to stay paying for his mistakes
