Let my car run out, cars burn out
I won't scream or shout
Lost my breath now
Yeah, let's die together (cars burn out)
No one lives forever
Yeah, let's die together, no one lives forever
Falling through the clouds
No one lives forever
Falling through the clouds
'Cause I feel like I'm in heaven, dancing...
No one lives forever

When you go, please, don't leave your love in the sun
My heart will melt away
In the night with your twisted tongue
When you drop the bomb, I'm blown away

'Cause I-I-I-I refuse to hide in a page of this story
I-I-I-I come out the box, I won't say I'm sorry

We in the nuclear season
In the shelter, I survived the storm
We in the nuclear season
Summer lovin' in the backseat, gone

No facing this on my own
'Cause you taste the blast and it shook your bones
I'm a warrior all alone
In the field of lies, I won't go home

'Cause I-I-I-I didn't burn my skin in the blaze of glory
I-I-I-I come out your hands, I won't say I'm sorry

We in the nuclear season
In the shelter, I survived the storm
We in the nuclear season
Summer lovin' in the backseat, gone

We survived nuclear seasons
We survived nuclear seasons

I can feel it, I can feel the fear
I can feel it inside of her soul
Inside of her soul

We in the nuclear season
In the shelter, I survived the storm
We in the nuclear season
Summer lovin' in the backseat, gone

We survived nuclear seasons (good times, dark nights)
We survived nuclear seasons (good times, dark nights)
We survived nuclear seasons (good times, dark nights)
We survived nuclear seasons (good times, dark nights)
