The night is filled with pretty girls
Dancing shoes and flying hair
Not one of them would refuse
To follow you up the stairs
You could have your pick of them
Why decide to pick on me?
You promised me you'd stay away
You promised me you'd set me free

Pounding of my heart
Trembling of my hands
Some things I'll just never understand

You know what to do to me
You know what it does to me
You know what to do to me
You know what it does to me
You know what to do
Do, you know what to do

The night is filled with shooting stars
I watch them fall, 'cause I can't sleep
I pray that you won't call at all
I'm still awake at ten to three
I hear your motorcycle roar
You pull up short outside my door
I don't know how I got outside
I don't know why I'm on this ride

We made love like a house on fire
We made love like dogs gone mad
Some things I'll just never understand

'Cause you know what to do to me
You know what it does to me
You know what to do to me
You know what it does to me
You know what to do to me
You know what it does to me
You know what to do to me
You know what it does to me
You know what to do
Do, you know what to do
Yes, you do
You know what to do
Oh baby, oh yeah
You know what to do

Pounding of my heart
Trembling of my hands
Some things I'll just never understand

'Cause you know what to do to me
You know what it does to me
You know what to do to me
You know what it does to me
You know what to do to me
You know what it does to me
You know how to do it to me
You know what it does to me
You know what to do to me
You know what it does to me
You know what to do to me
You know what it does to me
