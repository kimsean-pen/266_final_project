(Broken) Bones and the will
Capacity to disappear in misery saves
(Soaking) Pain as a thrill, hate to instill
Compassion's a cage

Forgiving the father
Read the story on my skin
I'll be the martyr
Falling from his grace again

(Sunken) Sooner or later we crawl our way back
Into our favorite hole
(Drunken) Swallow the savior
And follow him to hang from the highest pole

Forgiving the father
Read the story on my skin
Tell me more about the man I should have been
I'll be the martyr
Falling from his grace again
Falling from his grace again
This is where the end begins

The end begins

Falling from his grace again
Falling from his grace again
This is where the end begins
