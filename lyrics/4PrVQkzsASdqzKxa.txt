Beg myself to free all of the thoughts clinging to me
I heard them in the crowd
Calling my name, mmm
They took me by the hand
Showed me the lines drawn in the sand
Held me, yeah held me so true, mmm

I could've lost my mind, I could've lost my mind
I could've waded into the waves
I could've lost my mind, I could've lost my mind
I could've lost my mind

Memories made from gold
Out of the fire into the cold
They whispered I was right to be alarmed, mmm

I could've lost my mind, I could've lost my mind
I could've waded into the waves
I could've lost my mind, I could've lost my mind
I could've lost my mind

I thought I knew you, yeah knew your rules
You spoke of freedom and everything I'd lose
I coulda loved you
I coulda loved you
I could've loved you somehow

I could've lost my mind, I could've lost my mind
I could've waded into the waves
I could've lost my mind, I could've lost my mind
I could've lost my mind
