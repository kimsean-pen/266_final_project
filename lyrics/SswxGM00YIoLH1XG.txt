One with the sun!

Grave
Stench of death fills the air
Flesh chars to black
Obliteration
Waters overwhelm
Defenses of the undying mass

Degeneration
Plagues wreak havoc on man
Smother the living
Extermination begins

Rivers of fire
Blackened breath
Poison fills the atmosphere
Mass annihilation
The new dawn is here

Barren
Lands of vanishing life
Molten haze lay ruin and waste
Condemnation
Damned for defilement
Suffer extinction's wrath

One with the sun
Rivers of fire
One with the sun
Rivers of fire
One with the sun
Rivers of fire
One with the sun!

I am one with the sun
Inhale my flames
Drown in my acid reign
I am one with the sun
Inhale my flames
Drown in my acid reign

Grave
Stench of death fills the air
Flesh chars to black
Obliteration
Waters overwhelm
Defenses of the undying mass

I am one with the sun
Rivers of fire
Blackened breath
Poison fills the atmosphere
Mass annihilation
The new dawn is here

(I am one with the sun)
(I am one)
(I am one with the sun)
(I am one)

Rivers of fire
Blackened breath
The new dawn is here
Rivers of fire
Blackened breath
The new dawn is here

Rivers of fire
Blackened breath
The new dawn is here
Rivers of fire
Blackened breath
The new dawn is here

(I am one)
(I am one)
(I am one)
(I am one)
(I am)
