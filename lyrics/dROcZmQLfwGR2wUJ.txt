Not an innocent
I've made my place
That settle turning smirk
That's always fixed upon my face
Walking weakness
Hope I die without a sound
I'm a little boy
With my feet nailed to the ground
I know I'm guilty
My stomach always hurts
Milking your attention
For the little it is worth
I'm turning browner every day
I'm really turning down a stay
Tired of your little man
I've been around too long
Tired of walking
Talking with me
Edging me along
Well, I detest your patience
I know you've always known
You know that I'm a thief
So afraid to be alone
Alone (That's that)
[Static]
Nothing's real
I don't care
It's a lie, I wound
I'm a stupid baby
Only breaks in two

[noise]
(Jesus)
(Jesus is Christ)
[noise]
I don't see I don't feel
Like every little moron
I think nothing's real
I don't care
It's a lie, I wound
Darling skip the faith
That only breaks in two
[noise]
Good doesn't live
And there's no evil here
Only this great power
We misunderstand
So please relax
Take a pain
Laugh out loud
When you forget your name
(Jesus)
Relax, take the pain
Laugh out loud
When you forget your name
Good doesn't live
There's no evil here
Only this great power
We misunderstand
We'll tell you about everything
We'll tell you about everything
(Now)
