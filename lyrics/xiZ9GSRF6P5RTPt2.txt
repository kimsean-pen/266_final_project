It flies
Human fly gets in your ear
Human fly gets to your brain
Human fly sticks on your nerves
Grips on your blood pressure
Drives you to more pleasure

Human fly magic touch from your head
Down to your tips
Now start to move and dance
Now start to groove in trance

Stand up, you electric insect
Stand up, you electronic force

No sign of mortal bite
Just keep on flying, all right!

Now, you're an electric insect
Now use your electronic force

Blood pressure
More pleasure
It flies
