There's no such thing as love
There's no such thing as God
There's no such thing as you
There's no such thing as us

And tell me, friends
When I'm down, would you pick me up?
(My friends... x2)

If everyone had rights,
Would anything go wrong?
Would there ever be the need
For these politician songs?

And tell me, friends
When I'm down, would you pick me up, my friends?
Would you pick me up, my friends?
(My friends...)

Slipped into a cave one day,
I never thought I'd leave that place.
When I woke up the sky had fallen down.

And oh, what a waste,
And oh, what a waste.

Lord, help me right all of the wrongs that I have done.
I never meant to do.
Lord, help me right all of the wrongs that I have done.
You know I've done a few.

And tell me, friends
When I'm down, would you pick me up, my friends?
Would you pick me up, my friends?
Would you pick me up, my friends?
(My friends...)

I slipped into a cave one day,
I never thought I'd leave that place.
When I woke up the sky had fallen down.

The rights are written on our face.
We try to run to change our fate.
God will always catch us in disguise.

Oh, I hear you lost your head again.
Looks like old days.
