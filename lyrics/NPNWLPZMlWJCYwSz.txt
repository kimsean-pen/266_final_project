Can't hide it
Can't just stand there
Can't hide it
Come get high

Baby girl, just be patient
I can make you believe
Keep the miles in rotation
Smoke it 'til you feel free

Your body feels a sensation
Keep your eyes on me
Do you need simulation?
I can help you achieve

Can't hide it
Can't just stand there
Can't hide it
Come get high

Can't hide it
Can't just stand there
Can't hide it
Come get high

Can't hide it
Can't just stand there
Can't hide it
Come get high

Can't hide it
Can't just stand there
Can't hide it
Come get high
