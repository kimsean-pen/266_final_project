We will go outside
When the lights come on inside the house
But we will all be fine
If we read what they will write for us.

I had lost my head
Since the night you thought I left
But I have lost my mind
Since the day I found you died.
In the morning it was bright
On your skin
But you were light
As the snow fell down outside
I couldn't keep it from my eyes.
