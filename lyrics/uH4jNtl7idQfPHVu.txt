I'm left and right and in between
I am laying low on the ceiling
A floating stone in the sea of things I've seen
Running somewhere while this city runs through me

I don't believe in misery
I don't believe there are two of me
Islands of myself
Islands of myself
Islands of myself
Can you help me?

I'm right and wrong; reluctant king
I'm working on reconciling
All the brothers that reside inside of me
Dreaming sleepless while this city dreams of peace
Dreaming sleepless while this city dreams of peace

I don't believe in misery
I don't believe that you're near
Islands of myself
Islands of myself
Islands of myself
Can you help me?
