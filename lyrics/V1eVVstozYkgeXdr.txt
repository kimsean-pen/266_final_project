Didn't wanna write a love song
Usually these things come out wrong
But you been up in my head all day long
And now I'm all gone, yeah

Didn't know we'd end up this way
Keepin' memories on replay
Yeah you make me want to catch the bouquet
I just want to stay here

Yeah, you came and got me swoon
Laid under the summer moon
Lovin' all of the things you do
Since I met you in June
Ju-u-ne

Yeah, you came and got me swoon
Found love where the flowers bloom
Runnin' wild like we're meant to do
Since I met you in June
Ju-u-ne

Didn't wanna give you my heart
Feelings got me caught off-guard
Truly, really had me yours from the start
I'm falling so hard, yeah

And the way our conversations
They don't need no explanations
Never needing a vacation when I'm with you
Cause the sky stays blue

Yeah, you came and got me swoon
Laid under the summer moon
Lovin' all of the things you do
Since I met you in June
Ju-u-ne

Yeah, you came and got me swoon
Found love where the flowers bloom
Runnin' wild like we're meant to do
Since I met you in June
Ju-u-ne

Didn't wanna write a love song
Usually these things come out wrong
But you been up in my head all day long
And now I'm all gone, yeah

Yeah, you came and got me swoon
Laid under the summer moon
Lovin' all of the things you do
Since I met you in June
Ju-u-ne

Yeah, you came and got me swoon
Found love where the flowers bloom
Runnin' wild like we're meant to do
Since I met you in June
Ju-u-ne

Didn't wanna write a love song
