Assume the light
Isn't too dark
Your teeth have fallen out
After they made their mark
You seemed to look
Right through me
I couldn't show you how
To quit your trust or leave
Now that I'm turning back
You start to read

[Assistance came to lend
A hand but you're no realist
You're tongue tied]

Here is my word
A contest has begun
Here comes the soothing part of me
Sense my words, contextualize love
Here comes the soothing part of me
The center dark
Consumes the light
Has anybody read
The sentence that you hide
You seemed to look straight through me
I couldn't turn away
You pulled from underneath
Now that you're turning In
I start to breathe

Here is my word
A contest has begun
Here comes the soothing part of me
Sense my words, contextualize love
Here comes the soothing part of me
