Don't give up, you're gonna see tomorrow
That you'll be on your feet again
Sometimes the world's gonna knock you over
But you will see who you are your friends
Come on, stand, up again
Come on, stand,
Stand, you're gonna run again
Your faith and patience will be your soldiers
To guide you through your troubled times
Just put one foot in front of the other
The battles are inside your mind
You have the power to face your demons
No matter how they go on time
And rid yourself of your fear and weakness
So you can start to live your life
Come on, stand, up again
Come on, stand,
Stand, you're gonna run again
Stand, up again (Come on baby!)
Stand again
Come on, stand (come on, you can make it)
Stand, you're gonna run again
Pick up your will
And put on your face
If you need to, just take my hand
It's time to demonstrate, don't hesitate
Just get up and say: Yes, I can
Stand, up again
Come on, stand
Stand, you're gonna run again
Stand (oh stand), up again
Stand up again
Come on, stand (Oh, come on baby!)
Stand, you're gonna run again
Stand
Stand, you're gonna run again
Come on!
Stand, you're gonna run again
