A branch of cold flames
Hangs over your head
The one thing you could never burn

Its shadow's hanging over you
The shadow's never there
Explodes all over again

Shakes, we take control today
Shakes, give all your secrets away
Shakes, give us your soul today
Shakes, give it all away

To crush this foolish pride
I'm standing under glass
Trying to break through all the time

But deception never fails
Can't discover what's seen
What's seen behind these cold eyes

Shakes, give us your soul today
Shakes, give all your secrets away
Shakes, we take control today
Shakes, give it all away

Shadows over masses
Faces gun charge
It was too much fun all the time

She said your death must come first
To make this dream more real
You'll never be free again

Shakes, give us your soul today
Shakes, give all your secrets away
Shakes, we take control today
Shakes, give it all away

Shakes, shakes, shakes
Shakes, shakes, shakes
Shakes, shakes, shakes
Shakes
