on the mountain, above the hills
lived a mother, and her little ones.
glowing candles of morrow's riddles loving mother could not foresee.
"little darlings where are you heading? i will follow wherever you go".
little children started running into a dwelling with a wooden doors.
she went inside, the walls and rooms were quite.
halls of glooming light.
it was awful cold beneath she was freezing through her feet as she heard a whisper
"dear mother you should see we'll dive into the sea of calm water, do not falter"
drawing circles, moving slow.
she built a fire, abandoned all desire
and she wandered, as she pondered "oh i am childless, i am cold"
eyes were opened wide, she watched as they took flight
her hands were grasping tight
she was bending on her knees, floating through the breeze as she heard a whisper
"dear mother you should see we'll dive into the sea of calm water, do not falter"
