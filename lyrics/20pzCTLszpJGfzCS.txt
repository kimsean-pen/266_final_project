I'm constantly moving on involuntarily
From what I used to be
And now I'm meant to be, can I carry on?
Life seems to keep scaring me
Without my brother I'm so lost
And faced with insecurity

Capsized and violent holding
Troubled against my brothers
As if we've never been
One without the other
Through the worst or best
Kept this card close to my chest
But when the tables turn
I feel like you want me to burn

I try to reach out, hold your presence
These captured memories, I won't forget

Capsized and violent holding
Troubled against my brothers
As if we've never been
One without the other
Through the worst or best
Kept this card close to my chest
But when the tables turn
I feel like you want me to burn

With any passion of fun or dance
Just a pun, just a joke or a fake
Personally, it's not easy to please you
It makes me grind on my teeth

And when I have a blank canvas
Vacuumed from the choices
I must break my heart and say nothing

These tiny fragments in my head are telling me
It's not safe to question you
So I'll pretend this is the truth

I'm constantly moving on involuntarily
From what I used to be
And now I'm meant to be, can I carry on?

Escape and reshape
A plan or a play to invade space
I couldn't reach
As the ravens give meaning
I bleed this distrust to you

I try to reach out, hold your presence
These captured memories, I won't forget

Capsized and violent holding
Troubled against my brothers
As if we've never been
One without the other
Through the worst or best
Kept this card close to my chest
But when the tables turn
I feel like you want me to burn
