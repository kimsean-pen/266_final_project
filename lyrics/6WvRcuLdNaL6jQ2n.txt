Only goin' again in loving this can
Just woke up upon for a little stress
These two they're a perfect match

I did that but only for a minute
Came right back where she was
It's blurry and overcast

She spaced at my hand and
All I hear is crying and
All over again goodbye

Oh right, oh baby

ta-ta-ta-ta-ra-ram
