I woke up this morning
And I walked down to the sea
I sat there on the long grass
Just staring at the sea

Counting all my blessings
And everything that you gave to me
Why is this complicated?
Why can't you stay with me?

Stay with me
Won't you stay, stay with me
Won't you stay with me?

Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me

I just like to hold on
To all the magic memories
I dread this place without you
Don't leave, I'm begging please

Holding back the memories
Holding back the years
Holding back the memories
Holding back the tears

Stay with me
Won't you stay, stay with me
Won't you stay with me?

Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
