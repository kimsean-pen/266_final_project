I collect the souls of the desperate.
The disenfranchised, broken and the weak.
You must pay your way
Pay your way to meet with me.
Place a coin between your teeth and pray to your god
That your memories keep.
You are nothing more than a power gain
A lost spirit used for gain.
Your soul has drifted, now it's mine to keep.
A spirit lost inside, it's calling me.
Across the planes you know you'll never see.
Damned eternally.
Do you want my heart?
Pay with your soul.
I'll fill the emptiness, you'll never be alone.
Do you want my heart?
Pay with your soul.
And if you can't afford it, you'll always be alone.
I'll drown you in this ecstasy.
Blinded by your love.
Place your symbols across me
Banks burst; my river becomes a sea.
Your soul has drifted, now it's mine to keep.
A spirit lost inside, it's calling me.
Across the planes you know you'll never see.
Damned eternally.
Set the price to see the other side.
Your soul has drifted, now it's mine to keep.
A spirit lost inside, it's calling me.
Across the planes you know you'll never see.
Damned eternally.
