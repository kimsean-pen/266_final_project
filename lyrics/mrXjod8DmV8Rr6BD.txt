Born To Die

Feet don't fail me now
Take me to the finish line
All my heart, it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping that the gates,
They'll tell me that you're mine
Walking through the city streets
Is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home, if I tell you you're mine
It's like I told you honey

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love's not enough when the road gets tough

I don't know why
Keep making me laugh,
Let's go get high
Road's long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime ä¸€

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain

You like your girls insane
Choose your last words
This is the last time
Cause you and I, we were born to die

Lost but now I am found
I can see but once I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Tried to take what I could get
Scared that I couldn't find
All the answers, honey

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love's not enough when the road gets 1

I don't know why
Keep making me laugh

Let's go get high
Road's long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the 2
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the 3 rain
You like your girls 4
Choose your last words
This is the last time
Cause you and I
We were born to die
We were born to die
