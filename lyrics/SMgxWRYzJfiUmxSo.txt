You sit in the bathroom and you paint your toes
I sit on the bed right now and I sing you a song
It's not always easy, but somehow our love stays strong
If I can make you happy, then this is where I belong

And I'd just like to say
I thank God that you're here with me
And I know you too well to say that you're perfect
But you'll see, oh my sweet love, you're perfect for me

I know all you're secrets, and you know all of mine
You're always here to hold me up when I'm losing my mind
I wish that I was stronger so that I had more to give
But i'll share everything I have we'll find a way to live

And I'd just like to say

I thank God that you're here with me
And I know you too well to say that you're perfect
But you'll see, oh my sweet love, you're perfect for me

Even after all this time, nothing else I ever find
In this whole wide world can shake me like you do
It's true that something so sublime that there aren't words yet to describe
The beauty of this life I've made with you
And I'd just like to say
I thank God that you're here with me
And I know you too well to say you're perfect
But you'll see oh my sweet love you're perfect for me
And I know you too well to say you're perfect
But you'll see of my sweet love you're perfect
Oh my love I swear you're perfect
Yes I promise, you're perfect for me
