When it doesn't rain it snows.
Yes the cookie crumbles but in whose hand?
All things said and all things done,
Life is short

Oh I am young but I have aged.
Waited long to seize the day
All things said and plenty done,
Life is short

Oh, Oh, Could this be,
Oh, Oh, Could this be the day I've waited for?

Another door to peek in through.
The floor is filthy,
But the couch is clean.
At the end of the day,
That's another day gone.
Life is short, oh, life is short.

Oh, Oh, Could this be,
Oh, Oh, Could this be the day I've waited for?

Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, etc.

Oh I am young but I have aged.
Waited long to seize the day.
All things said and plenty done,
Oh I am young but I have a past.
Traveled far to find the start.
Yes I am scared and I've been burnt.
But life is short.

Oh, Oh, Could this be,
Oh, Oh, Could this be the day I've waited for?

Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, etc.
