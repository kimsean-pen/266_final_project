I remember your smile
the smell of your skin
the way that you walked
and laughed

I remember our room
and coming home to you
I remember our room
and you

Look back
hold on to the last
don't let today push down the past

Look back Look back
hold on till the last

I remember the drive
with and without you
One road I took to catch you
the other road I took
to leave you where I found you

And I remember a day
we sat in some strange bar
and nothing much to say
nothing at all

I loved you
and I still do
You know I loved you
and I still do

Look back
hold on to the last
don't let today push out the past
you gotta
Look back Look back
hold on till the last

I loved you and I still do

You know I loved you
and I still do

Look back Look backHold on to the last

and I loved you
(Look back Look back)
and I still do
(Look back Look back)
you know I loved you
(Look back Look back)
and I still do

Look back Look backHold on till the last
