Woo-hoo uh-huh mmm mmm

Anthony works in the grocery store
Savin' his pennies for someday
Mama Leone left a note on the door
She said, "Sonny, move out to the country."
Oh but workin' too hard can give you
A heart attack-ack-ack-ack
You oughta know by now
(You oughta know by now)
Who needs a house out in Hackensack?
Is that all you get for your money?

And it seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama, if that's movin' up then I'm movin' out!
Mmm I'm movin' out
Mmm mmm woo-hoo uh-huh

Sergeant O'Leary is walkin' the beat
At night he becomes a bartender
He works at Mister Cacciatore's down on Sullivan Street
Across from the medical center
Yeah he's tradin' in his Chevy for a Cadillac-ac-ac-ac
You oughta know by now
(You oughta know by now)
And if he can't drive
With a broken back
At least he can polish the fenders

And it seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama, if that's movin' up then I'm movin' out!
Mmm I'm movin out
Oh-huh woo-hoo uh-huh

You should never argue with a crazy mi-mi-mi-mind
You oughta know by now
(You oughta know by now)
You can pay Uncle Sam with the overtime
Is that all you get for your money?
And if that's what you have in mind
Yeah that's what you're all about
Good luck movin up, cause I'm movin' out!
Mmm I'm movin' out
Mmm mmm woo-hoo uh-huh mmm mmm

I'm movin' out!
