And I'm not so sure
If I'm sure of anything anymore
But this is the last night (this is the last night)
That you'll be keepin'
Secrets from me

Just hit the lights before you leave
you know of
the million things you had to say sorry just
just might have found it's way in there somehow, someway
But don't worry sweetie
cause I already know

And I'm not so sure
if I'm sure of anything anymore
But this is the last night (this is the last night)
that you'll be keepin'
secrets from me

You're so guilty it's disgusting
He's been sneakin underneath your sheets
And your hands
Have been in places that they probably shouldn't go
But don't worry sweetie
Cause I already know

Regardless my pictures
Well they don't line your mirror
Regardless you know that
I'll still wait for your call

Regardless my pictures
Well they don't line your mirror
Regardless you know that
I'll still wait for your call

Honestly (well they dont line my mirror)
It's the last time (Regardless)
That I see you
I'll still wait for your call

Do you know what your girl's been up to?
