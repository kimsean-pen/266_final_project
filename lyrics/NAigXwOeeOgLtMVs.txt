Dearly beloved
I'm writing this letter in hopes
That it reaches you in time
I've lived in darkness for so long
That my heart beats no more
And the only light I seek is
An undying flame across the earth

I watch the horror, it sickens me
You all know nothing of misery
The sound of hate
(The sound of hate)
It's deafening
This world means nothing to me

I am the bringer of ends
I am the bearer of night
All of your greed and your gluttony
Now you all must die

No one can run
No one can hide
This reckoning in my eyes
Nowhere to turn
Your fate I decide
This reckoning in my eyes

Pray, pray
Pray for the end of times
Pray, pray
Pray for the end of times

Filled with the worms of decay
Your skin shall perish in vain
Filled with the worms of decay
Your skin shall perish in vain

No one can run
No one can hide
This reckoning in my eyes
Nowhere to turn
Your fate I decide
This reckoning in my eyes

Pray, pray
Pray for the end of times
Pray, pray
Pray for the end
The end of times

A world cloaked in lies
(A world cloaked in lies)
Will face it's demise
With illness and agony
(With illness and agony)
I'll watch humanity die

I'll watch humanity die
I'll watch humanity die
