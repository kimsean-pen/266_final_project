Solitude, behind these endless walls
Despair, for tomorrow that never comes
Trustful, 'cause he knows that this tomorrow
Will come before the day ends

The arrival of a cold and stupid end!
But the winds will deliver him the power
To break down this endless night of fear
In his mind, he keeps the delights
Of days now gone

'Cause he knows embrace and
Hanging walk together
And yesterday is now
A memory of moments
That never happened

And tomorrow will come
Before the arrival of his end
But he needs to break down
The imaginary walls of pain!
