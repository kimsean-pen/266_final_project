Secrets of lovers
Whisper tonight
Broken down angel
Got lost in the cold daylight
The city is screaming
I look for your eyes

Someone to lean on all through the night
Your music talks to me and hits me tonight
One candle burning, I hear you say

So let there be love
Let there be love oh yeah
Love
Let there be love oh yeah

It heals and it hurts
She leads you to heaven's door
And leaves you for dirt

Someone to lean on, oh that you know
Some magic conquers me lives in my soul
She comes like an ocean I hear you sing
Love will conquer anything

So let it be love
Let it be love oh yeah
Love
Let it be love
Yeah

The wall's down
They're coming down
I can't slow
I know it now
So stay now
Hold on
And I'm praying

So let it be love
Let it be love oh yeah
Love
Let it be love oh yeah

I know what I want
I know what I feel
I know what I want alright
So let there be love
Let there be love

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
