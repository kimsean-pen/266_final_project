It's time to let go
But I won't let it die here
All I wanted was a dance from your apathy

In the corner of my eye, I see a smile
It's been hiding for too long
For a while, now
Only if you knew how well it suits you
You would leave it on, you know you would

It's time to let go
But I won't let it die here
All I wanted was a dance from your apathy
A stranger you know
As you look in the mirror
All I wish for is a light upon all this fear

Everybody watches as you glow
But everyone who loves you sees right through
You have built a life that's not your own
And now you only try to catch the wind

It's time to let go
But I won't let it die here
All I wanted was a dance from your apathy
A stranger you know
As you look in the mirror
All I wish for is a light upon all this fear
