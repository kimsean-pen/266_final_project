Stumbling down a bramble track
No turning back to where it started
Years ago, you'd wish you'd known
That people change, and rearrange

I don't mind wasting time
I don't care for what is good or bad, it's in the past
Say to me we'll be free
When we've reached our own space and time, it's all aligned

Out of sight and out of mind
Undefined, you're nobody
Here and now, and now and then
You're in again, a head of thunder

I don't mind wasting time
I don't care for what is good or bad, it's in the past
Say to me we'll be free
When we've reached our own space and time, it's all aligned

Can it not just wait 'til morning light
So we can see it clearly
Can it not just wait 'til morning light
So we can see it clearly
Can it not just wait 'til morning light
So we can see it clearly
Can it not just wait 'til morning light
So we can see it clearly

Stumbling down a broken track
This time there is no turning back
Now you know how people change
This time, you need to rearrange

Can it not just wait 'til morning light
So we can see it clearly
Can it not just wait 'til morning light
So we can see it clearly

Every time I see your face across the morning light
I see you through the night more clearly
Every time I see your face across the morning light
I see you through the night more clearly
Every time I see your face across the morning light
I see you through the night more clearly
Every time I see your face across the morning light
I see you through the night more clearly
