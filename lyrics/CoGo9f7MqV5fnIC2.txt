Pull up in a golden Tesla that's not cheap
Everything I do is electric on these streets
Walk up in the mall like, "I'll take one of each"
It all looks good on me, good on me, babe

I always choose the priciest shoes
And I drape my shoulders in purple raccoon
I never have to try and explain
'Cause the way I look says everything, everything

Say what you wanna say, I got expensive taste
And it's not a fantasy, all of the things I want
You should buy it for me, bury me in Gucci
Say what you wanna say, I got expensive taste
And it's not a fantasy, all of the things I want
You should buy it for me, bury me in Gucci

Sleeping in late, took the tiger for a walk
Took a selfie in front of my velvet walls
Everything I eat is compliments of chef
And my cocktail is top shelf, is top shelf

I always choose the priciest shoes
And I drape my shoulders in purple raccoon
I never have to try and explain
'Cause the way I look says everything, everything

Say what you wanna say, I got expensive taste
And it's not a fantasy, all of the things I want
You should buy it for me, bury me in Gucci
Say what you wanna say, I got expensive taste
And it's not a fantasy, all of the things I want
You should buy it for me, bury me in Gucci
You should buy it for me, bury me in Gucci
You should buy it for me, bury me in Gucci

I want that Gucci now, I want that Gucci later
I want that Gucci hat, I want that Gucci flavor
I got that Gucci boot, I got that Gucci paper
I got that Gucci on the brain, smoking that Gucci vapor
I want that Gucci now, I want that Gucci later
I want that Gucci hat, I want that Gucci flavor
I got that Gucci boot, I got that Gucci paper
I got that Gucci on the brain, smoking that Gucci vapor

Say what you wanna say, I got expensive taste
And it's not a fantasy, all of the things I want
You should buy it for me, bury me in Gucci
You should buy it for me, bury me in Gucci
You should buy it for me, bury me in Gucci
