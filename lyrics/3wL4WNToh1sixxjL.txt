- Lyrics and music by David Bowie

Hope little girl
Come blow me away
I don't care much
I win anyway
Just a dog
I'm Goddamn rich
An exploading mad
When I talk in the night
There's oil in my hands
What a dog

Fall Dog is cruel and smart
Smart time breaks the heart
Fall Dog bombs the moon

Devil in a market place
Devil in your bleeding face
Fall Dog bombs the moon
What a dog

There's always a moron
Someone to hate
A corporate tie
A wig and a date
Just a dog

These blackest of years
That have no sound
No shape, no depth
No underground
What a dog

Fall Dog is cruel and smart
Smart time breaks the heart
Fall Dog bombs the moon

A Devil in a market place
A Devil in your bleeding face
Fall Dog bombs the moon
What a dog
