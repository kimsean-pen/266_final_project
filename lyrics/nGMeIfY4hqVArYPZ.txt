Rise into the light and fade to the night
Sick of being told how to run your life
Their rules
They're fools
Empty words they promise so much
The present status quo remains untouched

If you want the world
Use your mind
Take control
Feel the strength
Rise from within
If you really want it the world is yours

Every empire was raised by the slain
Built through the age and you can destroy it in a day
Turn the page
Unleash your rage
Burn your golden cage and walk away
On your path toward ultimate power

If you want the world
Use your mind
Take control
Feel the strength
Rise from within
If you really want it the world is yours

Striking at the leash
Foaming at the mouth
No more subservience
Justice will be done

There's only so much
You can take
There is only so much
You can tolerate
When the bound breaks, the empire will fall

If you want the world
Use your mind
Take control
Feel the strength
Rise from within
If you really want it the world is yours

If you want the world
Use your mind
Take control
Feel the strength
Rise from within
If you really want it the world is yours
