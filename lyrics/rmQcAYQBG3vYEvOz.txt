Like dragging nails through my skin

Strip the scar, scratch the itch
Dig your nails deep until the nerve is good and raw
Pulling teeth again to pay for all your sins
The blue pill or the red, all you want are enemies

Feel the tension set to break
We've swallowed more than we can take
Like dragging nails through my skin

Die, die, dying to believe
This beast you resurrected won't break its leash
We're die, die, dying to believe
That the ghost of the ills of this world will find you where you sleep
We'll find you where you sleep

God complex, let's start a war
Whose prayers will you answer, whose will you ignore?
Paint it black and torn apart
Baptised in hate to the beat, to the beat of a hollow heart

Feel the tension set to break
We've swallowed more than we can take
Like dragging nails through my skin

Die, die, dying to believe
This beast you resurrected won't break its leash
We're die, die, dying to believe
That the ghost of the ills of this world will find you where you sleep
We'll find you where you sleep
We'll find you where you sleep

'Cause it's a sick fucking world in a sick fucking time
Splitting at the seams as you desecrate the hive
The cancer's in your heart, the poison's in your mind
Forked tongue motherfucker, tell me, how the hell do you sleep at night?
How do you sleep at night?
How do you sleep at night?
Dying to believe

Die, die, dying to believe
This beast you resurrected won't break its leash
We're die, die, dying to believe
That the ghost of the ills of this world will find you where you sleep
