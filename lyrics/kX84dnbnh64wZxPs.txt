Stuck here in a life that repeats
Living in the now and between
Pages from a magazine
Instruction manuals for your dreams

This is where you stop and rewind
This where our dreams all collide
Streaming through your heart that was mine
Living in my world that was yours through your eyes

It was you all along
It was you all along

Waiting for a life that was allowed
Not my own but yours all alone
Wide awake until your home
Black on black, roses gold

I was yours all along
I was yours all along

I was yours all along
I was yours all along

Don't go changing
I'm not leaving you

Don't go changing
I'm not leaving you
