Shedding tears for affairs
I'm a funny little thing
I can tell you this for nothing
Affairs don't win

Can you handle one more dirty secret one more dirty night?
Is it true what they say?
Will it make us go blind?

You had to drive
Look me in the eye
Whisper don't cry

I'll take an interest in Illustration
It should be a laugh
Your words are with me still
They whisper in the grass

Shedding tears for affairs
I'm a stupid little thing
I can tell you this for nothing
You won't win

You had to drive
(I didn't want to)
Look me in the eye
(I found it hard to)
Whisper don't cry
(I had to whisper don't cry)
So I cried
