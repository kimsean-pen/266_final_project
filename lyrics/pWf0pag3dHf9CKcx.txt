Hourglass shaped, something like a silhouette

Wonders towards me, and takes it's hold

Where do I stray, and why do I forget?

Did you take me home?

tell me who you are
where'd you come from
where'd you come from

tell me what I want to hear

feeling more than high on the run from the one I love

but I don't recognise you dear

Do I disguise my own vice
And lie to hide behind your eyes

Do I disguise my own vice
And lie to hide behind your eyes

I've been waiting to put you up on the show

and let your memory fade

but trust when I think I've got me all to myself

you can't take me away

I don't know who you are
where'd you come from
where'd you come from

and every part of me you stole

and never gone too far
on the run, toward the one I love
cause every time I lose control

Do I disguise my own vice
And lie to hide behind your eyes

Do I disguise my own vice
And lie to hide behind your eyes

Do I disguise my own vice
And lie to hide behind your eyes

Do I disguise my own vice
And lie to hide behind your eyes
