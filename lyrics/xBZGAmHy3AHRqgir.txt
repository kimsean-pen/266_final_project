Silent all your life
Running without vision
Hollowed out inside
Wronging all that's right

There's no cost to be alive
And no reason to escape from us
There's no wind outside, no pain
And I'll find any suffering

The road is dark and bare
No clarity, no light
The moment came and swallowed us
Blinding all our sight

We will keep you free from dark
All you have to do is stay with us
I will mend your broken heart
And return the glass that you have dropped

Give your life
So I can breathe
Save your life
It's all we need

We can be above the ground
And devour your humanity
Follow me and follow sound
To the end of your eternity

Give your life
So I can breathe
Save your life
It's all we need

Give your life
So I can breathe
Save your life
It's all we need
