Pitch-black, sparkling
Truthful, these eyes
Cleance me with your silence
Until we reunite
Hear my gleeful yearning
I'm forever bound to try

Take me to the underworld
Flee with me to the end
Lay me down in the arms of the night
Dance with me, waltz of death

When in love, when in love with the darkness
All is lost to a bitter embrace
When in love, when in love with the darkness
All that's left of you will fade

Death requite my love
Soon I'll be your muse
Death requite my love
Soon to be consumed

Take me to the underworld
Flee with me to the end
Lay me down in the arms of the night
Dance with me, waltz of death

Purge me with your violence until we are as one
Ceasing to exist I'm forever bound to you

Take me to the underworld
Flee with me to the end

And finally death do us part from the world
Silence in the dark
Silently rid me of pain
Forever give to me your name
Love
