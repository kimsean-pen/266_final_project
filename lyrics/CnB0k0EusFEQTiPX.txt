Don't waste my time with daydreams
I'm living my nightmare
Every semblance of hope in this life
Surrenders to despair
So I embrace the darkness
'Cause it's always there

Give me an open fire
Blazes in your eyes
Burns right through the night ((open fire)
I could live nocturnally
I could live without daylight
(open fire)
Give me a hug on a sheepskin rug
Tell me that we'll never part
(open fire)

Open fire, on my heart

(open fire)

The world's got a dark side

Every day it turns
But the sun only shines on occasion and when it does it burns

I am not enlightened
Everybody learns

Give me an open fire
Blazes in your eyes
Burns right through the night
(open fire)
I could live nocturnally
I could live without daylight

(open fire)
Give me a hug on a sheepskin rug
Tell me that we'll never part

(open fire)
Open fire, on my heart
(open fire)

Give me an open fire
Blazes in your eyes
Burns right through the night
(open fire)
I could live nocturnally
I could live without daylight
(open fire)
Give me a hug on a sheepskin rug
Tell me that we'll never part
(open fire)
Open fire, on my heart
(open fire)
