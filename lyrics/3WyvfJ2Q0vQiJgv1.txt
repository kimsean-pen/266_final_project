Mesmerise, symbolize everything that's unique
Make the choice with a voice, speak within and talk away
Seems to endeavor, breach from within
Beside the the shallow lake of youth
Seen our reflection shine like a gem
Within and serenade the view

Tears fell upon the fire, fell upon desire
Early in the morning
Age fell in to the sea, sunset of the east
You and I are older

Paradise is alive in the conscious of our brains
Shake away and become for one hour of the day
Piece of the passage, there from before
Becomes a carousel of truth
Seems all the pleasure, shine like a gem
Beneath the ever-changing view

Tears fell upon the fire, fell upon desire
Early in the morning
Age fell in to the sea, sunset of the east
You and I are older

Do you say, what you feel at the end of the day?
In your heart
In the rain, I'll watch it wash you away
In a heartbeat, in our heart's beach

Tears fell upon the fire, fell upon desire
Early in the morning
Age fell in to the sea, sunset of the east
You and I are older

Tears fell upon the fire, fell upon desire
Early in the morning
Age fell in to the sea, sunset of the east
You and I are older
