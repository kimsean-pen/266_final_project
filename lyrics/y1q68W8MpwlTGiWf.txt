Is that someone you used to date?
Why's she hanging around here, what's her story?
Doesn't she know that it's too late?
That the party is over and the car is for me

Why don't you tell her what's been goin' on?
'Cause she seems to be dreamin' instead of just leavin'
If you don't have the heart to fill her in
Then just step aside and let me lay it on the line

'Cause you're mine
And tonight you don't revolve around her
You're mine
And this time I'm gonna scream a little louder

Don't wanna be like
Every other girl in the world
Like every other one who wants you
'Cause when I see you, something inside me burns
And then I realize I wanna come first
I wanna come first

You look at me and I just die
It's like heaven arrivin' in my mind
And I can't believe all this jealousy
I used to be a girl who could let a guy breathe

But you're mine
And tonight you revolve around me
You're mine
And this time I'm gonna get a little louder

Don't wanna be like
Every other girl in the world
Like every other one who wants you
'Cause when I see you, something inside me burns
And then I realize I wanna come first
I wanna come first

Don't wanna be like every girl who's tried to get you
I wanna be the one who's never sorry that she met you
I wanna come first
I wanna come first, hey!

Don't wanna be like
Every other girl in the world
Like every other one who wants you
'Cause when I see you, something inside me burns
And then I realize, I wanna come first

Don't wanna be like
Every other girl in the world
Like every other one who wants you
'Cause when I see you, something inside me burns
And then I realize I wanna come first

Every other girl in the world
Like every other one who wants you
'Cause when I see you, something inside me burns
And then I realize I wanna come first
