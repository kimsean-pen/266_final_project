Wind on the move
A loving embrace
As we walk down old Chinatown
Looked in your eyes
And studied your face
As my world came tumbling down
With half a truth and smiling scars
You know you know there's more to you and me and us girl
So you'll never be the same no matter where you are
And we go and we go
Sometimes high sometimes low
Making choices we'll always regret
But I'll always remember the cold Chinatown night we had
A memory of pavement and skin
Under light of the digital skies
A cigarette indelible sin
And I can't get you out of my mind
With half a truth and smiling scars
You know you know there's more to you and me and us girl
So you'll never be the same no matter where you are
And we go and we go
Sometimes high sometimes low
Making choices we'll always regret
But I'll always remember the cold Chinatown night we had
Wait for the harrowing hour
You'll see what could've been ours
You won't forget about me
Sure as the sun and the sea
And we go and we go
Sometimes high sometimes low
Making choices we'll always regret
But I'll always remember the cold Chinatown night we had
And we go and we go
Sometimes high sometimes low
Making choices we'll always regret
But I'll always remember the cold Chinatown night we had
