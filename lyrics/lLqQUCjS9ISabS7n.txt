My hands are trembling
And my eyes are on fire
This house is crumbling
Left brain, left out on the while
Yeah, yeah

You make me happy
You magnify my better half
You make me certain
Though all I have today is your photograph

My past is perilous
But each scar I wear sings
Monuments to where I have been
And melodies to wear I am going
Yeah, yeah

You make me happy
You magnify my better half
You make me certain
Though all I have today is your photograph

When will I see you again?
Still-life can only go so far
I need you in front of me
To say my name
Say it to me, say it to me
Say it to me, I want you the way you are
The way you are
Yeah, yeah

You make me happy
You magnify my better half
You make me certain
Though all I have today is your photograph
You make me happy
You make me happy
You make me happy
Oh
