When I go by Baltimore
Ain't no carpet on my floor
You come along, & follow me
We'll go down to Galilee
Howlin' green, green rocky road
You promenade in green
Tell me who you love
Tell me who you love
See that crow up in the sky?
He don't walk, but he just fly
He don't walk, but he don't run
Keep in flapping to the sun
Howlin' green, green rocky road
You promenade in green
Tell me who you love
Tell me who you love
Hooka-dooka soda cracker
Does your mama chew tobacco?
If your mama chews tobacco
Hooka-dooka, hooka-dooka soda cracker
Howlin' green, green rocky road
You promenade in green
Tell me who you love
Tell me who you love
Now, when I go by Baltimore
Need no carpet on my floor
You come along, & follow me
There's a man in Galilee
Howlin' green, green rocky road
You promenade in green
Tell me who you love
Tell me who you love
