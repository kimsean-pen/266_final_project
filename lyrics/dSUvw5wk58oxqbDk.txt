The Roman king, the Romulus, the precipice born to change
The final days, the last appraise Augustus, Nero taking names
I'm high then I'm low, low stop then
I go, go bipolar
Oh, oh yes then I'm no, no
My time will come
I promise that
Pull the trigger back, back
Bullet in a gun
But in the end my time will come
Like a bullet in a gun
Blood, sweat and tears to be the one
Bullet in a gun, gun, gun, gun, gun, gun, gun
Bullet in a gun, gun, gun, gun, gun, gun, gun
Bullet in a gun

To make a name you pay the price
You give your life no other way
The Devil's deal, it comes around
To wear the crown
Rise up from the ground

I'm high then I'm low, low stop then
I go, go bipolar
Oh, oh yes then I'm no, no
My time will come
I promise that
Pull the trigger back, back

Bullet in a gun
But in the end my time will come
Like a bullet in a gun
Blood, sweat and tears to be the one
Bullet in a gun, gun, gun, gun, gun, gun, gun
Bullet in a gun, gun, gun, gun, gun, gun, gun
Bullet in a gun

How many voices go unheard?
How many lessons never learned?
How many artists fear the light, fear the pain, go insane, lose your mind, lose yourself
(You only care about fame and wealth)
Sellout, sellout, sellout!

Bullet in a gun
But in the end my time will come
Like a bullet in a gun
Blood, sweat, and tears to be the one
Bullet in a gun, gun, gun, gun, gun, gun, gun, gun
Bullet in a gun, gun, gun, gun, gun, gun, gun, gun
Bullet in a
