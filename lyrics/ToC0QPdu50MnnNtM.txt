With our lives at higher tension
And fear in every heart
We close the doors of our compassion
And we are worlds apart

Frightened by the sights around us
We look for answers here
And all they give us
Is ignorance and fear

Let's unbind our mind

We must rise, with the fire in our eyes
To prevent our own demise
In the hearts that suffer
Devil's in disguise

We must fight, to renounce the words of war
That divide us at the core
We'll rip off the veil
The face of terror won't prevail

In the name of their religion
The engine of their hate
They preach a god, their own illusion
With no shred of faith

Is this world they wanted?
Is this a world at all?
When joy and freedom
Could lead us to our fall

Let's unbind our mind

We must rise, with the fire in our eyes
To prevent our own demise
In the hearts that suffer
Devil's in disguise

We must fight, to renounce the words of war
That divide us at the core
We'll rip off the veil
The face of terror won't prevail

We must rise, with the fire in our eyes
To prevent our own demise
In the hearts that suffer
Devil's in disguise

We must fight, to renounce the words of war
That divide us at the core
We'll rip off the veil
The face of terror won't prevail
