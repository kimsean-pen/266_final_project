Tearing at my neck my sharpened teeth pierce the meat
My warm bloodied prey sustains my life for one more day
The oldest of souls, left behind after life
Before death I was nothing but human

Indulgence in the blood, intoxicated from its drug
It warms my cold soul

Tapping the gushing sap, trickling down my throat
Rejuvenation of my body
No blood left to scab
Now it flows through my veins
Heaven I have found
Fear in my grip
Transcend beyond mortal
The sweet blood
I will swallow
Draining the inner spirit
Feasting on the power
Knowing only pleasure
Human blood I devour

Ghastly beauty look into my eyes
To reproduce with the living
Every century

Impregnation of the virgin
I drink the blood of the unborn
Returning to my grave
Dragging my blood drained prey
My body burns from the light
Sleeping until night

In my clutch, you greet me with open arms
Soon I will rip them off
And drink the blood from the stumps
Life and death are too clear
But mankind is blind to see
The twisted path of their own mortality

Scripts of the dead
Netherworld knowledge
Rotten fragrance lingers
Unleash the odor
I have risen

Vampire
Zombie
Sucking on
Arteries
Body
Numbs
One of my sons died for your sins
Resurrect him so I can
Drink his blood again
