Don't wanna waste another day
Don't wanna let them fade away
I don't wanna shut my mouth
Don't wanna live in fear and doubt

All I am is based on who you are
I don't want to pretend
I'll drown in another's arms

Every word in my mind
I'm dying to resay
Every word I wanna say to you
Every word in my mind
Don't ever come out right
I can't turn inside out

So I put you in a song
So I can sing to you all night long
You'll forever live in my songs
'Cause I'm only brave when you're gone

I'm losing sleep every night
Still, I pretend to be alright
I wonder if it's all planned out
Or is it only wonder
Always on my mind

'Cause all I am is based on who you are
I don't want to pretend
I'll drown in another's arms

Every word in my mind
I'm dying to resay
Every word I wanna say to you
Every word in my mind
Don't ever come out right
I can't turn inside out

And what if I'm supposed to be with you?
What if it is supposed to be us two?
And what if I wait till I'm ready to tell you
And I can't find you?

Every word in my mind
I'm dying to resay
Every word I wanna say to you
Every word in my mind
Don't ever come out right
I can't turn inside out

So I put you in a song
So I can sing to you all night long
You'll forever live in my songs
'Cause I'm only brave when you're gone
