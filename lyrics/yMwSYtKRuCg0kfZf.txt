Wake up, wake up My God
This is not a test, and it's not too late to come clean
Get it off your chest
So steady your hand before your face and concentrate
There's got to be some stable ground left to walk on

So tear another page from the book
Are you asleep or just alone
Clear this room from your lungs
And pull yourself together
Pull yourself together man
Pull yourself together
Pull yourself together
On your back

You're sleeping in a bed of shame
Let the light breathe some new life into this room
It's what keeps you coming back
Made up of insatiable taste
Bury your head in your hands
And sink into yourself

Just what are you so afraid of
What are you so afraid of
You're staring truth in the face
So come on down
What are you so afraid of

You're busy living now, aren't you
You're busy making vows
You're coming unglued
Time is shorter than you know
I know the light is blinding to the naked eye
So why don't you take steps away from being alone
I swear it's not too late for you

It's all worth reaching for
It's all worth reaching for
It's all worth reaching for
The hand to pull you out
It's all worth reaching for
The hand to pull you out
Wake up, wake up, wake up
And step outside your box
Wake up, wake up
