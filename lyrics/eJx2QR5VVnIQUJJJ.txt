I wrote a letter
And I hope that you will see
The way you make me feel
And what you really mean to me

Every night I dream of you
I wonder where you are
I look outside into the sky
I see you wavin' on a star

I wanna be with you
I wanna follow you
I wanna be with you wherever you may go
I wanna be with you
I wanna follow you
I wanna be with you wherever you may go

I wanna be with you
I wanna follow you
I wanna be with you wherever you may go
I wanna be with you
I wanna follow you
I wanna be with you wherever you may go

I tried to call
And make it up with you
But you keep on sayin'
It's not an easy thing to do

Every night I dream of you
I wonder where you are
I look outside into the sky
I see you wavin' on a star

I wanna be with you
I wanna follow you
I wanna be with you wherever you may go
I wanna be with you
I wanna follow you
I wanna be with you wherever you may go

I wanna be with you
I wanna follow you
I wanna be with you wherever you may go
I wanna be with you
I wanna follow you
I wanna be with you wherever you may go

I wanna be with you
I wanna follow you
I wanna be with you wherever you may go
I wanna be with you
I wanna follow you
I wanna be with you wherever you may go
