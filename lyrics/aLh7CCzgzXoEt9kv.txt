A thousand people yell
They're shouting my name
But I wanna die in this moment
I wanna die

And a thousand people smile
Are smiling at me
But I wanna die in this moment
I wanna die

No way to understand
Why I've become the way I am

When the sky is filled with stars
I find the place inside my heart

Some people can take a blow
They won't ever drop
But I wanna die in this moment
I wanna die

She will tell me she loves me
She won't ever stop
But I wanna die in this moment
I wanna die

A coldness in my soul
And I reach out for her to hold

And then I watch her close her eyes
It's only me that needs to cry

And if I stay with you
Do you believe that I'll come true?

No way to understand
Why I've become the way I am

When the sky is filled with stars
I find the place inside my heart

And then I watch her close her eyes
It's only me that needs to cry

A thousand people yell
They're shouting my name
But I wanna die in this moment
I wanna die
