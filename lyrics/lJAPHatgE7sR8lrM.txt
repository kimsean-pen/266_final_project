The world as I see it, is a remarkable place
A beautiful house in a forest of stars in outer space
From a birds eye view, I can see it has a well-rounded personality
From a birds eye view, I can see we are family

It's not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
No it's not a difficult thing
It's not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
Because you are the world to me

Yeah the world as I see it, is a remarkable place
Every man makes a difference
And every mothers child is a saint
From a birds eye view I can see, we are spiralling down in gravity
From a birds eye view I can see, you are just like me

It's not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
No it's not a difficult thing
It's not hard for me to love you
Ooh I really love you
Unconditionally

No it's not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
No it's not a difficult thing
It's not hard for me to love you
Ooh I really love you
Love you are the world to me

You are the mountain, you are the rock
You are the cord and you're the spark
You are the eagle, you are the lark
You are the world and you're remarkable

You're the ocean eating the shore
You are the calm inside the storm
You're every emotion, you can endure
You are the world and the world is yours

(It's not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
No it's not a difficult thing
It's not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
Unconditionally)

No it's not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
No it's not a difficult thing
It's not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
Because you are the world to me
No it's not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
No it's not a difficult thing
It's not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
Because you are the world to me
Yeah the world as I see it, is a remarkable place
