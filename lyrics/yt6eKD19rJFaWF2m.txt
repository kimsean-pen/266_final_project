Think I can fly
Think I can fly when I'm with you
My arms are wide
Catching fire as the wind blows

I know that I'm rich enough for pride
I see a billion dollars in your eyes
Even if we're strangers till we die

I wanna run away
I wanna run away
Anywhere out this place
I wanna run away

Just you and I, I, I, I, I
You and I, I, I, I, I
You and I, I, I, I, I
You and I, I, I, I, I

Just you and I

You and I, I, I, I, I
You and I, I, I, I, I
You and I, I, I, I, I
You and I, I, I, I, I

Oh
(You, you, yuo, you)

I wanna run
Chase the morning sun when I'm with yuo
Give it all away
Catching fire as the wind blows

I know that I'm rich enough for pride
I see a billion dollars in your eyes
Even if we're strangers till we die

I wanna run away
I wanna run away
Anywhere out this place
I wanna run away

Just you and I, I, I, I, I
You and I, I, I, I, I
You and I, I, I, I, I
You and I, I, I, I, I

Just you and I

You and, you and I, I, I
Just you and I

I, I, I, I, I
You and I, I, I, I, I
You and I, I, I, I, I
You and I, I, I, I, I
Just you and I

You and, you and I, I, I

Oh
(You, you, you, you)
