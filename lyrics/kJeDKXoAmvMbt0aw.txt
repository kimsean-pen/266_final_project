I'm in transit
For the stranded on this boat
And I pledge myself allegiance
To a better night's sleep at home
And the sweet, sweet sun's coming down hard
The sun's coming down hard
It burns the bones
So hold a hand for cover
Hold a hand for cover
Hold a hand for cover from harm
Talk don't change a thing
Ohh it's fading fader
The words don't sink their swims
Ohh it's fading fader
Bless
This mess, we tried our best
Cause it's all that we can do
While the angels walk with the lonely ones
In the cold rain to rescue you
And this fable world's coming down hard
The world's coming down hard
On all our homes
So hold a hand for cover
Hold a hand for cover
Hold a hand for cover from harm
Time don't change a thing
Ohh it's fading fader
The words don't sink their swims
Ohh, it's fading fader
Talk don't change a thing
Ohh, it's fading fader
(Fader, in transit)
The words don't sink their swims
Ohh, it's feeling fader
(The world's much sweeter, the world might be there)
Ohh, it's fading fader
(Fader, in transit)
Ohh, it's fading fader
(The world's much sweeter, the world might be there)
