There's no place I call the height (ahh-aahh)
There's no way in a mean street (ahh-aahh)
There's no happy medium(ahh-aahh)
There's no in between(ahh-aahh)
So do your searching, until you're down (ahh-aahh)
Then realise, you're on you're home ground(ahh-aahh)

Sittin' in a white room dreaming of a life
You have got me thinking, what is paradise?

Should I take an ocean drive, coolin' from the sun
Silver screen got me thinking this is how it should be done

Take me home (ahh-aahh)
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah (ahh-aahh)
Take me home (ahh-aahh)
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah (ahh-aahh)

Stand together alone, not knowing who you are
Friendly strangely, strangely friendly
Would you keep me warm?

Would you keep me warm?
You know, you can be your paradise
A heart can keep me warm
You can have your own dream life
Step into your comfort zone (Emma & Victoria)
Comfort zone

Take me home (ahh-aahh)
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah (ahh-aahh)
Take me home (ahh-aahh)
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah (ahh-aahh)

Ain't nobody to take me home
Cos I'm here, yes where I belong
I may leave cos I'm on my way
But my home it will always stay (spoken)

Ain't nobody to take me home
Cos I'm here, yes where I belong
I may leave cos I'm on my way
But my home it will always stay (spoken)

Ain't nobody to take me home
Cos I'm here, yes where I belong
I may leave cos I'm on my way
But my home it will always stay
(Repeat)

(Spoken in Counterpart)
So it's all just free falling falls
Huh, out of time
You've got yours, I've got mine
Should all this be so precious?
Maybe I should be a little humble?
Slate to fear, cause I could stumble
So do your searching until you're down
Cos you're on home ground

Take me home (ahh-aahh)
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah (ahh-aahh)
Take me home (ahh-aahh)
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah (ahh-aahh)
(Repeat to Fade)
