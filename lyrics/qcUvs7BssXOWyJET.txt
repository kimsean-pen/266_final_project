The judging eyes watching me
Is all I've ever known
When I try to open up my heart
I am ridiculed and torn apart
You tell jokes I'll never get to hear
Behind my back, at my expense
There's something inside me, and I know it's good
I'm not evil, just misunderstood

Do you see me now, do you hear me now?
You will know my name
Do you see me now, do you fear me now?
You will know my name

Today I break my silence
Strip you of your dignity
Tear down your perfect world
Your perfect lies
No more jokes I'll never get to hear
Behind my back, at my expense
There's something inside me, and I know it's good
I'm not evil, just misunderstood

Do you see me now, do you hear me now?
You will know my name
Do you see me now, do you fear me now?
You will know my name
No longer invisible
You will know my name

Do you see me now, do you hear me now?
You will know my name
Do you see me now, do you fear me now?
You will know my name
No longer invisible
You will know my name
