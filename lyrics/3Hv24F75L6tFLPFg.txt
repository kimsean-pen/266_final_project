Give you this, give you that
Blow a kiss, take it back
If I looked inside your brain
I would find lots of things
Clothes, shoes, diamond rings
Stuff that's driving me insane
You could be preoccupied, different date every night
You just got to say the word
That you're not into them at all, you just want materials
I should know because I've heard when girls say

I want, I want, I want
But that's crazy
I want, I want, I want
And that's not me
I want, I want, I want
To be loved by you

You've got everything you need, but you want accessories
Got to hold it in your hand
If I changed the world for you, I bet you wouldn't have a clue
Don't you know that I can't stand when girls say

I want, I want, I want
But that's crazy
I want, I want, I want
And that's not me
I want, I want, I want
To be loved by you
Oh, and all the girls say
I want, I want, I want
But that's crazy
I want, I want, I want
And that's not me
I want, I want, I want
To be loved by you

Be loved by you
I want it, I'll stay true
I wonder if you knew what you put me through
Would you want, you want, you want me to love you too?

I want, I want, I want
But that's crazy
I want, I want, I want
But that's not me
I want, I want, I want
To be loved by you

Oh, and all the girls say
I want, I want, I want
But that's crazy
I want, I want, I want
And that's not me
I want, I want, I want
To be loved by you (Want to be loved by you)
I want, I want, I want
And all the girls say
I want, I want, I want
And that's crazy
I want, I want, I want
To be loved by you
