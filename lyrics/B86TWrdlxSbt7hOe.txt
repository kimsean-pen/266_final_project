Ebony beauty, pass this shade
The looking glass relects
Then a voice calls me back
"This is just circumstance
It is not personal"
Oh no, it never is
Then you ram your hand in your bag
For a little friendly substance

By the time you're twenty five
They will say you've gone and blown it
By the time you're thirty five
I must confide you will have blown them all

Right on cue just act surprised
When they invite you to take
Your curtain call
You climbed China's wall
Your curtain call

I have done what I've done
And it has the ultimate consequence
Then a voice calls me back
"This is not business
No, it's more like spiritual"
Is that what it is?
Then you ram your hand in your bag
For a little protection

By the time you're twenty five
They will say you've gone and blown it
By the time you're thirty five
I must confide you will have blown them all

Right on cue just act surprised
When they invite you to take
Your curtain call
You climbed China's wall
Your curtain call
They closed China's wall
Curtain call

Ebony beauty, pass this shade
The looking glass relects
