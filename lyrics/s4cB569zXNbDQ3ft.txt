Mmm, mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo, ooh, yeah, yeah, uh, oh

You tried so hard to get
Right back inside my head
I'm not saying it was a real success
'Cause now you're lying here in my bed

I checked you're messages
Believe me every woman does this
Now I'm picking up my heart up off the floor
I ain't gon' do this no more

How could you hurt me like this?
You said you love me
I'm so much better than this
So you gotta go

Get up, get out
Take your **** up, get out my house
A million apologies later
You *** do it again

Get up get out
Boy, I dare you to turn around
A million apologies later
You *** do it again
You *** do it again

My god what a fool I've been
How could I not have seen?
That you were a lying, cheating
Love taker, stupid, mother *** heartbreaker

First time was bad enough
But I believed it you when you said it was done
Now I'm picking up my heart up off the floor
I ain't gon' do this no more

How could you hurt me like this?
You said you love me
I'm so much better than this
So you gotta go

Get up, get out
Take your **** up and get out my house
A million apologies later
You *** do it again

Get up, get out
Boy, I dare you to turn around
A million apologies later
You *** do it again
You *** do it again

And so the curtain closes on this fine romance
I can't believe I really gave you a chance
I will not let this become the story of my life
I'll still have hopes and dreams without you by my side

Get up, get out
Take your **** up and get out my house
A million apologies later
You *** do it again

Get up, get out
Boy, I dare you to turn around
A million apologies later
You *** do it again

Get up, get out
Take your **** up, get out my house
A million apologies later
You *** do it again

Get up, get out
Boy, I dare you to turn around
A million apologies later
You *** do it again
You *** do it again

Get up, get out
How could you do this to me?
