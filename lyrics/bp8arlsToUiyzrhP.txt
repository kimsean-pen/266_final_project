Can you see the dying children
Can you feel their pain?
Can you see the starving people
Praying in vain?

Can you see the hate between us
When a man kills another man?
Can you hear the mothers crying
When they lose their child?

Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord

Are you laughing
When people are praying
Did you ever listen to them
Do you think were already lost
Or do you have the final plan?
Can you see the hate between us
When a man kills another man?
Can you hear million mothers crying
When they lose their child?

Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord

Thank you for the pain
Thank you for the terror
Thank you for making us cry
Thank you for all the violence in the world
Thank you for every child that dies
Are you too old to fight against the demons
Or do you just don't care?
Are you afraid of the revenge of Lucifer
Was this all a mistake?

Praise the Lord
