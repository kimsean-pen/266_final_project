Death bring thy kiss

Rip doth thy scarlet claws
And bleed with sweet stings

Caress me

Till black turn my bones
Septic phantoms
Love to rot

As the darkest things in life
Doth make my heart
Rattle against my ribs
As the darkest things in life
Doth make my heart
Rattle against my ribs

Death bring thy kiss

Rip doth thy scarlet claws
And bleed with sweet stings

Caress me

Till black turn my bones
Septic phantoms
Love to rot

As the darkest things in life
Doth make my heart
Rattle against my ribs
As the darkest things in life
Doth make my heart
Rattle against my ribs
