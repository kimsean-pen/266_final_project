There's a time for not speaking out
I was amused by the casting of shouts
Walk by on a stupid whim
Into your neck where the theory begins
Never spoke of this you know
This is a place where we can't be candid
Cheecky smite that you could hear
Try to crawl into something
They didn't make
And miss the core

Already know that i'm wrong
So why obsess about what side i'm on
All this will fall into seed
I'm not approaching you
Cuz i'm afraid that you might move
I'll the color when i speak

This behavior has a right
And it's better than the counter
That you might
Lose some skin that you didn't have to fun
Reach the point and lose the joy
Reach the place and shut my mouth off
From your forearm shouts a tear
Crawling off into another growth
And it is steep
