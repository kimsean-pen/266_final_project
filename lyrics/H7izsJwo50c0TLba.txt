Free from the prisions of are past
the sentences and the fears that last
We have lost another blossom to the snow
Where our bridges burn
Where our bridges burn and glow
We were the great ghosts
In our pariah state
Old Gods on new streets
Outlook bleak
A twilight gold and grey

In the peaceful snow
In the peaceful snow
As my father knows
I will go into the
Into the snow
In the peaceful snow
In the peaceful snow
As my father knows
I will go into the
Into the snow

In the wilderness we're seeking
We finally came to stay
No longer the quarry
The hunted
The ones that got away
I chew the world out to such a degree
I can no longer hear properly
The crashing walls and the baying for blood
Vukovar with love
Cry a tear much on

In the peaceful snow
In the peaceful snow
As my father knows
I will go into the
Into the snow
In the peaceful snow
In the peaceful snow
As my father knows
I will go into the
Into the snow

We were the great ghosts
In our pariah state
Old Gods on new streets
Outlook bleak
A twilight gold and grey
Free from the prisons of our past
the sentences and the fears that last
We have lost another blossom to the snow
Where our bridges burn
Where our bridges burn and glow

In the peaceful snow
In the peaceful snow
As my father knows
I will go into the
Into the snow
In the peaceful snow
In the peaceful snow
As my father knows
I will go into the
Into the snow
In the peaceful snow
In the peaceful snow
