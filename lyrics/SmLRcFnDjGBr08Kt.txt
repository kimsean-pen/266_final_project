Early mornin'

All right, I was out real late last night
Got a little messy
(Early morning)
Can't be like that anymore, no

I was shaking my ass in the streets, I'm wrong
And just walked in and it's early morning
Bump-bump 'til the break of dawn
And it don't stop 'til the early morning

Passed out on the couch, I'm yawning
Just walked in and it's early morning
(Passed out again)
Bump-bump 'til the break of dawn
And it don't stop 'til the early morning

Met a tall dude, kind of dark hair
When he walked up, somebody grabbed him
But, I liked him, told him "Come here"
"Kind of cool, baby we can make plans"

"Where you live? Do your mama live there?"
"Or we could up at the hotel"
He was down, so I told him "Let's go"
What happened next? Guess what? You don't want to know

I was shaking my ass in the streets, I'm wrong
And just walked in and it's early morning
Bump-bump 'til the break of dawn
And it don't stop 'til the early morning

Passed out on the couch, I'm yawning
Just walked in and it's early morning
Bump-bump 'til the break of dawn
And it don't stop 'til the early morning

I went out with my girl Jen
And we called up Gabe and his friends
They was talking 'bout hitting up a show
So I said, "What the hell? Let's go"

Got up and got on the dance floor
Hooked up with a guy named Joe
When the music was fast, danced slow
What happened next? Guess what? You don't want to know

I was shaking my ass in the streets, I'm wrong
And just walked in and it's early morning
Bump-bump 'til the break of dawn
And it don't stop 'til the early morning

Passed out on the couch, I'm yawning
Just walked in and it's early morning
Bump-bump 'til the break of dawn
And it don't stop 'til the early morning

Call all your boys
Call all your girls
Call all your friends
Let's do it again, let's do it again

Shoo-wop, shoo-wop! Yes
(Can't, can't, can't keep doing this)
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop! Yes
(Can't, can't, can't keep doing this)

I light your fire, your one desire
Pull on me, baby and I'll take you higher
(I want to get with you)
You should try her, so come over here and let's go
So, oh

I was shaking my ass in the streets, I'm wrong
And just walked in and it's early morning
Bump-bump 'til the break of dawn
And it don't stop 'til the early morning

Passed out on the couch, I'm yawning
Just walked in and it's early morning
Bump-bump 'til the break of dawn
And it don't stop 'til the early morning

Call all your boys
Call all your girls
Call all your friends
Let's do it again, let's do it a-

Early morning
Early morning
