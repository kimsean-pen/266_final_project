Take me with you when you go, down to the river
It's the only place I know where I can forgive her
Take me with you when you go
I'm tired of living life on hold
Take me with you when you go...

Down to the river, down to the river
Down to the river, oh I know!

Take a walk with me a while, it's quiet by the river
Oh I know that she's gone but I can't forget her
Take me with you when you go
It's the only place Iknow
We lost the dreams that we once had
How did our lives turn out so bad?
Take me with you when you go...

Down to the river, down to the river
Down to the river, oh I know
Down to the river, I can't forget her
I'll stay forever and watch it flow

Take me with you when you go
Lady's bridge is where we know
Now that our lives turned out so bad
We lost the dream that we once had
We can watch the river flow
And maybe make this city slow
Take me with you when you go...

Down to the river, down to the river
Down to the river, oh I know
Down to the river, I can't forget her
I'll stay forever and watch it flow
