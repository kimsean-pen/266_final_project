Sing a song to my beloved friends dear Simon
And also when I look for you, there comes silence
I'm still trying to remember all your names
I just wonder how you feel,
Comes silence

Nowadays gravestones swerving around me
And someday it's forgotten
Moody mind will pass away
At heaven's gate remember me
Who knows my grief, pain inside
Do I have choice of what to do
Remains silence
Just silence

Cross the line we've never been before
I know it's useless
But I did try and I won't mind
Cross the line we never been before
I do try I won't lie
Only heaven knows without who knows
