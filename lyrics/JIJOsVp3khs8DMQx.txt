On a lonely planet
There's chaos and there's high
And everybody's looking
For someone who is gonna share their life
When times are feeling empty
You advertise your heart
One in seven billion
All of us just trying to play a part
You can go searching to find someone new
Love just comes out of, out of the blue
Whatever's waitin', is waitin' for you
Love just comes out of, out of the blue
Out of the blue
On a lonely planet
We try to keep ahold
Of all our expectations
But love's a power out of our control
You can go searching to find someone new
Love just comes out of, out of the blue
Whatever's waitin', is waitin' for you
Love's gonna find you, out of the blue
Out of the blue
Somewhere round the corner
The one you're lookin' for
Will walk right through the door
Someone who is gonna share their life
You can go searching to find someone new
Love just comes out of, out of the blue
Whatever's waitin', is waitin' for you
Love just comes out of, out of the blue
You can go searching to find someone new (Oh, searching)
Love just comes out of, out of the blue (Out of the blue)
Whatever's waitin', is waitin' for you (It is waiting)
Love just comes out of, out of the blue
Out of the blue
Love is waiting
Out of the blue
You know that love, love comes
Out of the blue
Love is waiting
Out of the blue
You know that love, love comes
Out of the blue
