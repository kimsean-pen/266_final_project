Take him out back
Take him out back
Take him out back

I'm not too sure what I'm supposed to do with this
These hands, this mind, this instability
From a cage I created, to a hell that heaven made
Can't let go of the hatred 'cause I love the way it tastes

Take him out back

I wouldn't take back a moment
Not one miserable moment
I'll give it all till there's nothing
I'll walk into the fire, into the fire
I'll walk into the fire, into the fire
Into the fire

I've come to terms with the fact I'll never change
And that's just fine, I find solace in the pain
I don't mind the darkness, it's easy on the eyes
I'm praying for something to make me feel alive

I wouldn't take back a moment
Not one miserable moment
I'll give it all till there's nothing
I'll walk into the fire, into the fire
I'll walk into the fire, into the fire
Into the fire

I wouldn't take back a moment
I'll walk into the fire, into the fire
I'll walk into the fire, into the fire
Into the fire
Fire

Take him out back
