It's just amusing
The way you've found to say
You're not in this anymore

It's very confusing
To be the one who's left alone
What have I done the night before?

There's always a way
To say that you need time
There's always a way
To say you're no longer mine

Now who's gonna save me?
Who's gonna make me feel alright?
You can't just erase me
How can you sleep at night?

It's been only four days
But it's feeling like a month or two
It's getting impossible to smile

And I know that always
We're doomed to cross each others path
I just can't see you for a while

There's always a way
It's not about right and wrong
Uh, there's always a better way
To make me not write this song

Now who's gonna save me?
Who's gonna make me feel alright?
You can't just erase me
How can you sleep at night?

But why am I always the one
Who ends up in need for a hand to take me out of the bottom
Why am I always like this?
Someone tell me please, yeah

Why the sun never rises up
When I'm scared of the night?
I can't see the light
Because there is no one
There is no one
There is no one

Who's gonna save me?
Who's gonna make me feel alright?
You just can't erase me
But how can you sleep at night?

Who's gonna save me?
Who's gonna be with me tonight?
You just can't erase me
How can you sleep at night?
