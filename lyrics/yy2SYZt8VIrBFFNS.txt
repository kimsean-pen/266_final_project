Left you behind
Fallin' apart, I can't deny
Where do I start
I'm finally free
Burning bridges, now I can breathe
Healing stitches

Left you behind
Fallin' apart, I can't deny
Where do I start
I'm finally free
Burning bridges, now I can breathe
Healing stitches

Time to move on
Need to let go
You can't keep hurting
Thought you should know

Time to move on
Need to let go
You can't keep hurting
Thought you should know

Left you behind
Fallin' apart, I can't deny
Where do I start
I'm finally free
Burning bridges, now I can breathe
Healing stitches

Left you behind
Fallin' apart, I can't deny
Where do I start
I'm finally free
Burning bridges, now I can breathe.
