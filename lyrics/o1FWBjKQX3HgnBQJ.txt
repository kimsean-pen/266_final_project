Starry nights, sunny days
I always thought that love should be that way
Then comes a time that you're ridden with doubt
You've loved all you can and now you're all loved out
Oooh-oooh baby, we've been a long, long way
And who's to say where we'll be tomorrow
Well my heart says, no
But my mind says, it's so
That we've got a love
Is it a love to stay

We've got a wham, bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la thing

Wham bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la thing
Looking at you I wanted to say
I think a little emotion goes a long, long way
Careful now don't get caught in your dreams

Look out baby this is not what it seems
Oooh-oooh baby, you've been so good to me
But please don't make it what it's not

Well, I thought we agreed on what we need

So listen to me and I'll tell you what we've got

We've got a wham, bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la thing

Wham bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la thing
I think you're seeing what I've been saying

'Cause I hear you singing to the tune I'm playing

Now that it's said and we both understand
Let's say our goodbyes before it gets out of hand
Bye, bye baby, I'd really like to stay
But we'll remember the best time in our lives
We had a wham, bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la thing
Wham bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la thing
Wham bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la thing
