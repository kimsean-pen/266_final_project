The weight is heavy, I know
I'm not ready to lift it, been better at letting it go
You're a big school kid with a heart drawn out like a map
My ideas are much smaller, my brain is scattered at best
I don't think there's anything left to know
I'm too tired tonight
And it goes, and goes, and goes
I saw you then, I looked right in your face
But you give me half light, the full thing I know it waits
I thought I'd see it in the sweet of the springtime
I thought I'd see you, somewhere down the line
But I don't
Oh no, I'm too tired tonight
And it goes, and goes, and goes
I'll remember you in the best of times
Your big school heart and a bottle of wine
You can treat me unkind tonight
But I won't let that leave my side
I'll think of you in the summertime
I'll be alright, I'll be happy tonight
