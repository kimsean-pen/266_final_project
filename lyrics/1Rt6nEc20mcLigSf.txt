There's a big old hole
Goes right through the sole
Of this old shoe

And the water on the ground ain't got no places it's fine
So its only got one thing left to do
Just creep on in
Creep on in
Creep on in

And once it has begun it won't stop until it's done
Sneakin' in

There's a silver moon
Came a little too soon
Oh for me to bear
It shines brightly on my bed and the shadow's over head
Won't let me sleep as long as it's there

Just creep on in
Creep on in
Creep on in

And once it has begun won't stop until it's done
Sneakin' in

Creep on in
Creep on in

And once it has begun won't stop until it's done
Sneakin' in

There's a big old hole
Goes right through my soul
Oh that ain't nothin' new

So as long as you're around
I got no place else you've found
There's only one thing left for you to do

I just creep on in
Creep on in
Creep on in

And once you have begun don't stop until you're done
Sneakin' in

And once it has begun it won't stop until it's done
Sneakin' in

And once it has begun it won't stop until it's done
Sneakin' in
Sneakin' in
Sneakin' in
Sneakin' in
Creepin' in
Sneakin' in
Sneakin' in
Sneakin' in
Sneakin' in
Sneakin' in
Creepin' in
You want to keep creepin' on in
Creep
Creepin' in
