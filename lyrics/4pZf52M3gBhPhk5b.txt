Yeah,

With a boy like that, it's serious
There's a boy who is so wonderful
The girls who see him kinda follow him back home
And the gigolos run like spiders when he comes

'Cause he is Eros and he's Apollo
Girls, with a boy like that, it's serious
Senoritas, don't follow him
Soon he'll eat your hearts like cereals

Sweet Lolitas, don't go, you're still young
But every night, they fall like dominos

How he does it, only heaven knows
All the other men turn gay wherever he goes

Wow!
Girls, with a boy like that, it's serious
Senoritas, don't follow him
Soon he'll eat your hearts like cereals

Sweet Lolitas, don't go, you're still young
Yeah, with a boy like that, it's serious
Senoritas, don't go, please don't go
Soon, he'll eat your hearts like cereals
Sweet Lolitas, don't go, you're still young
Sweet Lolitas, don't go, you're still young
