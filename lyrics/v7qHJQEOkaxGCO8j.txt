Friday night and I need a fight
My motorcycle and a switchblade knife
Handful of grease in my hair feels right
But what I need to make me tight are those
Girls, girls, girls
Long legs and burgundy lips
Girls, girls, girls
Dancin' down on Sunset Strip
Girls, girls, girls
Red lips, fingertips
Trick or treat, sweet to eat
On Halloween and New Year's Eve
Yankee girls you just can't be beat
But you're the best when you're off your feet
Girls, girls, girls
At the Dollhouse in Ft. Lauderdale
Girls, girls, girls
Rocking in Atlanta at Tattletails
Girls, girls, girls
Raising Hell at the 7th Veil
Have you read the news
In the Soho Tribune
Ya know she did me
Well then she broke my heart
I'm such a good good boy
I just need a new toy
I tell you what, girl
Dance for me
I'll keep you overemployed
Just tell me a story
You know the one I mean
Crazy Horse, Paris, France
Forgot the names, remember romance
I got the photos, a menage a trois
Musta broke those French's laws with those
Girls, girls, girls
At the Body Shop and the Marble Arch
Girls, girls, girls
Tropicana's where I lost my heart
Girls, girls, girls
(Hey Tommy, check out that man)
(What, Vince, where?)
(Right there) (hey)
Hey baby, don't you wanna go somewhere? (girls, girls, girls)
Girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls, girls
