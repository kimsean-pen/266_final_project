Kicking up dust on an empty street
Waiting for John, Brian and Liz
I've already been stopped by the police
They're getting kicks, I'm feeling sick

Chorus. And I'm thinking - thinking of the USA
Thinking of the USA
Dreaming of the USA

10.30 and the band is still not on the stage
The kids are getting restless but all have to be paid
I really think that I should not stay
I need a rest .I need a drink
Chorus. And I'm thinking - thinking of the USA
Thinking of the USA
Dreaming of the USA

12.45 at the Roxy Club
And I'm tired of just hanging around
I need some sleep, I am so tired
All these people making crazy sounds

Chorus
USA-USA-USA-USA
Chorus

Walter Lure comes from the USA
Lou Reed comes from the USA
Richard Nixon comes from the USA
Gary Gilmore came from the USA
