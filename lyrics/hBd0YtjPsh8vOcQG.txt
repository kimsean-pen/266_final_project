Wake me wandering through the night
Over any height, overdone it right
there's nothing I wouldn't do for you
and there's nothing that I can do

please get over yourself
please get over everyone else
your mother made it herself
and everybody asked how
how are you doing
how are you
please tell me the truth
the uselessness of me
the uselessness of you
ending up as a bride on the moon

Water flowing everywhere
what a desperate day care
children painting parents flying
children nailing nails to make what will never sell

take my body from me
I'm reduced to need
spend the night praying to jesus
to have jesus pray to me

he says how are you doing
how are you
please tell me the truth
the uselessness of me
the uselessness of you
ending up as a bride on the moon
