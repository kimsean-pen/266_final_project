Where do you go from here
It's dragging you under
Nothing could be more clear
When you are the hunter
Is that a dream to die for?
The price, you keep it
Out of the light
Nothing can shine
Left in the dark
Far from their eyes
Under black water
There is no halo
Only the hunger
And you're in for a kill
You and your twisted minds
It's making us shiver
How can we be so blind?
The fear you deliver
It's all a grand illusion
The trick, you keep it
Out of the light
Nothing can shine
Left in the dark
Far from their eyes
Under black water
There is no halo
Only the hunger
And you're in for a kill
It's all a grand illusion
The trick, you keep it
Out of the light
Nothing can shine
Left in the dark
Far from their eyes
Under black water
There is no halo
Only the hunger
And you're in for a kill
You're in for a kill
Under black water
There is no halo
Only the hunger
You're in for a kill
