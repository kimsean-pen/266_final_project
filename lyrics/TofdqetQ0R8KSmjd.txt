Let 'em in, kill 'em then
They proud of all my fuckin' friends, missing men
I think I fell in love again in Michigan
The whip right there, and it's parked outside
Let 'em in, kill 'em then
They proud of all my fuckin' friends, missing men
I think I fell in love again in Michigan
The whip right there, and it's parked outside

Let us stay for more pain
Let us stay for more rain
Let us stay for more rain
Let us stay for more rain
Let us stay for more days
Let us stay for more pain
Let us pray for more rain
Let us pray for more rain

But who really knows? (Let us stay for more pain)
But who really knows? (Let us stay for more pain)

Wild child
Been along for a while now
If you gotta turn it down, down
Wild child
Been along for a while now
If you gotta turn it down, down
And the whip right there, and it's parked outside

I get, I get, I get
Let us stay for more rain
I get, I get, I get
Let us pray for more rain
Let us stay for more pain
Let us stay for more rain
Let us stay for more rain
I'll be waiting for you
Let us stay for more days
Let us stay for more pain
Let us pray for more rain
I'm always lookin' for you
