you know you've taken me over
but now you want me to leave
and I can sometimes do bad things
don't make me beg for it please

cuz you do
what I love
and I was only saying when we're alone
in my arms
I wish you knew how it feels to hold you
up
late at night
like it's 10am
I want you here
it's unreal
and now I let you take me over

mind control
you're using mind control
mind control
I'm under your control

I'm going crazy about you
I gotta get my head clear
I gotta get it together
I'm losing sleep over here
you got me just where you want me
you got my face on tv
you know you could just come take me
but now you're starting to fear

cuz I do
what you love
and you were only saying when we were alone
in my arms
you wish I knew how it feels to be held
up
late at night
like it's 10am
you want me here
it's unreal
and now you let me take you over

mind control
I'm using mind control
mind control
you're under my control
mind control
we're using mind control
mind control
we're under mind control
