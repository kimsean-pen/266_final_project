through the street lights and forfeited lanes
with a trunk full of everything that we could get
there is a place that磗 safe for those who know no better
that磗 where we keep our hideout hidden

we磖e travelling destinationless
with an open ticket for a one way trip
free of any expectations
and careless while they crack that whip

if the sun won磘 come up tomorrow
this is where i want to be
no way of knowing how much time you have borrowed
i try to keep mine free

we磖e travelling destinationless
with an open ticket for a one way trip
free of any expectations
and careless while they crack that whip

what would you decide
when ignorance can be such bliss

you see a car full of zeros
destined to die unsatisfied
i don磘 need to know where we going
i can still enjoy the ride

we磖e travelling destinationless
with an open ticket for a one way trip
free of any expectations
and careless while they crack that whip

what would you decide
when ignorance can be such bliss
