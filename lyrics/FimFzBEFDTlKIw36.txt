How many lies do we have to tell?
To keep from saying that I wish you well
How many times, I said I'm moving on?
How many times that false alarm goes off (goes off), goes off (goes off)?
I know, I'll see you tomorrow

'Cause I'm bad at letting you go, letting you go
Letting you go, letting you go
Moving on, moving on
Moving on, moving on
I'm ready to go, ready to go
Ready to throw, ready to throw
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boomerang, boomerang

How many tears do we have to cry?
How many sleepless lonely nights?
To work it out, is it worth it now?

Should we go ahead or should we turn around?
I know, I'll see you tomorrow

'Cause I'm bad at letting you go, letting you go
Letting you go, letting you go
Moving on, moving on
Moving on, moving on
I'm ready to go, ready to go
Ready to throw, ready to throw
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boomerang, boomerang

Just because it isn't easy, doesn't mean that it is wrong
Everything that we have been working on, working on so long

You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boomer-boomer-boomerang

Letting you go, letting you go (boomerang)
Letting you go, letting you go (boomerang)
Moving on, moving on (boomerang)
Moving on, moving on (boomerang)
I'm ready to go, ready to go (boomerang)
Ready to throw, ready to throw

You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boomerang, boomerang

Letting you go, letting you go (boomerang)
Letting you go, letting you go (boomerang)
Moving on, moving on (boomerang)
Moving on, moving on (boomerang)
I'm ready to go, ready to go (boomerang)
Ready to throw, ready to throw (boomerang)
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boomerang, boomerang
