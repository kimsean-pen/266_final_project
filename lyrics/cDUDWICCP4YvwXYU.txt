Beautiful little fools
That's what us girls are destined for
Beautiful little fools
Born to be adored

Where is the feminine race?
Where are these so-called independent women?
Who pick up their flaws
And let the world in
Where are these girls?

Beautiful little fools
That's what us girls are destined for
Beautiful little fools
Born to be adored

Most of these girls pick up her brush
They might not like art, but their face is a canvas
Designing something that is not their reflection
Becoming a beautiful little Hollywood perception

Beautiful little fools
That's what us girls are destined for
Beautiful little fools
Born to be adored

Didn't your mother ever tell you love yourself?
Well if your mother was Elda or Daisy, I guess not
Why can't you be a beautiful little girl
Instead of being a beautiful little fool?
I guess we're all just beautiful little girls
Playing a game of being fooled, yeah

Beautiful little fools
That's what us girls are destined for
Beautiful little fools
Born to be adored

Beautiful little fools, no
We're all just born to be adored
We're beautiful little fools
We're all just born to be adored
