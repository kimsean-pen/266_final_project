Taking it
Soft in the chest
Talking eyes
Sensitive breath
You're alive
Since a long time
There's nowhere to hide
That I can't find

Tracing the lines
Testing the noose
Coffin or not
I'm coming with you
You were mine
Before you would know
Grotesque and fine
Whenever you show

Further now
We step in the dark
Deeper I feel
The blade in the heart
You remind me
Of someone I know
Is it yours or mine
The blood in the snow
