Caught between one thick line
I can never see you in the dark
Can you see at all?
Can you see at all?
Can you see at all?

And now you go (Slip me the Vicodin)
This world is upside down
Night at the symphony
The bar is closing down (And now you go)
Slip me an antidote
Empty the cashbox out

And now you go (Slip me the Vicodin)
This world is upside down
Night at the symphony
The bar is closing down (And now you go)
Slip me an antidote
Empty the cashbox out

And I don't know why
I don't know why I fight for you this way
Fight for you this way
Fight for you this way
(Take the call and quickly lie about)
(Who you've been seeing lately)
(Then forget about it all)

Stage lights are burning up
Running faster to this spot
Stare at empty faces
Torn from all these places
And I won't go

Mace yourself, blame someone else
Fall face down, fluid leaking out your eyeballs
Mace yourself, blame someone else
It's okay, no one will believe you
Mace yourself, blame someone else
Fall face down, fluid leaking out your eyeballs
Mace yourself, blame someone else
It's okay, no one will believe you now

And I believed you're not okay
And I won't go far
And I believed you're not okay

And I don't know why
I don't know why I fight for you this way
Fight for you this way
Fight for you this way
(Take the call and quickly lie about)
(Who you've been seeing lately)
(Then forget about it all)

Hey girl, you're the best
I'm a sucker, maybe I should fuck her now
