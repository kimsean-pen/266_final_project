C'mon man

And with the local DDC news, LL Cool J with a triumphant comeback
But tonight...

Don't call it a comeback, I been here for years
I'm rockin' my peers, puttin' suckers in fear
Makin' the tears rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom
Explosions, overpowerin'
Over the competition, I'm towerin'
Wrecking shop, when I drop
These lyrics that'll make you call the cops
Don't you dare stare
You better move, don't ever compare
Me to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced
Competition's payin' the price

I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh)

Don't you call this a regular jam
I'm gonna rock this land
I'm gonna take this itty-bitty world by storm
And I'm just getting warm
Just like Muhammad Ali, they called him Cassius
Watch me bash this beat like a skull
Don'tcha know I had beef wit'
Why do you riff with me, a maniac psycho
And when I pull out my jammy, get ready 'cause it might go
Blauh! How ya like me now?
The ripper will not allow
You to get wit' Mr. Smith don't riff
Listen to my gear shift
I'm blastin', outlastin'
Kinda like shaft, so you could say I'm shaftin'
Olde English filled my mind
And I came up with a funky rhyme

I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh)

Breakdown

Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie

Shadow boxin' when I heard you on the radio
Uuh, I just don't know
What made you forget that I was raw?
But now I gotta new tour
I'm going insane startin' a hurricane, releasin' pain
Lettin' you know, you can't gain or maintain
Unless you say my name
Rippin', killin', diggin' and drillin' a hole
Pass the Ol' Gold

I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh)

Shotgun blasts are heard
When I rip and kill, at will
The man of the hour, tower of power, I'll devour
I'm gonna tie you up and let you understand
That I'm not your average man
When I gotta jammy in my hand
Damn, ooh
Listen to the way I slay, your crew
Damage (Uhh), damage (Uhh), damage (Uhh), damage
Destruction, terror and mayhem
Pass me a sissy, so suckas I'll slay him
Farmers (What), farmers (What?)
I'm ready! (We're ready)
I think I'm gonna bomb a town (Get down)
Don't you never, ever, pull my lever
'Cause I explode
And my nine is easy to load
I gotta thank God
'Cause he gave me the strength to rock, hard
Knock you out, mama said knock you out (Huuh)

I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh)
