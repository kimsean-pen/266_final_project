Called to the ring
Taking me round by round
It hurts and it stings
Taking me down, down, down.

You think that you caught me
I can hear you taunt me
Fractured and I'm falling down
My enemy is watching me bleed.
But I'm not dead yet, so watch me burn
Go trying, lying, you're so sure
I may be broken, but I'm not done
I'll go burning this breath in my lungs
'Cause I'm not dead yet
No, I'm not dead yet.
Look for the day
That I'll be counted out
You stand at my grave
Already breaking ground.
But I don't think you know me
There's a side you don't see
Been to hell and made it out
My enemy, I watch you bleed.
But I'm not dead yet, so watch me burn
Go trying, lying, you're so sure
I may be broken, but I'm not done
I'll go burning this breath in my lungs
'Cause I'm not dead yet
No, I'm not dead yet.
I'm still awake
I won't go away
It's gonna take my life
You can break
Calling my name.
Heaven is calling my name.
But I'm not dead yet, so watch me burn
Go trying, lying, you're so sure
I may be broken, but I'm not done
I'll go burning this breath in my lungs
'Cause I'm not dead yet
No, I'm not dead yet.
I'm still awake
I won't go away
It's gonna take my life
You can break
