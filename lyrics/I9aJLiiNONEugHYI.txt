Losing hope
Wondering when this tide will change
So alone
No one to light the way
Feel the coldness of these northern winds all down my spine
All I'm asking, please, just let me know

Must I wait like this in the wilderness [?]
Feel the pressure build as the blood get spilt I can't stand it
Must I wait like this in the wilderness [?]
As you spread your lies with
It's just scandalous

Seems everyday, news of another tragedy
So much pain
Piece by piece it's eroding me
Feel the coldness of these northern winds all down my spine
All I'm asking, please, just let me know

Must I wait like this in the wilderness [?]
Feel the pressure build as the blood get spilt I can't stand it
Must I wait like this in the wilderness [?]
As you spread your lies with
It's just scandalous

Losing hope

So alone

Feel the coldness of these northern winds all down my spine
