I was safe when I was in the womb
I was warm when I was wrestling to get out
Out of the flesh
And the sound of the world filled easily
And the eyes above watched eagerly
In the hope of the nave
In the hopes of a change
It was all bright, clear
It was all bright, clear

Deep in the nest of an endless dream
When a stranger thought becomes of me
It can slowly turn my blood
Just as the rings around our ever burning sun
Eventually wilt a once freshly blooming bud
It was all bright, clear
Subtlely shedding back the years
And after it all we soon disappeared
Yes, into the dark depths we all soon disappeared
Out of this labyrinth that makes our world
How do we ever know the light inside ourselves?
To know that the skin that we wear is raw
That we can be anything if we know anything at all
Yes, we can be anything if we know anything at all
Bright, clear
And it was bright, clear
