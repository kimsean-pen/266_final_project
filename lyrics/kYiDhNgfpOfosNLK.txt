Now as the early light is catching the folds
Black lace and satin wrapped
Wrapped up against her face
She turns her frozen steps
To break the frost and cold
Beyond the misty bay, still sleeping to the east

Too many miles (too many miles)
She hears the seabirds call
(She hears the seabirds call)
Her captain's ship (her captain's ship)
She waits for wind and sail

Below the breaking point, the tide will ebb and fall
The storm is silent now
As silent as the dawn
Above the rocks and cliffs
She watches all the while
She waits for distant sails that never will return

Too many miles (too many miles)
She hears the seabirds call
(She hears the seabirds call)
Her captain's ship
She waits for wind and sail
(She waits for wind and sail)

Below the breaking point, the tide will ebb and fall
Above the rocks and cliffs
She watches all the while

Too many miles
She hears the seabirds call
Her captain's ship
She waits for wind and sail

Too many miles (too many miles)
She hears the seabirds call
Her captain's ship (her captain's ship)
She waits for wind and sail

She hears the seabirds call
She waits for wind and sail
She waits for wind and sail
