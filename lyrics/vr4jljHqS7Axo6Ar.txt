There's only one thing that I long for
When I reach that heavenly land
To see my Jesus in His glory
As I go from land to land

There's only one thing that I long for
When I reach that heavenly land
And I know, I know we shall see Him
In that sweet, oh My Lord, peaceful rest

Without a mother, without a father
We got to beat this journey by myself
Heart-breaking pain, all left in shame
But our journey, here along

There's only one thing that I long for
When I reach that heavenly land
And I know, I know I shall see Him
In that sweet, oh My Lord, peaceful rest

Without a mother, without a father
We got to beat this journey by myself
Heart-breaking pain, all left in shame
But our journey, here along

There's only one thing that I long for
When I reach that heavenly land
And I know, I know I shall see Him
In that sweet, oh yes, peaceful rest
