I am a light sleeper
But I am a heavy dreamer
My imagination gives me wings
And I can go anywhere

And when I wander away, to some other place
I'm suddenly there, way up in the air
Where passenger trains catch fire and fill the sky with flames
And that black rabbit of death
Wakes up in a breath, of beautiful dreams
My heartache it seems, so terribly vain
Where fire and diamonds fall like rain

Do you believe in endless miracles?
Do you believe in the impossible?
Do you believe sleep is a time machine?
Do you believe in curiosity?
Do you believe in what you cannot see?
Do you believe life is a Lucid Dream?

Well that's how you study the stars
That's how you study the stars
And that's how you know 'em by heart
Life is a Lucid Dream

Such is the path of a dreamer
I find my way by moonlight
My imagination gives me wings
And I can go anywhere

And when I wander away, to some other place
I'm suddenly there, way up in the air
Where passenger trains catch fire and fill the sky with flames
And that black rabbit of death
Wakes up in a breath, of beautiful dreams
My heartache it seems, so terribly vain
Where fire and diamonds fall like rain

Do you believe in endless miracles?
Do you believe in the impossible?
Do you believe sleep is a time machine?
Do you believe in curiosity?
Do you believe in what you cannot see?
Do you believe life is a Lucid Dream?

Well that's how you study the stars
That's how you study the stars
And that's how you know 'em by heart
Life is a Lucid Dream
Well that's how you study the stars
That's how you study the stars
And that's how you know 'em by heart
Life is a Lucid Dream

I am a light sleeper
But I am a heavy dreamer
