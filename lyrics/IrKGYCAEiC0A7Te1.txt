Think about the love inside the strength of heart
Think about the heroes savin' life in the dark
Climbin' higher through the fire, time was runnin' out
Never knowin' you weren't going to be comin' down alive
But you still came back for me
You were strong and you've believed

Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Be strong, believe
Be strong, believe

Think about the chance I never had to say
Thank you for giving up your life that day
Never fearing, only hearing voices callin' out
Let it all go, the life that you know, just to bring it down alive
And you still came back for me
You were strong and you've believed

Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Be strong, believe

Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Be strong, believe

{Again today, we take into our hearts and minds
Those who perished on this site one year ago
And also those who came to toil in the rubble
To bring order out of chaos

To help us make sense of our despair}
Wanna hold my wife when I get home
Wanna tell the kids they'll never know
How much I love to see them smile
Wanna make a change right here right now

Wanna live a life like you somehow
Wanna make your sacrifice worthwhile
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright

Everything is gonna be alright
Be strong, believe
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright

Everything is gonna be alright
Be strong, believe
Think about the love inside the strength of heart
(Everything is gonna be alright)

(Everything is gonna be alright)
Think about the heroes saving life in the dark
(Everything is gonna be alright)
(Be strong, believe)
Think about the chance I never had to say
(Everything is gonna be alright)
(Everything is gonna be alright)
Thank you for giving up your life that day
(Everything is gonna be alright)
(Be strong, believe)
{The world will little note
Nor long remember what we say here
But it can never forget what they did here}
