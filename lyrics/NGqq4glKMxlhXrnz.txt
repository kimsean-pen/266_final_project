Stand by me
Oh my darlin'
Stand by me

I walked through a pool of water
And I seen the shadow of a broken-hearted girl
Pictured us walking to the altar
For better or for worse

Why don't you stand?
Stand by me
Oh my darlin'
Stand by me
'Cause we gon' make a movie, a movie
And it's gon' be in 3D, in 3D
And we gon' make a movie, a movie
And it's gon' be in 3D, in 3D

Why don't you stand?
Stand by me
Oh my darlin'
Stand by me

I ain't pop no molly
But you still got me sweating
What happened to that feeling?
We'll never get it back
I ain't take no shots, but used to got me hot
What happened to the feeling? I wish it wouldn't stop
We were supposed to be together
We were supposed to be together

They say that love can hit you so fast
Plenty odds are running out of time
But our on the borderwalk baby
Take me as I am or not
I can't breath without you, without you, as mine

Why don't you stand?
Stand by me
Oh my darlin'
Stand by me
'Cause we gon' make a movie, a movie
And it's gon' be in 3D, in 3D
And we gon' make a movie, a movie
And it's gon' be in 3D, in 3D

My darlin', stand by me
3D, movie, 3D, 3D
Why don't you stand?
Stand by me
Oh my darlin'
Stand by me
'Cause we gon' make a movie, a movie
And it's gon' be in 3D, in 3D
And we gon' make a movie, a movie
And it's gon' be in 3D, in 3D
Why don't you stand?
Stand by me
Oh my darlin'
Stand by me
