I heat up
I can't cool down
Got me spinnin' 'round and 'round
'Round and 'round and 'round it goes
Where it stops nobody knows

Every time you call my name
I heat up like a burnin' flame
Burnin' flame full of desire
Kiss me baby
Let the fire get higher

Abra-abracadabra
I want to reach out and grab ya
Abra-abracadabra
Abracadabra

You make me hot
You make me sigh
You make me laugh
Make me cry
Keep me burnin' for your love
With the touch of a velvet glove

Abra-abracadabra
I want to reach out and grab ya
Abra-abracadabra
Abracadabra

I feel the magic in your caress
I feel magic when I touch your dress
Silk and satin
Leather and lace
Black panties with an angel's face

I see magic in your eyes
I hear the magic in your sighs
Just when I think I'm gonna get away
I hear those words that you always say

Abra-abracadabra
I want to reach out and grab ya
Abra-abracadabra
Abracadabra

Every time you call my name
I heat up like a burnin' flame
Burnin' flame full of desire
Kiss me baby
Let the fire get higher...
Yeah, yeah...

I heat up
I can't cool down
My situation goes ('round and 'round)
I heat up
I can't cool down
My situation goes ('round and 'round)
I heat up
I can't cool down
My situation goes ('round and 'round)
I heat up, I heat up
I can't cool down
My situation goes 'round and 'round and 'round

I heat up, I heat up
I can't cool down
My situation goes 'round and 'round and 'round

I heat up, I heat up
And 'round (repeat to fade)
