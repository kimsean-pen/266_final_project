What can I do?
Life's lost its spark, please tell me
Does it speak to you?
My heart's gone deaf, my lungs are failing
Faithful envy takes its toll
My heart, my soul
It's all for you, it's all for you

I wanna feel something
Lately I can barely stand
I wanna feel something
A sign of life
Maybe someday you'll be with me
Until then I'll numb the pain
Sweet serenity, don't forget me
All in due time

Maybe tides shift only for you...

I can't see the rising sun behind these fading eyes
Relapsing thoughts of what I should've done before you ran me dry
Oh, I tried to face the world alone
But I can't, and I won't

I wanna feel something
Lately I can barely stand
I wanna feel something
A sign of life
Maybe someday you'll be with me
Until then I'll numb the pain
Sweet serenity, don't forget me
All in due time

Maybe someday you'll be with me
Until then I'll numb the pain
Sweet serenity, don't forget me
Here from now on

Faith can't reverse what's been done
Fate bends to the will of none

I wanna feel something
Lately I can barely stand
I wanna feel something
A sign of life
Maybe someday you'll be with me
Until then I'll numb the pain
Sweet serenity, don't forget me
All in due time
