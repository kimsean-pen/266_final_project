Emerald green
You shine of hope and dreams
Crystal blue
You see me through
Rubin red
You left my heart for dead
Diamond bright
Purest delight
Don't you see?
I tried to set you free
I wanted you to be
My one true love
Talk to me
Reveal how you feel
Does your life still feel so unreal?

Won't you ever realise?
Our world's on fire
You're still living in denial
My love
Won't you take me by the hand?
We're off to Neverland
We will watch the sun descend
Never again

Ardent gold
Embracing me so cold
Silver lines
Of sweet decline
Onyx black
Fierce as a heart attack
Sapphire
Burn with desire
Don't you see?
I tried to set you free
I wanted you to be
My one true love
Talk to me
Reveal how you feel
Does your life still feel so unreal?

Does your life still feel so unreal?

Won't you ever realise?
Our world's on fire
You're still living in denial
My love
Won't you take me by the hand?
We're off to Neverland
We will watch the sun descend
Never again

Can't you see you're my will to be?
My eyes are fixed on you, my love
Oh, I can hardly breathe
I concede that you're my destiny
Totally obsessed with thee
You are the air I breathe

Won't you ever realise?
Our world's on fire
You're still living in denial
My love
Won't you take me by the hand?
We're off to Neverland
We will watch the sun descend
Never again
