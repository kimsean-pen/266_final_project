I look forward to
That day when
The show will stop, will stop
Stop renewing itself

When, when the most mundane
The most pedestrian show
Will cause and instill such boredom
Boom

Ooh, wah, wah, wah, woay
Ooh, wah, wah, wah, woay

The time when all forms
Of expressions of life will be so
Destitute of substance
Bang

Then life will become
So intolerable
That perhaps our senses will wake up
Woay

K-bang
Ooh, wah, wah, wah, woay
Ooh, wah, wah, wah, woay
Ooh, wah, wah, wah, woay

Ooh, wah, wah, wah, woay
Ooh, wah, wah, wah, woay
Ooh, wah, wah, wah, woay
