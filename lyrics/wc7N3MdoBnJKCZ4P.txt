Why is that sad look in your eyes? Why are you crying?
Tell me now, tell me now, Tell me, why you're feelin' this way
I hate to see you so down, oh baby
Is it your heart oh, that's breakin' all in pieces?
Makin' you cry, makin' you feel blue
Is there anything that I can do?

Why don't you tell me where it hurts now, baby
And I'll do my best to make it better
Yes, I'll do my best to make the tears all go away
Just tell me where it hurts, now, tell me
And I love you with a love so tender
Oh and if you let me stay, I'll love all of the hurt away

Where are all those tears coming from? Why are they falling?
Somebody, somebody, somebody leave your heart in the cold?
You just need somebody to hold on, baby
(Give me a chance)
To put back all the pieces, take your broken heart
Make it just like new, there's so many things that I can do

Why don't you tell me where it hurts now, baby
And I'll do my best to make it better
Yes, I'll do my best to make the tears all go away
Just tell me where it hurts, now, tell me
And I love you with a love so tender
Oh and if you let me stay, I'll love all of the hurt away

Is it your heart oh, that's breakin' all in pieces?
Makin' you cry, makin' you feel blue
Is there anything that I can do?

Why don't you tell me where it hurts now, baby
And I'll do my best to make it better
Yes, I'll do my best to make the tears all go away

Just tell me where it hurts, now, tell me
And I love you with a love so tender
Oh and if you let me stay, I'll love all of the hurt away
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me baby
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
And I'll do my best to make it better
Yes, I'll do my best to make the tears all go away
Just tell me where it hurts, now, tell me
And I love you with a love so tender
Oh, and if you let me stay, I'll love all of the hurt away
