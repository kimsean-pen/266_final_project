In the back of my mind
I can barely even remember
When there was nothing left to hide
And she had found a way inside

Then I was forced to walk alone
Living in an empty home
All I wanted was to hide
And try to numb the ache inside

And I'm still afraid of the light
And a thousand voices share their laughter
At my demise

Now if I am to survive
The infection must die
Murder the beast
That's been eating me alive
The infection must die

Nothing left but a broken man
Terrified of everything
Nothing left of his foolish pride
His found memories slowly die

Then as he wakes again alone
Still a prisoner in his home
Ready to allow the dark
To penetrate his broken heart

And I'm still afraid of the light
And a thousand voices share their laughter
At his demise

Now if I am to survive
The infection must die
Murder the beast
That's been eating me alive
The infection must die

...
Now if I am to survive
The infection must die
Murder the beast
That's been eating me alive
The infection must die
This is where I draw the line
This infection must die
Give me release from this demon of mine
The infection must die
...
The infection must die
