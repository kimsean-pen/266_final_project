I'm psychedelic, unstable
They want role model but I just puked a rainbow
It gets so lonely
I tried to end it all
Jumped off my wallet but I landed in my swimming pool

And I think so hard why don't you love me
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, our hands in the air

I am in my private jet, I am in limousine
I got my test back baby, and I'm super clean
Get excited
I just want people to like me

I'm in the land of the brave, in the home of the free
I got a pretty young thing right on top of me
Come inside, girl
Some people just ain't going like it

I can't dance
I can't sing
But I made it this far you'd think they'd be happy for me
And I'm so loaded
I guess I could stop
'Cause absolutely nothing about me loves pissing you off

And I cry all night, why don't you love me
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, our hands in the air

I am in my private jet
I am in limousine
I got my test back baby, and I'm super clean
Get excited
I just want people to like me

I'm in the land of the brave, in the home of the free
I got a pretty young thing right on top of me
Come inside, girl
Some people just ain't going like it

They gave my music to a man who played my music to a scene
They gave my music to some people who say what they mean
Call me psychic
Some people just ain't going like it

They gave my music to a man who played my music to a scene
They gave my music to some people who say what they mean
Call me psychic
Some people just ain't going like it

I am in my private jet
I am a limousine
I got my test back baby, and I'm super clean
Get excited
I just want people to like me

I'm in the land of the brave, in the home of the free
I got a pretty young thing right on top of me
