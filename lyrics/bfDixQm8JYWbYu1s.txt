Am I not pretty enough?
Is my heart too broken?
Do I cry too much?
Am I too outspoken?

Don't I make you laugh?
Should I try it harder?
Why do you see right through me?

I live, I breathe.
I let it rain on me.
I sleep, I wake.
I try hard not to break.

I crave, I love.
I've waited long enough.
I try as hard as I can.
Am I not pretty enough?

Is my heart too broken?
Do I cry too much?
Am I too outspoken?

Don't I make you laugh?
Should I try it harder?
Why do you see right through me?
I laugh, I feel.

I make believe it's real.
I fall, I freeze.
I pray down on my knees.
I hold, I stand.

I take it like a man.
I try as hard as I can.
Am I not pretty enough?

Is my heart too broken?
Do I cry too much?
Am I too outspoken?

Don't I make you laugh?
Should I try it harder?
Why do you see right through me?

Why do you see
Why do you see
Why do you see right through me?
Why do you see
Why do you see
Why do you see right through me?
Why do you see
Why do you see
Why do you see right through me?
Why do you see
Why do you see
Why do you see... right... through... me
