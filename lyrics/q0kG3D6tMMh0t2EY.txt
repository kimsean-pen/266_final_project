We never get old
Because we ran
Right into the sea
And tumbled around in the waves
To die with the earth all around us

Our clothes decomposed
And our flesh dissolved
All along with the minerals
We held hands through it all
The day when we vanished

The sea treated us kindly
Poured into our mouths
And we knew this was the
Point when we would meet for real

The day we lay down to sleep
To see with our new eyes
The day our bones decayed
To makes us feel more alive
The day we lay down to sleep
To see with our new eyes
To see with our new eyes

The day we lay down to sleep
To see with our new eyes
The day our bones decayed
To makes us feel more alive
The day we lay down to sleep
To make us feel more alive
To make us feel more alive
