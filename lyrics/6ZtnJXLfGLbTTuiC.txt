Couldn't find you
Honesty
All the blisters
You were holding alone

Couldn't find you
Honesty
Were you water
Were you breaking

My frozen bones
My broken mind
It pulls this frozen
Weight on us

My frozen bones
My broken mind
It pulls this frozen
Weight on us

Now I've spoken
What it meant to be
In your doorway
Standing taller than those
Long shadows

Couldn't find you
Honesty
Were you water
Were you breaking
Was it tearing out
At your feint skin
Are you out there
'Cause I'm shaking

My frozen bones
My broken mind
It pulls this frozen
Weight on us

My frozen bones
My broken mind
It pulls this frozen
Weight on us
