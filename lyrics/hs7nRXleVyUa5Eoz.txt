It's all on the table, don't carry it away
PLAY WHILE YOU'RE STILL YOUNG

Walked around, chopped them down
Now I'm all alone, I was right
To hang out, another round
For me watered

It's all on the table, don't carry it away
PLAY WHILE YOU'RE STILL YOUNG

I love your face, I love your face
Even when the garden grays
I love your face, I love your face

Go, everything is running faster for you
Lights out, it's getting loud
Time will tell

It's all on the table, don't carry it away
PLAY WHILE YOU'RE STILL YOUNG

Play while you're still young
Play while you're still young
Play while you're still young
Play while you're still young
Play while you're still young

Our lives, built in the changes
Only a sign needs the arranging
Darling, that's all
Anything burning faster for you
You'll say don't go

Don't go, everything goes
All that you know, let go
Darling, that's all
Anything burning faster for you
You'll say don't go
Don't go
