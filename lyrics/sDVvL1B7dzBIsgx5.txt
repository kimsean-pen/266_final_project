Mind's got to move, but I'm
So trapped within me
Expanded all my limits too carelessly
I'm calling all the time
To get me back alive
'Cause nothing really
Makes sense no more
But I'm on on holes
I need big parts anymore

'Cause the face in the mirror
Just couldn't be clearer
Right back from me
And how I'd like to say
We'll be better tomorrow
Or any day

Yeah, I'm talking 'bout you, you, you
And the luck you're trying to find
You, you, you
And how hard you try to hide it

I sensed the pain, but it
Doesn't hurt anymore
It's even number than the
Ache I felt before
So I smile for a while, let the
Torture begin now
The pressure on my chest
Becomes almost routine, oh
It's not like I don't care, but
There's nothing left to bear

Yeah, I'm talking 'bout you, you, you
And the love you're trying to find
You, you, you
And how hard you try to hide it

And I'm letting it all come crushing down
Come breaking in
It's like the rain just left a cloud

And I'm talking 'bout you, you, you
And the love you're trying to find
You, you, you
And how hard you try to hide it
