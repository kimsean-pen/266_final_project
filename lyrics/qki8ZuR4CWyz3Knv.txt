The time you came
Don't lie to me
Because I feel weak
Because I feel weak

You turned around
It's just like mine
Because I feel weak
Because I feel weak

And if I fall
Into the sea
Don't let me go
Because I feel weak

So tell again
Don't let it in
Because I feel weak
Because I feel weak

You turned around
It's just like mine
Because I feel weak
Because I feel weak

And if I fall
Into the sea
Don't let me go
Because I feel weak
