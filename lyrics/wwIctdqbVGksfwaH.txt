Turn your heart into a lake
Remove what floats

Hide your friends from all your dates
All eyes on you

It's a game that we should've played
When we were cool

No, it never works
It never works
For me

Recognize their fallacies
And let them go

Save your money for the days
You'll need it more

It's a game that we should've played
When we were cruel

No, it never works
It never works
No, it never works

But it'll work for you
For you
You
You...
For-

No friends
No wives
Yeah, i think we're better off apart

Good shirt
Wrong tie
Yeah, i think we're better off apart

Low-hanging fruit
Yeah, i think we're better off apart

Fast-paced
Cgi
Yeah, i think we're better off apart
I think we're better off apart
