She loves me it's not just in my head
She loves me even though it's not been said
And if anything means anything
Then this means something good
And I guess I'd love her back if I only could

She loves me
I can see it when she smiles ear to ear
She loves me and I'm sure that she can't hear
How I scream out for someone else
When I'm asleep or by myself
How I'm so sad I hate myself
Don't know where to go for help

Her love could never grow sour
Becomes more pure with every hour
And I never wanted anything like that from her

But still she loves me
It's not just in my head
She loves me even though it's not been said
And if anything means anything
Then this means something good
I guess I'd love her back if I only could

She loves me
And I know she can accept me for myself
She loves me and I'm shure that she can't help
How I'm this close to cashing in
How I chase dreams that don't exist
How I hate girls and I hate my life
The pain that rips me tears me ruins me
And her love could never grow sour
It grows more pure with every hour
I never wanted anything like that from her

But still she loves me
(I don't have to be all by myself)
She loves me
(She don't love no one else)
She loves me
The way she loves me
The way she loves me
