Does anybody know where we're really gonna go?
I was wondering if we got that real soul?
You know, the thing you cannot trade or ever own

Does anybody know where we're really gonna go?
I was wondering if we got that real soul
You know, the thing we cannot trade or ever own

The solitude
The sacred mood
Appalachian Springs
All my days

Took a step to the left
Took a step to the right
I saw myself
And it wasn't quite right

Does anybody know where we're really gonna go?
I was looking for answers in a sin, in the feelings that a man can't control
I let the fire burn bright in the dead of night
Disappointed she'd get I told a lie
I said that I would never be on their side

Took a step to the left
Took a step to the right
And I saw myself
And it wasn't quite right

I took a step to the left
I took a step to the right
I'll keep it together, yeah

And I was waiting for my number come
Like a bingo calling, singing in a song
You said 'our number's 69', I said: 'ok'

The solitude, my sacred mood, Appalachian Springs
All my things

Took a step to the left
Took a step to the right
And I'm keeping it together
You know, I'm not right

Took a step to the left
I took a step to the right
I'm gonna keep it together
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon

Does anybody know where we're really gonna go?
I was wondering if we got that real soul
You know the thing you cannot trade or even own
Or ever own
Or ever own
Or ever own

Or ever own
Or ever own
Or ever own

Or ever own
Or ever own
Or ever own

"Good luck, I'm coming home"
I feel so young
I don't know where I've gone

I took a step to the left
I took a step to the right
And I saw myself
And it wasn't quite right, yeah

Yeah, a step to the dreams
Slippin' out, slippin' in and out of dreams
