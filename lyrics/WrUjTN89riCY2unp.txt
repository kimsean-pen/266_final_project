the stone inside the mountain revealed
a human heart shown
the core unfolding
song on wind
tumultuous in the soft world
bones protruding
the heart blossoms for a moment
amid stone
and then crawls back inside the cave
mountain heaving
I can't see or hear from where I'm standing
and I go through my days like this
with a force that tears and erodes at all shapes
in dissatisfaction
where was the source of wind I thought I found?
on the ridge.
or am I holding this sighing that tears at the house
in my cavern?
the stone on top of my heart is shaking
the wind at the door
is blowing loud
