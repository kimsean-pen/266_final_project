This ain't no social call
I don't appear for fun at all
This ain't no social call
I bet you wanted more
What you see is what you get
I ain't seen nothing I want yet
This is something deep, today, I'll try
This is something deep, today, I'll die

Some things are better left unsaid
Some things are better left undone
Some things are better left for dead
Some things are better left

What you get is what you see
Look out, ooh, I don't aim to please
Forever means nothing to me right now, right now
Forever means nothing to me right now, right now
Right

This ain't no social call
I ain't here for your fun at all
This ain't no social call
Too bad you were expecting fun

Some things are better left unsaid
Too bad you don't understand
Some things are better left undone
Some things are better left undead
This is forever, okay?
Some things are better left

Some things are better left unsaid
Some things are better left undone
Some things are better left undead
Some things are better left
Left burning
