One, two... one, two, three

You got me runnin' goin' out of my mind
You got me thinkin' that I'm wastin' my time
Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no
Whoo-ee-ooh
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

You wanna stay out with your fancy friends
I'm tellin' you it's got to be the end
Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no
Whoo-ee-ooh
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

Don't bring me dowwwn, Bruce
Don't bring me dowwwn, Bruce
Don't bring me dowwwn, Bruce
Don't bring me dowwwn

What happend to the girl I used to know?
You left your mind out somewhere down the road
Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no
Whoo-ee-ooh
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

You're always talkin' 'bout your crazy nights
One of these days you're gonna get it right
Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no
Whoo-ee-ooh
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

Don't bring me dowwwn, Bruce
Don't bring me dowwwn, Bruce
Don't bring me dowwwn, Bruce

You're lookin' good just like a snake in the grass
One of these days you're gonna break your glass
Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Whoo-ee-ooh
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

You got me shakin' got me runnin' away
You get me crawlin' up to you everyday
Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no
Whoo-ee-ooh
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down, down, down, down, down, down

I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
