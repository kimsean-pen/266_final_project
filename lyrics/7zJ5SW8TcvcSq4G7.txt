Buried in a motion with no might '
Till howling broke light into the unreal Everything that's shuttered
came in sight I prey but it's alright I know how to deal And everyday
we're clinging to old fright The wanting to mold right With nothing
to feel Cryin' out I'm finished with this life We're dying to go
fight And running to heal Alright alright And I'm never gonna go back
home Move on move in The jungle's callin' me all alone And alright
And alright And I'm never gonna go back home And move on and move in
The jungle's callin' me all alone I'm telling you it's
naturally their way Just so you
don't dare say The things that you need
Buried underwater My hopes fray
I only become prey Is that all this is?
Walking in the fire to set clay The only way life stays It just has
to be And alright And alright And I'm never gonna go back home And
move on and move in The jungle's callin' me all alone And alright And
alright And I'm never gonna go back home And move on and move in The
jungle's callin' me all alone And alright And alright And I'm never
gonna go back home And move on and
move in The jungle's callin' me all alone

Conquistadores seal the doorway Chop up the world n' sell it on ebay
We gotta stop them but I don't know how They say it's simple go and
get high Put down the knives,
pick up the sword It's time to overthrow the lord This sound to show
you're not alone Never go back home Everybody go And alright And
alright And I'm never gonna go back home And move on and move in The
jungle's callin' me all alone And alright And alright I'm never
gonna go And move on and move in The jungle's callin' me all alone
