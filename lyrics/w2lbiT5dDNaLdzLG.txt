Trading their lies on the TV-screen
Telling us all what to be
Act like they're gods, egos inflated
Can't believe you'd fail to see

Other lives on the great divide
And hungry you swallow their scheme
Small-minded fools, all so conceited
Don't you know that they're never quite they seem

As weird as if a dream

Another fool, one more crossing the line
Won't believe, a mad man leads the blind
So follow your heart and hear them cry
Because fools never die

Crawl on your knees for your world to grow.
A round of applause and you go
In with the freaks, swallow our poison
Never thought you'd stoop this low
