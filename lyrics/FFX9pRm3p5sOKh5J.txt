I'm up for a real hard time,
Now you've changed your mind,
Knew I'd see the day.
"Go on, have it any way.
Just enough," you say,
"I'm all yours to take."

This is all I want from you,
Yours to give and mine to lose,
This is all I want from you,
All I want from you.

You found a feeling that was new,
And now we're half way through,
You're changing all the rules.
Say, "Now my friend, if you mind,
your name upon this line..."
It seemed so black and white.

This is all I want from you,
Yours to give and mine to lose,
This is all I want from you,
All I want from you.
This is all I want from you,
Time to change and time to choose,
This is all I want from you,
All I want from you.
