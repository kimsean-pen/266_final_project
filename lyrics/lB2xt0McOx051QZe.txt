This is our legacy

With the weight of the world on our tired shoulders
We refuse to live our lives in the dark
What we leave behind us is another dead heart left to rot
Or will we mark our presence? Let's divide the masses
To the ones who lead and to the ones who simply follow
Who will live for tomorrow

We'll turn it back around
We've strayed from our path and lost the track of being free
I learned to live that facing the sun, shadows fall back behind me

We live our lives underneath the burning sky with the weight of the world
The weight of the world on our tired shoulders

The sun will rise, keep facing the sky, don't close out your eyes
We can't stay blind forever set sail for a new horizon
The stars will guide, no matter what lies in our way
We'll lead, not follow the heavy hearts of our sorrow

We'll turn it back around
We've strayed from our path and lost the track of being free
I learned to live that facing the sun, shadows fall back behind me

We live our lives underneath the burning sky with the weight of the world
The weight of the world on our tired shoulders
We walk down on the longest road for us to keep track of who we want to be
Will we ever be free with our heavy burden?

Here we stand
At the top of the world with the wind in our back together
We are invincible
Here we stand
At the top of the world with the wind in our back together
We are invincible
Show them our strength
