Empty temples impress
The imperial temptress
They'd endow
The flowerless trees

Tokyo Kyoto
And back to freeze
My little bud
You who cannot say please

You won't see me upon your release
You won't see me upon your release

Tokyo Kyoto
And back to freeze

Meet me back in valen-time
I'd ask you to be mine, all mine
But now my darlin'
You can't stay long
I'm sending you off
With love in this song

You won't be joining in this race
I'll be wondering all around your face

Tokyo Kyoto
We'll have those days
Tokyo Kyoto
We'll have those days
