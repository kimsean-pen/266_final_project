I'm not your star
I'm not that beam of light
Here to save your life
To make your wallet fat
While mine's on a diet

It's not my greatest care
When simple needs are scarce
It's never ending
It really seems unfair
But lately I don't care
I don't care that much
I've given up tryin'

So sing about love
Sing about lust
So they will care
It's the same difference

That's what happens
When you play catch without arms
That's what sets, sets, sets us apart
Well that's what happens
When you compromise your art
That's what set, set, set us apart

We've got this far
I don't know if you care
But I think that you should swear
Or something of the sort
To show me that you're tryin'

So sing about love
Sing about lust
So they will care
It's the same difference

That's what happens
When you play catch without arms
That's what sets, sets, sets us apart
Well that's what happens
When you compromise your art
That's what set, set, set us apart

Set the faith
So they will find it
If there's a hope they can't deny it
Sing about lust so they can feel it
Sing about love so they can sing it
Sing it

Well that's what happens
When you play catch without arms
That's what sets, sets, sets us apart
Well that's what happens
When you compromise your art
That's what set, set, set us apart

I'm not your star
I'm not that beam of light
Here to save your life
Oh no

I'm not your star
I'm not that beam of light
Here to save your life
Oh no
