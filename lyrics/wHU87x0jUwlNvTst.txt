I've not been feeling quite myself
In my head I've never looked so close to death
Well I just don't know
Then you said let's talk of something else instead
And no one's trying to kill you babe
No one's trying to kill you babe
No one's trying to kill you babe
No one's trying to kill you babe
No one's trying to kill you

I'm seeing faces in the trees
And since they only seem to speak to me
Well I just don't know
Then you said it's far too late to talk of death (No one's trying to kill you)
And no one's trying to kill you babe
No one's trying to kill you babe
No one's trying to kill you babe
No one's trying to kill you babe
No one's trying to kill you

And no one's trying to kill you babe
No one's trying to kill you babe
No one's trying to kill you babe
No one's trying to kill you babe
No one's trying to kill you

And no one's trying to kill you babe
No one's trying to kill you babe
No one's trying to kill you babe
No one's trying to kill you babe
No one's trying to kill you
