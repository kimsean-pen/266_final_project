Sometimes I think to check
Sometimes I wish to cut you up
At times I've been the worst
At times I've been the best of you
And when you cry it's always me, and I destroyed our hopes and dreams
So I will try and I'll succeed to be the one that sees

Right through your tears worth more than gold
I found comfort inside your soul
When you don't speak because you can't, and I won't weep nor will I dance
For Englands sake I will stay cold, and will not show this hate I've grown
Look to my eyes for answers
You'll be the one that sees right through me

So come friday and I'll be distant
So come friday and I'll be found
So come friday and we'll be together
So come friday and I'll be down

Draw two circles from a last resort
Draw me into your passport
Now that I have my hate and love for you, the memory distorts
Have I found the formula?
Have I mislead the misshaped fear, while I congratulate your capturer
There's a definite defeat

But I'm still holding on
But I'm still home enough that I can feel my [?]
So silence my grave, I was never here
But I'm holding on
You're just holding on

So come friday and I'll be distant
So come friday and I'll be found
So come friday and we'll be together
So come friday and I'll be down
Come friday and I'll be distant
So come friday and I'll be found
Come friday and we'll be together
So come friday and I'll be down
