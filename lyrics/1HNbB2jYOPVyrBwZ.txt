Climb over the church wall, he said
You can feed the koi in the pond
Climb over the church wall in your Sunday dress
Be sure to feed the koi in the pond
It's a long, long climb going back in time

All of me wants to be, believe
That the angels will find me Saint Veronica
All of me wants to be, believe
That somehow you will save me Saint Veronica

He said: Kneel before your judges in reverence
Your penance for the woman you'll become
You knew if you talked there'd be a consequence
Your sentence for the woman you'll become
Ten days of hell in Satan's cell

All of me wants to be, believe
That the angels will find me Saint Veronica
All of me wants to be, believe
That somehow you will save me Saint Veronica

Dream of dimensions
Then cross through the veil to them
Wrap yourself in linen holding Jesus close
Calling Saint
Calling Saint
Saint Veronica

Climb out of the belly of the beast, she said
Become a witness out of the abyss
The temple of the soul will have to heal the flesh
Only when you're whole can you forgive
But it's a long, long climb
It's a long, long climb
