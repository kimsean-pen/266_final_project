For Heaven's sake, what have I done?
All I can do now is hate
The other part is stronger again
Butcher in me kills for fun

How can I be the bad part of me?
What can I do to get free?
Holding an instrument to satisfy this lust
I'm innocent, the killer is he

Confused mind
Confused mind

He commits suicide, break his might
When he dies, my life ends too
My mind is confused, I feel so slow
'Cause that's the only thing I can do

I'm taking the knife to finish my life
But this strange feeling comes up again
This evil lust takes over me
The butcher, the winner again

Confused mind
Confused mind

Confused mind
Confused mind

Through the backstreets of the town
His steps are clanging
Now he's horny and all panting
In his hand, a blade of solid steel
Now it's the time, you've got it to feel
