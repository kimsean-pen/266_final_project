time melts away in this living inferno
trapped by a cause that i once understood.
feeling a sickness building inside of me
who will i really have to answer to.
March on through the rivers of red.
souls drift, they fill the air.
forced to fight, behind
the crooked cross.

do only what is expected of me
with no emotions my feelings suppressed.
blind obedience carries me through it all.
conscience a word i learned to forget.

march on through the rivers of red.
souls drift, they fill the air.
forced to fight, behind
the crooked cross.
Lead: hanneman, king
king, hanneman
