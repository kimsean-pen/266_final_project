Stay away from the unknown
Stay away from me for a while, I know.
Give all your heart,
Give all your heart for me

It's the greys again, I know, I know.
And it's a sinister game they play;
I know, I know.
Give all your heart,
Give all your heart for me.

And the world, it gets so loud
And when they start to tear you apart
You were right, you were always right.

Ready or not here I come!

And the greys flood our memories in the long haul
Can the greys wash away?

Chaos!

And the world it gets so loud
And when they start to tear you apart
You were right, you were always right there

Ready or not here I come!

And the greys flood our memories in the long haul
And the greys flood our memories in the long haul
And the greys flood our memories in the long haul
And the greys flood our memories in the long haul
