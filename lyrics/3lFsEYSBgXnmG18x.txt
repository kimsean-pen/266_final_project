You're killing me so finish me off or spare me
Nicole, where are you now?
Are you at home?
Priscilla ordering Chinese for you.
Is Wayne drinking one of those bottles of wine?
Everyone brought one and now he has the time
To relax and unwind.
I miss fucking you on your living room floor every Sunday night.
And I miss the smell of your log cabin and your cute little hands grabbing for mine.
I wonder what they're clasped around now
I know someday's a lie but is somehow?
How can I survive without you now?
Are you at school?
In the city that falls asleep before you.
In a bed that sinks in the middle
And you might be little but I'm big
We both don't fit
And you used to put up with it
I miss waking up covered in lintAnd to your lips pout and hint that you want mine
But I don't miss not hearing my name
And always wanting more and getting the same
The same old, same old has got me down
You've got me now
Baby I tried and tried
I lived and died
And I sacrificed
But I don't want to be anything
If anything means that I'm something without you
How can I describe my meaningless life?
Without your beautiful light guiding me home every night?
