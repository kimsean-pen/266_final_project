C'mon, c-c'mon (say what, say what)
Yo Yo, there she go
Go girl with your fine ass

You keep askin' for my time
You keep tellin' me, that I'm fine!
Give me your number
I won't call!
Give me your pager too
Not at all will I call, not at all

I know that you want a piece of my ass
Don't you know that a guy like you wouldn't last
Not a player don't get paid

I'll leave you hangin' (I'll leave you hangin') for days
Don't send me flowers they won't do (no, no, no, no)
Don't give me diamond rings
Cos I'll take them and call you a fool
C'mon why you do me like that
Can't you see that I wanna feel that?

C'mon why you do me like that
Can't you see that I wanna feel that?
Why's this fool all up in my ass
Doesn't he know I want class not trash

Why's this fool all up in my ass
Doesn't he know that I got my own cash
I know that you want a piece of my ass
Don't you know that a guy like you wouldn't last

Look don't touch, you're askin' much
Why's this fool all up in my ass
Doesn't he know I want class not trash

Why's this fool all up in my ass
Doesn't he know that I got my own cash
Na, na baby (uh, uh)
Na, na baby (uh, uh)

Na, na baby (uh, uh)
You want what you can not have
I know that you want a piece of my ass
Don't you know that a guy like you wouldn't last

Look don't touch you're askin' much
I know that you want a piece of my ass
I'm all hooked up, you're outa luck
Don't you know that a guy like you wouldn't last
Look don't touch you're askin' much
I know that you want a piece of my ass
I'm all hooked up, you're outa luck
Don't you know that a guy like you wouldn't last
Look don't touch you're askin' much
