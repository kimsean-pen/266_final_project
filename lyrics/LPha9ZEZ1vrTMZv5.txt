Someone's masquerading in the galleries today
Beside the arch it is always following me
It seems
Confusion dance and echoes ringing loud
So clear
Vaging on these loops are filled with
Empty dreams

In a chamber of hellos
In a chamber of hellos
In a chamber of hellos
In a chamber of

Such familiar feelings
Come and go
Betraying
Such familiar prayers said to the way
And gone
Someone's masquerading in the galleries
Leave no one
Making all these moves when no one really
Hears hallo

In a chamber of hellos
In a chamber of hellos
In a chamber of hellos
In a chamber of

Hello hello hello
In a chamber of
In a chamber of

In a chamber of hellos
In a chamber of
Hello hello
Hello hello
Hello hello
Hello hello
Hello
