The leaves fell off as I did
I guess it held some kind of meaning.
I've been lying in this bed of nails
That let the wind out of my sails.
She left me on the bridge she's burning
Hell, maybe I deserve it.
I'm just trying to find my purpose
I hope that it's all worth it.

There will come a time
When you will face your life
Don't let it twist and tear you up inside

The world's a fucked up place
but it depends on how you see it
Life is full of change
you grow up and then you feel it.
But smooth seas don't make good sailors
Jump ship and head for failure
Find yourself a tragedy
Slowly lose your sanity.

I'll be alright, your bark was worse than your bite.
Left a scar that faded with time
Echoed out to the back of my mind.

There will come a time
When you will face your life
Don't let it twist and tear you up inside

The world's a fucked up place
but it depends on how you see it
Life is full of change
you grow up and then you feel it.
But smooth seas don't make good sailors
Jump ship and head for failure
Find yourself a tragedy
Slowly lose your sanity.

I've been walking round in circles
cursed every corner of this town
Will I make it out?
If I do then it's a godsend.
I caught a bullet in-between my teeth
Could this finally be the end?

There will come a time
When you will face your life
Don't let it twist and tear you up inside

The world's a fucked up place, but it depends on how you see it
Life is full of change, you grow up and then you feel it.
But smooth seas don't make good sailors
Jump ship and head for failure
Find yourself a tragedy
Slowly lose your sanity.
Find yourself a tragedy
Slowly lose your sanity.
