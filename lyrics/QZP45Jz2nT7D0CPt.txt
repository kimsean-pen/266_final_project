It's only when I turn away,
Only when I'm near the edge.
I look around and see where I should be instead.
You can think you've got it all wrapped up,
Then you feel the threads unwind.
There's nothing I can do,
Now it's too late to realize.
Got you on my mind...

Sunburnt through the glass -
Ooooh, you've got me beat,
I saw the light but I missed the heat.
I thought I had all that I wanted...
Sunburnt through the glass -
Ooooh, it's gone so deep,
Why'd it take me this long to see.
That all that I wanted was to saaaay -

All I wanna do is get back,
Try to find that light that I know went black

The beach has started closing off,
The evening tide is coming in,
Trying to catch that train and call in one last drink.
Enough of trying to shake the dark,
Enough of trying to trick the light.
I could really do with letting someone else decide...
Where to spend the night.

Sunburnt through the glass -
Ooooh you got me deep,
I saw the light but I missed the heat,
I thought I had all that I wanted.
Sunburnt through the glass -
Oooh, it's gone so deep,
Why'd it take me this long to see,
That all that I wanted was to saaaay -
Don't tell me it's too late.

Sunburnt through the glass -
Ooooh, you got me beat,
I saw the light but I missed the heat.
I thought I had all that I wanted.
Sunburnt through the glass -
Ooooh, you got me beat,
Why'd it take me so long to see,
That all that I wanted was to saaaay,

Tell me if you can hold on, hold on,
If you can hold on, hold on.

Driving straight back through the night...

Tell me if you can hold on, hold on,
If you can hold on, hold on.

Flashing headlights in my eyes...
