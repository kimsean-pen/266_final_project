In Trash City On Party Avenue

in Trash City On Party Avenue
i Got A Girl From Kalamazoo

wanna Go Bowling Wanna Chuck Some Rocks
wanna Come To My House And Change All The Locks
in Trash City On Party Avenue
i Got A Girl From Kalamazoo
in Trash City On A Transit Line
i Put You On Hold But You're Sure Looking Fine
sing You A Song Like Rubber On A Turn
fifty-Seven Records That You Know You Ought To Burn
garbagemen Don't Care For The Blues Or Rock N' Roll
it's Five O'clock In The Morning In A Coffee Shop In Seoul
first I Got A Hot Dog In A Nightmare Zone
then I Vandalize A Cheap Payphone
crying To The Girls Won't You Leave Me Alone
makin' Love In The Graveyard With Cockroach Bones
in Trash City On Party Avenue
i Got A Girl From Kalamazoo
