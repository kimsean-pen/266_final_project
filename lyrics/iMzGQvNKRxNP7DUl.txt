I've always felt so cold inside
Clinging on to life
I've always felt at one with the night
Fading deep inside

Winter winds are blowing through my life
Deep inside I know that I can run but I can't hide

Fallen angel at my side
Take me by the hand
And lead me far into the night
Far away from this life

I've always felt so drawn to the sea
So deep and wild and free
I've always lived my life through my dreams
To deny life's misery

Winter winds are blowing through my life
Deep inside I know that I can run but I can't hide

Fallen angel at my side
Take me by the hand
And lead me far into the night
Far away from this life

Fallen angel at my side
Take me by the hand
And lead me far into the night
Far away from this life

Fallen angel at my side
Take me by the hand
And lead me far into the night
Far away from this life
