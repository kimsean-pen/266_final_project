A human leech
Foul you crawl into my field of vision; an empty speech
Breaking the skin of concentration
Jesus Christ, you make me sick
Bloated and corpulent from disregard, what you discard
Your presence is leaving a scar
Are you ready for the night?

Put you out like the setting sun
Four more words and then I'm done
How the fuck did you think this would end?

A filthy prick
Foul parasitic imposition; a dirty trick
A seasonal war of attrition
So thoughtless, you're such a pig
Loaded and indolent and you assume what you consume
Is other's business to reap and remove
Are you ready for the night?

Put you out like the setting sun
Four more words and then I'm done
A violent need to speak the truth
Tired of bone and long of tooth, let's be clear
You're not welcome here again
How the fuck did you think this would end?

This is where it ends

The swollen fingers of the modern age
The human condition in a gross display
Are covered in the grease of indulgence
Anemic and weak with intemperance
Clutching at the latest distraction
Breeding a most savage reaction

Are you ready for the night?

Put you out like the setting sun
Four more words and then I'm done (Get. The. Fuck. Out.)
A violent need to speak the truth
Tired of bone and long of tooth, let's be clear
You're not wanted here, my friend
How the fuck did you think this would end?
How the fuck did you think this would end?
How the fuck did you think this would end?
