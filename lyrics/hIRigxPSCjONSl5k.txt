Reduced into tears
Cold winter gust
My disease
Your time to shine

Since the start
Upholding the trust
Search your heart
It is mine

Urgent and unaccidental
Broken foe in my sight
Structural
Sentimental
Hard to see
Clear and bright

Innocence bleeding
Sudden, foreseen
Dismounting heathen
Stagnating seed in

Lawless you say
Directions still unknown
Go down this way
You're on your own
