I'm walking home one winter night
As the party is over I try not to think about you
Now I can't wait for the morning light
Cause these feelings inside me they totally ruin my mood

Crazy I know
But I'm scared to fall
In a place I've been to before
Not a part of my plan

I'm falling out of control in love
For the first time
Girls, don't be losing your head with love
No, no
Keep him at a distance
Guarding your position
I try so hard but love will always get its way
Why me, why now?

It's gone too far
No I can't rewind
Though my conscience is calling
I'm finding you hard to refuse
No one resists as I confide
Don't go feeding the fire
And it's slowly burning you

I may not know
Where I'm heading for
So I think I better get wise
And just enjoy

I'm falling out of control in love
For the first time
Girls, don't be losing your head with love
No, no
Keep him at a distance
Guarding your position
I try so hard but love will always get its way
Why me, why now?

Oh, why you running? Don't hide
Oh, when is there a right time

Oh, oh, oh

I'm falling out of control in love
For the first time
Girls, don't be losing your head with love
No, no
Keep him at a distance
Guarding your position
I try so hard but love will always get its way
Why me, why now?

I'm falling out of control in love
For the first time
Girls, don't be losing your head with love
No, no
Keep him at a distance
