Mississippi Queen
If you know what I mean
Mississippi Queen
She taught me everything
Way down around Vicksburg
Around Louisiana way
Lived a Cajun lady, we called her Mississippi Queen
You know she was a dancer
She moved better on wine

While the rest of them dudes were'a gettin' their kicks
Buddy, beg your pardon, I was getting mine!

Mississippi Queen
If you know what I mean
Mississippi Queen
She taught me everything
This lady she asked me, if I would be her man?
You know that I told her, I'd do what I can
To keep her looking pretty
Buy her dresses that shine

While the rest of them dudes were making their bread
Buddy, beg your pardon, I was losing mine!

You know she was a dancer
She moved better on wine
While the rest of them dudes were'a gettin' their kicks
Brotha, beg your pardon, now I'm getting mine!
Oh, Mississippi Queen
