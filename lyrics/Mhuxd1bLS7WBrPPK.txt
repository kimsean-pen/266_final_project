My feet were made to march like thunder
My lips to praise in all and wonder
My hands hold power and my lungs breath fire
Holy Spirit fire, Holy Spirit fire

On your love I stand
Because of who You are
I know who I am
Wherever I will go
Wherever You will lead
I'll never walk alone
Your spirit is with me
You're with me as I go
So I will not be afraid
You call me to be brave
In You, in You
Brave
In You, in You
You call me to be brave

No height, no death, no fear can shake me
Held firm, Your hands will never fail me
I won't lose strength, for Your strength is mine
You will be my light through the darkest night

All of my love is dead
Because of who You are
I know who I am

Wherever I will go
Wherever You will lead
I'll never walk alone
Your spirit is with me
You're with me as I go
So I will not be afraid
You call me to be brave
In You, in You
Brave
In You, in You
You call me to be brave

Rise up, stand on faith
I will not be afraid
Your spirit lives inside
Your spirit is alive

Rise up, stand on faith
I will not be afraid
Your spirit lives inside
Your spirit is alive

Rise up, stand on faith
I will not be afraid
Your spirit is alive
Your spirit is alive

Wherever I will go
Wherever You will lead Wherever You will lead
I'll never walk alone
Your spirit is with me Your spirit is with me
You're with me as I go
So I will not be afraid
You call me to be brave
In You, in You
Brave
In You
You call me to be brave
In You, in You
Brave
In You
You call me to be brave
