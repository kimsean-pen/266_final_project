I got sick of waiting Tuesday afternoon
K Line sea containers, thunder past my room
I use my vibrator wishing it was you
I was thinking of ya Tuesday afternoon

'Cause you're a pretty light
And I'm so attracted to ya
A malaria mosquito buzzing in the shadow
Your name is up in lights
And baby, you deserve it
I wanna bring you cake back home from work
But you're allergic

You're a pretty light
And I'm so attracted to ya
A malaria mosquito buzzing in the shadow
Your name is up in lights
And baby, you deserve it
I wanna bring you cake back home from work
But you're allergic

You're a pretty light
And I'm so attracted to ya
A malaria mosquito buzzing in the shadow
Your name is up in lights
And baby, you deserve it
I wanna bring you cake back home from work
But you're allergic
