Forget the image you design
Ignore the colour outside the lines
The doors are closed the lights are off
Locked from the inside

Burn the liars rake the coals

Outside these windows
The moonlight cries
Haunting dreams eternal
Lost in your eyes

Your face meets glass
It feels like
Your face meet glass
It feels like
