Now this is what it's like when worlds collide
Now this is what it's like
Now this is what it's like when worlds collide
Now this is what it's like

What is it really
That's going on here
You've got your system for total control
Now is there really anybody out there
Now watch us suffer cause we can't go
What is it really that is in your head
What little life that you had just died
I'm gonna be the one that's taking over
Now this is what it's like when worlds collide

Are you ready to go
'Cause I'm ready to go
What you gonna do baby, baby
Are you going with me
'Cause I'm going with you
It's the end of all time

What is it really that motivates you
The need to fly or this fear to stop
I'll go along when you realize
When we get there I say nine of ten drop
Now who's the light and who is the devil
You can't decide so I'll be your guide
And one by one they will be hand chosen
Now this is what it's like when worlds collide

Are you ready to go
'Cause I'm ready to go
What you gonna do baby, baby
Are you going with me
'Cause I'm going with you
It's the end of all time

You are a robot

Now this is what it's like when worlds collide
Now this is what it's like
Now this is what it's like when worlds collide
Now this is what it's like

What is it really when they're falling over
Everything that you thought is denied
I'm gonna be the one that's taking over
Now this is what it's like when worlds collide

Are you ready to go
'Cause I'm ready to go
What you gonna do baby, baby
Are you going with me
'Cause I'm going with you
It's the end of all time

Are you ready to go
'Cause I'm ready to go
What you gonna do baby, baby
Are you going with me
'Cause I'm going with you
It's the end of all time
Are you ready
'Cause I'm ready
It's the end of all time
Are you going
Yeah I'm going
It's the end of all time
