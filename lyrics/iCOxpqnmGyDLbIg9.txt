Don't hit my line, don't call my phone
And don't waste my time, leave me alone

When you're ringing my telephone
All you hear is the dial tone
Tryna see what I been on
When I just wanna be left alone
See, you don't check to see if I'm alright
But sometimes I can't sleep at night
I know you think your in deep this lie
But things ain't what they seem, it's by light

So don't hit my line, don't call my phone
And don't waste my time, leave me alone
Don't hit my line, don't call my phone
And don't waste my time, leave me alone

I find myself doing the same old things
Thinking 'damn man, where are my friends?'
I guess that love is just for pretend
My views was skewed like a fish eye lens
I like the truth and my clarity
I kneel and pray for my enemies
'Cause hate would take up my energy
And I do not need that, mentally

So don't hit my line, don't call my phone
And don't waste my time, leave me alone
Don't hit my line, don't call my phone
And don't waste my time, leave me alone
