This door will never open, why would it, we never tried to
Exterminating angel, the black hold of beauty

In a world of complete make-believe
There's a chance to practice what we preach

In a world of complete make-believe
There's a chance to practice what we preach
Throw the hammer burn the gasoline
We're all toothwheels in the death machine
