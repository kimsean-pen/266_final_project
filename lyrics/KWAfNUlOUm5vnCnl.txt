Dark rain falls
The portents of war, closing in
In the furtherst reaches of the kingdom's hold
A new will burns, making blood run cold
Deep under mountains, a portal awoke
A time of trouble, of which a prophecy spoke
An army of men, an emblem unknown
They come not for peace - send word to the throne

Let loose the horses, for south we must ride
To marshal an army to hold back this tide

We've heard reports - tales from the north
Of an ancient army that arrived in force
Led by a warlord bathed in fire
Soldiers in red that do not tire
They came to conquer, and desecrate our land
We must retaliate, we must take a stand
For the kingdom and for our lives
Ready the generals as

We've heard reports - tales from the north
Of an ancient army that arrived in force
Led by a warlord bathed in fire
Soldiers in red that do not tire
All that we know comes to an end
If our ancient homeland we cannot defend
For the kingdom and for our lives
Ready the generals as we ride

If we fall today, tomorrow will never come

We've heard reports - tales from the north
Of an ancient army that arrived in force
Led by a warlord bathed in fire
Soldiers in red that do not tire
All that we know comes to an end
If our ancient homeland we cannot defend
For the kingdom and for our lives
Ready the generals as we ride
