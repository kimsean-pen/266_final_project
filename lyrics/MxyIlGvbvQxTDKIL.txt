I throw you a rope
And you do what you want with it
Cause your face is leaving me

You should never have left
This soon
This soon
Cause I can never forget
You washed up on that shore

Just pull up the rope
And that's all that I'll beg from you
Cause your face is leaving me

You should never have left
This soon
This soon
Cause I can never forget
You washed up on that shore

But you know I had no choice, you know
Some of us are lost [?]
