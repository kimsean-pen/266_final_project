Runin' to and fro, Hard workin' at the mill
Never fail, in the mail yea come a rottin bill
Uh-uh, too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in

Salesman talking to me tried to run me up a creek
Says you can buy it, go on try it, you can pay me next week
Uh-uh, too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in

Blonde haired, good lookin' tryin' to get me hooked
Wants me to marry, get a home, settle down, write a book
Uh-uh, too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in

Same thing everyday, gettin' up goin' to school
No need a me complainin' my objection over rule
Uh-uh, too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in

Pay phone, somethin' wrong, dime gone,
Well me ought to sue the operator for tellin' me a tale
Uh-uh, too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in

Been to Yokohama, been a fightin' in the war
Army bar, army chow, army clothes, army car
Uh-uh, too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in
Workin' in the fillin' station, too many tasks
Wipe the windo', check the tires, check the oil, dollar gas
Uh-uh, too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in
Too much monkey business for me.
