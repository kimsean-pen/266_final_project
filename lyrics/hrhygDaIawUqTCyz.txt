Theres something I wanna say
Something that Ive been holding back
Cant let it go another day
Let me start by saying that

Nothing, nothing,
Nothing, means more than the truth.

And truth is that I realize, love is fading from your eyes
Dont know how it came to this, but we gonna get it fixed tonight
Cus nothing, nothing,
Nothing, is worth losing you

Tell me what could the problem be, thats got you drinking way too much
What could it be about us
Dont you tell me not right now, I cant let it go
(I cant let it go, no I cant let it go, Oh nooo)

What can I do to help you see,
That there√¢
