Lean against the stove
Leave it glowing in the dark
Push my hand onto the coil
It is burnt now
Forever

Cherry blossoms fall
But for a minute there
I have the will to live
But then the cuckoo cries
Hey!, hey!, hey!, hey!

You constantly aspire
To the be the first to pierce
Your dagger into fondness
It will hurt now
Forever

Cherry blossoms fall
And for a twinkle there
I have the will to live
But then gomorrah calls
No!, no!, no!, no!

Caterpillar girl
Here you are

Cherry blossoms melt
And for a weekend there
I have the will to go on
But then it fades to
Pink
Pink
Pink
Pink
Pink
Pink
Pink
