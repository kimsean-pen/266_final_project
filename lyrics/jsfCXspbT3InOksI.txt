Here I chase
The end of our tale
I played your fool
As I glide
Into the air
On this motion moving wings
There we ride
In constant replay
In slow motion, riding the waves

Trying hard to see
How I could possibly be on your frenquency 'cause I miss him?
You and me.

Through the air
This waves come in
Breaking on my shore
How I pray
With all my heart
I could love you, the same way you love me
And share the same ways.

Trying hard to see
How I could possibly be on your frenquency 'cause I miss him?
You and me.

Always
Airwaves
Always
Airwaves.
Always
Airwaves
Always
Airwaves.
Always
Airwaves
Always
Airwaves.

Trying hard to see
How I could possibly be on your frenquency 'cause I miss him?
You and me.

Always
Airwaves
Always
Airwaves.
Always
Airwaves
Always
Airwaves.
