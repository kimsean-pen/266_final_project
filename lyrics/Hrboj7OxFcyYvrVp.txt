Let's begin, with the past in front
And all the things that you really don't care about now
You'd be exactly where I'm at
And to think, you've got a grip
Well, look at yourself
Your lips are like two flaps of fat
They go front and back and flappity flappity flap

I'm all staged
It's all an act
I'm really scared that I may fall back on the abstract
You'd be exactly where I'm at

If you're to be
The roaming eye
Well, pry it open and let me tell you why it sees
The harsh realities

So let's begin, with the past in front
And all the things that you really don't care about now
You'd be exactly where I'm at
