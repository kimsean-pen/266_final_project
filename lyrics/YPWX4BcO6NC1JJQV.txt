Make me wanna pop a pill
You make me wanna lose control
You make me wanna do some things
And I know they ain't good
But I've overdosed
You make me wanna act a fool
You make me wanna do the most
You make me wanna do some things
And I know they ain't good
But I've overdosed, overdosed oooh

Look, how come every time I hit your line I need a buzz
How come every time we tryna f*ck we fall in love
How come every single time we do it
It's the same exact result
Like I hate you then I love you
Then it's right back to my fault
Like got damn
Look you make me stress
You should make me stress less
21 questions like you make me take a test
Now I got a fifth in my fist
Girl you know I only drink when you on some crazy shit
Learn your lesson
You no angel, don't be lying to yourself
Girl you no blessing
You know I don't do no crazy drugs
But you got me addicted
Drive me crazy, now I think I need some help
Cause your love is like a drug
But you're addicted to yourself
(Make me pop a pill)
You know I don't usually do this
Every subject of an argument we have is always stupid
We break up then make up
Then do the whole thing again
Don't you know you really f*cking with my head

You make me wanna pop a pill
You make me wanna lose control
You make me wanna do some things
And I know they ain't good
But I've overdosed
You make me wanna act a fool
You make me wanna do the most
You make me wanna do some things
And I know they ain't good
But I've overdosed, overdosed oh woah

Yeah I know all my homies looking at me like "I told you so"
But you make me feel a way that I've never known
Got my head spinning like I've overdosed, oh woah
I can't say I haven't thought about it
Doing whatever it takes to get your a to come through
If you wanna chill then we can talk about it
You know that you're the only one I'm f*cking with because
Everybody's into something
But I'm only into you
Got me poppin' all these bottles
Doing things I never do
Can't stand it
Like I'm losing sight of who I am
Can't manage
Seeing that you're with another man
God damn it
Now I'm out here tryna do the most
All the things I know I can't control

You make me wanna pop a pill
You make me wanna lose control
You make me wanna do some things
And I know they ain't good
But I've overdosed
You make me wanna act a fool
You make me wanna do the most
You make me wanna do some things
And I know they ain't good
But I've overdosed, overdosed oh woah
