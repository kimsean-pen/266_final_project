Is all that we tried not to do, tried not to say
Better left undone?
Tell me when you're looking back and wondering
Who was in the wrong
My life is good, I can't complain, I'm happy now
Most of the time
Maybe I was too fragile then and broken down
To have ever loved you right

I guess there's a time and place kept for everything
'Cause some things just don't last
I'm trying hard not to reminisce
But when I think about the past

All I see are good, good, good, good things
And all I feel are good, good, good feelings
What we had was more than words
Could ever hope to explain
And I'd be lying if I said I don't still
Think about you every day

I wanna know just how to fill this empty heart
I've held reserved for you
So maybe then the power you've had over me, yeah
Would let another through
Though your eyes and loving arms might be replaced
Nothing will compare
To starry nights, mosquito bites and caffeine highs
That meant that you were here

I guess there's a time and place kept for everything
'Cause some things just don't last
I'm trying hard not to reminisce
But when I think about the past

All I see are good, good, good, good things
And all I feel are good, good, good feelings
What we had was more than words
Could ever hope to explain
And I'd be lying if I said I don't still
Think about you every day

And I'd be lying if I said I don't still
Think about you every day

Good, good, good things
And all I feel are good, good, good feelings
What we had was more than words
Could ever hope to explain
And I'd be lying if I said I don't still
Think about you every day
