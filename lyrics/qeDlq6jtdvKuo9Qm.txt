Dust.
I see red.
I know this state you're in.
Time has come, once again.
This is not our habitat.
This is not our place to be.

You and me, we took great pains to not get down too deep.
Down into the raging stream of our subconsciousness.
Shadows are passing by.
Sometimes they're close to catching up.
Sea scorpions prowl these waters.
They are the apex predators.
This time we won't surrender facing the unknown.

Close your eyes, hold your breath.
Tell me now, are you really sure you wanna walk this path once more.
We know what's lurking at the end of the road.
Blank out all painful reminders of past indignation.

Another rough double reality day.
I understand now how it feels to be trapped inside the lair of light.
Reflections bouncing off the walls...
To be losing any sense of time while every clear thought dissolves.

Learn to embrace the the gift of ambiguity.
It sets you free.
We have said a few things now that we have never said before.
And I don't know yet what that means.
Maybe we will wake up tomorrow with gratitude
and uncertainty that all the glaciers will retreat.
Yield to warm and shallow seas.
Or maybe not.

I am super fucked and all I really want is to sleep now.
Exposed to my interpretations.
Please cut me out of this equation.
Release me.
My conscience is as clean as the bluest sky after a storm.
You were so proud of our achievements.

We have said a few things now that we have never said before.
And I don't know yet what that means.
Maybe we will wake up tomorrow...
