There is freedom within
There is freedom without
Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup
There's a battle ahead
Many battles are lost
But you never see the end of the road while you're travelling with me

Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
But you know they won't win

Now I'm towing my car
There's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
In the paper today, tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over the TV page

Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
But you know they won't win

Now I'm walking again
To the beat of a drum
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows appear
Barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and release

Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over (it's over)
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in (comes in)
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
But you know they won't win

Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over (it's over)
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in (comes in)
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
But you know they won't win
Oh no, no-ooo
Don't let them win
O-oh, no
When the world comes in
Hey now, hey now
Ooh, to build a wall between us
Hey now, hey now
No, no, don't let them win
Hey now, hey now
Oh, no no no
Hey now, hey now
To build a wall between us
Hey now, hey now
