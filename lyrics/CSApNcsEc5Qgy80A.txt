Every day I open the window
Every day I brush my teeth
Every day I read the paper
Every day I see your face

In the gleam of a brilliant twilight
I see people torn apart from each other

Maybe that's their way of life

Every day I ride in cars
Every day I watch TV
Every day I write my diary
Every day I go to sleep

In the gleam of a brilliant twilight
I see people torn apart from each other

Maybe that's their way of life

Every day I open the window
Every day I brush my teeth
Every day I read the paper
Every day I see your face
Every day I ride in cars
Every day I watch TV
Every day I write my diary
Every day I go to sleep
