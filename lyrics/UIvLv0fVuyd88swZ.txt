From the start love was swaying bouncing orchestra playing loud
Oh so enlightening but it also felt frightening when
A lasso in high speed make a perfect knot around my knees
I'm falling into worm embrace while secretly in chains

'Cause I wanna call it forever call
This thing forever forever
I wanna call it forever call
This thing forever forever

These promises deform my spiritual stability
Dedication so newborn burning flavours inside of me
Oh from a vision I recall your presence in a zoom
Now loving words are faint 'cause I'm to tight in your embrace, oh oh

Want to call it forever call
This thing forever forever
I wanna call it forever call
This thing forever forever

Big tears splash my eyes I keep my female personalities
Romance blooming smells so nice out plays any harmonies
Oh I'm floating up stream and my knees are shaking
So as we sway orchestra play oh I hope we make it

Wanna call it forever
This thing forever forever
Oh I wanna call it forever call
This thing forever forever
