My harbor has a boat in it
The water makes its way 'round it
When the sun shines down the hills winds blow
I miss you more
You said I am young and I am yours
I am free, but I am flawed
I am here and your heart
I was here from the start
The forests have a rock in it
Roots and animals were blocked by it
When they turned all their bones, changed to stone
They've lost their faith
You said I am young, and I am yours
I am free, but I am flawed
I am here and your heart
Was here from the start
There when the rain came and settled on your skin
Not like before and you let it all in
To your heart was the only part
From the start you set upon
You said I am young, and I am yours
I am free, but I am flawed
I am here and your heart
Was here from the start
