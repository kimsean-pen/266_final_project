Thought we'd settle down
In Mesa, Arizona
And I thought you'd heard the words
The words that I told ya'

We can only hurt ourselves
So long
We can only hurt each other
'Till it all goes wrong

Together we made flowers out of weeds
Danced in garbage instead of leaves
Don't scratch my skinny legs and arms
(Wait till the waters come)
Wait till the waters come
x2

And I know, I know each moment is fleeting
I hold my breath you're breathing [?]
With my kaleidoscope vision
I passed out in your kitchen

We can only hurt ourselves
So long
(Wait till the waters come)
We can only hurt each other
'Till it all goes wrong
('Till it all goes wrong)

Thought we'd settle down
In Mesa, Arizona
And I thought you'd heard the words
Heard he words that I told ya'

We can only hurt ourselves
So long
(Wait till the waters come)
We can only hurt each other
'Till it all goes wrong
('Till it all goes wrong)
