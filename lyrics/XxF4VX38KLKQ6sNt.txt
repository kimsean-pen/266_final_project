And love .
Such a silly game we play, oh
Like a summer's day in May.
What is love, what is love?
I just want it to be love
oooh

And I, I, I, I, I... I can feel it in your kiss
It just gives me tender bliss
What is love, what is love?
I just want it to be love
oooh

When I feel you around
I was mad as hell when I hit the ground.
When I see you laugh away
It hurts but I just won't say
oh, oh, oh... Love ...

Who can tell me I am wrong?
I just think that I am strong.

What is love, what is love?
I just want it to be love.
ooooh

When I feel you around
I was so upset we fell on the ground
When I see you mad at me
It was such a silly thing
ooooooh

And love .
Such a silly game we play
Like a summer's day in May.
What is love, what is love?
I just want it to be love
ooooh. oh
And I, I, I, I, I... I can feel it in a kiss
It is something I will miss
What is love, what is love?
I just want you to be love
