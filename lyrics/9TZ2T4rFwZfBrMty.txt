When we're in the back room
We can't hear a sound
Creaking and groaning
With windows smashed out
The hush isn't separate
From the glory found
At the edge of your basement
Where the light gets out

Only the heavens
Can say when the rain gets out

I still love it
When you're around
It cost me my kingdom
Your glorious crown
The moment I wake up
I forget to breathe
All of this heartbreak
Is smothering me

Only the heavens
Can say when the rain gets out
Only the heavens
Can say when the rain gets out
