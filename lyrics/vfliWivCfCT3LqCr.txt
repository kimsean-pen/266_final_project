Only a chariot could cross it
Across this void

I wouldn't jerry rig or candy coat your Latin kisses

You're not what you aren't
You're aren't what you're not
You got what you want/You want what you got
People look great when they shave
Don't they?

We lived on Tennyson and venison and The Grateful Dead
It was Mudhoney summer, Torch of Mystics, Double bummer

You're not what you aren't
You're aren't what you're not
You got what you want
You want what you got
Feels so great in the shade

A love like oxygen, so foxy then so terrific now
On a jape I'm returning
Bobby spinnin' out
I was so messed up
You were drunk and high
Just a ramblin' wreck
Comin' off the breaks to see what was shaking

We grew up listening to the music from the best decade ever
Talkin' about the A-D-D's
We grew up listening to the music from the best decade ever
