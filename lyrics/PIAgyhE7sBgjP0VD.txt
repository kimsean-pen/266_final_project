It slipped my mind
And for a time
I felt completely free

Oh, what a troubled
Silent poor boy
A pawn into a queen

I laugh now
But later's not so easy
I gotta stop
The will is strong

But the flesh is weak

Guess that's it
I've made my bed
I'll lie in it

I'm still hanging on

Bird upon the wires
I fall between the wings

I avoid your gaze
I turn out a face
A pawn into a queen

I laugh now
But later's not so easy
I gotta stop
The will is strong
But the flesh is weak
Guess that's it
I've made my bed
I'll lie in it

But it's eating me up

It's eating me up
It's eating me up (If I could feel others stand in my place)
It's eating me up (If I could feel others stand in my place)
It's eating me up (If I could feel others stand in my place)
