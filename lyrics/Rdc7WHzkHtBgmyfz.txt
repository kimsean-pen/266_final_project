Lightning from above, followed by hail
Death from above in the wake of his trail
A vision sent this child, becomes a man
Blood of the past, has chose his plan

Oh, I am
Oh, crazy horse, I am
Oh, I am
Crazy horse, I am

The sacrifice of others, that walk within
The battlefields of death, embracing him
The courage from beyond, surrounds one's soul
Walking side by side, though graves unknown

Oh, I am
Oh, crazy horse, I am
Oh, I am
Crazy horse, I am

A vision sent for the Heavens to see
This is a good day to die, now follow me

Oh, I am
Oh, crazy horse, I am
Oh, I am
Crazy horse, I am

Crazy horse, I am
Crazy horse, I am
