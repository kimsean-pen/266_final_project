Where did we go?
What did we do?
I think we made something
Entirely new!
And it wasn't quite me
And it wasn't quite you
I think it was someone
Entirely new!

Ohh... umm
Well, I just can't stop thinking
So... umm
Did you say I was different?
And you hadn't before?
Of course not
When would I have ever?
I'm so sorry
No, no, don't be
And now you're here forever!
What about you?
What about me?
Well, you're here, too
We're here together
How I feel...
I. I feel...
Lost...
And Scared...
And. and Happy!!...
