Here in this darkness that I lie
Depression heavy in its way
And how my body aches to leave
And sing its final eulogy
My sons I love you ever more
And though the road back ends once more
I see the damage that I've done
And search for redemption
But I am just a broken man
Who's soul cries out to understand
How the madness shatters me
Upon the stage on bended knee
I scream aloud at skies above
That answer mute, bereft and loved
I struggle not to fall from grace
I sing the hyms of my disgrace

We build cathedrals to our pain
Establish monuments to obtain
Freedom from all of the scars and the sins

Lest we drown in the darkness within

Misery's forgotten chords
I strum in vain to please the lord
But he has never answered me
And faith has winged eternaly
An empty man who passed along
The woes of all religions wrong
And now the shadow veil it falls
Hear the clarion calls
So pray to music
Build a shrine
Worship in these desperate times
Fill your heart with every note
Cherish it and cast a flow
'Cause God is in these clef and tone
Salvation is found alone

Haunted by its melody
Music, it will set you free (let it set you free)

We build cathedrals to our pain

Establish monuments to obtain

Freedom from all of the scars and the sins

Lest we drown in the darkness within

Do Do Do...
(Music my savior)
Music my savior
(Save me)
Music my savior
(Save me)
Music my savior
(Save me)
Music my savior
(Save me)
We build cathedrals to our pain

Establish monuments to obtain
Freedom from all of the scars and the sins
Lest we drown in the darkness within
We build cathedrals to our pain
Establish monuments to obtain
Freedom from all of the scars and the sins
Lest we drown in the darkness within
Do Do Do...
