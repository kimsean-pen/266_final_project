this could be my chance to get out of this place
hide my face from the coming days

turn away from that awful city
that's all, that's all i was feeling

i've kept my eyes in this corner
this room becomes a little smaller

(?) light and then there was you
and lasting warmth to attend to

warmth consumes me
brightens in front of me
made of fire
bound my suffering

this light feels like a paradise
i watch the sun dance in our eyes
as i lay here in front of you
there's nothing else i would like to do

this could be my chance to get out of this place
hide my face from the coming days

turned away from that awful city
that's all, that's all i was feeling

this rooms becomes a little smaller
