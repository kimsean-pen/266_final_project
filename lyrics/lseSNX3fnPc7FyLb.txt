Since I met you I've been unravelling
questioning everything I say or do
all of these words don't mean anything
nothing means anything when I'm not with you
and the strength that I held in the palm of my hand is slipping
and the sense that I have slowly is melting away

you rocked my world
made me forget myself
I started to learn how I could be somebody else
discovered the girl I thought I could never be
now I am hurt, you're leaving for somebody else, oh

I'm not a fool, though I behave like one
can't help it, I've come undone
too late to turn back
the strength that I held in the grip of my hand is slipping
and the sense that I had almost has melted away

you rocked my world
made me forget myself
I started to learn how I could be somebody else
discovered the girl I thought I could never be
now I am hurt, you're leaving for somebody else

I fell in blindly
but love still denies me
I wasn't ready for losing control, oh no
we played by the same rules
you did what you had to
whatever your reasons I have to let go

but you rocked my world
made me forget myself
I started to learn how I could be somebody else
discovered the girl I thought I could never be
and now I am hurt, you're leaving but I won't forget

you rocked my world (you rocked my world)
made me forget myself
I started to learn (started to learn) how I could be somebody else
discovered the girl (discovered the girl) I thought I could never be
now I am hurt, you're leaving for somebody else
