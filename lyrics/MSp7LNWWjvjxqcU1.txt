Snap trappin', rack stackin', she said baby hold
My degree, don't you speak, don't be talkin' down on me
All this wig snatching, snap trappin', it's a life
My rack stackin', ass clappin', it's a wife
My wig snatchin', snap trappin', it's a life
She look like watercolor roses on her Instagram posin'
Snap trappin', rack stackin', it's a life

Up in the clouds, can you hear me now?
I'm thundering, booming, I'm hungry
I just been eating and holding it down
Got something to say but don't got nothing to do
What the fuck gotta do with me, I'm not fuckin' you
Then he say, I wouldn't fuck with you anyway
Then I say nigga that's not what the Henny say
All in my DM's like Cardi on wedding day
Say it on everything, yeah I got everything
Got a wifey who loves me and it's all art
It's her dream and it's my dream and it's all ours
Yeah, and my dream girl, living in a dream world
Milk and honey all up on me, roses fallin' all around me, yeah
Post to drown around me, yeah
Seen in front and out out they neck
But they ain't seen nothing yet
No they ain't seen nothing yet
No they ain't seen nothing yet, yet, yet, yet, yet

Well I think you should spend some time alone
Don't you listen to no problems
