I wanted to show my gratitude
And to set it up for you
A moment that would open true
I wanted to show my gratitude
In places you won't let me see
Thought you turn inside out at will
I wanted to show my gratitude
For the way you reflect me
All of me arms and face
Better then the mirror
In my solitude my restless gratitude
I'm reckless within sight of you
And in my gratitude I might
Make to much noise for you
In my gratitude I sometimes need
The spectacle of failure
And in my gratitude all of life
Takes on your flavor
In my gratitude to die for you
Would be just one more favor
