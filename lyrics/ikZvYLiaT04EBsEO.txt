All my life, been hustling and tonight is my appraisal
'Cause I'm a hooker selling songs and my pimp's a record label
This world is full of demons, stocks and bonds, and bible traitors
So I do the deed, get up and leave, a climber and a sadist, yeah

Are you ready for the sequel?
Ain't ready for the latest
In the garden of evil
I'm gonna be the greatest
In a golden cathedral
I'll be praying for the faithless
And if you lose, boo-hoo

Hey look Ma, I made it
Hey look Ma, I made it
Everything's coming up aces, aces
And if it's a dream, don't wake me (don't wake me)
I said, Hey Look Ma, I made it

Friends are happy for me, or they're honeysuckle phonies
Then they celebrate my medals, or they wanna take my trophies
Some are loyal soldiers, while these other thorns are rosy
And if you never know who you can trust
Then trust me, you'll be lonely, oh

Are you ready for the sequel?
Ain't ready for the latest
In the garden of evil
I'm gonna be the greatest
In a golden cathedral
I'll be praying for the faithless
And if you lose, boo-hoo

Hey look Ma, I made it
Hey look Ma, I made it
Everything's coming up aces, aces
And if it's a dream, don't wake me (don't wake me)
I said, Hey look Ma, I made it, I made it
I said, Hey look Ma, I made it, I made it
I see it, I want it, I take it, take it
If it's a dream, don't wake me (don't wake me)
I said, Hey Look Ma, I made it

(Mama best believe it)
(Mama best believe it)
Hey Look Ma, I made it
(Or I must be dreamin')
(Or I must be dreamin')
Hey Look Ma, I made it
(Mama best believe it)
(Mama best believe it)
Hey Look Ma, I made it
(Or I must be dreamin')
Hey Look Ma, I made it
