Got the world up my ass and I'm gonna jump fast
Be the first, won't be the last
I've got the world up my ass

Society is burning me up
Take a bite, spit it out
Take their rules
Rip 'em up, tear 'em down

Twisted mind, withered brain
You know I'm going insane
I just tell them, "Get back"
When they tell me how to act
I've got the world up my ass
You know I've got the world up my ass

Society is burning me up
Take a bite, spit it out
Take their rules
Rip 'em up, tear 'em down

You know I've got the world up my ass
You know I've got the world up my ass

Society is burning me up
Take a bite, spit it out
Take their rules
Rip 'em up, tear 'em down
