They're gonna put me in jail?
Man, I'm already in jail
Don't they know that my life
Is just one big cell

I'll bite the hand that feeds me
And I could give a damn if that hand needs me
Oh, why can't you leave me alone?
A lie may fool someone else
But it tells you the truth
You're weak, just another clone

I just want my life
To do whatever I like
Yeah, it's a selfish need
To have no responsibility
So I'll say what I'm gonna say
'Cause I'm going to hell anyway
I'd rather be alone
In my world

I'm not afraid
I am not afraid
Nothing touches me
I'm a walking razor blade
Face the face of fear
Face the face of death
Laugh when others tear
Hate when others laugh
(laugh, laugh)
In my world it's so cold
My defense is like stone
No one gets inside, 'cause
In my world I'm home
In my world I loathe
And you'll always pay a toll
No one gets inside, 'cause
In my world I'm home, yeah

An adult at thirteen
My childhood was a dream
A full clout nightmare, a sight unseen
My greatest fear as a kid
One which I always kept hid
Was to come home from school
And find my mother dead

I just want my life
To do whatever I like
Yeah, it's a selfish need
To have no responsibility
So I'll say what I'm gonna say
'Cause I'm going to hell anyway
I'd rather be alone
In my world

I am not afraid
I'm not afraid
Nothing touches me
I'm a walking razor blade
FFace the face of fear
Face the face of death
Laugh when others tear
Hate when others laugh
(laugh, laugh)
In my world it's so cold
My defense is like stone
No one gets inside, 'cause
In my world I'm home
In my world I loathe
And you'll always pay a toll
No one gets inside, 'cause
In my world I'm home
Home!

I'm not afraid
I am not afraid
Nothing touches me
I'm a walking razor blade
Face the face of fear
Face the face of death
Laugh when others tear
Hate when others laugh
I'm not afraid
I am not afraid
Nothing touches me
I'm a walking razor blade
I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid
