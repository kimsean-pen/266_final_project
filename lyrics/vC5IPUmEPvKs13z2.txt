Sit down!
Just shut up! I'll talk
No, you just sit down
I'll talk!

Can I come back next time
Dressed in shite
And take my place
On the landscapes ice
It's the rest who push the policy dream
Affixing life with policy cream
Voice your thoughts
Near big black gates
On bed of rose near bricks and gates
To the sound of nothing
As it breaks the spell
There's no witchcraft here,
it's just fucking hell

We're in the makings of another role
Where we all get the
Chance to climb on again
It's just the makings of another role
That will turn on us all eventually

Yeah, I got a roadworks
Pose even though I'm free
I mean I can't really moan
Because you'll have a go at me
So stupid ain't we?
We're like pumped up meat
Wet and fried and thick to the slice
I got no flies on me,
I'm like shit that's white
The kind that you tell
Your kids to pick up if they like
I got two brown bins,
Should I only have one?
But what the council
Don't know won't hurt them

We're in the makings
Of another role
Where we all get the
Chance to climb on again
It's just the makings
Of another role
That will turn on
Us all eventually
We're in the makings
Of another role
Where we all get the
Chance to climb on again
It's just the makings of another role
That will turn on us all eventually

It's gonna turn on us all
And bring us round, round, round
Take us back to the top
And drag us down, down, down
Gonna turn on us all
And bring us round, round, round
Take us back to the top
And drag us down, down, down
It's gonna turn on us all
And bring us round, round, round
Take us back to the top
And drag us down, down, down
Gonna turn on us all
and bring us round, round, round
Take us back to the top
And drag us down, down, down
