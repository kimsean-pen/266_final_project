I'm always assuming the worst
But you're going on nonetheless
And there's nothing to cushion your heart led fall
Letters from further away
Keep pulling me close to home
And there's something to cushion my callous sighs

And I know that you hope for
Longer good-byes
Embracing for forever
And falling in your eyes
In your eyes
Your eyes

Pouring over photographs
I'm living in your letters
Breathe
Deeply from this envelope
It smells like you
And I can't be
Without that scent
It's filling me
With all you mean to me
To me

Continually failing these trials
But you stand by me nonetheless
And you won't let me sink
Though I'm begging you
I'm begging you
Phone calls from further away
And messages on my machine
But I don't ever tell you this distance
Seems terrible

And there's no need to test my heart
With useless space
These roads go on forever
There'll always be a place
For you
In my heart

So I'll hit the pavement
It's gotta be better than waiting
And pushing you far away
Cause I'm scared
So I'll take my chances
And head on my way up there
Cause turning to you is like falling in love when you're ten
