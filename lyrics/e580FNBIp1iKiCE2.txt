I'm taking, taking
All of my time
I'm dodging words but she's saying the right lines
She made me, made me
Oh so crazy
But this time I feel like I'm doing something right

It made me sick
To think about
Everything you put me through
And how you left without
Saying goodbye
And if it's really over now
Then you can walk away
And it would be the last time

This is the end of you and me
Everything I used to be
Back then it meant something
You're living a lie
You just can't hide from me

You had me hanging
On your last word
And now I'm feelin' a little less than trusting
You had me wishing
We were something (something)
But left me here with a whole lotta nothing now

This is the end of you and me
Everything I used to be
Back then it meant something
You're living a lie
You just can't hide from me

"Love is a luxury," she said,
"I'd rather be in love than dead"
But not with her, oh God not with her
She's the type of girl who makes love hurt

I'm taking, taking
All of my time (taking my time)
I'm dodging words but she's saying the right lines (the right lines)
She made me, made me
Oh so crazy (I'm going crazy)
But this time I feel like I got it right

(1, 2, 3, 4, 1)

This is the end of you and me
Everything I used to be
Back then it meant something
But you're living a lie
You just can't hide from me

This is the end (this is the end)
Of you and me (whoa-oh)
And everything I used to be
Back then (this is the end)
It meant something (yeah)
You're living a lie
You just can't hide from me
