So let me keep
The last piece of my heart
Before you tear it all apart
Just let me keep
The last piece of my heart
Before you tear it all apart

You packed the bag
I guess that your mind is made up
You take a drag
Off of the cigarette you said you quit, and I
Take a step back
When all I want is to hold you
Drive away fast
This ain't the movie scene I thought we'd be in, nah

You, oo-ooh
You, oo-ooh
Lost myself to you

So let me keep
The last piece of my heart
Before you tear it all apart
Just let me keep
The last piece of my heart
Before you tear it all apart

You cut your hair
Remember how I used to love it
Now I gotta stare
At the boxes of shit that I thought we could fix, and I
Wanna be fair
But then I'd be working with nothing
But you drive away
Blasting the music that we used to make out to

You, oo-ooh
You, oo-ooh
Lost myself to you

So let me keep
The last piece of my heart
Before you tear it all apart
Just let me keep
The last piece of my heart
Before you tear it all apart

(So let me keep)
You, oo-ooh
You, oo-ooh
Lost myself to you
(So let me)
You, oo-ooh
You, oo-ooh
Lost myself to you

You left your smokes by the window
I'm gonna wait by the door
Somewhere in me, I got some hope
A hope that you find what you're looking for

So let me keep
The last piece of my heart
Before you tear it all apart
Just let me keep
The last piece of my heart
Before you tear it all apart

So let me keep
The last piece of my heart
Before you tear it all apart
Just let me keep
The last piece of my heart
Before you tear it all apart
