Spiral staircase... to the center. of the earth
Green lit orb... siar eye... one and first
Hidden hole... pit of Jura... Serpent Cult
Descending down... steps of bone... greet the cold

PROPHET PROPHET
Where's the manifest of FIRE?
PROPHET PROPHET
See, his eye is made of stone

ALWAYS STARING AT THE SUN

Torchlit walk... into the dark... starless deep
Black parade... Khaalus cave... breathless steep
See, behold. the oracle... the divine
We are thy servants 'til the end of time

PROPHET PROPHET
Where's the manifest of FIRE?
PROPHET PROPHET
See, his eye is made of stone

ALWAYS STARING AT THE SUN

We are the guardians of the purple flame
Please show us the start of it all... everything
The dreams, the way of the dead, the age of stars
Give us the birth and the death of eternity

Crystal globe... starblack eye... holy void
Fill our heads... with godlike threads... Speak in tounges
Tell us please... future dreams... cosmic plans
Show us the apocalypse, forevermore

Oh... Dead prophets come and go...
Like dying rainbows in the snow...
But no one spoke, no one called
Bury the false... Bury them all
