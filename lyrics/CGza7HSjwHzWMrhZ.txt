Three tall bony fingers stretched into the night,
Topped with hope against the rising tide,
Illuminating what waking tries to hide,
Propped up by the content of your soul,

Thought I can't see,
The illusion still remains,
I was at first alone,
Fears given life by a flickering light,
Beyond the lucid veil,

Haunted by what resides beyond the glow,
Its poison spilling deep within my mind,

Though I can't feel,
The illusion still remains,
I was at first alone,
Fears given life by a flickering light,
Beyond the lucid veil,

Now, from the void, it emerges,
Cloaked in horror,
Nightmares of flesh and bone,
Nothing,

So reveal the darkened figure,
Eyes adjust to the flame,
Creeping like those bony fingers,
Stretching into the sky.
