Deadweight
Get up, get up

Mirror mirror on the wall
The man I see is at fault
When did I become everything that I hate?
Internally bound, I'll self-destruct
Bleed out until I think I've had enough
But it never is
I swear it never is

It's like I'm out of my mind
Relapse, repeat, never the last time
I can't take much more
I've never been this low before
Never been this low before

Deadweight
(All you do is)
Break me
(Leave me feeling)
Empty
(How I long to be set free)
You're my own misery
Deadweight
(All you do is)
Break me
(Leave me feeling)
Empty
(How I long to be set free)
You're my own misery

Go
To be honest
I've grown to love the pain
So what's it worth when you can't sleep? Can't think
You'll do whatever it takes to feel just the little things
Trapped inside my head
I'm hanging by your thread

Deadweight
(All you do is)
Break me
(Leave me feeling)
Empty
(How I long to be set free)
You're my own misery
Deadweight
(All you do is)
Break me
(Leave me feeling)
Empty
(How I long to be set free)
You're my own misery

You and I are running out of time
We can't coexist
You took what was mine
So you see, it's you or it's me
Now I'm seeing red, yeah
Why don't you just drop dead?
Why don't you just drop dead?

All you are is
Deadweight
(All you do is)
Break me
(Leave me feeling)
Empty
(How I long to be set free)
You're my own misery
Deadweight
(All you do is)
Break me
(Leave me feeling)
Empty
(How I long to be set free)
You're my own misery
No longer part of me
No longer part of me
