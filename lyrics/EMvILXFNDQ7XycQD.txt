I'm going home tonight
I can't stay here
I'm going home for good
But I still want you near

And the taxi pulls up
(and the taxi pulls up)
Goodbye I said
(Goodbye he said)
I love you she said
(I love you I said)

But you left me standing here

Im going home tonight
I can't stay here
I'm going home for good
But I still want you near

And the taxi pulls up
Goodbye he said
(Goodbye I said)
I love you I said
(I love you she said)

But you left me standing here
(But you left me standing here)
You left me standing here
(You left me standing here)
You left me standing here
(You left me standing here)
You left me standing here
(You lefft me standing here)
