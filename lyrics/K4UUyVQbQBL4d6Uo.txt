The soul got out of the box,
The soul got out of the box,
The soul got out of the memory box
And placed itself on a unpaved road.

The soul kept shooting like an untouched woman,
Weeping (without tears)
The wind was very fine,
The wind was very fine.
The soul kept shooting like an untouched woman,
Weeping, without tears.

Hello doomsday, could you be my friend?
My soul got out of hand,
Come on doomsday,
I'm feeling lost
Since the soul got out of the box.

Doomsday, doomsday, doomsday
We don't need words no more,
We don't need words no more.
All you have to do is keep on shooting,
Keep in shooting till the doomsday.

Hello doomsday, could you be my friend?
My soul got out of hand,
Come on doomsday,
I'm feeling lost
Since the soul got out of the box.

Hello doomsday, could you be my friend?
My soul got out of hand,
Come on doomsday,
I'm feeling lost
Since the soul got out of the box.

We don't need words no more,
We don't need words no more,
Don't need
Don't need

We don't need words no more,
World took a trip on the night train

We don't need
We don't need
Words no more

Untouched woman, woman, woman
Untouched woman, woman, woman
Untouched woman, woman, woman
Untouched woman
(What's she bring?)
