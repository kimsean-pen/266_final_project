there is a chapel in the woods
where from the farthest-seeing senses rule
there is a scroll inside a casket...
clear blue eyes have worn this outfit

yes I knew it was no moonshine, it is real
I feel much better
now I know this spiral shaft
can possess the brightness of the light

oh, I sayeth
thou art mine true companion
and I wish
thou wilt enter my kingdom
oh, mesmerising unicorn

when if danger it will glow
a glimmer can foresee all threats to come
gone are disbeliefs and doubts
it would be nice, so nice...

oh, I sayeth
thou art mine true companion
and I hope
thou wilt enter my kingdom
oh yes, I wish
I really wish
