Tell me a secret
I don't just want to know about any secret of yours
I want to know about one special secret

Oh
Because tonight I want to learn all about the secrets
In your garden

I wanna read your mind
Know your deepest feelings
I wanna make it right, for you
Baby, show me, let me share the mystery, oh

(Come on, come on, come on, come on)

Listen to your heart tonight
(Come on, come on, come on)
Make it alright, yeah-ah
(Come on, come out tonight)

I know a melody, that we could sing together
I've got the secret key, to you baby
Let's make music, harmonizin' ecstasy
(Come on, come on, come on, come on) Come on and sing it to me

Here in the garden (Where temptation feels so right)
Passion can make you fall for what you feel
(In the garden, we can make it come alive) We can make it come alive
(Every night) Every single night

Oh, woman!
Your secret garden

Oh baby
I need to be with you
Let me lay beside you
Do what you want me to, all night

I'm gonna hold you
Ooh, baby, can I touch you there
(Come on, come on, come on, come on)
I can keep you satisfied

Baby (Come on, come on, come on)
Ooh, ooh wee, ooh wee, baby
Please, baby, oh, darlin'
(Come on, come out tonight) Yeah, baby

I'll take good care of you
That's what a man is supposed to do
And I'll be there for you all the time

Let your hair down, let me get you in the mood
(Come on, come on, come on, come on) Come on, take me
Take me with you

(Into the garden) In the garden
(Where temptation feels so right)
Passion can make you fall for what you feel

(In the garden, we can make it come alive)
(Every night)
(Oh, woman!)

Here in the garden

And I never wanted anyone
I never wanted anyone as much as I
As much as I want you

I want you to show me
I want you to tell me how you feel
All the secrets

(If you think I, I am gonna take care of you)
(If you think I have got what you need)
(Show you're right)

I want us to take our time because
We have all night

(If you think I am gonna be good to you)
(If you think I, I like what you do)
(Show you're right)

(Oh, I'm gon' be so good to you baby)
(Ooh wee, ooh wee baby)

(If you think I, I am gonna take care of you)
(If you think I have got what you need)
(Show you're right)

Let me learn your secrets

(If you think I am gonna be good to you)
(If you think I, I like what you do)
(Show you're right)

Show you're right
Baby, you know me

(If you think I have got what you need)
(Show you're right)

(If you think I am gonna be good to you) I'm gonna be good to you
(If you think I, I like what you do)
