I saw a name in the graveyard that I knew
Glowing, like the neon in a lounge light
Spelled just the same as the twinge that crawls through you
As it, passes slowly through a fast night
Dear everything i've harmed the fault lies on my tongue
And I, take it holy as a last rite
I picked away all the gray hairs that i'd grown
That remained on the

Outside
And I'm wound tight
And bound by
The secrets you saved
The pieces you kept
They've risen and slept
Without you

I tried to break all the objects that I threw
When I, kept the tidiness of town life
I tried to sing all the verses that I knew
Of it, screaming softly in a loud mic
How do i blame all my carelessness on you
Tell me, taking is mostly what it sounds like
Hard words to sing but I laughed cause they were true
And it's seen on the

Outside
And I'm wound tight
And bound by
The pieces you saved
The secrets you kept
They've risen and slept
Without you
