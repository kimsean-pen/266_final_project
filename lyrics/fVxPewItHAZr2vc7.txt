STOP THE CHEMICAL INVASION
German beer's among the finest
The beer is pure and chemical free
A standard set which we are proud of
A standard met by no other land
Purity laws and chemical free
No body pollution - no change!
Preservatives shall soon be common
And the beer will be bastardized

Chemical invasion
Fight for your right to drink pure beer
Chemical invasion
It's your right the time is here

Make a stand and try to fight it
They'll poison us with import beer
'Cause German beer - it is the purest
And there's no room for chemicals here
Purity laws and chemical free
No body pollution - no change!
No loss for us - refuse to buy it
We'll rather keep our bodies clean
