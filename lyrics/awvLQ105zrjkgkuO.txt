So since the surgery, how's that ghost limb
Hey man, say man have you been rubbin' your nub
Por favor
De no sacar los manos, de no sacar los manos
Fuera de la ventana
So cuenta es muchas dinero lo siento
But I have got to hand it to you, you're taking this extremely well
Ah rub it on me, rub it on me Duane
So since the surgery, how's that ghost limb
Hey man, say man have you been rubbin' your nub
