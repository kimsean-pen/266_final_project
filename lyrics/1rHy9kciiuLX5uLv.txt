When life does not make sense and you long for a friend
When you know that you're innocent but they take offense
Accused and forgotten, get blamed and you're terrified

I'm a soldier of metal, I live in your heart
I'm a soldier, we never will part
I'm a soldier of metal, I fight till the end
I'm a soldier you can always depend on
I'm a soldier of metal, I live in your heart
I'm a soldier, never will part
Oh, I'm a soldier of metal, I fight till the end
I'm a soldier you can always depend on

Hope is always there, let you know I care
Like an angel in the dark, I'll be always there
Ten years in prison, it feels like you're on death row

I'm a soldier of metal, I live in your heart
I'm a soldier, we never will part
I'm a soldier of metal, I fight till the end
I'm a soldier you can always depend on
I'm a soldier of metal, I live in your heart
I'm a soldier, never will part
Oh, I'm a soldier of metal, I fight till the end
I'm a soldier you can always depend on

I will send a prayer to God
When you can't take it no more
He will wash away all your flaws
And He will open, open that door

I'm a soldier of metal, I'm a soldier of metal
I'm a soldier, never will part
Oh, I'm a soldier of metal, I live in your heart
I'm a soldier you can always depend on, ooh

Yeah, I'm a soldier of metal, I fight till the end
I'm a soldier you can always depend on
