I won't let you bring me back, bring me back.
No I won't let you bring me back, bring me back.
You can throw all the fits and the tantrums you want
But I won't let you bring, bring me back down.

(Ohh)
Way back in '95
Scraped knees, tough love, ah yeah
Grass stains were just a sign of the times
(Ohh)

Big kids, look at us now

Too adult to say, "big whoop"
Letting any old bummer get under my hide
(Ohh)
But ooh I'm gonna take control...

Cause I won't let you bring me back,
bring me back down in the dumps.
No I won't let you bring me back

bring me back down in the dumps.

Ya
So I'll walk that tightrope wire
But what am I really made of? Yeah
Scared of heights like I'm scared of falling in love
(Ohh)
But ooh I'm gonna take control...

Because I won't let you bring me back,
bring me back down in the dumps
No I won't let you bring me back,

bring me back down in the dumps
You can throw all the fits and the tantrums you want
But I won't let you bring, bring me back down.
So think back to '95
And reach arms length deep ah yeah
Cause they'll try to pierce your childhood hide
(Ohh)
But ooh I'm gonna take control...
Cause I won't let you bring me back, bring me back down in the dumps
No I wont let you bring me back, bring me back down in the dumps
I won't let you bring me back,
bring me back down in the dumps
I said I won't let you bring me back,
bring me back down in the dumps
Oh no I said I won't let you bring me back,
bring me back down in the dumps
No I said I won't let you bring me back,
bring me back down in the dumps
You can throw all the fits and the tantrums you want
But I won't let you bring, bring me back down
You can throw all the fits and the tantrums you want
But I won't let you bring
bring me back.
