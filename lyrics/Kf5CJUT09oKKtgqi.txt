We are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we are

The time has come to bring you down
Take the power back and show you how

I hear the sound of a plane passing by
Someone had the same thoughts as I
But as I get to the end of mine
You deny and think everything is fine

We are, we are, we are
We are the truth that hurts the most, cuz'
We are, we are, we are
It hurts, like your denials exposed
It hurts, like your denials exposed

I can't --
Think of all the things we leave behind

I hear the sound of a car driving by
You can go on for miles
But you will --
This is not your day

Are you just gonna turn around and walk away?

We are, we are, we are
We are the truth that hurts the most, cuz'
We are, we are, we are
It hurts, like your denials exposed
It hurts, like your denials exposed

But as I get to the end of mine
You deny and think everything is fine

We are, we are, we are
We are the truth that hurts the most, cuz'
We are, we are, we are
It hurts, like your denials exposed
We are, we are, we are
It hurts, like your denials exposed
It hurts, like your denials exposed
