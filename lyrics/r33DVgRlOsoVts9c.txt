I'm alive again
More alive than I have ever been
And now I'm climbing, climbing
To the top to win
And nothing's gonna stop, stop
Me in the end
Victorious

And everyday that I awake
I say a prayer and I give thanks
That I'm alive and I am glad
That I've been given one more chance
My eyes are open now I see
The powers dwelling within me
I've done the deeds I've cleared my head

Now I am clean back from the dead

Whoa!
I rise above it all and I'm not coming down
Whoa!
Because a champion is what they call me now
And I'm not backing down (hey hey hey)
I will stand my ground (hey hey hey)

Whoa!
Because a champion is what they call me now

Look how far I've come
The wars that I have won
I think out loud
Victorious and proud
The years behind

The tears I try to hide
This pain won't last
Time to remove this mask

My eyes are open now I see
The powers dwelling within me
I've done the deeds I've cleared my head
Now I am clean back from the dead

Whoa!
I rise above it all and I'm not coming down
Whoa!

Because a champion is what they call me now
And I'm not backing down (hey hey hey)
I will stand my ground (hey hey hey)
Whoa!
Because a champion is what they call me now

Wait stop, stop
Hold on, hold on, hold on
I got this new head on my shoulders and I'm lookin' for justice
So gladly seekin' out bitches that decided to talk shit
You want conflict? Well I got it and I ain't gonna stop
Until I drop or take that motherfuckin' place on top
Ain't given it back when I take that place
As a matter of fact lets cut to the chase
Gonna take that spot on top of the list quick!
Call it statutory rape
You want some beef? Better bring a fork
Cause I'm never gonna pass the torch
Gonna keep goin' with the flows
Exposin' you hoes to show you I'm more important
A lil' bit of dirt mixed with the
Mud a lil' bit of rock mixed with a thug
Gotta good heart inside my chest

And a lil' bit of gangster in my blood
Been to jail I've been to prison went to hell and had a vision
Was presented with a decision to change how I was livin'
Gotta give it up gotta give it back

I've had enough gotta get intact
As a matter of fact gotta get these
Kats in check and stack these fucking racks
Gotta get that cheese gotta get that
Bread gotta get that dough gotta get ahead
Gotta cut no slack to these motherfuckin' punks
Who held me back

BACK FROM THE DEAD GO!
Whoa!
I rise above it all and I'm not coming down
Whoa!

Because a champion is what they call me
Whoa!
I rise above it all and I'm not coming down
Whoa!
Because a champion is what they call me now
And I'm not backing down (hey hey hey)
I will stand my ground (hey hey hey)
Whoa!
Because a champion is what they call me
A champion is what they call me now
