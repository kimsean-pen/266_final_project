[ 1]? I'm triggering the soft alarm
Barrs the entrance, now I want to know
Who's then feeding?
I want a name, I want a name
Just know that, that's fine
The hollow throws his lousy drone
And you don't want to breathe
But you'll talk
Now absolute the zero count
Zero? in the?
Whose counts empty
I want a name, I want your name
Just right, that's fine
This empty throne is monotone
But now I've turned the key
And you've drowned, call out again

Gather 'round so empty now
All you got is from the sound
I want the truth
But if I've got to rip it from you

Here's our feet in, I felt the same
So they took my name
And I put up no fight
The void you throw is all you know
You watch me turn a key
How like you, to slip away
A sonar's rounds
Yeah, I just cloister up and?

Boy, you've still got your sound
And I see you staring down
I want to know,?
