Please don't leave me without saying goodbye
Without saying goodbye

You and I, cold February night
It's been a half an hour
Taking sweet time, saying our goodbyes
One minute more, go!

The best day of my life
Is all thanks to you
Precious remembrance
Saved for rainy days on February

Few scenes from my life
Where moments mean more to me
Than our fine nights
I remember like yesterday, the time of my life

Please don't leave me, without saying goodbye
Without saying goodbye
Please don't leave me, without saying goodbye
Without saying goodbye
Let's travel back in time

2-12-99, at the stroke of midnight
Holding you tight
Your body and mine, in February

Few scenes from my life
Where moments mean more to me
Than our fine nights
I remember like yesterday, the time of my life

Please don't leave me, without saying goodbye
Without saying goodbye
Please don't leave me, without saying goodbye
Without saying goodbye

Please don't leave me, without saying goodbye
Without saying goodbye
Please don't leave me, without saying goodbye
Without saying goodbye
Let's travel back in time
