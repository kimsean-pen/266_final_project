we were here when the heat had found us
under thousands of lilies so blue
with a weight so thick you could taste it
could you feel it too?

drilled into the hull,
and sinking slow
into the deep, forever blue
blue

It was clear when the fog had lifted,
we were here all along and i knew
that some words, they would rise to the surface
with unguarded truth

depicted on the scrolls
the ancient hoax
a lucid stream of wilted truth
truth

drilled into the hull,
i love you so
into the deep, forever blue
blue

and i love you
(oh, i do)

drilled into the hull
and sinking slow,
into the deep, forever blue
blue
