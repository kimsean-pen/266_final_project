Don't you ever leave me out
Are these pieces of you?
You never show
Now I'll never know
You needed to
Get high just to prove
You've got control
And I wanna believe it

The faces we put on our scars
And then they let me down
I'm famous for my flaws and scars
I'll take them lying down
And I've got nothing left to prove

I've been left alone all my time spent in my head
Try defending all my sins
And if you could only know my body language
We could hold conversations
I've been patient

Leave me out
All these things that we do
They help us grow
Just let me go
You needed me to
Get clean just for you
We never spoke
We never address this true

The faces we put on our scars
And then they let me down
I'm famous for my flaws and scars
It's such a heavy crown
When they all got eyes on you

I've been left alone all my time spent in my head
Try defending all my sins
And if you could only know my body language
We could hold conversations
I've been patient

You said you're running out
I don't want to believe it
You said you've grown it
You know I won't
You said I let you down
I don't want to believe it
I know I won't

I've been left alone all my time spent in my head
Try defending all my sins
And if you could only know my body language
We could hold conversations
I've been patient

I've been left alone all my time spent in my head
Try defending all my sins
And if you could only know my body language
We could hold conversations
I've been patient
