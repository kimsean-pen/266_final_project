I ran away with only ten bucks in my pocket
And a twenty thousand ransom for my head
My baby said I didn't take it like you wanted
So I kissed him on the neck and shot him dead
He's such an artist how he'd paint a broken promise
Now he's laying on the floor covered in red
And if I'm honest you're the man to keep him modest
Yeah, he broke me so I had to get revenge

When they come for me, oh, I'll be gone for miles, baby
And I'll think of you this way to your favorite song
When they find me I'll be riding high in style, baby
And I'll look down and I'll say

Catch me if you can
Ooh, I, mmm
Catch me if you can

Oh, he had a face so pretty
Typa smile that makes you dizzy
Uh, it almost took me down, hey
And when it hit me, yeah, he started acting fishy
Bet he wishes he was nicer to me now
Such a composer how he wrote the story for us
But you didn't see this coming, did you now?
And I'd be lying if I said I wasn't crying
But he broke me so I had to take him out

When they come for me, oh, I'll be gone for miles, baby
And I'll think of you this way to your favorite song
When they find me I'll be riding high in style, baby
And I'll look down and I'll say

Catch me if you can
Ooh, I, mmm
Catch me if you can
Ooh, I, mmm
Catch me if you can

It's over now
But I'll see you in another life
Can't catch me now
It's over now
But I'll wait for you up in the sky
It's over now

When they come for me, oh, I'll be gone for miles, baby
And I'll think of you and slay

When they come for me, oh, I'll be gone for miles, baby
And I'll think of you this way to your favorite song
When they find me I'll be riding high in style, baby
And I'll look down and I'll say
Catch me if you can
Ooh, I, mmm
Catch me if you can
Ooh, I, mmm
Catch me if you can
