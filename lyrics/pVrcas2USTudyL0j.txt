Sung by jim

Fall to my bended knees
Shoving up till I freeze
Falling on down to you
Down down down
So choked up in the dust
Hand held holy lust
Dragging me to her cross
Fall fall fall
So I dragged you down
C'mon drag me down
So it seems to be
So it seems to me
That I just cant fail to see
Falling on down to you
Down down down
Everybody's falling on me
And I'm as dead as a christmas tree
