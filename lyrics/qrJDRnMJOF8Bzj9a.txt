He waved hello, silent like a mime
There's no changing my mind
I won't walk the stairs with you tonight
Going nowhere
The clock moved a quarter of a turn
The time it took a cigarette to burn
She said, "You got a lot of things to learn"
Going nowhere

Saw you move a certain way
Missed you a lot
Return to this abandoned place
Should have been forgot
Echoes drown the conversation out
Echoes that only seem to bring about
A silent expression
Things you may allow
Going nowhere

The steps made a pattern
I'd never seen
I felt like a kid of six or seventeen
I was off in some empty daydream
Going nowhere
It's dead and gone, matter of fact
Maybe for the best
Said some things you can't take back
Honestly I guess

The old records
Sitting on the floor
The ones I can't
Put on anymore
He walked over to her like before
Going nowhere
Going nowhere
Going nowhere
