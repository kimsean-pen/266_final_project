He said that he loved me, never would go
ahaaaa ahaaaa
Now I find I'm sitting here on my own
ahaaaa ahaaaa
Was it something I've said or done
That made him pack his bags up and run?
Could it be another he's found?
It's breaking up the happy home.

Mister can you tell me where my love has gone?
He's a Japanese boy.
I woke up one morning and my love was gone
Oh, my Japanese boy, ooh
I miss my Japanese boy.
aha aha aha aha aha aha aha aha aaaaaaa

People ask about him every day
oh oh, oh oh.
Don't know what to tell them what can I say?
Oh oh, oh oh.
If only he would write me or call
A word of explanation, that's all.
It would stop me climbing the wall.
It's breaking up the happy home.
Mister can you tell me where my love has gone?

He's a Japanese boy.
I woke up one morning and my love was gone
Oh, my Japanese boy, ooh
I miss my Japanese boy.
