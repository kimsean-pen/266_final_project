I've been so lost for so long
Every street's a dead end
Every sign points behind me
If you need me, don't
You can't trust a man
Who can't find his way home
My impaired intuition
Is telling me just to give in

If you find me
Would you please remind me
Why I woke up today

I feel so sick, doctor it hurts
And I exist

I hope it's not contagious

Maybe I'm asleep
And this is all a dream
I can't believe
Life is happening to me

If you find me
Would you please remind me
Why I should wake up tomorrow

This is me
Reaching out to you
Publicly
So, what else is new?

Maybe I'm asleep
And this is all a dream
