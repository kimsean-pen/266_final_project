Water gray
Through the windows
Up the stairs
Chilling rain
Like an ocean
Everywhere

Don't want to reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
And now there will be no mistaking
The levees are breaking

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet under water, I do

Hope decays
Generations disappear
Washed away
As a nation
Simply stares

Don't want to reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
But now there will be no mistaking
The levees are breaking

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet under water, I do

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underground now I
Now I do

Little things give you away
Little things give you away
Little things give you away
Little things give you away

(Little things give you away) All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you (little things give you away)
(Little things give you away) All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you (little things give you away)

(Little things give you away) All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you (little things give you away)
(Little things give you away) All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you (little things give you away)

(Little things give you away) All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you (little things give you away)
(Little things give you away) All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you (little things give you away)
