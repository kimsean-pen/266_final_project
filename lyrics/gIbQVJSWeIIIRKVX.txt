What am I to do
Been caught up for a while
I'm feeling like a fool
Cuz when I fall I fall so hard

I guess it's not my fault
I'm losing all control
If only I could play it cool cool
But I'm burning deep inside

Never thought that
I could get this far
Wanna stay away
From where you are
Find myself alone in this bar
Oh yeah

I'm always fighting this feeling
Come on DJ keep spinning tonight

And turn up the music
I wanna escape it all
Turn up the music
Cuz I'm trying to forget him
Don't wanna think about love

Emotions on a high
Let's do another round
Already bulletproof
Ain't gonna let you shoot me down

Never thought that
I could get this far
Wanna stay away
From where you are
Find myself alone and in this bar
Oh yeah

I'm always fighting this feeling
Come on DJ keep spinning tonight

And turn up the music
I wanna escape it all
Turn up the music
Cuz I'm trying to forget him
Don't wanna think about love

There's no way to
love love love love again
There's no way to
love love love love again

Whatever you say
Cuz I'm trying to forget you

You are the... music
Best Mistake
Best Mistake
Best Mistake
You are the... music
Best Mistake
Best Mistake

Cuz I'm trying to forget him
Don't wanna think about love
And turn up the music
I wanna escape it all
Turn up the music
Cuz I'm trying to forget him
Don't wanna think about love
