on a page torn from this book
i drew a waveform with your blood
and so i follow it, and so remorse
courses through my body, of course

in a little while i'll go
unless you might wanna hang a while
then i won't
you're the only one i found so far
so outside i could be around
so come down
come over

on a cutting board
the lights were shutting down
an avocado cut through your thumb
coursing out
already undone

in a little while i'll go
unless you might wanna hang a while
then i won't
you're the only one i found so far
so outside i could be around
you should come down
over through the fire escape
it's so late
but i know you aren't tired yet
and i'll bet you've got a couple things you think i should know
but unless you wanna say 'em now
i'll go, yeah
