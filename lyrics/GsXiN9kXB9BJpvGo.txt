You're so strong, oh to lose your sister all to young
Swept away, never ending ocean waves
Her eyes are always gray
No... she's never coming back
No... she's never coming back

A broken floor never spilled so many tears before
Living on your hill, yeah you wish the gun against your will
Oh... no... she's never coming back
And you know she's never coming back
And you know she's never coming back
No she's never coming back
She's never coming back
She's never coming back
