summer dress makes you more beautiful than the rest
lovliest girl that i know, and the sweetest
spends her life inside, she thinks she isn't blessed

summer dress separates you from the rest
easiest days of her life have been spent
wonders if she is loved, if she is missed

says a prayer as she's kissed by ocean mist
takes herself to the sand and dreams

says a prayer as she's kissed by ocean mist
takes herself to the sand and dreams
