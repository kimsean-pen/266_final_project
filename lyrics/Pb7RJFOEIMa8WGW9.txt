some dreams
live on in time forever
those dreams,
you want with all your heart

and i'll do whatever it takes
follow through with the promise i made
put it all on the line
what i hoped for at last would be mine

if i could reach, higher
just for one moment touch the sky
from that one moment in my life
i'm gonna be stronger
know that i've tried my very best
i'd put my spirit to the test
if i could reach

some days
are meant to be remembered
those days
we rise above the stars

so i'll go the distance this time
seeing more the higher i climb
that the more i believe
all the more that this dream will be mine

if i could reach, higher
just for one moment touch the sky
from that one moment in my life
i'm gonna be stronger
knowing that i've tried my very best
i'd put my spirit to the test
if i could reach

if i could reach, higher
just for one moment touch the sky
that one moment in my life
i'm gonna be stronger
i'm gonna be so much stronger
yes i am
i put my spirit to the test

if i could reach,
if i could, if i could
if i could reach
reach, i'd reach, i'd reach
i'd reach, i'd reach so
much higher
