This dress that I made
Out of the curtains
Was on the line
Dancing around
Better than I can
Now we walk up
To the top of the street
Once letting go
Rain sails us in a leafy boat
Down the street
And we'll be there before we know
There go the lawn chairs
Some frogs are racing them
To catch up with me
Gray buildings go by
Violety sky lit up with trees in yellow
Once letting go
Rain sails us in a leafy boat
Down the street
And we'll be there before we know
Hey, is that you
Going by, swimming by
Hey, is that you
Zig-zagging, whizzing by
Sailing up, sailing by
Once letting go
Rain sails us in a leafy boat
Down the street
And we'll be there before we know
