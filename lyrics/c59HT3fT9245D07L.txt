One by one we see the sun
Feel the day has just begun
Trembling lights up in the clouds
All we need to feel is now
As we work
Get me a parachute
Take me to the sky
Just take me to the blue
Before I start to collide
Get me a parachute
Take me to the sun
We'll be a miracle
To turn this world into one
Get me a parachute
One by one we see the sun
Feel the day has just begun
Trembling lights up in the clouds
All we need to feel is now
As we work
Get me a parachute
Take me to the sky
Just take me to the blue
Before I start to collide
Get me a parachute
Take me to the sun
We'll be a miracle
To turn this world into one
Get me a parachute
Take me to the sky
Just take me to the blue
Before I start to collide
Get me a parachute
Take me to the sun
We'll be a miracle
To turn this world into one
Get me a parachute
Get me a parachute
Take me to the sky
Just take me to the blue
Before I start to collide
Get me a parachute
Take me to the sun
We'll be a miracle
To turn this world into one
