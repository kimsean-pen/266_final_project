We stand in flames to defend this home
Not one, none can defeat us
To pave the way for the new - the birth of a legion
So natural
The order falls
So natural

The end archaic
Dissension breeds within their hearts
The haunting calls of devastation
To stand this ground - stand our ground
A steadfast gathering

So natural

The order falls
So natural
The end archaic
Blunt force to erase all that we've known
To witness this distance between us
Blunt force to erase all that we've known
To witness this distance between us
Change of flame
Birth of a legion
The birth of a legion
We stand in flames to defend this home
Not one, none can defeat us
To pave the way for the new - the birth of a legion
So natural
The order falls
So natural
The end archaic
Blunt force to erase all that we've known
To witness this distance between us
Blunt force to erase all that we've known
To witness this distance between us
You threw it all away
You threw it all away
Change of flame
Birth of a legion
Change of flame
The birth of a legion
