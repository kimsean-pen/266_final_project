It's 3 o'clock, and we ask ourselves
Where are we now?
It seems we've wondered out of bounds again

(Over and over we, ask ourselves why we don't,
Utilize things that are, stored deep inside of our...)

Deep inside, I'm on my own, I can't see straight
Deep inside, cause I'm so stoned, I can't see straight
Man, I've got to find my way back home, but I'm too deep inside

It's 4 o'clock, and we ask ourselves
Where did we go wrong?
We passed my house at least an hour ago

(Over and over we, ask ourselves why don't,
Utilize things that are, stored deep inside of our...)

Deep inside, I'm on my own, I can't see straight
Deep inside, 'cause I'm so stoned, I can't see straight

It's 5 o'clock, and we tell ourselves
We need to get home
The sun is creeping overhead again

I'm way too deep inside to get home...
I'm way too deep inside to get home...
I'm way too deep inside to get home...
I'm way too deep inside to get home...
Oh my god I've got to get home...
Oh my god I've got to get home...
Oh my god I've got to get home...
I'm way too deep inside to get home

(over and over we, ask ourselves why we don't,
Utilize things that, are stored deep inside of our...)

I know exactly where we are, where the FUCK are we?
