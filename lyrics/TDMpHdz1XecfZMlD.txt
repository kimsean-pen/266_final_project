And this is my last remaining filter
On my last remaining words
It's leaving the taste
Of something bitter on my tongue

I'm leaving a letter full of reasons
Along with a line that starts to blur
Into a page that says
You faded way too young

'Cause you're leaving something
Short of innocent
I'm still thinking of the times
We should have spent

It's as if this form of treason
Crawled up deep inside your head
And left you notes
On how to keep your insides dead

If I had any other heart
If any other piece spoke louder
If I had any other hands
I wouldn't need the voice to tell
The world about the coward

That refuses to stand
And claim the blood on your hands
If I had any other heart beside my own
We might have left you cold

I'm handed a book about instructions
On when I should know to go
And tracing my fingers
Down the binding I get cold

'Cause I've been this awful shade of lonely
Since your reasons left the room
And I'd see everything get warmer
If you decide to follow suit

If I could paint the town
With all your good intent
I'd leave these walls
As red as my eyes could have been

While picking comfort for my father
For a place to rest his head
Well, Tallahassee will stay gray outside instead

If I had any other heart
If any other piece spoke louder
If I had any other hands
I wouldn't need the voice to tell
The world about the coward

That refuses to stand
And claim the blood on your hands
If I had any other heart
If I had any other heart beside my own

If I were king of the world
Then I would build you a day
A smile just to rip it all away
I want to make a memory in your head
That screams about regret

If I had any other heart
If any other piece spoke louder
If I had any other hands
If I had any other hands

Oh God, if I had any other hands
God, if I had any other hands
And you're still refusing to stand
And claim the blood on your hands
If I had any other word
If I had any other way
