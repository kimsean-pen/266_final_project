I'm going back, thinking about all the changes.
I'm going back to all those wasted years.
I see the rise and fall of the world I lived in.
This time it doesn't seem real at all.
But I took the fall and on came all the changes.
All i had could not be saved - it was far too late.

Everyone leaves. In the end.
Everything dies. In the end.
It doesn't matter how hard you hold on.

I'm going back to the times you went away.
I thought you thought that I was the monster.
I see the rise and fall of the world that I made.
I always wanted to take you with me.
And then I saw some people for the people that I thought they were.
In your painful absence.

Everyone leaves. In the end.
Everything dies. In the end.
It doesn't matter how hard you hold on.

How hard can you?
Do you want to hold on?

How hard can you?
The all leave in the end.

How hard can you?
We all die in the end.
