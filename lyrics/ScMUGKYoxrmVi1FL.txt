It was nine twenty nine
Nine twenty nine, back street, big city
The sun was going down
There was music all around
It felt so right
It was one of those nights
One of those nights
When you feel the world stop turning
You were standing there
There was music in the air
I should have been away
But I knew I had to stay
Last train to London
Just heading out
Last train to London
Just leaving town
But I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you
Let the music play on down the line tonight
It was one of those nights
One of those nights when you feel the fire is burning
Everybody was there
Everybody to share
It was so right
There you were on your own
Looking like you were the only one around
I had to be with you
Nothing else that I could do
I should have been away
But I knew I had to stay
Last train to London
Just heading out
Last train to London
Just leaving town
But I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you
Let the music play on down the line tonight

Underneath a starry sky
Time was still but hours must really have rushed by
I didn't realize, but love was in your eyes
I really should have gone
But love went on and on
Last train to London
Just heading out
Last train to London
Just leaving town
But I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you
Let the music play on down the line tonight
But I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you
Let the music play on down the line tonight
