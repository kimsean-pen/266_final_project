Hey man there's a hole in my arm where all the money goes
Jesus christ died for nothin' I suppose

Cop shoot cop
I believe
I believe that I have been reborn
Cop shoot cop
I haven't got the time no more

Hey man there's a hole in my head where information goes
And all my friends died for nothin' I suppose

Cop shoot cop
I believe
I believe that I have been reborn
Cop shoot cop
I haven't got the time no more

Hey man there's a hole in my reason that I gotta close
'cause all my love died for nothin' I suppose

Cop shoot cop
I believe

I believe that I have been reborn
Cop shoot cop
I haven't got the time no more
Desert is any place without you
oh my love, I'm pretty sure that you can feel that too
and loneliness, you know it hits me and it lasts for days
cause you're so sweet you make me feel like a child my babe
desert is where I find myself when i get blown
cause you're so sweet and I can't seem to find my way back home
if this is heaven, well you know that I'm not happy here
cause heaven ain't any place where you're not there
desert is any place without you my friend
and I will love you even if I'm getting to the end
cause you're so sweet I'm always wishing babe that you were here
desert is any place without you my dear
and I will love you
and I will love you
and I will love you
and I will love you
and I will love you
and I will love you
and I will love you
