Anger lost
Fear from the beat and the pulse
Laughing like a fool
Playing for the heart and the soul
And the soul
Capture something red
Paste it to the edge of your bed
Someone will be there
Someone who will know what is says
What it says
Feel it breath
Feel it breath
Nothing is lost .
Feel it breath

Elevate your fingers
Motions makes it hard to Write
...Feel right
Feel right
Feel it breath
Nothing is lost .
Feel it breath
