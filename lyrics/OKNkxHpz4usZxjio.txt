We take your soul back home
And lead you to the dome
No word forgiven for we sinned
The holy wolf brigade
The priests of metal blade
Scream words of wicked in the wind

We are the bloodred five
Never come alone
We are wolves against the world
We keep the storm alive
We are made of stone
Forever wolves against the world

We are devils in disguise
We're the demons of the night
We're the priests of heavy metal and we rise
By the power of the claw
We are preachers of the raw
And we carry on the bible is the law
Together

We are the bloodred five
Never come alone
We are wolves against the world
We keep the storm alive
We are made of stone
Forever wolves against the world

Stand here together and never compromise
Born of the dark we are

We fight for hurricane, fire and death
We fight for hurricane, fire and death

No storm could break our pride
We rise where others hide
We're banned from heaven and we swear
Come near my friend and see
Your soul we guarantee
We'll rise to rebell so beware

We are the bloodred five
Never come alone
We are wolves against the world
We keep the storm alive
We are made of stone
Forever wolves against the world
