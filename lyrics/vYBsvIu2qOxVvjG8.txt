Are you up there?
Just give me a signal I'm reaching you now
'Cause I remember the sound of your voice
But I don't remember what we talked about
It doesn't matter, that's a waste of time

So take off your rings and lipstick for me

I swear that I can hear you in the wind
You're singing to me and you're
Dancing in the halls outside again

I'm always listening
Send me off into space on this rocket invention
We'll look at the lights over the atmosphere
Eat gold medal ribbon till we die up here it's
self sabotage, suffocation and stale taste of blood

I swear that I can hear you in the wind
You're singing to me and you're
Dancing in the halls outside again

And I'm always listening
I'll teach you to love, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I'll teach you to love, oh-oh, oh-oh
Again
Swear that I can hear you in the wind
You're singing to me and
Dancing in the halls outside again
I'm always listening
I'm always listening
I swear, I swear, I swear, oh
