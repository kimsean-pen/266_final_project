Do you hear me?
Do you care?
Do you hear me?
Do you care?

My lips are moving and the sound's coming out
The words are audible but I have my doubts
That you realize what has been said
You look at me as if you're in a daze
It's like the feeling at the end of the page
When you realize you don't know what you just read

What are words for
When no one listens anymore
What are words for
When no one listens
What are words for
When no one listens
There's no use talking at all

I might as well go up and talk to a wall
'Cause all the words are having no effect at all
It's a funny thing, I say to myself
Something has to happen to change the direction
What little filters though is giving you the wrong impression
It's a sorry state, am I all alone?

What are words for
When no one listens anymore
What are words for
When no one listens
What are words for
When no one listens
There's no use talking at all

Do you hear me?
Do you care?
Do you hear me?
Do you care?

Let me get by over your dead body
Hope to see you soon, when will I know?
Doors three feet wide with no locks open
Walking always backwards in the faces of strangers
Time could be my friend
But it's less than nowhere now, it's less than nowhere now
It's less than nowhere now, nowhere now

Pursue it any further and another thing you'll find
Not only are they deaf and dumb they could be going blind
No one notices, I think I'll dye my hair blue
Media overload bombarding you with action
It's getting near impossible to cause distraction
Someone answer me before I pull the plug

What are words for
When no one listens anymore
What are words for
When no one listens
What are words for
When no one listens
There's no use talking at all

What are words for
When no one listens anymore
What are words for
When no one listens
What are words for
When no one listens
There's no use talking at all

Do you hear me?

Do you care?
