Walls of tears
Confined our lives and dignity
Hushed in fear
The peaceful days are gone
As memories

Invasion kept us prisoners
Nails of scorn
Were driven through those masks
That made us strangers
Their anger kept us prisoners
Doors of stone'
Concealing truth for years
Silently

Days of fear
Are carving paths for us to take
Mournful years
Could never wilt our hopes
In freedom's sake

Escaping from this misery
Darkness shall unfurl its wings
And give us all the answers
Each footstep made with bravery
Dreadful chains
Are breaking from our feet
Free we'll be

In time,
One's fate finds peaceful grounds
In sight,
One's eye triggers and shoots
In pain,
One's fate finds crimson grounds
In vain,
One' eye captured the truth

Absconders
