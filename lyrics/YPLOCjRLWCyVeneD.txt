I need living or a lightning
For no land
I would let you down

All that you were
Now is fading
Your bed's a rose
For a while

Beg for you
You little hope being alive
For you hold on this is your last
End to be near

The green of a serenade
Falling in love means
To blow up fate

Breaking down
For a distant life
We are alone
I am the solitude

Beg for you
You little hope being alive
For you hold on this is your last
End to be near

Beg for you
You little hope being alive
For you hold on this is your last
End to be near

Beg for you
You little hope being alive
For you hold on this is your last
End to be near
