Why should I apologize?
I'm just trying to live my life
Did that ever cross your mind?

I don't need you the way you want me
I don't need you the way you want me to

I never meant to let you down
I gave you more than I gave anyone
And I can never get it back

I don't need you the way you want me
I don't need you the way you want me to

My heart's not yours just because you need it
Just because you need me
My heart's not yours just because you need it
Just because you need me

I don't need you the way you want me
I don't need you the way you want me to

Just because you need me, doesn't mean I'm yours
Just because you need me, doesn't mean I'm yours
