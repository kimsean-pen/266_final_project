Breath is like us maybe
Trust it all back
Cant take me home
You cant see my patience
Breathless again
But im still beating home
Time awaits my lady
The soveignty
Keep on breathing
You were there I take it
Where the place it could be older
Then ill say
Never hold back on yourself
Leave it all behind
Never hold back on yourself
Leave it all behind

You thought I'm mistaken
Bless it all by this vacancy
Try to show my patience
Breathless again
But im still beating

Never hold back on yourself
Leave it all behind
Never hold back on yourself
Leave it all behind

Love to save my soul
Isnt there enough
Love to save my soul
Isnt there enough
Love to save my soul

(My best guess, i hope someone can correct
