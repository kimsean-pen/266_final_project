If I'm innocent when I dream
Then I'll be dreaming
Don't wake me, I'm not even here

Not even death could lay his hands on me
I'm fast asleep and can't be guilty

Wake me when the dust has settled
Then just give it to me straight
Is there anything that's left?
Kill me if there's cause for weeping
Until then, I will be sleeping

Not even death could lay his hands on me
I'm fast asleep and can't be guilty

Please don't let me know what's coming
If you should find a way to
Not even if it comes for us
Cause by the time that it does
It will be so much stronger than the two of us

You could close your eyes and go to sleep with me
As long as we do we can't be guilty
