Midnight wish
Blow me a kiss
I'll blow one to you
Make like this
Try to pretend it's true

Show me all your favorite things
Show you all mine too
Make a wish
I'll give it all to you

Welcome to your promises
Welcome to mine too
Caught like this
I'll turn it in with you

Fall apart my bleeding heart
Nothing left to do
Once in love
I'll be the death of you
