Beneath the blood moon, all filled with wine
You say you love me, for the very first time
And as the three words fire from your teeth
Like some perfect bullet
To knock me off my feet

I'll be loving you too
The shadow of your heart it cuts right through

And as you fall for some decent man
You place your life into his trembling hands
And as the red sun struggles up in the sky
With his arms around you
And your dreaming eyes

I'll be loving you too
The shadow of your heart it cuts right through
I'll be loving you too
From your lips to the dirt they lower me down into

And as I make love to another one
Your name is riding on the tip of my tongue
And as her body crashes on my like a wave
My resolve may weaken
But never break

I'll be loving you too
The shadow of your heart it cuts right through
I'll be loving you too
From your lips to the dirt they lower me down into
And the shadow of your heart it cuts right through

And when the day comes
You've forgotten my name
And I've drunk an ocean
To try to quell the pain

And in your autumn
When your colors have changed
Your naked branches
Oh your limbs don't feel the same

And on the Greyhound to the afterlife
I was looking out my window
All this time

I'll be loving you too
The shadow of your heart it cuts right through
I'll be loving you too
From your lips to the dirt they lower me down into
