If there were no tomorrows
If there was just one more chance
I'd take it again
You know I'd take it again

You turn and it's gone forever
In time you forget
You know that's love
It's only love

And no matter where the days have left you
Every day ends at the street café
The street café
And no matter where the road may take you
Every time it brings you back to the street café
It's where you have to be

Well the people may come and go but
Here the street and the scene is just
The way that it was
Mmm the way that it was

No nothing will ever change here
Maybe a smile reminds you
Now and again
You wonder now and again

When another night will take you nowhere
You go down to the street café
And any time you know the crowd can hide you
The days end at the street café
Yeah the street café

Ohh you turn and it's gone forever
In time you forget
You know that's love
You know it's only love

But no matter where the days have left you
Every day ends at the street café
The street café, uh-huh
And no matter where the road may take you
Every time it brings you back to the street café
Yeah the street café, woh-hoh

Oh no, no, no
No matter where the road may take you
We'll meet again someday
You know we'll meet someday
Someday at the street café
