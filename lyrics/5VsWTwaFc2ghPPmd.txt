I can heal it like your sounds babe
I can feel it like your fears
I can go another round your way, but I can't do this on my own
I thought you'd love me 'til I'm raw, oh my God, mm
I thought you'd love me till I'm raw, oh my God, oh my God

It's tough to face
My Phoenix rising crazy
Oh it's got a hold on me
This kind of love ain't stable

See all these ghosts dripping blood on this pain
Kill all these ghosts with slow motion explosions
Feel my body through your fears and stains
I'm coming fast, oh my God, oh my God

It's tough to face
My Phoenix rising crazy
Oh it's gotta hold on me
This kind of love ain't stable
Oh it's gotta hold on me
This kind of love (this kind of love) ain't stable
Oh it's gotta hold on me
This kind of love ain't stable
Oh it's gotta hold on me
This kind of love (this kind of love) ain't stable
Oh it's gotta hold on me
This kind of love ain't stable
Oh it's gotta hold on

I finally brought my fate up
I finally brought my fate up
I finally brought my fate up
I finally brought my fate up
I finally brought my fate up
I finally brought my fate up
