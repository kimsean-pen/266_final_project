I hear your endless talking
While you feed me all you have to say
I believed every lie so easily

But now my eyes are open
I see you just for what you really are
Hiding every truth you've ever heard

You will not restrain me!
You will never break me!

Take my world, but you'll never take my soul
Burn it down to ashes on the ground
Take my world and swallow it whole
Burn it down, but you'll never take control!
Never take control of me!

You know you almost had me
I believed in every word you said
Every deed was buried in the darkness

Knowing all the secrets
Living in such beautiful detachment
All the time spreading your disease

You will not restrain me!
You will never break me!

Take my world, but you'll never take my soul
Burn it down to ashes on the ground
Take my world and swallow it whole
Burn it down, but you'll never take control!
Never take control of me, yeah!

You will not restrain me!
You will never break me!

Take my world, but you'll never take my soul
Burn it down to ashes on the ground
Take my world and swallow it whole
Burn it down, but you'll never take control!
Never take control of me!

Take my world, but you'll never take my soul
Burn it down to ashes on the ground
Take my world and swallow it whole
Burn it down, but you'll never take control!
Never take control of me!
