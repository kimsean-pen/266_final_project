Love fails to die
Remain survives
It feeds off life

Weary frustration it's not enough
I'm pleading with the Solitary one
In this temptation we're without blood
I'm weakened by a solitary one

Redemption lies
In blood-filled eyes

Weary frustration it's not enough
I'm pleading with the Solitary one
In this damnation we're without blood
I'm weakened by a solitary one
