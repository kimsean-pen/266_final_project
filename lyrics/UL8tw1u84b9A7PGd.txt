Wasn't like this when it started
Wasn't like you, broken-hearted
Couldn't fight it (Couldn't fight it)

We were painted one and only
Didn't see you, didn't know me
We've been changing (We've been changing)

I know you've been afraid (afraid)
But through it all I'll stay (I'll stay)
No matter who you are, I'm yours
No matter who you are, I'm yours (I'm yours)

Ain't no limit to your loving
Been addicted to each other
Unrestricted (Unrestricted)

But you've been saying that we're drifting
That you became something different
And you need space

I know you've been afraid (afraid)
But through it all I'll stay (I'll stay)
No matter who you are, I'm yours (I'm yours)
No matter who you are, I'm yours (I'm yours)

I've been dreaming for a long, long time
For the day when I could call you mine

Sundown for a thousand flames
Stand out in the pouring rain
Call out my...
Call out my name
And I will be...
And I will be (...) Yours
And I will be (...) Yours

Sundown for a thousand flames
Stand out in the pouring rain
Call out my...
Call out my name
And I will be...
And I will be (...) Yours
And I will be (...) Yours

No matter who you are, I'm yours (I'm yours)
No matter who you are, I'm yours (I'm yours) (I'm yours)
No matter who...
No matter, no matter...
No matter who, no matter who
No matter who
