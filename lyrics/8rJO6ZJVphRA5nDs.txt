Chance brought me down on your side
She's just along for the ride
Wings melt and we hide
And all this means nothing to the sun.
Are we leaving this one?

Mine comes true here
Bruised, expanding clear
Mind full of you here
I won't claim losses in the sun
Are we leaving this one?

And swift out, she goes to the last frame
Short lives and long days and if I stay
Then we'll lay way to you

Your ocean spreads out on sunbeams
Radiant, knowing
And your hand looks so nice in mine
And it's been a thousand years seen since inception
And you're radiant, glowing
And they say that you're doing fine

Your ocean spreads out on sunbeams
Radiant, knowing
Your hand looks so nice in mine
And the new construct will have both of us
Stapled to the island for awhile
And they say that you're doing fine
