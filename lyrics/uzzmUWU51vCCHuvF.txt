Can't get to Heaven in a silver spoon
Polish everything except for the mark on you, you

Come be the first in line, to shake the hand of mine
Come be the first in line, to shake the hand of

All hands on the bad one, all hands on the bad one
We would be no better, we would be no better
All hands on the bad one, all hands on the bad one
We would be no better, we would be no better

Can't get to Heaven in your Sunday best
When night before they were callin' it your cocktail dress, dress

Come be the first in line, to shake the hand of mine
Come be the first in line, to shake the hand of

All hands on the bad one, all hands on the bad one
We would be no better, we would be no better
All hands on the bad one, all hands on the bad one
We would be no better, we would be no better

All hands on the bad one, all hands on the bad one
We would be no better, we would be no better
All hands on the bad one

Can't get to Heaven with a three chord song
Called you a sinner, people want to sing along, along
