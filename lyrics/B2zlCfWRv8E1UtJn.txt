I told you I was looking for some empathy
Well you fooled me
Just a touch and a thought and I was gone

And now
Someone's gonna get to know the better you
When I was supposed to
Oh, ooh, oooh
Why did it have to be you?

I guess
Now the next time there's an opportunity
I'll tread more carefully
My heart's running out of cellotape

You know
How is it I've never felt that way before
I was so sure
Oh, ooh, oooh
It wasn't gonna be you

Why do all the red flags
Just look like so much fun?
Oh, I have a habit of searching for the damage to
Share my love

I promised to be numb
But somehow you were the one
Now to unwind months
Of a good time

People will tell me that I messed up
And it wasn't love
And I'm secretly hoping they are right

Because
Whatever it was it was wonderful
But non functional
Oh, ooh, oooh
I really hope I don't love you

Oooooh ooooh hmmm
Ahhoooooo Aahhooo
HmmHmmHmmm
