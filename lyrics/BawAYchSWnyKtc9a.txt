Speed leaving without warning...
I need some place to sleep tonight.
Blowing in the rocking of the pine,
Speed leaving without warning.
The sunlight is going into the mountain...

I will crawl into the mountain.
Sun shines in the rusty morning...
Skyline of the Olympus Mons,
I think about it sometimes.
Sun shines in the rusty morning...
Once I had a good fly,
Into the mountain, I will fall.
