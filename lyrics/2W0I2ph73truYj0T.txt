Warmth in the west, self-suffocation
My vision lies in the familiar loop
Love is my frailty
So I dragged myself up
One time around the carousel
And I aged another decade
But how I could have stayed
Fever in the eastern dell
A figure called me from the fresco
A diffuse monastic in the mirror

I left my body on the ridge
So I followed the hanging rope

Down, down to the material world
I met the knot
And there on the far bank
You kissed me
I know you always knew why
