Keep your faith if you want
Keep your brace if you want
I'll just fuck up and fuck up again

To my mother
Who loves to tell me I'm a mistake
And her daughter
Spitting in my face every day
I'm not like you

To my brother
Always too concerned with my faith
And now my father
Who ran away to play a new game
I'm not like you

Keep your faith if you want
Keep your grace if you want
I'll fuck up and fuck up again
It never ends
Keep your faith if you need it
Hide my face if you hate it
I'll fuck up and fuck up 'cause I'm fucked up again

Here's to the priest
Telling me that "heaven's for me"
What about my friends?
Who never should have died in their dreams
Tell me one more lie
Make up a side
Make up a side
Tell me one more lie
Prove to me there's something on the other side

I am not the same as you
I am not the same
And I will never be, so

Keep your faith if you want
Keep your grace if you want
I'll fuck up and fuck up again
It never ends
Keep your faith if you need it
Hide my face if you hate it
I'll fuck up and fuck up 'cause I'm fucked up again

Maybe I'm ashamed that we share our last name, what?

You'd drop everything
To help out anyone but me
Because I just can't believe
So know that's why you're dead to me

I can't find God
I can't find God
I can't find God
I can't find God
(Where are you?)
I can't find God
(I can't find God)
I can't find God
(I can't find God)
I can't find God
(I can't find God)
I can't find God
(Show me where he is)
I can't find God
(I can't fuckin find him)
I can't find God
(Where is he?)
I can't find God
(Fuck)

Keep your faith if you want
Keep your brace if you want
I'll just fuck up and fuck up again
It never ends

Keep your faith if you need it
Hide my face if you hate it
I'll fuck up and fuck up 'cause I'm fucked up again

Keep your faith if you want
Wear your brace if you want
I'll fuck up and fuck up again
It never ends
Keep your faith if you need it
Hide my face if you hate it
I'll fuck up and fuck up 'cause I'm fucked up again
It never ends
