I remember how we used to sing
Writing poems in your bed sit
Finding time to be the passenger
But there you are you never saw me leave

But there you go you're sailing away
And you know
You never come away
Yeah but you should
You never lie to me
Yeah but I will
Never come away
Yeah but you should

But do you really want to see
Oh do you really want to see
Oh do you really want see
On your television screen

I remember how we used to be
Without the world upon our TV
Well let it lie or you can take it back
Wrap your life around evil's trap

But there you are you're sailing away
And you know
You never come away
Yeah but you should
You never lie to me
Yeah but I will
Never come away
Yeah but you should

Well do you want to see the world what what
Do you want to see the world what what
Well do you want to see the what what what
Well do you want to see the world what what what
Well do you want to see the world (I know I do) what what what
Do you want to see the world (I know I do) what what what
Well do you really want to what what (I know I do)
Well do you really want to what what (I know I do)
Well do you really want to see (I know I do... I know I do... I know I do)
