[Chorus]
Over my head
big waves will fall
turn away
out into the ocean
see you

loyal to the lost
never to the success we saw
i was in the water washing away

we will resurface again
so be very patient

[Chorus]
Over my head
big waves will fall
turn away
out into the ocean
see you

stay under
stay under
Poseidon will defeat you
preserve the oxygen
you need too

navigate the channel
we heavy arms and shoulders aching
I was unprepared
I didn't realize the scope of the shoreline
I hope it will be fine

how to return to the safety
I don't know
I don't know
how to return to the safety of the shoreline?

loyal to the lost
we will resurface again
so be very patient

[Chorus]
Over my head
big waves will fall
turn away
out into the ocean
I see you
