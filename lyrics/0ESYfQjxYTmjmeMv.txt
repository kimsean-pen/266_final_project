This is not me at all
I used to be so much stronger
Here I am holding on
When there's nothing to hold onto, now
I've tried to understand,
It's not making sense

If you don't want to be here tonight
Why do I still want you to stay
If you don't want to reach out your hand
Why do I find a way
If I don't have a place in your heart
Why do I say maybe in time
If you don't want to give me your love
Why do I give you mine
Tell me why do I
Why do I
Why do I

Always loved the sound of your voice
Couldn't be to hear you whisper
Always love you here by my side
You said that it would be forever
It was meant to be forever

If you don't want to be here tonight
Why do I still want you to stay
If you don't want to reach out your hand
Why do I find a way
If I don't have a place in your heart
Why do I say maybe in time
If you don't want to give me your love
Why do I give you mine
Tell me why do I
Why do I
Why do I

This is not like me all
Not me at all

If you don't want to be here tonight
Why do I still want you to stay
If you don't want to reach out your hand
Why do I find a way (why do I find a way)
If I don't have a place in your heart
Why do I say maybe in time
If you don't want to give me your love
Why do I give you mine
Tell me why do I
Why do I
(Tell me why do I)
Why do I
(Tell me why do I)
Why do I
(Tell me why do I)

Why do I
Why do I
Why do I
Why do I
Why do I
Why do I
