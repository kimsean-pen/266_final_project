The way that she moves well I was aroused
Impowered impassioned by every move
It's so cold outside we need a place to hide
Go into the club to thaw out for the night

She's automatic, so automatic
The way that she moves, the way that she moves
She's automatic, so automatic
The way she moves

Situations get tricky I was feeling so proud
The bass and the drums the music so loud
She asked me if I would stand her side
Like glue that I would till the end of the night

She's automatic, so automatic
The way that she moves, the way that she moves
She's automatic, so automatic
The way she moves, yeah

My head was spinnin' a million miles an hour
The chance I was takin' I get anxious around her
She put her head on my shoulder I started to hold her
Swingin' and swayin' the morning began

She's automatic, so automatic
The way that she moves, the way that she moves
She's automatic, so automatic
The way she moves, yeah

I say the way she moves, yeah
I say the way she moves, yeah
I say the way she moves, yeah
I say the way she moves
