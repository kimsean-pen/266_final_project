Lichen softens on bended knees
Stone sleeping under heaving seas
Further north frost catches her heels
Cut through the ice among birds and seals
Hollow, hollow, hollow oh hollow, hollow ...
Frost in her hair and sand in her shoes
Skirts the coastline, iron-black and blue
If you stand on the line you can see it all
From Viking to bedsit the curvature falls
Hollow, hollow, hollow, hollow oh hollow, hollow ...
When I was young I had a fever
All tight and swaddled a believer
Clear pinball behind my eyes
Sheets knotted for windows til it passed by.
