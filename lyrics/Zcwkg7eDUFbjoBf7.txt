Some people suppress you
They partch you
And reap a disaster
Reeducation for the infants

Who demanded for an innocent instance
The great commandment
Shows the contempt
Between the world and their embarrassing pavement
Believe the scholars
Read the readings

Realize the man who says anything

The great commandment
The needers believe you
They treat you
Like survivors of a disaster
Reeducation for the infants

Who demanded for an innocent instance
The great commandment
Shows the contempt
Between the world and their embarrassing pavement
Believe the scholars
Read the readings

Realize the man who says anything
The great commandment
Shows the contempt
Between the world and their embarrassing pavement
Believe the scholars

Realize the man who says anything
