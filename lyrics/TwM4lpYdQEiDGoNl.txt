Girl meets boy and girl goes crazy
Boy backs away, she gets her heart broken
No words are spoken
Boy comes back and acts
As if everything is cool
Soon she's got him back on a pedestal
She only sees what she wants to see
Love is blind, love is so misleading

I see the light, oh what a light!
And I am sober
All that you served to me
No longer will I drink it in
I took the time to think it over
I see the you, I had never knew
Now it's finally sinking in
I am sober
I am sober

Girl wakes up and smells the coffee one day
Realizes she's on her own again
All alone again
Boy takes every opportunity
To play on every insecurity
Get her back on track
She's in a daze, back in the fire
But will she cave into her old desires?

I see the light, oh what a light!
And I am sober
All that you served to me
No longer will I drink it in
I took the time to think it over
I see the you I had never knew
Now it's finally sinking in
I am sober
I am sober

I see the light, oh what a light!
She's in a daze, back in the fire
But will she cave into her old desires?

I see the light, oh what a light!
And I am sober
All that you served to me
No longer will I drink it in
I took the time to think it over
I see the you I had never knew
Now it's finally sinking in
I am sober
I am sober

I see the light, oh what a light!
And I am sober
