Do you really want it?

You say gimme a high, oh god, gimme a feeling
(I've lost my reason)
You say gimme a push, oh push through this
(Concrete ceiling)
You say gimme a sign that proves what I believe in
(My psychic reading)
So I can shake these american demons
Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme

Everybody wants to change the world
But one thing is clear
No one ever wants to change themselves
(That's the way things are)
All because we hate the buzzkill, hate it when we need to feel
But we can change it all (if you really want it)

Do you really want it?
Do you really want it?
(Come, come, come)

You gotta bite the bullet, 'til your guts are bleeding
(Grab a mic and scream it)
You gotta dig up the past to get past this
(Anxious feeling)
You gotta get ripped apart to see what you breathe in
(To find a reason)
So I can shake these american demons
Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme

Everybody wants to change the world
But one thing is clear
No one ever wants to change themselves
(That's the way things are)
All because we hate the buzzkill, hate it when we need to feel
But we can change it all (if you really want it)
But we can change it all

Do you really want it?
Do ya, do ya?
Do you really want it?
Do ya, do ya?
So I can shake these american demons
Screaming, screaming, screaming
Everybody

Wants to change the world
But one thing is clear
No one ever wants to change themselves
(That's the way things are)
All because we hate the buzzkill, getting what we need to feel
But we can change it all
(But we can change it all)
We can change it all
If you really want it

(But we can change it all)
(Yeah, we can change it all)
If you really want it
(We can change it all)
(We can change it all)
And everybody wants to change the world
(We can change it all)
No one ever wants to change themselves
(We can change it all)
And everybody wants to change the world
(We can change it all)
No one ever wants to change themselves
(We can change it all)
And everybody wants to change the world
(We can change it all)
No one ever wants to change themselves
(We can change it all)
And everybody wants to change the world
(We can change it all)
No one ever wants to change themselves
