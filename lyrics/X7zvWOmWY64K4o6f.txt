This is just the start
You've got a cold heart
Don't you wanna spend
more time 'round here?

I ran out through the garden
Ended up by your home
With broken arms and stolen charms
I knew you weren't alone

Don't you love me, yeah?
Don't you wanna be my sky?
If you trust me, yeah
We won't ever have to fight

We are not departed
From the place in which we started
We just got up on the bridge
So we could see it glow

The things that we have left in
The cities which we've slept in
The coming of the winter on the fields

Don't you love me, yeah?
Don't you wanna be my sky?
If you trust me, yeah
We won't ever have to fight

This is just the start
You've got a cold heart,
Don't you wanna spend
More time 'round here?
