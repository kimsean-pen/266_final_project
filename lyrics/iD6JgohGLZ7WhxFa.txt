We're gonna do it, let's get to it
I hope you enjoy this as much as I do

If I give you my love, don't refuse it
Won't wear it out if we use it
It's something special, so don't abuse it
Once you've got it I promise you won't lose it

Too much of a good thing
You can never get enough of my good love
(Open up and let me in)

Too much of a good thing
(Let my love take control)
When you're with me there'll never me

We're gonna do it, let's get to it

Don't tell me to slow down or take it easy
I want you right now and completely
If I give you my heart maybe you'll see
You will never need a love in place of me

Too much of a good thing
You can never get enough of my good love
(Open up and let me in)

Too much of a good thing
(Let my love take control)
When you're with me there'll never me

Too much of a good thing
You can never get enough of my good love
(Open up and let me in)

Too much of a good thing
(Let my love take control)
When you're with me there'll never me

We're gonna do it, let's get to it
(Make a body)
We're gonna do it, let's get to it
I hope you enjoy this as much as I do

Too much of a good thing
You can never get enough of my good love
(Open up and let me in)

Too much of a good thing
(Let my love take control)
When you're with me there'll never me

Too much of a good thing
Too much of a good thing
(Let my love take control)
When you're with me there'll never me

Too much of a good thing
You can never get enough of my good love
(Open up and let me in)

Too much of a good thing
(Let my love take control)
When you're with me there'll never me
Too much of a good thing
