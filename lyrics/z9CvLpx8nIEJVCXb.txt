New Jersey tongue, not saying too much
I'm feeling your attitude
That East Coasting, baby, is driving me crazy
Just like it's supposed to do
With hands that could save me, face that could break me
Sort of in love with you
But I wouldn't say that to ya
And now I'm trying to find the words
To tell you how I feel and show you that it's real
And now I'm trying to find the words

I don't know what else to say, but you're pretty fucking dope
Just so you know
I've been thinking 'bout the ways that I wanna hold you close
Just so you know
I don't know what else to say, but you're pretty fucking dope
Oh, just so you know
I don't know how else to say it, but you're pretty fucking dope

Do you already know, do you already know
Do you got a girlfriend?
Cause if you don't, then I'm coming after you
Don't wanna be selfish

I don't know what else to say, but you're pretty fucking dope
Just so you know
I've been thinking 'bout the ways that I wanna hold you close
Just so you know
I don't know what else to say, but you're pretty fucking dope
Oh, just so you know
I don't know how else to say it, but you're pretty fucking dope
