Despair will hold a place in my heart
a bigger one that you do do do
and I will always be nicer to the cat
than I am to you you you you
dear God, I hate myself
dear God, I hate myself
and I will never be happy
and I will never feel normal
[don't ask me if this line is about you]
what do they do there tonight tonight?
why do they go there alright alright?
why do they live there [tonight tonight]?
and why do they live at all alright alright?
dear God, I hate myself
dear God, I hate myself
and I will never be happy
and I will never feel normal
why do they live there [tonight tonight]?
and why do they live there at all alright alright?
flip off the mirror as protest
who the F-word are you you you?
and I will never be happy
and I will never feel normal
dear God, I hate myself
dear God, I hate myself
