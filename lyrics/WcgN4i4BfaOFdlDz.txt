Here and then you're gone
Yeah, Houston loves some
Used to run around
With the vampires of the town
But I've seen them fade
And I got to get away

In the years to come when you know that Houston loved me wrong
Pictures say to me
Put his arms around me
My baby don't lie
My baby so true

Arm in arm
With Houston third
Keep it low to the ground now
As you get to know the town
Cutie's mind is on fire
She had a spiritual good time
She's never been a good student
She's cute, cute

My baby don't lie
Don't you know I'm in the mood?
Gonna do it to you, you, you, you, you
Can you make it through December?
And barely look up to you
Keep it cool and calm
Keep it going till it's done
Drove on 4.2
Drove his car through the city

Well, can you do
Every thought you had was untrue
Been dreaming too long
Fell under the snow cloud
Powerful two-chord blues
Coming through from me to you

Maybe this is all
Let's keep it short and sweet
Keeping my brights on
We got miles to go
