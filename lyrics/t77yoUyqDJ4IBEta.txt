When I was just a boy
I would dream of all those moments in my life
I'd hold them tight
All those memories fill my soul
I had nowhere else to go
I chose to fight, keep holding tight

No matter what they say
There'll be another day

The sun will come up
Tomorrow starts again
This is not the end
The sun will come up
I'll have no regrets
This is not the end

Imagine life before
It was full of closing door
There was no light left in my life
But I could see my path
It was deep within my heart
Burning so bright all through the night

No matter what they say
There'll be another day

The sun will come up
Tomorrow starts again
This is not the end
The sun will come up
I'll have no regrets
This is not the end
This is not the end
This is not the end
