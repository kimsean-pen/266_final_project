I dream of the setting suns
And darkness comes as no surprise
I got to get away, got to get away from myself

I'm dancing in this devil's waltz
I'm dirty and I need your help
I got to get away, got to get away from myself
Oh, yeah!

Drop me in the water
Try to make me clean
Got the sinking feeling, boat has a leak
Drop me in the water
Try to make me clean
Got the sinking feeling, boat has a leak
This boat has a leak

I sleep to dream away time
My body doesn't feel like mine
I got to get away, got to get away from myself

I'm dancing in this devil's waltz
I'm dirty and I need your help
Got to get away, got to get away from myself
Oh, yeah!

Drop me in the water
Try to make me clean
Got the sinking feeling, boat has a leak
Drop me in the water
Try to make me clean
Got the sinking feeling, boat has a leak
This boat has a leak

There's a long, long way to go
Long, long way to go...

Drop me in the water
Try to make me clean
Got the sinking feeling, boat has a leak
Drop me in the water
Try to make me clean
Got the sinking feeling, boat has a leak
This boat has a leak
