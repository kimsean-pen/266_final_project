Didn't know you were so

Didn't know we were so

Back when we started out
I was hoping, thinking we could work it out
We were picture perfect
And I never ever missed a moment
Never no doubt
And I tell you tell you tell you
How much I miss you
Thinking that'll solve all your other issues
So I'm lining up the shot and pull the trigger down
Life is kinda lifeless when you're not around
Packing up and leaving to a different town
Distant in the distance naw I mean it
Just return the crown
Every night I'm dreaming and I'm screaming
That we're headed downtown to lil Tokyo
So hit me let me take you now
Maybe a day like that can change it all
I mean like, who else could I call
Capture all these moments then we threw em away
Little prince and princess to the grave

Going going gone
You're moving moving on
It's unfair for you to care only some of the time
I thought you just needed air and then nothing was fine
I know lavender is your favorite smell and color
And how your hair feels whenever you miss a shower
And how our cranes hang in your koreatown tower
And all your deepest thoughts when you're in your darkest hour
If you didn't love me then you leave me alone
And I know it's probably wrong for me to answer the phone
But I'd rather make you smile then leave you lonely at home
Cause it kinda hurts to care but it hurts worse to have you gone
A pictures worth a thousand words
Collage them up to make them hurt
Read you bedtime stories till we're both laying still
And use these memories for the words of my will

Don't want to make you go away
But I can't make you stay
Don't want to make you go away

Don't want to make you go away
But I can't stay hey hey
