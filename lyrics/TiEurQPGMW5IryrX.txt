I survived everything
I have tried everything
Everything everything
And anything

All the walls begin to dissolve away
Do your hands begin to shake, shake, shake, shake, shake?
And just do what you think you used to be
All begins to bend then break, break, break, break

Wave goodbye
Wish me well
I've become
Something else
Something else, something else
It's just the world

But this thing that lives inside of me
The sound that rocks awake, awake, awake, awake, break
And if he depletes what's owed to me
And he comes to grab and take and take and take

I am whole
I believe
I am whole
I am free
I am whole
I can see
Always here
Finally
I am whole
I believe
I am whole
I am free
