When the waters is rough
The sailing is tough
I'll get drowned in your love

You've got a cut throat crew, yeah
I'm gonna sink under you
I got the bell bottom blues
It's gonna be the death of me

It's the graveyard watch
Running right on the rocks
I've taken all of the knocks

Ain't giving me no quarter
I'd rather drink sea water
I wish I'd never had brought you
It's gonna be the death of me

Soul survivor, soul survivor
Soul survivor, soul survivor
You know it, darling
Soul survivor
That's what I'm talking about
That's what I'm talking about
Soul survivor
I'm a soul survivor
Gonna be the death of me
It's gonna be the death of me

Oh yeah, when you're flying your flags
All my confidence sags
You got me packing my bags

I'll stowaway at sea, yeah
You make me mutiny
Where you are I won't be
You're gonna be the death of me, yeah yeah

Soul survivor, soul survivor
Soul survivor, soul survivor
It's gonna be the death of me

Soul survivor
That's what I'm talking about
That's what I'm talking about
That's what I'm talking

Soul survivor, soul survivor
Soul survivor, soul survivor
Soul survivor, soul survivor
