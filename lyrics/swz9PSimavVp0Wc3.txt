You say it's been said I know it's been done
But I can't shake that feeling it won't be undone
I'm lying awake when I know I should run
To get back the power and feel like I've won

I've carried the wind I've battled for time
But no one remembers the mountain I've climbed
I'll give you the truth but the end is the same
I won't live forever so carry the flame
Can you hear what I'm saying
Will you ever listen
Only got one hour to live
That's how you know it's all I will give
You and me
I'll never let you down

I've only got one hour to live
That's how you know it's all I will give
I've only got hour to live
Burning this town for reasons to live
You and me
I'll never let you down
