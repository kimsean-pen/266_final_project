I threw my old note books In the trash,
Dont wonna turn that blue cheque into cash.
So here come that last hit make it last, make it last, make it last.
I'm tryna figure out how you can love
me, when I don't even love myself baby.
But if you wonna find out then we can see, we can see, we can see.

When I first met you I hit that panic button,
i know that upset you I wasn't capable of love,
but really I was not prepared to be presentable, I hated myself.
I knew that I could love you from the day that we were dealt,
just like we picked a perfect day off the shelf.
The only thing that stopped me was that knowledge of self,
talk about overnight oatmeal. Take you out,
in and out, small pockets, big promises, bigger self-doubt.
I coulda sworn that I was to far gone for someone like you,
a swarm warm with big hearts sharp and
sepia tone. Made a promise on my mattress
