So kind is the others
Of the change in the wind
The watchtower man
Turned and whispered me some things
He said we don't sleep
Stuck in the dream

Shot my baby with an arrow

In the wing
Wounded cut bent and scarred

We got together
Lost in love in your broke down car
Through stormy weather
Like the bird on the buffalo
Like the bird on the buffalo
So kind is the others
Of the change in the wind

The lighthouse man
Turned and whispered me some things
We don't sleep
Awake in a dream

Shot my baby with an arrow

In the wing
Us, you, me and them
We got together
We got together and we did our thing
Through stormy weather
Like the bird on the buffalo
Like the bird on the buffalo
Like the bird on the buffalo
Like the bird on the buffalo
Like the bird on the buffalo
Like the bird on the buffalo
Like the bird, oh
Like the bird on the buffalo
