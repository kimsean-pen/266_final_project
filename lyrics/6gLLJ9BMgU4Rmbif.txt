Could I be your light,
when you are afraid?
Could I be the reason,
when you're asking why?
I could be a mistress,
for your lonely nights.
I would give you wings.
I am the gateway.
To another life.
You are on your way.
To a better place.
Descending weight.
Aroused by the warmth.
Like a moth circles the lantern.
You are calling us like a drug.
Everything is covered in white.
You can hear the silence.
Your heart stopped beating.
But you still keep walking.
Feeling lighter than air.
You are one with the sky.
Now you understand.
You are a frozen star.
Lower your armour.
Release the pain.
Cry like a newborn.
You are free again.
There is no violence.
In surrounding darkness.
There are no laws in this chaos of colours.
This weary burden.
Of eternal winter.
Fading away.
Aurora.
