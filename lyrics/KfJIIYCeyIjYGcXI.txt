Putting down my feelings on paper
Secrets that I've never told
With the beating of my heart I surrender
To ralph ralph macchio

Watching you on screen
Made it better
Oh-ooh
My teen dream on video
And any others of my lovers
Won't ever
No-oh
Feel like my romeo

Kiss me once
And keep me forever
Ralph macchio
In his arms
We hold on together
Ralph macchio

Kiss me once
And keep me forever
Ralph macchio
And in my dreams
We lie here together
Ralph macchio, never let me go

Never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go

Where did you go?
Haven't seen you lately
What should I do with my love?
I sometimes think that I see you baby
Dancing with the stars up above

Watching you on screen
Made it better
Oh-ooh
My teen dream on video
And any others of my lovers
Won't ever
No-oh
Feel like my romeo

Kiss me once
And keep me forever
Ralph macchio
In his arms
We hold on together
Ralph macchio

Kiss me once
And keep me forever
Ralph macchio
And in my dreams
We lie here together
Ralph macchio, never let me go

Ralph macchio
Never let me go
Ralph macchio
Never let me go
Ralph macchio
Never let me go
Ralph macchio
Never let me go
