I've been playing a fool
four, three, too many times and
When did lust for you
Become an organised crime

I tried to keep you honest, babe
But I was just a pawn you played the part
So well, it hurts to know you're gone

Did you mean it

Could you feel it
When you broke into my head

Did you fake it just to break another stranger in your bed
Was it worth it

Was it perfect

When you up and left me cynical
Like you planned it
You're a bandid

Just a no good, too big, filthy, rotten criminal
Let me count the ways
I six, seven, ate my words
Right from the silver plate
We checked in, checked out, checkmate I couldn't keep you honest, babe
Cause I was just a card you played
We draw so well
It hurts to know you're gone, you're gone, you're gone
Did you mean it
Could you feel it
When you broke into my head
Did you fake it
Just to break another stranger in your bed
Was it worth it
Was it perfect
When you up and left me cynical
Like you planned it
You're a bandit
Just a no good, too big, filthy, rotten criminal
Did you mean it
Could you feel it
When you broke into my head
Did you fake it
Just to break another stranger in your bed
Was it worth it
Was it perfect
When you up and left me cynical
Like you planned it
You're a bandit
Just a no good, too big, filthy, rotten criminal
Did you mean it
Could you feel it
When you broke into my head
Did you fake it just to break another stranger in your bed
Was it worth it
Was it perfect
When you up and left me cynical
Like you planned it
You're a bandit
Just a no good, too big, filthy, rotten criminal
End.
