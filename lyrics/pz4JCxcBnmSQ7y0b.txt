Dear friends in this academy
Romeo is bleeding to death
To see friends bleed to death
What for? Some kind of metaphor
That I cant see?
So I'll drink until I see it

This sky will make me sick
So I'll give up on you
I'll give up on this
This sky will make me sick
So I'll give up on this
I'll give up on you

Archers in your arches
Raise your fingers for one last salute
And i'll bleed this skyline dry
Your history is mine

So you want to hold me up and bring me down
Yes, you want to hold me up and break me down
I don't care for your sweet scent or
The way you want me more than I want you
I don't care for your sweet scent or
The way you want me more than I want you

Archers in your arches
Raise your fingers for one last salute
And bleed this skyline dry
Your history is mine

Archers in your arches
Raise your fingers for one last salute
And bleed this skyline dry
Your history is mine...

It's all mine...
