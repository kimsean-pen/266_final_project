Underneath this canopy of snow
Where fifty-seven winters
Took their toll
Where did you go?

And I believed in you
I believed in you
Like Elvis Presley singing psalms on a Sunday
Where did you go?

Well she's gone to meet her maker
Back to where she came from
Come to save her soul
Come to save her soul
Come to take her home
'Cause it's late and past your bedtime
Well past bedtime

Angel, my angel
Fly over me, angel
Angel, my angel
Fly over me, angel

She took her life within her hands
She took her life within her own two hands
And no one can tell her
What to do now

And I believed in you
I believed in you
Like Elvis Presley singing live from Las Vegas
Where did you go?

Well she's gone to meet her maker
Back to where she came from
Come to save her soul
Come to save her soul
Come to take her home
'Cause it's late and past your bedtime
Well past bedtime

Angel, my angel
Fly over me, angel
Angel, my angel
Fly over me, angel

Close your eyes
Go to sleep
Forever in my heart
I'll keep you safe, forever
I'll keep you safe

Angel, my angel
Angel, my angel

Angel, my angel
Fly over me, angel
Angel, my angel
Fly over me, angel

Angel, my angel
Fly over me, angel
