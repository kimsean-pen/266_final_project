Time, without a purpose
Sure found ways, to test my patience
Now, I've got a distance
Alone
Time, has got my measure
Twists and drags, for its own pleasure
Now, I listen only
For you
Cause when,
Will my suffering end
Will my, angel eyes see you again
My love
Oh now
Time, won't recognise me
Dusty with all, the hopeful glances
Now, my heart murmurs
Alone
Time, flirts in silence
And tricks each day, into another
Now, my journeys over
For you
Cause when,
Will my suffering end
Will my, angel eyes see you again
My love
Oh now
Time, without a purpose
Sure found ways, to test my patience
Now, I've got a distance
Alone
Cause when,
Will my suffering end
Will my, angel eyes see you again
My love
Cause when,
Will my suffering end
Will my, angel eyes see you again
My love
Oh now
