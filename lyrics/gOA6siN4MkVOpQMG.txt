Down at Pinky's roadhouse
On Highway 69
Shake your money down in my cup
I'll sing the blues all night
Oh you know, that's how I jingle and go

My Cadillac is cherry
My boots are crocodile
Shake some money down in my cup
My pinky ring will slide
Oh you know, that's how I jingle and go

I got the struggle
I got the hustle
Got your lowdown blues and country shuffle
You hear me talkin'
I ain't no fool
I'll teach ya things you just can't learn in school

Dollar for some whiskey
Dollar for some gin
Shake your dollar down in my cup
I'll sing it all again
Oh you know, that's how I jingle and go

I got the struggle
I got the hustle
I got the lowdown blues and funky shuffle
I play for money
That ain't no sin
I'm keepin what I'm sellin so ya'll come back again

Down at Pinky's roadhouse
On Highway 69
Shake your money down in my cup
I'll sing the blues all night
Oh you know, that's how I jingle and go
Oh you know, that's how I jingle and go

Got the struggle
I got the hustle
Shake your money down in my cup
I'll play you on the double
Oh you know, that's how I jingle and go

I got the hustle
I got the struggle
I got the lowdown blues and funky shuffle
Oh you know, that's how I jingle and go
Oh you know, that's how I jingle and go
Oh you know, that's how I jingle and go
