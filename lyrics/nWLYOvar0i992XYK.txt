Sometimes I dream about reality
Sometimes I feel so gone
Sometimes I dream about a wild wild world
Sometimes I feel so lonesome

Hey Bobby Marley
Sing something good to me
This world go crazy
It's an emergency

Tonight I dream about fraternity
TONIGHT I say: one day!
One day my dreams will be reality
Like Bobby said to me

Hey Bobby Marley
Sing something good to me
This world go crazy
It's an emergency

Hey Bobby Marley
Sing something good to me
This world go crazy
It's an emergency...

Tonight I watch through my window
And I can't see no lights
Tonight I watch through my window
And I can't see no rights
