She could be your cay
Come to the fore
Ship Ahoy!
You cling and fail
You watch her go
To love, to be old
Just be the one
To love, to be old
Just be the one
Come and love
She could be your cay
Come to the fore
Ship Ahoy!
You cling and fail
You watch her go
To love, to be old
Just be the one
To love, to be old
Just be the one
Come and love
