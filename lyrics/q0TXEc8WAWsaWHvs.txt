Searchlights on the skyline
Just looking for a friend
Who's gonna love my baby
When she's gone around the bend
Egyptian bells are ringing
When it's her birthday
Sweet nothin', I'm talking about you
There's a hurricane blowing your way

Oooooh such a beautiful way
To break your heart
Oooooh such a beautiful way
To break my heart
There's someone calling your name
It's driving you insane

You were wearing that stained raincoat
And your umbrella was a tangled mess
You were washed up on the glittering shores
Looking for another crime to confess
You bribed yourself
Out of a place in the sun
But you had some change to spare
So you said you wanna spend it on me
And shook the blues out of your hair

Oooooh such a beautiful way
To break your heart
Oooooh such a beautiful way
To break my heart
There's someone calling your name
You're gonna miss that train
. . . . . . . . . . . . .
Oooooh such a beautiful way
To break your heart
Oooooh such a beautiful way
To break my heart
There's someone calling your name
It's driving you insane
