Ooo, oooh, oooh
I'm not talking to you
I won't give you anything
I gave my everything already, did you see?
I don't owe it to you
Cause I'm just the same again
But with better manners and the right to be
Alone, alone

I just wanna be alone
If you're gonna ask me for my time
at least say please
Cause I'm not how I used to be
And these things get to me (oh)

If you wanna break me I'm already on my knees
I didn't give my love for you
To walk all over me
To walk all over me
I'm just trying to be
A little honest here
Cause the other half of the time
I just smile

It's not like me to be the one
I'll bite my tongue for a while
And I'll smile cause I've got better manners and the right to be
Alone, alone
I just wanna be alone

If you're gonna ask me for my time
at least say please
Cause I'm not how I used to be
And these things get to me (oh)
If you wanna break me I'm already on my knees
I didn't give my love for you
To walk all over me
To walk all over me
If you wanna ask me for my time
At least say please
No no
And if you wanna break me
I'm already on my knees
I'm on my knees
