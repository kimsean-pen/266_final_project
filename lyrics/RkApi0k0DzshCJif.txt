Shopping for labels, shopping for love
Manolo and Louis, its all Im thinking of
Shopping for labels, shopping for love
Manolo and Louis, its all Im thinking of

I already know what my addiction is
I be looking for labels, I aint looking for love
I shop for purses while I walks out the door
Dont cry, buy a bag and get over it

And Im not concerned with all the politics
Its a lot of men, I know I could find another
All I know is that Im always happy
When I walk out the store, store

I guess I'm supercalifragisexy
Nothing to be playing with
I love him, hate him, kiss him, diss him
Tryna to walk a mile in my kicks

Loves like a runway but which one do I love more?
No emotional baggage just big bags filled with Dior
Loves like a runway so whats all the fussing for?
Lets stop chasing those boys and shop some more

I know I might come off as negative
I be looking for labels, I aint looking for love
But relationships are often so hard to tame
And Prada dresses never broken my heart before

And ballins something that Im fed up with
Ima do the damn thing, watch me do the damn thing
'Cause I know that my credit card
Will help me put out the flames, flames

I guess I'm supercalifragisexy
Nothing to be playing with
I love him, hate him, kiss him, diss him
Tryna to walk a mile in my kicks

Loves like a runway but which one do I love more?
No emotional baggage just big bags filled with Dior
Loves like a runway so whats all the fussing for?
Lets stop chasing those boys and shop some more

Gucci, Fendi, Prada purses, purchasing them finer things
Men they come a dime a dozen, just give me them diamond rings
Im into a lotta bling, Cadallic, Chanel and Coach
Fellas boast but they cant really handle my female approach

Buying things is hard to say, rocking Christian Audigier
Manolo or Polo, taking photos in my Cartier
So we cant go all the way, I know you might hate it but
Ima shop for labels while them ladies lay and wait for love
Loves like a runway but which one do I love more?
No emotional baggage just big bags filled with Dior
Loves like a runway so whats all the fussing for?
Lets stop chasing those boys and shop some more
Shopping for labels, shopping for love
Manolo and Louis, its all Im thinking of
Shopping for labels, shopping for love
Manolo and Louis, its all Im thinking of
