These rooms got a lot of space
Crowded but a lonely place
Sittin' at a table full of double dates
And everywhere I go I wanna see your face

Pictures, I'm reminded of good times
How we tried it
Don't know how to get you out of my head
I don't have it in me to deny it

'Cause everybody, everybody knows something I don't
And I wonder, and I wonder how to keep a good thing going

All my friends are falling in love
All my friends are locking it up
But I can't seem to settle down
'Cause I'm waiting on you to come around
While all my friends are falling in love

They say that love is true
And I'll find somebody new
Everybody lookin' like a honeymoon
But all that I've been looking for is me and you

'Cause everybody, everybody knows something I don't
And I wonder, and I wonder how to keep a good thing going

All my friends are falling in love
All my friends are locking it up
But I can't seem to settle down
'Cause I'm waiting on you to come around
While all my friends are falling in love

Falling in love
Falling in love

'Cause everybody, everybody knows something I don't
And I wonder, and I wonder how to keep a good thing going

All my friends are falling in love
All my friends are locking it up
I can't seem to settle down
'Cause I'm waiting on you to come around
But all my friends are falling in love

Falling in love (I'm falling, I'm falling)
Falling in love (I'm falling, I'm falling)
Falling in love (But I can't seem to settle down)
'Cause I'm waiting on you to come around
While all my friends are falling in love
