Go outside go outside don't turn around girl
Take me down to the rainbow grrrr
And I want to go inside
The molecule girl of a rainbow girl

Go outside go outside don't turn around girl
Take me down to the rainbow grrrr
And I want to go inside
The molecule girl of a rainbow girl

Go inside a rainbow so rare
Sowing the bloom, inner plume, outer plume so
I take you on a ride
Then I wanna go inside
Then I wanna to go inside
Then I modify

Go inside a rainbow so rare

And I don't even know if it would be worth it in the long run
And I don't even know if it would be worth it in the long run
And I don't even know if it would be worth it in the long run
And I don't even know if it would be worth it in the long run

And I don't even know if it would be worth it in the long run
The elastic snags and wooden friendships die

And I don't even know if it would be worth it in the long run
The elastic snags and wooden friendships die

But we can voodoo into shapes for all my gaping mind to see
But you can voodoo into shapes for all my gaping mind to see
Grnnnnnnn etc etc
