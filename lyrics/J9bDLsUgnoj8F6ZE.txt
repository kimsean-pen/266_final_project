Bright young sun, it looks like the morning's come,
And its all come so easy like the heavens are wishing me well.
And those dawning eyes brought forth my own sunrise,
Well it's been a long time since the beat of my heart was a friend,
It's been a long time since I felt I was breathing again.

In you I found my home from home,
Left all that I knew for a love that I know.

So fresh air, open ways, mild nights, wild days, wondering in wonder, pondering what wandering we'll do.
I guess I don't care about what? When? Or where? Because I'm starting to realise the question worth asking is, who?
I'm starting to realise the question worth answering is you.

In you I found my home from home,
Left all that I knew for a love that I know

And that grip you prized me from I was already trying to lose.
It was holding me, to hold me back from you!

I guess its funny, this two-fold irony; I guess its funny, this two-fold irony,
My greatest victory was my own defeat, greatest victory in my own defeat.
