Hot Kiss, won't you tell me what you miss, boy?
My Love, you got me spinning like a wound-up toy
Hot Kiss, won't you tell me what you miss, boy?
My Love, you got me spinning like a wound-up toy

Oh, father! I pray to thee!
I gotta man so blind I can't see
I'm his favourite toy
Like a beach ball
Play me up and down
and throw me 'gainst the wall

"Oh, Tallulah", he said
"You're so dramatic
"What's all that shakin' goin' on in your attic?"

Hot Kiss, won't you tell me what you miss, boy?
Hey Love, you got me spinning like a wound-up toy
Hot Kiss, won't you tell me what you miss, boy?
Hey Love, you got me spinning like a wound-up toy

You can't knock it, or rock it, or be-bop it
It's a itch you can't scratch
Nothing's gonna stop it
I'm a cheater, so reminisce
Waitin' on my man and his one hot kiss
I'm on the prowl, sent my thunder
Hour after hour, break this spell I'm under

Hot Kiss, won't you tell me what you miss, boy?
Hey Love, you got me spinning like a wound-up toy
Hot Kiss, won't you tell me what you miss, boy?
Hey Love, you got me spinning like a wound-up toy

All my life
I've searched for you
All my life...
All my life
I was searching for you

Spinnin' round the room
I can't sleep
Oh, you're little girl wants to fffffff...!

Hot Kiss, won't you tell me what you miss, boy?
Hey Love, you got me spinning like a wound-up toy
Hot Kiss, won't you tell me what you miss, boy?
Hey Love, you got me spinning like a wound-up toy

Hot hot hot love...
