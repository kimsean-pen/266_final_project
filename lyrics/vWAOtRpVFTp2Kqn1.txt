Caress cement 'til it's dry
Come clean your hands in the backseat before you're onto the next fiend

Don't ever touch my blade, you fool
You'll be cursed for a lifetime
Don't ever touch my blade, you fool
You'll be cursed for a lifetime
Don't ever touch my kid, you sick thing

Range utensil flaking in the wind
Wanna stand in place like a foil deer?
Isn't that the reason you came here?

Don't ever touch my ring, you fool
You'll be cursed for a lifetime
Don't ever touch my ring, you fool
You'll be cursed for a lifetime
Don't ever touch my kid, you sick thing

You know by now
With all these drops of blood it is love
Moonballing bureaucrats
With all this love, it is death
Get in the van and take my hand
We're onto the next life
Smothered and fond, not redolent
Scarred and it's timesome

Don't ever touch my kid
You fool, you fool
You fool, you fool
You'll be cursed
You'll be cursed
