Delirium
Delirium
Delirium
Delirium
I can't surrender
I cannot breath and I'm still going under
it's hard to realise
it's getting closer
I fear this struggle
is wasting me from inside
Delirium
Delirium
Delirium
Delirium
insane obsession
is growing faster
there's no medication
It's hard to realise
lost in confusion
I hear the silence
is screaming aloud inside
Delirium
Delirium
Delirium
Delirium
Enclosed in a shrine
locked away inside my mind
I walk in the darkness and neon lights
delirium will take me away
Delirium
Delirium
Delirium
Delirium
Delirium
Delirium
Delirium
Delirium
