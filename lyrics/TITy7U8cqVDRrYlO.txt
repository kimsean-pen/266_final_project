The bright light of day
You'll no longer see
In a blind dimension
Henceforward you'll be

A burying in darkness, you will have to bear
Deep, you're drowned, in this optical nightmare
In vortex, your visions collapse instantly
Now your life is condemned to obscurity

Condemned to obscurity

Of your eyes you are deprived
Now touch what you would've seen
Like if you still had those eyes [x2]

Lost in this void of light
There is nothing to see, everything to feel
With no more sense of sight
There is nothing to see, everything to fear

In the gloomy vault of nothingness
My imagination will agonize
Suffering of a psychic blindness
Nothing is all I recognize

In a blind dimension, henceforward you'll be
Buried in darkness and obscurity
Where visions in vortex collapse endlessly
For life, you are condemned to obscurity

Lost in this void of light
There is nothing to see, everything to feel
With no more sense of sight
There is nothing to see, everything to fear
