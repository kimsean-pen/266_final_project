Honestly, its time for honesty
My heart is on my sleeve
So will you hear me out?
I've got nothing left to give of me
I gave up everything
So there is nothing left to lose for me now
Could you forgive me somehow?

I've chased a million things
Bright lights and empty dreams
Now here I am
Right where I thought I wanted to be
I'd trade it all right now
Leave it all and lay it down
To get back to where I belong
Lord, all I've ever needed was your love

Truth be told, I've made this world my home
I let it steal my soul
But now I want it back
Cause all I need is waiting
In your arms, a place
To hang my heart, where I am known at last
You're the one true thing I have

I've chased a million things
Bright lights and empty dreams
Now here I am
Right where I thought I wanted to be
I'd trade it all right now
Leave it all and lay it down
To get back to where I belong
Lord, all I've ever needed was your love

And I know that I was meant to be
More than just a melody
I know that you had hopes for me
I hope you still believe in me

I've chased a million things
Bright lights and empty dreams
Now here I am
Right where I thought I wanted to be
I'd trade it all right now
Leave it all and lay it down
To get back to where I belong
Lord, all I've ever needed was your love
Lord, all I've ever needed was your love
