My diet pill is wearing off
My diet pill is wearing off

'Cause we're just in the bed
Sewn to the sheets with thread
The twins are in the car
The frying pan is red.

Calgon can't take me away
No, Calgon can't take me away
From the things I did today

'Cause we're just in the bed
Sewn to the sheets with thread
The twins are in the car
The frying pan is red.

And Im outta here
Im so outta here
Im outta here

I think the swelling is going down.
I said, I think that the swelling is going down.
Two hundred dollars to leave this town.

'Cause we're just in the bed
Sewn to the sheets with thread.
The twins are in the car
the frying pan is red.

And im outta here
Im so outta here
Im outta here.
