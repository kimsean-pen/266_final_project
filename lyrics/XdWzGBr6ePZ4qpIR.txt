If the sun refused to shine, I would still be loving you
If mountains crumble to the sea, there would still be you and me

Kind woman, I give you my all
Kind woman, nothing more

Little drops of rain, whispers of the pain
Of tears of loves lost in the days gone by
Our love is strong, with you there is no wrong
Together we shall go until we die

Inspiration is what you are to me
Inspiration, look and see

And so today, my world it smiles, your hand in mine, we walk the miles

And thanks to you it will be done, cause you to me are the only one
Happiness, no more be sad

Happiness, I am glad
Little drops of rain, whispers of the pain
Of tears of loves lost in the days gone by
Our love is strong, with you there is no wrong
Together we shall go until we die
Inspiration is what you are to me
Inspiration, look and see
If the sun refused to shine, I would still be loving you
If mountains crumble to the sea, there would still be you and me
