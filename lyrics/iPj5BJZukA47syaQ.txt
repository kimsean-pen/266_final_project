You've been giving me away to other men, to other men
Most things are born golden until they start to notice

I was on your side
I was on your side

I gathered twigs between your eyelids, until they fell between your eyelashes
Wove my hair into the bare places,
and nested down for the evening

I preened my feathers in the old mill that you shared for me
I wear this dress of indifference and find it quite becoming

You say you need me now
Oh, shut your dirty mouth
When I was only a child
I sold my name for a small prize

You've been giving me away
You've been giving me away
You always made it easy
Reminding me not to bloom
Reminding me not to bloom
Reminding me not to bloom
