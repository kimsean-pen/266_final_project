The giants holding world crumbled
and the blow beyond the stars
Froze the entire face of the Earth
The gateway opened and seismic waves
flushed the living
into the rivers of the Underworld

Floating in your own feces ha!
Is this the creature that was an image of their God?

These are the scorched steps of mankind - ruins!
This is travesty of life - ruins!

They are too weak to be godlike!
They are too weak to even fight back when given a chance to do so!

Behold the human agony in all its glory
Is this not what you have been waiting for
Is this not what you have been trying to foreseen
For as long as you have lived

These are the scorched steps of mankind - ruins!
This is travesty of life - ruins!

Are you willing to eat
the flesh of your fellow man
If not...
Then into to pit
You must crawl
And die!

It is time to arise
It is to conquer these ruins

Into the pit...
You must crawl...
Flesh will rotten...
Bones will turn to dust...

The giants holding this world crumbled
and the blow beyond the stars
Froze the entire face of the Earth
These are the scorched steps of mankind - ruins!
This is travesty of life - ruins!
