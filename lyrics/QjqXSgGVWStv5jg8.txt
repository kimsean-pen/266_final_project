Daylight lucidity
Streams through me
Let me dream
Out of this world, out of this world

I cannot sleep
Sedate me
Wide awake
Animate this soul
I'm still following the pain

Daylight lucidity
Beam on me
Come to me
Into my sleep, into my sleep

I cannot sleep
Sedate me
Wide awake
Animate this soul
I'm still following the pain

Don't try to wake what is unreal
The secrest only you must seal
You hold the key of what I need
Unlock the door that will reveal

I cannot sleep
Sedate me
Wide awake
Animate this soul
I'm still following the pain
