Can we believe all that we read all that we tell you?
What you perceive to be the truth and what is real,
Leaving you scraping at the bottom of the barrel,
Nothing is broken or forgotten that's the deal,

And all your monsters in the night they come to life,
So you embrace them in the hope that you'll survive,
Intoxicated by the fear and the flames,
There's paranoia in your veins.

We're all lying to the mirror,
Lying to ourselves,
Hiding in the glitter,
Lying to the mirror.

It is the beauty of our flaws that will define us,
So don't hold on to all the things you never had,
Just remember we're the good the bad the lovely,
It is the sanity of life that makes us mad.

So when the pain of your mistakes keeps you awake,
And all your skeletons rattle in the chains,
Intoxicated by the fear and the flames,
There's paranoia in your veins.

We're all lying to the mirror,
Lying to ourselves,
Hiding in the glitter,
Lying to the mirror.

Who you are is what you are and what you are is beautiful.
Who you are is what you are and what you are is beautiful.

We're all lying to the mirror,
Lying to ourselves,
Hiding in the glitter,
Lying to

We're all lying to the mirror,
Lying to ourselves,
Hiding in the glitter,
Lying to the mirror.
