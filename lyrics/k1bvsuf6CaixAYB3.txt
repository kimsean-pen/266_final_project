As we walk into the night
you kissed me and it felt right
all the lights followed closely behind
it's you and i who will hold out till the morning light

maybe it's your kiss, and your touch
that makes me want you more than love
all the lights followed closely behind
it's you and i who will hold out till the morning light

after the moment, with you

as we ran from the night
you held me when it felt right
all the lights went straight to your eyes
it's you and i who will hold out till the morning light

maybe it's your kiss, and your touch
that makes me want you more than love
all the lights followed closely behind
it's you and i who will hold out till the morning light
after the moment, with you
