You will not find us among
those who dream of escaping
Across the aether we've come
All is ours for the taking

You don't age when you live out of time
A thousand years in the blink of an eye

Secrets of the blackest void
known only to the ancients
Freedom from the planetoids
and the gravity that chains us

To make a fold in space and slip
between the curves
Sacrifice of the sisterhood to do for those
they serve
To cross a universe in hyper-spatial flight
We ride the warp of space into the
womb of night

Ourano's daughter, Hermes' bride
Mistress of the Mysteries
Upon the Warp she rides
Navigatrix of the star-seas

She makes a fold in space, we slip
between the curves
Sacrifice of the sisterhood to do for those
they serve

To cross the Universe in hyper-spatial flight
We ride the warp of space into the
womb of night
You don't age when you live out of time
A thousand years in the blink of an eye
