Is this a dream?
It's not in essence
What it used to be
Stole the words
Of yesterday
Turned away
Yet felt the same
In every face a thing to want
When everything is what you can't
Love
The seed that's sown grows
And it rose in the garden
The seed that's sown grows
A red rose in the garden goes
We feel it new soul
Of a hollow garden
Where nothing could grow
Was only stone and coal
Is this a life?
Tiny leaves
Cut on the family knife
Stormy words
That turn the clock
Ticks away
Then fakes a stop
Like every faith is a mirror above
We vanitized the message of love
