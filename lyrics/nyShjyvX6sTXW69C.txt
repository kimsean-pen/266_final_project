What do we want
A part of the action
It goes with the need
To be a part of the attraction
To be fed all the time
To avoid sleepless eyes
To be a rebel to be a slave
To have a right to remain

Gods go first
To the absolute
Into nothingness

This time
All the levels are undone
For the greater and the lesser alike
Within a single reality
That is all that is

Gods go first
To the absolute
And into nothingness

All that is
That is all

How to deal with the night
How to deal with the midnight sun
To be the truth and to be denied
A treasure within sight

Gods go first
To the absolute
And into nothingness
