Gazing through the window
At the world outside
Wondering will mother
Earth survive
Hoping that mankind will
Stop abusing her, sometime

After all there's only
Just the two of us
And here we are still
Fighting for our lives
Watching all of history
Repeat itself
Time after time

I'm just a dreamer
I dream my life away
I'm just a dreamer
Who dreams of better days

I watch the sun go down
Like everyone of us
I'm hoping that the dawn
Will bring a sign
A better place for those
Who will come after us, this time

I'm just a dreamer
I dream my life away, oh yeah
I'm just a dreamer
Who dreams of better days

Your higher power may be
God or Jesus Christ
It doesn't really
Matter much to me
Without each others help
There ain't no hope for us
I'm living in a dream
A fantasy, oh yeah yeah yeah

If only we could all
Just find serenity
It would be nice if
We could live as one
When will all this anger
Hate and bigotry, be gone?

I'm just a dreamer
I dream my life away
Today
I'm just a dreamer
Who dreams of better days
Oh yeah
I'm just a dreamer
Who's searching for
The way, today
I'm just a dreamer
Dreaming my life away
Oh yeah yeah yeah
