This hits too close to home for me
And I don't need to be reminded of this pain
I dwelled so long on the possible changes
Well every step forward was a fall towards your demise

(The secret lives of wives)
And you beg me
Please don't go tonight
And I beg you
Please just come back down

To earth to build this trust
In which we have learned
To recreate

(The secret lives of wives)
And you beg me
Please don't go tonight
And I beg you
Please just come back down

Your pride won't let you ride
(And I thought your candid smile was worn down)
And you said
(I thought your candid smile was worn down)
When will you give it up?
(Lying to suite the mood)
I won't fail
(I thought your candid...)
I'm not leaving
(Worn down)
You and me
(Lying to suit the mood)
And this will fall
(I thought your candid smile)
How will we get it back up?

(Shop for ties, shop for ties, shop for ties)
(Shop for ties to hang myself with)

And you say this ended in arrogance
Caused by my vanity
Oh, where will you be?

Well, maybe you just looked too hard
Or maybe I don't look enough
Who will decide our fate?

(Stricken close to the heat and I'm)
How will you align this with love?
(Biting a line)
(Stricken close to the heat and I'm)
How will you end this with glory?
(Biting a line)
(Burn in the wheat fields)
And oh, don't let this go
(Burn in the wheat fields)
And oh, don't let this go
(Burn in the wheat fields)
Oh and don't let this go
(Burn in the wheat fields)
Just let this down

(Shop for ties, shop for ties, shop for)
(Shop for ties to hang my, to hang myself, myself with)
(Myself with)
