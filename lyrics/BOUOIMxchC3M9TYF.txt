I couldn't close my eyes
I never had much choice
I took out my pistol
And ran from everyone
The air that's in my lungs
Just like a noose that's strung
Cuts off my blood and brain
Until I'm like everyone
But I wouldn't hurt you
I'm a stranger tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
I never had much luck
I never had a plan
I'll come right up behind you
Like death does to everyone
Your neck is warm to touch
If I squeeze a little too much
Cuts off your blood and brain
Until you're like everyone
I wouldn't hurt you
I'm a stranger tonight
Now we shan't overcome
Fucked over everyone
"As long as I'm alright Jack"
You don't care about anyone
Our brains are empty shells
But there's no room in hell
We'll wrought the earth with blood and pain
To fall on everyone
But I wouldn't hurt you
I'm a stranger tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
