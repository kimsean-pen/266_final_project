In your dreams
The pain is so real
Before the dead
You'll have to kneel
Hear your future screams
See your epitaph
As you scream
The dead they laugh

Pain, Growing stronger
Life, Exists no longer
Welcome, To a world of pain
Death and despair

Denial of life (Vile denial)
Denial of life
Denial of life

Created by your mind
To overtake your life
Sacrificial suicide
End it with a knife
Much too late
To change your mind
A bloody corpse
Is left behind

Pain, Growing stronger
Life, Exists no longer
Welcome, To a world of pain
Death and despair

Denial of life (Vile denial)
Denial of life
Denial of life
