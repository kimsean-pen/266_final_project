Remit
Remit the signal

The flood is coming down
I can't hold it back
I can't see her
I can't even breathe

Even breathe
Breathe

The individual
Will drifts into space
And the signal
Fills it's void

Void
Black hole

The eyes of greater size
Than all the oceans
Do you ever get that feeling that you're sinking?
I do
