Every time that I get around ya
Something takes a hold of my soul
Staring me up until I can't get enough
When you move it makes my sweat turn cold

'Cause you're a freak for the rhythm, slave to the dance
And now I've got you in the palm of my hand
Get all dramatic, erratic, your moves are automatic
You're a freak for the rhythm, slave to the dance
That's my jam

That's my jam
That's my jam
That's my jam
That's my jam

Every time that I get around ya
Something takes a hold of my mind
Three seconds time, I'm 'bout to redline, singing
Ooh, yeah you shake it so fine

'Cause when you move it slow, my bones start shaking
You move it slow, I can't stop

'Cause you're a freak for the rhythm, slave to the dance
And now I've got you in the palm of my hand
Get all dramatic, erratic, your moves are automatic
You're a freak for the rhythm, slave to the dance
That's my jam
You're a freak for the rhythm, slave to the dance
That's my jam
I've got you in the palm of my hand
That's my jam
'Cause you're a freak for the rhythm, slave to the dance
That's my jam
But you're a freak for the rhythm, slave to the dance
That's my jam

You know I love the way the girl, them shake it up
Cyaan with men, only gyal, then make it up
I love strong, I make way long, long, long up
Drop the rythm and the gyal, then give it up
Confidence from dusk till dawn
Lock the door and turn the lights on
Exodus from the beat of me bone
Now I'm crawling out by morning
Pour your sugar all over me
Wine that body, take you home with me
Feels so good you've got to raise your hands
You're a freak for the rhythm, slave to the dance

Every time that I get around ya
Something takes a hold of my soul
Staring me up until I can't get enough
When you move it makes my sweat turn cold

'Cause you're a freak for the rhythm, slave to the dance
And now I've got you in the palm of my hand
Get all dramatic, erratic, your moves are automatic
You're a freak for the rhythm, slave to the dance
That's my jam

That's my jam
That's my jam
That's my jam
That's my jam
