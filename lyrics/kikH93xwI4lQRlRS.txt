Better than words
But more than a feeling
Crazy in love
Dancing on the ceiling

Everytime we touch
I'm all shake up
You make me wanna
How deep is your love?
God only knows, baby

Ooh, I don't know how else to sum it up
'Cause words ain't good enough
There's no way I can explain your love, no
Ooh, I don't know how else to sum it up
'Cause words ain't good enough
I can't explain your love, no
It's better than words
Better than words

Better than words

You drive me crazy

Someone like you

Always be my baby
Best I ever had
Hips don't lie
You make me wanna uff

One more night
Irreplaceable, yeah
Crazy, we're crazy
Ooh, I don't know how else to sum it up
'Cause words ain't good enough

There's no way I can explain your love, no
Ooh, I don't know how else to sum it up
'Cause words ain't good enough
I can't explain your love, no
Everyone tries
To see what it feels like
But they'll never be right
'Cause it's better, it's bettet, it's better

One more time
Better than words
Yeah
Ooh, I don't know how else to sum it up (i don't know)
'Cause words ain't good enough
There's no way I can explain your love, no
Ooh, I don't know how else to sum it up (to sum it up)
'Cause words ain't good enough (the words ain't good enough)
I can't explain your love, no
It's better than words
It's better than words
