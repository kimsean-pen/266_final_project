You've never proved me anything but right
You hold no surprises, consistency defined
An underwhelming sense of predictability
A dull sideways slide into mediocrity
Another day spent buried in the shadow of your doubt
Always the same but still you refuse to figure out

You will destroy you
Distorted, tore yourself in two
Your will absorbs you
You can't ignore you anymore

An entitled declaration of distress
Strife, misery, and the pursuit of unhappiness
Endless complaining, no accountability
The reek of privilege and weightless tragedy
Another day spent buried in the shadow of your doubt
Always the same but still you refuse to figure out

You will destroy you
Distorted, tore yourself in two
Your will absorbs you
You can't ignore you anymore

Cry wolf on your silken pillow
Clipped wings beneath a crooked halo
A perfect child who never looks at the mirror
Right in your face but not any clearer
A problem hidden in plain view
It's staring right back at you

All the world's a stage
But you are the only player
A black hole at the center of the universe
A dark cloud of despair

Caught in an endless rut
A crisis without solution
Someone should stitch your mouth shut
And solve your fucking problem
Strife, another day
And misery
Always the same
Strife, another day
And misery
Always the same

You will destroy you
Distorted, tore yourself in two
Your will absorbs you
You can't ignore you anymore
