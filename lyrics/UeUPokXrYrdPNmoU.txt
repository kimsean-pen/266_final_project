I've got nothing to show in these hands of mine, oh
But I've no reasons left to stay behind
Oh, please don't let me leave this life

And let the light come in
Oh, let the light come in

I can't look beyond to the end
So I'll turn to look behind
These strings I can't untie

How come you have no reasons
Left to stay with me
But please, don't leave me here with nothing

And let the light come in
Oh, let the light come in

There's no reason why to look at me so sadly
When I cry for you
These noises are so maddening
The light burns the hallways
Screaming out for you
