People say that I'm a rockstar
They think I stay up all night
All night, all night
Well, just because I'm such a rockstar
Doesn't mean I always get high
Get high, get high
(Horns)

Well, I look good
You look good
Got money in the bank
(damn, that's a lot of money)
Said, I look good
You look good
Don't give a fuck what you think

Sometimes I gotta wear my shades
'Cause there's sunshine dripping down my face
Don't let these people lie to ya
Don't let 'em see ya smile too much
They only tryna take it away
Sometimes you gotta hide from 'em
Don't let 'em see what's under the shades

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't let 'em see what's under the shades
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't let 'em see what's under the shades
(Yeah, yeah, don't talk to me)

Well, people say I take it too far
But I don't see nothing wrong
Damn right, damn right
I'm a, I'm a rockstar
Yeah, I can do what I want
Get high, get high
(Horns)

Well, I look good
You look good
Got money in the bank
(damn, that's a lot of money)
Said, I look good
You look good
Don't give a fuck what you think

Sometimes I gotta wear my shades
'Cause there's sunshine dripping down my face
Don't let these people lie to ya

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't let 'em see what's under the shades
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't let 'em see what's under the shades

You know, things always look a little different
I gotta wear my shades
When you got some tint on your lenses
'Cause there's sunshine
Can't let 'em see what's under the shades
Dripping down my face
You feel me?

Sometimes I gotta wear my shades
(You know what I mean?)
'Cause there's sunshine dripping down my face
Don't let these people lie to ya
Don't let 'em see ya smile too much
They only tryna take it away
Sometimes you gotta hide from 'em
Don't let 'em see what's under the shades

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
