Leavin' in the mornin'
Baby, you know I got to go
Leavin' in the mornin'
Baby, you know I got to go

I've got the blues
And I can't stay here no more

I ain't seen my baby
And the evening sun is goin' down
I ain't seen my baby
And the evening sun is goin' down

I've got the blues
And I can't stay here no time

The moon is risin'
And the sun is done goin' down
The moon is risin'
And the sun is done goin' down

I've got the blues
And I can't stay around

I ain't seen my baby
And the evening sun is goin' down
I ain't seen my baby
And the evening sun is goin' down

I've got the blues
And my baby can't be found
