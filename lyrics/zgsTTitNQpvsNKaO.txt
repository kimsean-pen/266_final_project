What's the use of reaching for your heart, when we sail miles apart.
I gave you tomorrow's useless broken try, to make our world alive.
I'm free from lover's breathless scream, following me.
Perhaps you could just take one small chance, and see maybe you need me.

I'm the man that stands behind you,
real calm while you prove yourself
Understand that there is someone
waiting, till the curtains close.

Me, I'm a watercolour washing off
into the deepest sea.
Though my soul may set in darkness,
it will rise in light.

I'm the man that stands behind you,
real calm while you prove yourself
Out beyond your claim to freedom, a field wide
I can meet you there.

I shut my eyes and all the world drops,
I lift them and you are born again
Out beyond your claim to freedom, a field wide
I can meet you there.

I'm the man that stands behind you,
real calm while you prove yourself
I will come back here at sunrise,
a lover who waits all night.
