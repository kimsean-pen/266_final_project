Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah Aooh!
Come inside and be afraid
Of this impressive mess I've made
If you take a look now you will find
I have throne away my vice

Done away with paradise
See what's going on inside my mind
Please let me out

Please let me out
Please let me
Branded like an animal
I can still feel them burning in my mind

I do believe that you made your message clear
(I think I am loosing my mind, I think I am loosing my mind)
Deprivating, isolating all that I feel
Leaving me with images I know are not real are those

Words of condemnation that I hear
(I think I am loosing my mind I think I am loosing my)
Come inside now I implore
Do you think you can restore
The crucial pieces missing from my brain
What seems to be the matter dear

Why do you cry and shake with fear
I've only have the best dub me insane
Please let me out

Please let me out
Please let me
Branded like an animal
I can still feel them burning in my mind

I do believe that you made your message clear
(I think I am loosing my mind, I think I am loosing my mind)
Deprivating, isolating that I feel
Leaving me with images I know are not real

Are those words of condemnation that I hear
(I think I am loosing my mind, I think I am loosing my mind)
Don't know how much I can take
The secret thoughts inside me wake

I've lost what was within me
Oh sweet insanity
Don't know how much I can take
The secret thoughts inside me wake

I've lost what was within me
Oh sweet insanity
Now I try again to find
The thing that was my mind

Behold the other side
Cause there I've lost my mind
I try again to find
The thing that was my mind

Behold the other side
Cause there I've lost my mind
I'm lost my mind
I'm lost my mind
I'm lost my mind
I'm lost my mind
I'm lost my mind
I'm lost my mind
I'm lost my mind
I'm lost my mind
I'm lost... mind
I'm lost my mind
I'm lost my mind
I'm lost my mind
I'm lost my mind
I'm lost my mind
I'm lost my mind
I'm lost my mind
I'm lost my mind
