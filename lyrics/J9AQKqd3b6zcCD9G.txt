I done tried it all
Tried it all
Hey
Done tried it all
I can't stop this internal bleeding
And my heart is leaking, heart is leaking out

I done tried it all
Tried it all
Hey
Done tried it all
I can't stop this internal bleeding
And my heart is leaking, heart is leaking out

I done tried it all
Tried it all
Hey
Done tried it all
I can't stop this internal bleeding
And my heart is leaking, heart is leaking out

Tried it all
Tried it all
Hey
Done tried it all
I can't stop this internal bleeding
My heart is leaking
And it hurts

Cut me down
Slice me deep
I dare you
Burn my crown
Spit on my grave
I'll make you
See my face
See my face
I'll haunt you
Deep in the dark
Behind your eyes
I'm on you
Salt of the Earth
Bird of the Heavens
You hear them
All in the hell
The hollowest halls
Don't fear them
Here I am
The warrior man
Here I stand
The warrior man

I done tried it all
Tried it all
Hey
Done tried it all
I can't stop this internal bleeding
And my heart is leaking, heart is leaking out
