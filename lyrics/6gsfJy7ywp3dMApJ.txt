Suddenly
It, it came to me
A potent dosage of reality
I saw myself
In the broad daylight
And it made me think about life

I'm not the kinda guy
Who nods his head
With closed eyes
I scoff at labels
I defy censuses
And despise group mentality

All along I thought that this was only human
But I know now that I'm in the minority

I'm lookin' in
Lookin' in
Lookin' in
I'm lookin' in
(Ahhh)

Now I think in relation to
My fellow man
And what he strives to do
We fail to see
There's no compromise
Our evolution is our demise

One day you may find you are also one of me
A complex microcosm of the human race
Observing those around us desiring to belong
Behind the guise of salvation we suffer all along the way, yeah

We're lookin' in
Lookin' in
Lookin' in
We're lookin' in

Lookin' in
Lookin' in
Lookin' in
We're lookin' in
