Watch yourself in the cold rain
Wait till you lose yourself in the forest
And I was told to look away
Not to fall for what I saw in the mirror

I was told to look away
Your hands around me
Fall into the end of days
I will drown in this very place
It will surround you
You will lose me to the dark

Watch yourself as you lose friends
Wait till you find yourself in the forest
And I was told to go away
And to hate what I saw in the mirror

I was told they they look you away
Their hands around you
Fall into the peace of pain
Let's vow to never start again
It seems they found you
You had lost me in the dark
