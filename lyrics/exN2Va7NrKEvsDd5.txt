Another lonely name etched in the stone
On a wall, in a cell, with a prisoners bone
As the night drags its fingers over our eyes
So too do my fingers trace these outlines

Lights out, lights out
And the concrete slowly works its way
Into a man's heart

Real world rules, no missing evidence
Real world rules, no prison break
Real world rules, no tunnels to freedom
Innocence was here, innocence was here

Someone else's fail has cost your life
What happens now when the doors have slammed shut?
Lights out, lights out till we think only with barbed wire brain cells
And dream only of some long-ago life

Lights out, lights out
As the screamers begin their lament
In voices long shredded with fear and regret
And the natural born killers
Rest peaceful in their violent sleep

Real world rules, no missing evidence
Real world rules, no prison break
Real world rules, no tunnels to freedom
Innocence was here, innocence was here

And when somebody else's fingers have traced
The initials I've carved, carved into the stone
There was no prison break, there was no escape
Someone else's mistake

There was no prison break, there was no escape
I was innocent all along

Real world rules, no missing evidence
Real world rules, no prison break
Real world rules, no tunnels to freedom
Innocence was here, innocence was here

No missing evidence
No prison break
No tunnels to freedom
Innocence was here, innocence was here
