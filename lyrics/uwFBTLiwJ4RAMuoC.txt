I stumble and I'm in
You fit me with those angel wings
Set me go
Set me high
Set it up while I'm in the sky
But the storm is gone
And the temperature's high
And delilah's dining
At my table
I think how lucky we are
Angel at my table, God in my car
Get it at sea
Take a ship
I'd christen her victory
She'd make it

Victory
Victory

Come on boys
Let's push it hard
You bump down, push your motorcart
Come on boys
You done us proud
The sweat, just mop it right off your brow

Victory
Victory
Victory
Victo ry

So the storm is gone
And the temperature's high
And delilah's dining
At my table

Till the storm is gone
And the temperature's high
And delilah's dining
At my table
