These nights
You know what they go like
Shots up
I forget about the whole time
Dollar bills while she shake it under strobe lights
Wait until we take it on the road like

I'm afraid of me
I'm afraid of you
I got lanes to pick
I got lanes to choose
So much left to get
So much left to lose
I'm just trying to live
Trying to find a mood for it

I'm just trying to find that shift roll right
Im not dealing wit the hype
I don't fuck with your vibe
Take that to the other side
I don't know
I don't know
I just end up like a ghost
Some days
Some nights
I prefer to be alone

When I take the tone I go away
Maybe you can pull me close and feel a way
I just need to find a little space
Ay
You know how I'm always wide awake
Finna slay

These nights
You know what they go like
Shots up I forget about the whole time
Dollar bills while she shake it under strobe lights
Wait until we take it on the road like

I'm afraid of me
I'm afraid of you
I got lanes to pick
I got lanes to choose
So much left to get
So much left to lose
I'm just trying to live
Trying to find a mood for it
I'm afraid of me
I'm afraid of you
I got lanes to pick
I got lanes to choose
So much left to get
So much left to lose
I'm just trying to live
Trying to find a mood for it

Try to find a mood
Try to find a mood for it
Try to find a mood
Try to find a mood for it
Try to find a mood
Try to find a mood for it
Try to find a mood
Try to find a mood for it

Got me up
Make it roll
Over ice
Paper throw
Sip it slow
Find a mode
Hit the highs
Hit the lows
I'm sorry
I'm so sorry
I know I never knew
Try to find a better me
Try to find a better you
Ay

When I take the tone I go away
Maybe you can pull me close and feel a way
I just need to find a little space
Ay
You know how I'm always wide awake
Finna slay

I'm afraid of you
I got lanes to pick
I got lanes to choose
So much left to get
So much left to lose
I'm just trying to live
Trying to find a mood for it

Try to find a mood
Try to find a mood for it
Try to find a mood
Try to find a mood for it
Try to find a mood
Try to find a mood for it
Try to find a mood
Try to find a mood for it
