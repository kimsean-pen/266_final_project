My darling, I loved you
I long to become you
And know what it is that you gave

We dance the sorrow
Forgive me tomorrow
And I pray night after night and day after day
Would you watch my body weaken
And my mind drift away?

Dear lover forsaken, our love is taken away

You were my speaker, my innocence-keeper
I don't night after night, day after day
Would you watch my body weaken,
My mind drift away?

Dear lover forgiven, my love is driven by rage

Oh I should just leave you, instead I've deceived you
But I don't
Night after night, day after day
Would you watch my body weaken and mind drift away?

I count no one, hold nobody's ear
I sold you my hand once and you hit me in fear
I don't stand for the devil
I don't whisper in ears
I stand on the mountains and call people to hear

Sudden bursts of light, it's a fate foretold
It is knowing, it is knowing

He longs for the answers, as all of us must
He longs for the woman who will conquer his lust
He screams in the night, I scream in the day
He weeps in the evening and lies naked and prays

Night after night, day after day
Night after night, day after day
Would you watch my body weaken and my mind drift away?

It's a tempting communion
It's a fate foretold
It is knowing, it is knowing
What it is that you're told
