You go down to the station
With a ticket in your hand
You go down to the station
With a ticket in your hand
And you will
Oh you will
I heard you will be on your way
Be on your way
Be on your way
Be on your way
Be on your way

And you go down to the chapel
To put a ring upon his hand
And you go down to the chapel
Holding your daddy's hand
And you will
Oh you will
I heard you will be on your way
Be on your way
Be on your way
Be on your way
Be on your way

But please
Oh please
Remember
Remember me
As one you loved
