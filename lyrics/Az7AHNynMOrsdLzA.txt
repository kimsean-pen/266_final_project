A sweetheart drinking lemonade
In absence of the shade
It tingles spines like buried pines
A sweat-line on parade

On a blanket made with patches that describe the zodiac
With a Norman Rockwell smile and some flarey summer flats
In a court when rubber balls bounce high above the baseball hats
I am running from my notes

My only lemonade

I'm driving in a snowy race
Your sunny dates I chased
Your couple with some twisted straws
There's gonna be some spills

And the ice that you chase after is the last thing in the glass
And the ritual of longing for a thing that doesn't last
Now I'm losing all my focus when my soul goes in the grass
I am one too many close

My only lemonade
My only lemonade
My only lemonade
My only lemonade
My only lemonade

Lemonade
Lemonade
Lemonade
Lemonade
