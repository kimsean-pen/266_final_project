Laying next to you, I got a flight in the morning
Got me questioning what I think is important
I can't even lie, think of you when I'm with her
Look me in my eye, tell me that you feel different
Drove two hours just to stay the night with you
Haven't seen you in a year, but I still get you
Hurts to see you laugh 'cause I know I'll fucking miss that
How could I forget that?

You made me feel alive
Forget them other bitches, I will put 'em to the side
Girls in L.A. couldn't be more dry
You're so money, baby, you ain't even have to try
Now I'm runnin' with you 'round East Lansing
Tito's in your dorm, we're dancing
It's a quarter after three
Sayin' everything we mean

Girl, it's hard to see me go so fast, yeah, I get that
Times that we have, so wild, can't forget that
Now I'm on a flight in my feels, thinkin' 'bout you
Hope you know you fire, fuck anyone who doubts you
Life out in Cali has been great, I'm committed
You the only thing that makes me wish things were different
I might fly you out, get your ass on a one-way
If I had it my way

Girl, you'd be by my side
Forget them other bitches, I will put 'em to the side
Girls in L.A. couldn't be more dry
You're so money, baby, you ain't even have to try
Now I'm runnin' with you 'round East Lansing
Tito's in your dorm, we're dancing
It's a quarter after three
Sayin' everything we mean

Maybe I'm stuck in the past, girl
Not willing to let it all go
You can't ignore the fact, baby

You made me feel alive
Fuck them other bitches, I will put 'em to the side
She's so real, baby, look me in my eyes
You're so money, baby, you ain't even have to try
Now I'm runnin' with you 'round East Lansing
Tito's in your dorm, we're dancing
It's a quarter after three
Sayin' everything we mean

For a moment, I was feeling like I had you
Didn't wanna leave, I had to
It's a quarter after three
Saying everything we mean
