With graying clouds watching over me
Oh, I cannot, I cannot breathe
Your pale face behind bars, my heart sinks
Sold to this house for the use of men
Oh, your young heart, I wish I could mend
But instead, I'll pretend, I'll pretend

So close your eyes, close your eyes
'Cause in our dreams, in our dreams
In our dreams
Lovers' suicide

With last sen in pocket I turn to you
A painted rain dragon, the scent of bamboo
Sake drips from your lips when you say,
When you say our love is true
So where do we go? Where do we go?
Like a flower, I can't bloom in the snow
We can't hide, we can't grow

So close your eyes, close your eyes
'Cause in our dreams, in our dreams
In our dreams
Lovers' suicide
