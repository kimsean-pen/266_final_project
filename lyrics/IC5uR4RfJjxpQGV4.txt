Crash
That was you and me
It started out so innocently
Shattered on the ground
I hear the sound

Crash
Ringing in my ears
I still feel the sting of my tears

Someone wake me
I can't seem to break free

Go on get out of my head
I'm on the wrong side of a parallel universe
Am I alive or just dead
I've been stumblin' in the dark
Livin' in a crash world

Hush
Don't say one more word
At this point the truth seems absurd
Cut who we were
It's gone for ever

Crash
Underneath the fears
Everythings so twisted and weird

Someone save me
I can't seem to break free

Go on get out of my head
I'm on the wrong side of a parallel universe
Am I alive or just dead
I've been stumblin' in the dark
Livin' in a crash world

(Crash world... yeah yeah)

Slow motion
Defistation
Shoulda seen it comin' but I couldn't do nothin'
Emotion
Desperation

Someone save me
I can't seem to break free

(universe)

Go on get out of my head
I'm on the wrong side of a parallel universe
Am I alive or just dead
I've been stumblin' in the dark
Livin' in a crash world

Go on get out of my head
I'm on the wrong side of a parallel universe
Am I alive or just dead
I've been stumblin' in the dark
Livin' in a crash world

(Crash world. yeah yeah)
(Crash world)
