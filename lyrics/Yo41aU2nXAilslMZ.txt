Invisible until I want to be
I'm miserable on a beautiful day
Take one look around you
And you just might find
A miracle, a mile away

Might be a miracle
A smile arrives on your face
Might be a miracle
A mile, a mile away
Quit looking for love you've left behind
Waiting for what you've yet to find
Might be a miracle
A mile, a mile away

So spiritual you used to be
So cynical in every obvious way
Take one look around you and the world might end
A miracle in every day

Might be a miracle
A smile arrives on your face
Might be a miracle
A mile, a mile away
Quit looking for love you've left behind
Waiting for what you've yet to find
Might be a miracle
A mile, a mile away
