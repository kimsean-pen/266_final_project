In the cosmos
There is balm as well as bitterness
And that balm is Nepenthe.

Yet underneath endless oceans of sand
I have not forgotten
Those who had betrayed me.
Silent and unmovable,
I am not sorry
For I had hated the light.

Now I ride with the undead
Across the night-sky
And play by day
Amongst the catacombs of Nephren-Ka
In the sealed and unknown
Valley of Hadoth by the Nile.

I know that light is not for me
Save that of the moon over the rock tombs of Neb
Nor any debauchery save the unknown feasts of Nitokris
Beneath the great pyramid.

But in the loneliness of entombment,
I welcome the bitterness of alienage.
