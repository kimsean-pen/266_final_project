A sky blue and the walls passed me outside
And I saw your face as some sort of neon dream
And of all the cars, and the bars, and the stars
On Sunset Boulevard, I saw you
And you couldn't tell me what that means
Or what I'd seen

Pre-
Oh but then it hit me, it was not the same thing
I had missed it all like tears in the rain
Finally I was seeing everything so clearly
Took what I'd been thinking and washed it away

I didn't see it coming
O-o-oh
I didn't see it coming
O-o-oh
I didn't see it coming
Coming, coming, coming, coming, coming, coming, coming,
I didn't see it coming
O-o-oh

Well the street lights flickered and the hot air side
The conversation had stopped on a diamond
A cruise missile climbed into this little land of these mighty dreams of mine
And I was told don't speak with your mouth open, but
I couldn't helá¹— it cause you were chosen as I,
I watched that sky blue limo drive away

Pre-
Oh but then it hit me, it was not the same thing
I had missed it all like tears in the rain
Finally I was seeing everything so clearly
Took what I'd been thinking and washed it away

I didn't see it coming
O-o-oh
I didn't see it coming
O-o-oh
I didn't see it coming
Coming, coming, coming, coming, coming, coming, coming,
I didn't see it coming
O-o-oh

A little skin, a little money
A little taste, a little honey
A little white lie, but if you love it
Tell me who am I to judge

A little skin, a little money
A little taste, a little honey
A little white lie, but if you love it
Tell me who am I to judge

A little skin, a little money
A little taste, a little honey
A little white lie, but if you love it
Tell me who am I to judge

I didn't see it coming
O-o-oh
I didn't see it coming
O-o-oh
I didn't see it coming
Coming, coming, coming, coming, coming, coming, coming,
I didn't see it coming
O-o-oh
