I became an atheist the Junior year of my spring semester in college

My friend from back home moved into our already crowded two-bedroom apartment
that now housed four
(and five when Cathy would move in later that year)

He was unyielding and used logic
like a hammer or a martyr,
and would hurl question after question across the four-foot gap
between his mattress and mine

It absolved me of any last remaining doubt

There was a certainty that finally settled in
that had been torn open during my freshman year over a course in Cultural Anthropology

I am comfortable knowing that this is it

There is so much more beauty in a life that also has death
