Are you drinking tonight?
If you are, can you talk me through this?
I guess I never felt so lonely and reckless
And I know you ain't no stranger to falling in time
That's the thing
I'm getting high but I'm so low all the time now
Constantly scared of death, that someone'll find out
I'm still the fucked up kid that I was from the start

Well you look better than you ever did
Giving me the eyes before you walked in
Talking that shit about how we fit
Perfectly together
Yeah but everything's a mess when I'm around you
I wish I'd never found you, I wish I'd never found you
'Cause everything's a mess when I'm around you
I wish I'd never found you

'Cause I've been drinking tonight
Just like you said that I would
Quietly hoping for someone to move on
And let their feelings go
That I've been thinking tonight
That I should visit your home
What ever makes you feel less alone
I wish you'd known I was lonely when you told me

Well you look better than you ever did
Giving me the eyes before you walked in
Talking that shit about how we fit
Perfectly together
Yeah but everything's a mess when I'm around you
I wish I'd never found you, I wish I'd never found you
'Cause everything's a mess when I'm around you
I wish I'd never found you

'Cause I was scared that she would know we were doomed
From the start
End every hour brings me closer to breaking apart
'Cause this ain't new
It's just a ritual between me and you
And she don't know the depths I'm in
When do we even begin?

I wish I'd never found you
Better than you ever did
Giving me the eyes before you walked in, talking
I wish I'd never found you
Perfectly together
Yeah 'cause everything's a mess when I'm around you
I wish I'd never found you, I wish I'd never found you
