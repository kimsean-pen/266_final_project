Leave all behind now to watch her crawl
Through our dark gardens of insanity
She'll be the light to guide you back home
Just give her a kiss worth dying for - and open your arms

Watch me fall for you
My venus doom
Hide my heart where all dreams are entombed
My venus doom

Grieve all your hearts out as she'll writhe
Enthralled in tragic ecstatic agony
And in her flames, we will die some more
Just show me a life worth living for – light up the dark

Watch me fall for you
My venus doom
Hide my heart where all dreams are entombed
My venus doom
(All dreams are of you – my venus doom)

Hold me inside your infernal offering
Touch me as I fall
Don't lose yourself in the suffering yet
Hold on

Hold me inside your infernal offering
Touch me as I fall
Don't lose yourself in the suffering yet
Hold on, to me

Watch me fall for you
My venus doom
Hide my heart where all dreams are entombed
Watch me fall for you
My venus doom
Hide my heart where all dreams are entombed
My venus doom
(All dreams are of you – my venus doom)
