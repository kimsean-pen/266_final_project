Spend all my time with you
I feel so alive with you
Baby you know that it's true
Cause my eyes are only for you

No I can't bear to see you go
No I don't want to let you go
The way I feel when were alone
Oh girl you keep me on my toes

And you would never even know
It's kinda hard for me to show
But baby girl I love you so
I want to call you all my own

My eyes are only for
My eyes are only for you
Only for you

My heart is only for
My heart is only for you
Only for you

Spend all my time with you
I feel so alive with you
Baby know that it's true
My eyes are only for you
