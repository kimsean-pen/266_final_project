My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus Blood and Righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly trust in Jesus Name

When darkness seems to hide His face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil

Christ alone
Cornerstone
Weak made strong
In the Saviour's love
Through the storm
He is Lord
Lord of all

His oath, His covenant, His Blood
Support me in the whelming flood
When all around my soul gives way
He then is all my Hope and Stay
He then is all my Hope and Stay

Christ alone
Cornerstone
Weak made strong
In the Saviour's love
Through the storm
He is Lord
Lord of all

He is Lord
Lord of all

Christ alone
Cornerstone
Weak made strong
In the Saviour's love
Through the storm
He is Lord
Lord of all

When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless stand before the throne
