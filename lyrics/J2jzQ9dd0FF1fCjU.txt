See, now the door is
Shakin', wonder if I'll
Let you in
I am contemplatin'
Wonder what the neighbors
Think of me

Coverin' my ears now
So I can try to block the pain
Still I hear your voice
I'm feelin' how your words
Fall through my veins, yeah

Go find yourself a better man
Better than I am
Find yourself a better man
Someone who understands

But now you know that I am just
A scumbag in a t-shirt
Plenty better out there, you can be sure
So find yourself a better man
Better than I am

Finally the melody
Is runnin' outta
Outta time
Gotta run through fire
No I'm no better
Than other guys

Ooh, no don't you dare forgive me
'Cause I deserve the sufferin'
Not enough words to fix how I hurt ya

Find yourself a better man
Better than I am
Find yourself a better man
Someone who understands

But now you know that I am just
A scumbag in a t-shirt
Plenty better out there, you can be sure
So find yourself a better man
Better than I am

Black holes of sorrow
That's what we fall in
New day tomorrow
Bring a blue sky
And bring a blue sky

Black holes of sorrow
That's what we fall in
New day tomorrow
Bring a blue sky
Bring a blue sky

Go find yourself a better man
Better than I am
Find yourself a better man
Someone who understands

But now you know that I am just
A scumbag in a t-shirt
Plenty better out there, you can be sure
So find yourself a better man
Better than I am
