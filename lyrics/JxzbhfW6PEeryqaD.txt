Your boyfriend doesn't deserve you
Not to creep you out, but I watch
You enough to know just how he hurts you
If you were my girlfriend,
I'd pay attention to you
Not saying a whole bunch,
Considering how much I already do

But he's lying next to you,
I'm in the treehouse outside
He gets to hold you,
Whenever he wants to
I sleep alone all night
He gets to wake up in the
Sunshine of your love & doesn't care
But he's the one that gets to be with you
It's not fair

Just imagine, what if
I was the "good guy"
And he was the lowdown,
Lovesick loser lurking outside
Aside from the ski-mask,
What would the difference be?
You may as well kick him
Out and take a chance on me

Cause I would always hold your hand
And I would always understand
And, when you want me to fuck off
You know I'm good at getting lost
He says he loves you but he don't
He says he'll be there but he won't
When are you gonna wake up
And see that I'm the one?

He gets to wake up in the

But he's the one who gets to be with you
He's the one that gets to be with you?
He's the one that gets to be with you?
It's not fair
