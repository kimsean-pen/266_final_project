it's such a strange way
floating through the nothing else with you baby
something in your eyes says its raining
if you wanna stay baby stay

it's such a strange world
floating through the emptiness with you girl
something in your eyes says small wait
but girl how can I can stay

can you feel me now?
yeah you can't imagine
down in your soul
can you feel me now?
yeah you can't imagine

its such a dark day
but i can see the stars will shine with you babe
something in your eyes says its okay
so if you wanna stay baby stay
yeah yeah

it's such a dark day
to never know if we'll be getting home okay
something in your eyes shows the way in
so if you wanna stay baby stay
yeah yeah

can you feel me now?
yeah you cant imagine
down in your soul
can you feel me now
yeah you cant imagine
can you feel me now?
down in your soul
yeah you can't imagine
and it's under control
how did you know?
yeah you can't imagine...
