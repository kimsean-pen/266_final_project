Oww
Try it on, baby

Well, I don't look good in no Armani Suits
No Gucci shoes, or designer boots
I've tried the latest lines from A to Z
But there's just one thing that looks good on me

The only thing I want
The only thing I need
The only thing I choose
The only thing that looks good on me... is you

I'm not satisfied with Versace style
Put those patent leather pants in the circular file
Sometimes I think I might be lookin' good
But there's only one thing that fits like it should

The only thing I want
The only thing I need
The only thing I choose, yeah
The only thing that looks good on me... is you

Yeah it's you, it could only be you
Nobody else will ever do
Yeah baby it's you, that I stick to
Yeah we stick like glue

The only thing I want
The only thing I need
The only thing I choose, yeah
The only thing that looks good on me is you

The only thing I want, yeah
The only thing I need
The only thing I choose
The only thing that looks good on me is you

(The only thing I want) The only thing I want
The only thing I need, oh yeah
The only thing I choose, alright
The only thing that looks good on me is you
Oh you
Oh, oh, yeah

Yeah, yeah, you

The only thing that looks good on me is you
Oh yeah
The only thing I want
The only thing I need
