Cause you know girl
That every little thing you do
Even when I'm feelin' blue
It makes me smile
As we going through some stormy weather
That' s what keeps us together
Cause I know they'll find the light on the other side
Cause we'll be just fine
If we take our time
Let the sun shine
Cause we'll be just fine
Cause we'll be just fine
If we take our time
Let the sun shine
Cause we'll be just fine
Even when I'm going underwater
I can breathe just fine
Cause you got m in my prime goal
And it feels so good
As we going through some stormy weather
That's what keeps us together
Cause I know they'll find the light on the other side
Cause we'll be just fine
If we take our time
Let the sun shine
Cause we'll be just fine
Let the sun shine
Let the sun shine
Let the sun shine
Let the sun shine
Let the sun shine
Let the sun shine
Let the sun shine
Let the sun shine
Let the sun shine
Let the sun shine
Let the sun shine
Let the sun shine
Cause we'll be just fine
If we take our time
Let the sun shine
Cause we'll be just fine
Cause we'll be just fine
If we take our time
Let the sun shine
Cause we'll be just fine
Just fine
Just fine
