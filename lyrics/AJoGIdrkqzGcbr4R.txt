Today i watched the boats
Moving through the harbor
walking on water
In your arms i'd stay
Forever if i could
Forever if i may
Keep me in your thoughts, don't disappear

I am on your side
And so alive
So alive it isn't real

If this is how i feel
Then nothing now is true
And nothing now can ever be taken away from you
sinking in the past
The things that shouldn't last
Just put to bed and stand beside me
Stand beside me
Always on your side
I'm on your side
And so alive it isn't real

I am on your side
And so alive
And so alive
And so alive
I am on your side
I am on your side
I am on your side
And so alive
So alive

I am on your side
I'm on your side
I'm on your side
on your side
