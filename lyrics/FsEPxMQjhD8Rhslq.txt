it's turning on the tv, when we were fourteen
you said "my mom's asleep, we won't get caught, do you wanna watch?"
and i could hear the traffic, that i know you're ignoring
but i let it in to my life to thicken the air i breathe
it was at the bus stop that a woman cried
and i could tell she was different, by the look in her eyes
and i don't know what she said, but i felt what she meant in her honesty
and i went to your house that night and i told u about
the womans eyes and the words in her mouth
and how i wouldn't mind to give her advice some day
but i'm a cowardly lion.
i'll leave quietly
if that means a better chance to commemorate what we had
when you were happy.
this isn't a love song, no, not in the least
i just miss you watchin' my tv when i'm writing
so i can hear you laughing
swear to god i still hear you when i close my eyes
and you tell me "i'm not gonna die"
like you used to, before i did this
you're the sunlight that i wished would leave
i'm the raincloud i don't wanna be because the more you're gone
the more i grow pale, i grow pale
you're the sunlight that i wished would leave
i'm the raincloud i don't wanna be because the more you're gone
the more i grow pale, i grow pale
