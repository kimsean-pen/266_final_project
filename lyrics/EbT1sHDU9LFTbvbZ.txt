Let me lie across your crescent spine*
Press my belly to the mountain side
Glorious our earthly bodies rise
Fall and rise
The wine-skin and my eyes are dry
Though the spirit and truth abide
When you stir throughout the wake-less night
Stir and Sigh
Oh
I love you (I am you knew/new)?
Oh
D-d-d-d-d-d-doo-d-doo (2x)
Without joy, and left without recourse.
I approached the giants who came before us
In a resurrected voice
I can conjure up a soundless void
Baby lay your head
We begin and end
Oh
I love you (I am you knew/new)?
Oh
D-d-d-d-d-d-doo-d-doo (2x)
