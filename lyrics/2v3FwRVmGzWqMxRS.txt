Shoot it up
Ready to take a pill
Juice the cup
Phenobarbital
Loosen up
Drift away in the bottom bunk

Quench your love
Don't you want to get close to God
Evolutionary level above
This wasteland of human
When you wanna go it's you
When you wanna go it's you
Ready for a different view
Different view, oh

You forget tomorrow's never gonna come again
You regret your sorrow
Never could make amends

You relied

One by one
Three days later thy will be done
Evacuate us of modern dumb
They've prepared
Now time has come

Yes, this is what it seems
Isolate eternal dream
Wish I could kiss your cheek and cover you in that purple sheet

You forget tomorrow's never gonna come again
You regret your sorrow
Never could make amends

You forget tomorrow's never gonna come again
You regret your sorrow
Never could make amends

You've forever known it's only about the ride
You've told others that it's coming in the night
You're going to the other side
You've took refuge in the plenty of their empty lives
Or is this the other side

You forget tomorrow's never gonna come again
You regret your sorrow
Never could make amends
You forget tomorrow's never gonna come again
You regret your sorrow
Never could make amends
You forget tomorrow's never gonna come again
