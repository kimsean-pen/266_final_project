I caught a glimpse out the window
A Polish graveyard filled with widows
I coddle a bottle of warm beer
I see a pool of liquid tearz
Glimmering so sweet and mellow
A sea of lilting wilting willow
A secret book of forgotten wishes
Drown in ponds with broken dishes

The moon asked the crow
For a little show
In the hazy milk of twilight
No one had to know
The moon asked the crow
For a little show
In the hazy milk of twilight
No one had to know

Angel brother I miss your hair
Careless nature gentle stare
You fell like rain in the dark abysses
Kissed the lips of bloody twinsis
Sung to you a slew of sirens
Tricky mermaids and evil pirates

You watched the sky
With kaleidoscopic eyes
Howling out right
To the blasphemous night
A wolf in the garden
Why do you linger so
Like a silky snail soul
The moon asked the crow

For a little show
In the hazy milk of twilight
No one had to know
The moon asked the crow
For a little show
In the hazy milk of twilight
No one had to know
The moon asked the crow
For a little show
In the hazy milk of twilight
No one had to know
