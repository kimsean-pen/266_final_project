I don't wanna work today
Maybe I just wanna stay
Just take it easy cause there's no stress.
I know it's not an awful crime,
Something special in my mind,
Nothing's gonna cause me distress.

I text my baby on her phone,
Try to get her sexy body home
That's the way I wanna spend my day.
Got to find an alibi,
Cause I don't wanna waste my time
I don't wanna feel distress.

It's not that I'm lazy
I think I'm just crazy
It's not that I'm lazy
I think I'm just crazy
It's not that I'm lazy
Think I'm just crazy
It's not that I'm lazy
I'm just crazy

No stress

I think I'm just crazy
No need to fight against the feelings
Because the life is not depressing
No need to fight against the feelings
Because the life is not depressing

No stress
Oh-oh

I don't wanna work today
I don't wanna work today
I don't wanna work today
Maybe I just wanna stay
Just take it easy cause there's no stress.
I know it's not an awful crime
Something special in my mind
Nothing's gonna cause me distress.
I text my baby on her phone
Try to get her sexy body home
That's the way I wanna spend my day
Got to find an alibi
Cause I don't wanna waste my time
I don't wanna feel distress.

It's not that I'm lazy
I think I'm just crazy
It's not that I'm lazy
I think I'm just crazy
It's not that I'm lazy
Think I'm just crazy
It's not that I'm lazy
I'm just crazy

No stress
I think I'm just crazy
Not depressing

I don't wanna work today
Oh-oh
I don't wanna work today
I don't wanna work today
Oh-oh
I don't wanna work today

No need to fight against the feelings
Because the life is not depressing
No need to fight against the feelings
Because the life is not depressing

I don't wanna work today
Oh-oh

No stress
I don't wanna work today
