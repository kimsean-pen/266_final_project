Lost my grip and my vision gone dull
So swing my hip like a dancer gone numb
I saw your shadow, saw the skeleton run
There's something missing from my memory of you

You shake my world from the ground to my head
A distant noise that'll wake me out of bed
I listen as the walls cave in
I'm hanging on 'cause your memory's thin

Ooh, I lost my grip, I balance it on a piece of paper
True, you wanna trip, it's waving in and I'll wait for later
Ooh, it's leaning on, leaning in on my yesterday
Ooh, it's sneaking in, it's sneaking in on me, on me

I've got a house and an eternal frown
Painted walls and letters upside down
I try to hold on, I try to hold on but you're gone
Then I try to let go but your memory's still on

Ooh, I lost my grip, I balance it on a piece of paper
True, you wanna trip, it's waving in and I'll wait for later
Ooh, it's leaning on, leaning in on my yesterday
Ooh, it's sneaking in, it's sneaking in on me, on me

On me, on me, on me, on me, on me, on me
On me, on me, on me, on me, on me, on me
On me, on me, on me, on me, on me, on me
On me, on me, on me, on me, on me, on me

On me, on me, on me, on me, on me, on me
On me, on me, on me, on me, on me, on me
On me, on me, on me, on me, on me, on me
On me, on me, on me, on me, on me, on me

On me, on me, on me, on me, on me, on me
On me, on me, on me, on me, on me, on me
On me, on me, on me, on me, on me, on me
On me, on me, on me, on me, on me, on me
