Jumping out of windows after dark
We wanna see the king play in the park
The glitter on her face joins us to the stars
Tripping through the city

We're laying in flowers after bars
Smoking with strangers in the park
You shot me a vibe through a midnight laugh
Now I'm hearing sirens

Well I've been having too much fun
So I might as well jump, might as well jump
And I heard that you're a cannibal
Well I'm an animal, I'm an animal
Take off all of your clothes
Ready set go, ready set go

Throw your weapon, Colt .45
Not so innocent, criminal in disguise
You showed me yours and I showed you mine
Go easy on me, I don't wanna die

All I know
Is I'm not gonna say no (not gonna say no)

Well I've been having too much fun
So I might as well jump, might as well jump
And I heard that you're a cannibal
Well I'm an animal, I'm an animal
Take off all of your clothes
Ready set go, ready set go

Mid-night show
With my best friends girl
Well I should know better
I should know better
I should know better
I should know
But I've been having too much fun
So I might as well jump
And I heard that you're a cannibal
Well I'm an animal

Well I've been having too much fun
So I might as well jump, might as well jump
And I heard that you're a cannibal
Well I'm an animal, I'm an animal
I'm an animal, I'm an animal
