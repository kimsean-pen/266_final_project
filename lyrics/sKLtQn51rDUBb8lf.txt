I am your silence deafening
That silence deafening
How you will wear my crown
My heir my blood my hands in time

Root your faith in solid ground
Always see everything
Believe in yourself profound

I am silence disappearing
Your silence deafening

And you will wear my crown
And you will make my world your own

All the prayers in the world
Won't bring me back
But I know I will be safe
Inside your heart

There will be sinners,
There will be saints
That cross your path
But don't lose heart now, love
You will be alright
