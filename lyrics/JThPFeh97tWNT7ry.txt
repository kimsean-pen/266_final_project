Sounds in my head
Where'd they go now
Words in my bed
They don't quiet down
I know it's nothing to worry myself about

But I haven't slept
I haven't slept
Except for the beat when it goes
And my eyes finally close
Steady the pound

Move to the sound
'Cause the music it knows
What your heart won't let go of
Steady the pound
Move to the sound of love
The sound of love
The sound of love

The sound, the sound

Courage it took, but I'm here now
Wiping the dirt, sweat the fever out
I know it's nothing to worry myself about

Hands on my chest
Doing my best

So feel the beat when it goes
And my eyes finally close
Steady the pound
Move to the sound
'Cause the music it knows
What your heart won't let go of
Steady the pound
Move to the sound of love

The sound of love
The sound of love
The sound, the sound

So feel the beat when it goes
And your eyes finally close

Steady the pound
Move to the sound
'Cause the music it knows
What your heart won't let go of
Steady the pound

Move to the sound of love
The sound of love
The sound of love
The sound, the sound

So feel the beat when it goes
And my eyes finally close
Steady the pound
Move to the sound
'Cause the music it knows
What your heart won't let go of
Steady the pound
Move to the sound of love
The sound of love
The sound of love
The sound, the sound
