He's a spacer
A star chaser
A spacer

He's a ladies man
Always greets with, a kiss on the hand
He protects us all
At the ready to answer our call
In his own special way he is gentle and kind
Oppression he hates
Love in his eyes
My heart skips a beat when I'm by his side

He's a spacer
A star chaser
A spacer
He's a spacer
A star chaser
A spacer

In our galaxy
You can't trust everyone that you meet
I'm so lucky
He's the only one I'll ever need
He will blast off tonight
He puts his life on the line everytime he's in flight
A man you can trace
But our love will last beyond time and space

He's a spacer
A star chaser
A spacer
He's a spacer
A star chaser
A spacer
He's a spacer
A star chaser
A spacer
