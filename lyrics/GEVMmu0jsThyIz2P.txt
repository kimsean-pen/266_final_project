Darling I'm hostage
To the red quilted rivers
To your hand that is stronger than mine
Shakes and quivers

All the virgin needs swelter
For the one that is lovingly seeing you
Just as you are

Love is
The sin that we waited for
Run free
Hot naked love is all
Love is
Hanging from the roof of life
Run free
Singing in my arms so bright

Every limb and that powerless hand
Strapped onto the eclipse when it falls I fall
All of the flowers still grow
Towards the light of a face you know
To be turning and spinning around you
When the mind starts to wander
Lying bare and golden with you
In this room
In this constellation
Slipping through the vast and measureless
Fingers of duration
Some days dressed in a heart throb
Some days in a gilded noose
We watch the afternoons roll by
Here in our exile
Darling

Love is
The sin that we waited for
Run free
Hot naked love is all
Love is
Hanging from the roof of life
Run free
Singing in my arms so bright

Love is
The sin that we waited for
Run free
Hot naked love is all
Love is
Hanging from the roof of life
Run free
Singing in my arms so bright

Love is
The sin that we waited for
Run free
Hot naked love is all
Love is
Hanging from the roof of life
Run free
Singing in my arms so bright
Run free
Run free
Run free
Run free
Run free

Run
Run
Run
Run
Run
Run
Run
