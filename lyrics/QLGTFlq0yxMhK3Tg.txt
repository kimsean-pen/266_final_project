I want to say twice
We can't be too long
We can't be too strong to try
Slow to care
And one by one, we are looking for the ties
We move like the keep inside
In a hard wooden house

I guess, I've been carrying many small things
Would you be able to come there with me?
It's just a game, a game that you have to play
Without the rules and if I fall with you, fall with you

Step by step, we are tracing your
We like to believe one day
It will make sense
And in the dark, when we deep like not
We'll be trying to hold hands, trying to hold
My bones will be no stronger than the pieces of
That walks with me
harder it is to forget,
and if I fall would you fall with me?
Hard, hard, hard it is,
Hard, hard, hard it is,

I guess, I've been carrying many small things
Would you be able to come there with me?
It's just a game, for wich you have to play
Without the and if I fall with you, fall with you
And if I fall, would you fall with me?
And if I fall, would you fall with me?
