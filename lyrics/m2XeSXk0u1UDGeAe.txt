You the coverclouds in a midnight sky
I, a little snowflake waxwing high
Erring on the delicate side
Who can mark the hour our soul sick friendships die?
Ever felt like Noah on an overcast day?
David, take down your harp and play
You hatched your little plan when the first fell through?
The wicked in you ran, though none pursued!
You're toeing a precarious line
Momentary taste of almost unmediated mind

Silk shirt for a sackcloth king
David, take down your harp and sing!
Clockwork drama in a Josten's ring
Ever on the verge of catastrophe

King of Spain and Queen of Portugal
King of Spain and Queen of Portugal
King of Spain and Queen of Portugal
King of Spain and Queen of Portugal

I ran to the sea but the sea wouldn't hide me
The oceans agree there was no one to hide
Will my story give way to the weight of its gravity?
Self appointed cop spokesman of the end times

Knockneed step and a bent-back spine
No sense of direction besides
Patterns in the clouds over lake Cascade
Message in the sounds of the Air Force planes!
Claims on an extravagant scale in elaborate
If laminated poster board display about chemtrails
Tinky's harp on the wall next to Janis Joplin
Man, I coulda sworn that I saw
The cosmos in the livestock straw
Early cartography sea creature dragon and all?

King of Spain, our songs proclaim that you're Queen of Portugal
King of Spain, our prayers in vain till you're Queen of Portugal
Owls now sail toward seas of Africa flee, thou matadors
Courts of dandelions, wars of Oranges have conquered us
