Pernicious existence
corrupt and deprived
the webs of superiority
an entire race enslaved

Human superior?
So puny as flies
What you call democracy
Is what I call a lie, lie

Observing from the spheres
the witness of the shame
the verdict called extinction
will end this flux of pain

Sick of your infantilism
dignity unknown
raise my hammer of justice
to krush the planet below
through time came no progression
intelligence misused
community of savages
ignorant and confused

Laughable little world
pile of defecation
never found the harmony
choking in economy
in fire began the chaos
and flames will start the end
aversion brought the sentence
celestial revenge

The final explosion
life vapourized
shreds of the earth
the madness has died
