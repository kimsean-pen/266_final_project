Oh July
It's better off since April died
I can see September through the trees
And I can't lie
There's more to know than what's inside
Maybe there's some reason in my memories
But all I know
It's easier to love you when I'm gone
But it's hard for me to leave
I don't know
This anger isn't helping anyone
And I don't know what I need

Oh St. Marie
Close my eyes before you leave
So I don't have to look at you in shame
Oh St. Marie
Take my hand and give me peace
Cause I don't think I'll ever be the same

Here come the broken hearts
Just as the music starts
One by one they testify
I never did enough
I never cared enough
Even though I stood, I always ran away
We all wonder why
It's easier to blame the ones you love
Cause it's harder to believe
That we fall sometimes
No matter how I try, I've given up
But now I have a chance to be

Oh St. Marie
Close my eyes before you leave
So I don't have to look at you in shame
Oh St. Marie
Take my hand and give me peace
Cause I don't think I'll ever be the same

Sometimes the quiet ones
Are all I want to be
There's only so much left
The rest is up to me
You're all I ever want
I hope you feel it 'cuz
As far as I'm concerned
You're exactly what I need

Oh St. Marie
Close my eyes before you leave
So I don't have to look at you in shame
Oh St. Marie
Take my hand and give me peace
Cause I don't think I'll ever be the same
Cause I don't think I'll ever be the same
Cause I don't think I'll ever be the same
