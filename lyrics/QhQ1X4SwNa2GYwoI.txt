Tied to the testin' of wills
When my heart breaks and spills
Left to the sight of the sky
In your arms I'm defined

Thrown to the wolves
In the minds of your enemies
And I'm stoned in the eyes
Of your foolishness

If this is what I'm meant for
No longer interesting
Fall forward just to even the score
Just a thought to you

Tied to the testing of wills
When my heart breaks and spills
Left to the sight of the sky
In your arms I'm defined

Thrown to the wolves in the minds of your enemies
In the minds of your enemies
And I'm stoned in the eyes
Of your foolishness

And I'm nothing more without a line in your book
Yet I'm nothin' more without a line in your book
Yet I'm nothin' more without a line in your book
Yet I'm nothin' more than a line in your book
In your book
In your book

If this is what I'm meant for
No longer interesting
Fall forward just to even the score
Just a thought to you
Juneau tell you
Juneau tell you
Yet I'm nothin' more, yet I'm nothin' more
Than a line in your book
Yet I'm nothin' more than a line in your book
