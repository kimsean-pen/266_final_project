So long, new love
I came to say goodbye
Cause love, should live long
But on this we can't rely
Until I go
Tell me what you feel inside
That's how, I'll know
Our hearts are just untied

Oh! I feel like a fool.
I do
I made a lullaby I might give to you
Oh! I feel like a fool
I do
I made a lullaby I might give to you

How long will it take
Till I start to feel I melt with you
Just go on, love
For that I think there's no "undo"
So hard, I got close
Tough I made this song to say the truth
But far, I was wrong
I'd try anything to make it right with you

So long, new love
So long, new love

Oh! I feel like a fool.
I do
I made a lullaby I might give to you
Oh! I feel like a fool
I do
I made a lullaby I might give to you
Oh! I feel like a fool
I do
I made a lullaby instead of saying goodbye
To you
