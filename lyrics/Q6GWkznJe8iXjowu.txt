Ooh, gonna be like a dog
Lay flat on my back
Pull my feet off the ground
Ooh, let my head hit the sack

I'm muscle in plastic
Nyjinsky's bad move
Just a white show piece
I've got nothing, nothing to lose

I preach for the praise
Well, I can't dance so I gaze
Like a bad offset
Well, I'm just counting the days

Well, I'm a muscle in plastic
Nyjinsky's bad move
Just a white show piece
I've got nothing, nothing to lose, oh
Yeah

Well, I can't dance so I gaze
And I preach for the praise
You can't dance stay here, here
Well, you can't dance stay here, here
Owh, oh

Sonar blips on my arms
My head's increased
Just a hotel inmate
I'm the lover deceased
I'm the latent impression of a dancer's leg
I like faking persuasion
And laying my bed

I'm a muscle in plastic
Ooh, Nyjinsky's bad move ooh
Just a white show piece
I've got nothing to lose
I've got nothing to lose, lose
Nothin', oh nothin', nothin'
Nothin, nothin', nothin', nothin'
