(This just in, another talented young Black man
Thrown in jail, lost his life
Just sitting on his couch, in the street)

Every time I turn on the news
I can't seem to tell a lie from the truth
Earthquakes all over the place
Contaminated water in Flint is so crazy
Big pharma makin' big ol' bucks
Sellin' all these deadly and addictive drugs
And we don't even know what we can eat
We got genetically modified broccoli
And they clonin' animals, we eatin' the meat
The text thing they turn around
They clonin' you and me
The way they do the human race
Is a ridiculous crime
And Colin Kaepernick's knee
Got y'all losin' y'all minds? Come on

Let me off this rollercoaster (hey)
I don't wanna ride no more
(I don't wanna ride no more)
I don't wanna ride no more
I don't wanna ride no more, no more
Let me off this rollercoaster
I don't wanna ride no more
(I don't wanna ride no more)
I don't wanna ride no more
I don't wanna ride no more, no more

Every time I turn on my radio
It's the sex, lies, the misogyny show
All day, every day in my ear
If you keep your clothes on
Then they call that rare
Vulgarity, they raisin' the ante
It's the road less traveled
If you wanna be classy
I look at it all and I'm completely inspired
To answer all negativity
With a song and a smile
And I'ma stand up for what I believe in
And I don't care who thinks I'm preachin'
Pay attention to the way
You're spendin' your time
'Cause keepin' up with the
Kardashians is fallin' behind, yeah

Let me off this rollercoaster
I don't wanna ride no more
(I don't wanna ride no more)
I don't wanna ride no more
I don't wanna ride no more, no more
Let me off this rollercoaster
I don't wanna ride no more
(I don't wanna ride no more)
I don't wanna ride no more
I don't wanna ride no more, no more

'Round and 'round and up and down
Yeah, it's makin' me nauseous
Let you take me on this ride
I've got to be more cautious

All this talk of human rights overseas
Meanwhile our Black
Community is under siege
Genocide is focused on the African race
Especially in the streets of this USA, now
They say that there's a war on terrorism
Then the powers that be
They need to look in the mirror
I thought that we lived in a democracy
But I don't remember anyone askin' me, nah
They said that our vote would be our voice
This insanity could never be anyone's choice
'Cause the whole world is
In need of desperate help
But the first thing that we need
To do is look at ourselves, yeah

Let me off this rollercoaster
I don't wanna ride no more
(I don't wanna ride no more)
I don't wanna ride no more
I don't wanna ride no more, no more
Let me off this rollercoaster
I don't wanna ride no more
(I don't wanna ride no more)
I don't wanna ride no more
I don't wanna ride no more, no more

Mumble rap, Percocet, Oxycodone
Amateur pornographic videos
I would not believe it if
I hadn't seen it with my own eyes
If it didn't make me mad
It would make me cry
Now how are we gonna get
Ourselves out of this mess?
It's time for us to elevate our consciousness
And raise our voice to be
The men we want our girls to marry
Make love, peace and respect the priority
'Cause we're watchin' as
The world falls apart
That means we need to
Stop and switch our heart
'Cause we create this world we live in
The only way to peace is through

Let me off this rollercoaster (ooh)
I don't wanna ride no more
(I don't wanna ride no more)
I don't wanna ride no more
I don't wanna ride no more, no more
Let me off this rollercoaster
I don't wanna ride no more
(I don't wanna ride no more)
I don't wanna ride no more
I don't wanna ride no more, no more

(This just in, another talented young
Black man taken to prison
Was sitting on his couch
Little more than crossing the street
See the few and more controversial
This school shooting
More on this in the news at nine)
