From the mouths of babes to power of men
I make it all new again
Hold my hand, hold my hand
Cause I can't touch the ground
The carousel goes around, round and round
The addiction, the friction, it burns you alive
So illegal, no evil is seen with these eyes
I won't tell if you won't it and I will if you want
Nothing is sacred, don't care if it's wrong

I'm your Lolita
La Femme Nikita
When we're together
You'll love me forever
You're my possession
I'm your obsession
Don't tell me never
I'll love you forever

Doomed from the start, we can't stay apart
Everywhere I turn, I'm trapped in your heart
There's no escape, secrets keep you awake
No running away, no saving the day
Wild and exciting, I'm breaking you down
You're making a comeback, I'm taking your crown
Nursery rhymes, I'm singing my dreams
I'm lost in the woods, and you're baring your teeth

I'm your Lolita
La Femme Nikita
When we're together
You'll love me forever
You're my possession
I'm your obsession
Don't tell me never
You'll love me forever

Always stay close to me
Don't think of leaving
And I promise I will keep
Our secret

I'm your Lolita
La Femme Nikita
When we're together
You'll love me forever
You're my possession
I'm your obsession
Don't tell me never
You'll love me forever
Always stay close to me
Don't think of leaving
And I promise I will keep
Our secret
