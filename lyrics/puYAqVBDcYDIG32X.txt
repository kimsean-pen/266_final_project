Flies
Flies

Sitting here like uninvited company
Wallowing in my own obscenities
I share a cigarette with negativity
Sitting here like wet ashes
With X? s in my eyes and drawing flies

Bathed in perspiration drowned my enemies
Used my inspiration for a guillotine
I fire a loaded mental cannon to the page

Leaning on the pedestal that holds my self denial
Firing the pistol that shoots my holy pride
Sitting here like wet ashes
With X? s in my eyes and drawing flies

I said, "Hey, what you yellin'?
About conditions, permission, mirrored self affliction
Hey, what you yellin?
About sadist? s co-addiction, perfect analogies
Hey, what you yellin?
About conditions, permission, mirrored self affliction"

Leaning on the pedestal that holds my self denial
Firing the pistol that shoots my holy pride
Sitting here like wet ashes
With X? s in my eyes and drawing flies

Sitting here like uninvited company
Wallowing in my own obscenities
I share a cigarette with negativity

Leaning on the pedestal that holds my self denial
Firing the pistol that shoots my holy pride
Sitting here like wet ashes
With X? s in my eyes and drawing flies

Flies
