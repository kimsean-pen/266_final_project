Hey listen up, did ya hear that sound?
I sent a signal but it never made
Its way around in time
And when did all these streetlights
Get so bright?

I'm walking home again
But my head's not right
Is there anyone out there...?

'cause I
Feel it coming over
Can somebody call an ambulance
To save me from my self-offence?

I think better when you're in town
And I look much better
When I'm not laying
Face-down on the ground

And when did all these days
Turn into nights?
Staring at the mirror
Trying to pick a fight
Is there anyone out there...
