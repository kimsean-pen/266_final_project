You can talk all you want but my skin is really thick
I'm the leader of the crowd and my game is really slick
I'm unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable
You can talk all you want but my skin is really thick
I'm the leader of the crowd and my game is really slick
I'm unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable
Save your pity for tomorrow when I smash it like a ball
In the club, on the news I'll be rockin' like a rock star
I'm unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable
Crazy F baby, hello girl I got a black resident in a yellow cab
In my red shoes and my swags so sick I need a cess pool
I'm never in a bad mood but I can make her bit move
You like my attitude, ain't nobody else on my magnitude
See ain't nothing stopping me, I feel like ain't nothing after me
Huh, whatcha talking about that? I ran in a bank and I walked out set
Yeah, and I walk it like I talk but I run this shit, yeah run it like a poesy
I'm on the A list 'cause I'm all young money
You can talk all you want but my skin is really thick
I'm the leader of the crowd and my game is really slick
I'm unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable
Save your pity for tomorrow when I smash it like a ball
In the club, on the news I'll be rockin' like a rock star
I'm unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable
Now shake your body like you got the jungle fever
Rushing through your veins
We gettin' crazy and the club is banging through your brain
When I say jump, you jump, jump is knockin', knockin'
I wanna see you jump like this beat is rockin'
Love bite on my bracelet kinda fancy but it's hot
You wanna come along and see and holler at me
Maybe I lost it, maybe not 'cause I got game
Like a burning flame, yeah that's me uh, huh
You can talk all you want but my skin is really thick
I'm the leader of the crowd and my game is really slick
I'm unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable
Save your pity for tomorrow when I smash it like a ball
In the club, on the news I'll be rockin' like a rock star
I'm unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable
Fa, fa, fa, fa, follow the leader
Fa, fa, fa, fa, follow the leader
Fa, fa, fa, fa, follow the leader
Fa, fa, fa, fa, follow the leader
You can talk all you want but my skin is really thick
I'm the leader of the crowd and my game is really slick
I'm unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable
Save your pity for tomorrow when I smash it like a ball
In the club, on the news I'll be rockin' like a rock star
I'm unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable
