Tell me, baby is it yes or no?
You've got a face that just don't show what's going on inside
Tell me, I swear I'll take it on the chin
Don't sugarcoat where I fit in, what's going on?

Inside you there's a room, a room with a door
I finally come knocking and I've been here before
Oh, I've got this love for you but what is it for?
If you can hear me then tell me

Last chance, hold me in your arms and say
If you want this love to walk away
Tell me and I'll say goodbye

Inside you there's a room, a room with a door
I finally come knocking and I've been here before
Oh, I've got this love for you but what is it for?
If you can hear me

I'll make it easy, I'm counting to three
Am I something you want or someone you need, baby?

Tell me that you want me, tell me that you love me
Tell me, darling won't you tell me?
I'm begging you to tell me
Tell me and I'll say goodbye
