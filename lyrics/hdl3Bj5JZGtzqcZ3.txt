I felt a little better when the sun went down
I felt a little taller when I got up off the ground
Think I hurt my back when reaching for the top
This goddamn trouble
Ain't never gonna stop
I waited all day 'till they finally called my name
Right to the front of the line, and I brought my A-game
I was eye to eye with a two-wheeled cop
This goddamn trouble Ain't never gonna stop, never gonna stop

You see it didn't look good for your hero at large
He was stuck in the mud, stuck in the charge
Then they sent him away up the mountain top
Never gonna stop

Pushing the envelope, pull out the rug
Pushing the button, pulling the plug
Too, too much trouble, there goes the rug

I like my trouble tight, who's to say I'm right
Too much, goddamn trouble
All day and all night long, who's to say I'm wrong
Too much, goddamn trouble
