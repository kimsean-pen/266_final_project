Looking from the window above,
it's like a story of love, can you
hear me?
Came back only yesterday, we're moving farther away,
want you near me

All I needed was the love you gave, all I needed for another day,
And all I ever knew - only you

Sometimes when I think of her name
When it's only a game
And I need you
Listen to the words that you say
It's getting harder to stay
When I need you

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

This is gonna take a long time
And I wonder what's mine
Can't take no more

Wonder if you'll understand
It's just the touch of your hand
Behind a closed door

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you
