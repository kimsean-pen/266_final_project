Laura is learning how to love
See, can't you see?
It hurts to see her go
To parties all alone

And I hope they bring back Elvis
And all the stars of the past
Together at last
For a cover show
And we can make it last
On the Flaming Star

The first word
And the word is let
They never let you learn
To be you right 'em all
Except the word can still be

Light up and colour-code your old LPs
They never turn no more
It's just a garage rock that rattles to the floor
Every morning is separating, you and Caroline again
The look in your eyes, it looks just like the twilight of your life

Now you're stone cold tired
And your wife is getting high with your daughter
And another guy in the starlight

And I hope they bring back Elvis
And all the stars of the past
Together at last
For a cover show
And we can make it last
On the Flaming Star
