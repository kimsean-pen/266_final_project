Don't cry, open up your eyes and know
There's someone else out there that feels this way

I'm singing to you
Cause I know what you've been through and now
It's not so long ago I felt the same

Like soldiers, march on
If we can make it through tonight we'll see the sun
March on, march on

And I remember summer nights alone
The fireflies the only thing we own
Yeah, all we had were dreams of California
And I remember winters were so cold
Hunger was the only thing we know
And rock'n'roll dreamin' was what saved us

Like soldiers, march on
If we can make it through tonight we'll see the sun
March on, march on

Till we see the sun, march on, till we see the sun
Through the good times, through the bad times
Through the long days, through the hard nights
Keep on, till we see the sun

Like soldiers, march on
If we can make it through tonight we'll see the sun
March on, march on

Like soldiers, march on
If we can make it through tonight we'll see the sun
March on, march on

Even when there's no one there for you march on
Even when the days are long for you march on
And like soldiers, march on
