Bright light city gonna set my soul
It's gonna set my soul on fire
Got a whole lot of money that's ready to burn
So get those stakes up high

There's a thousand pretty women waiting out there
They're all waiting, the devil may care
And I'm just the devil with a lung to spare

So viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas

How I wish that there were more
Than the twenty-four hours in the day
Even if I ran out of speed, boy
I wouldn't sleep a minute of the way

Oh, that blackjack and poker and the roulette wheel
I'll poach your money lost on every deal
All you need is sonar and nerves of steel

So viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas

Viva Las Vegas where the neon signs flash your name
The one-arm bandits cash in
All those hopes down the drain

Viva Las Vegas, turning day into nighttime
Turning night into daytime, if you see it once
You'll never be the same again

Gotta keep on running
Gonna have me some money
If it costs me my very last dime

If I wind up broke
Then I'll always remember that
I had a swingin' time

Oh, I'm gonna give it everything I've got
Lady Luck's with me, the dice stay hot
Got coke up my nose to dry away the snot

So viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
Viva, viva Las Vegas, whee!
