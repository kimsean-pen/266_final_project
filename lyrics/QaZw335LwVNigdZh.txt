You don't know
I sing these songs
About you
You don't know the the Pseudonyms
I assume

You don't know the the Pseudonyms
I assume
For you.
Are you happy now?

That the Gods are dying.
Or do you dream of
Heston with omniscient beard
You should be happier now

with no one to pray to.
Or would I love to break your knees from begging and
praying?
Bite Hard.
Well its a broken smile

Breaking their hearts and breaking their minds.
Bite Hard.
A survival guide
Edges and lines and we ride together

Bite Hard.
May be lonelier now but im happy oh no honest.
Aint only alone but what would we talk about anyway
I'd never resort to kissing your photo

Honest
I just had to see
How the chemicals taste their honey.
Bite Hard.
well its a broken smile
Breaking their hearts and breaking their minds.

Bite Hard.
A survival guide
Edges and lines and we ride together

Bite Hard.
We ride together
We ride together
We die together.

Bite hard.
ahhhhh
Bite hard.

ahhhhohhhh
Bite hard.
woaaaaaaah
Well I never
Well I never
Well I never know
Well I never
I just had to
I just had to taste their honey.
Bite Hard.
well its a broken smile
Breaking their hearts and breaking their minds.
Bite Hard.
A survival guide
Edges and lines and we ride together
We ride together
We die together.
