Gotta find a way
Yeah, I can't wait another day
Ain't nothing gonna change
If we stay 'round here

Gotta do what it takes
'Cause all in our hands
We all make mistakes
Yeah, but it's never too late
To start again
Take another breath
And say another prayer

And fly away from here
Anywhere
Yeah, I don't care
We just fly away from here
Our hopes and dreams
Are out there somewhere

Won't let time pass us by
We'll just fly
Yeah!

If this life
It seems harder now
It ain't no never mind
You got me by your side

And anytime you want
Yeah, we can catch a train and find a better place
'Cause we won't let nothing or no one keep getting us down
Maybe you and I
Could pack our bags and hit the sky

And fly away from here
Anywhere
Yeah, I dont care
We just fly away from here
Our hopes and dreams
Are out there somewhere

Won't let time pass us by
We'll just fly
Do you see a blue sky now
You can have a better life now
Open your eyes

'Cause no one here can ever stop us
They can try but we won't let them
No way

Maybe you and I
Could pack our bags and say goodbye

And fly away from here
Anywhere
Honey, I don't care
We just fly away from here
Our hopes and dreams
Are out there somewhere

Fly away from here
Yeah, anywhere
Honey, I don't, I don't, I don't, I ...
Yeah, we just fly away
