Shes singing softly in the night
Praying for the morning light
She dreams of how they used to be
At dawn they will be free

Memories they haunt his mind
Save him from the endless night
She whispers warm and tenderly
Please come back to me

And when the golden sun arises far across the sea
The dawn will break as darkness fades forever well be free

Never forget what I did, what I said
When I gave you all my heart and soul
Morning will come and I know well be one
Cause I still believe that youll remember me

She mourns beneath the moonlit sky
Remembering when they said goodbye
Wheres the one he used to know
It seems so long ago

And when the golden sun arises far across the sea
The dawn will break as darkness fades forever well be free

Never forget what I did, what I said
When I gave you all my heart and soul
Morning will come and I know well be one
Cause I still believe that youll remember me

Never forget what I did, what I said
When I gave you all my heart and soul
Morning will come and I know well be one
Cause I still believe that youll remember me

Oh I still believe that youll remember me
Oh I still believe that youll remember me
