In my nite life I don't think twice,
everything is so nice
Loving in the luxury of the nite life,
everything is alright
Blinding by the headlites,
driving past midnite

Looks like a still life

Give me something cheap,
not enough sleep
Which one do I keep?
You are my nite life

Nite life, brite lite, hold tight,
turn right, turn left, like that
Bright light

In my nite life I don't think twice
everything is so nice
Loving in the luxury of the nite life,
everything is alright
Blinding by the headlights,
driving past midnite

Looks like a still life

Give me something cheap,
not enough sleep
Which one do I keep?
You are my nite life
