Chilled to the bone and five miles to home
I'm messing in the dark and feeling all alone
I got ice in my fire got the heat in my wire
Inject a little heat I'm burning up the tyres
Sidewalking
Talking like I'm on and I'm the only one
I'm making like I'm done and staring like a gun
Sidewalking
And I got to get a car
And I got to get a ride
Gotta get a car
Got jesus on my side
Messing in the dark and walking all alone in
The streets
Know just where I'm going
Sidewalking
Chilled to the bone
Hotwired heat all the way home
