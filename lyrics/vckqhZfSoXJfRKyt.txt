I've already been there
A broken lock
Inside a rotting idea of a heart
You'll never find it
You took my name
On top a desolate mountain of hope

I saw it frame by frame
We'll take it all apart
Until there's nothing left to blame
Protect the weakest thread until the bitter end
I saw it frame by frame
You'll never see me (within my arms)
Before you know it we'll be gone

I've never heard of
A patient prayer
Within a chorus of unending stares
I've already been there
It feels the same
Inside a rotting idea of a heart

If you write it down
It feels the same

I saw it frame by frame
We'll take it all apart
Until there's nothing left to blame
I saw it frame by frame
Protect the weakest thread until the bitter end
You'll never see me (within my arms)
Before you know it we'll be gone

Always a race to keep you dragging on
Until the currents change
Our days are paced to keep from burning out
You used to care

Always a race to keep you dragging on
Until the currents change
Our days are paced to keep from burning out
You used to care so much
