We talk so much
And I feel like I know you
You say what it costs
And I play and define you
Oh God
Don't care so much
For a start leave it out
Are we decided? Decided?
Or leaving out too much?

We don't have time, let it go
These 85 videos
With broken eyes
Time flows and never flies
We don't have time, let it go
These 85 videos
It makes me sad
Of no use

Angel, I found you
In the drifting lights
In the drifting lights
Oh angel
I'll find you
Should have known you'd side
With the drifting lights

I'm most sincere when I'm talking to strangers
They somehow appear in my hour of defenselessness

We don't have time, let it go
These 85 videos
With broken eyes
Time flows and never flies
We don't have time, let it go
These 85 videos
We'll white-out their views
Of no use

On the passing them both
Like it, I'm the cold
Something I know
Has joined along
Time through
Take it out
No sleep
Only when you stop
Time to deceive ain't up
On the passing them both
Like it, I'm the cold
Something I know
Has joined along
Time through

Angel, I found you
In the drifting lights
In the drifting lights
Oh angel
I'll find you
Should have known you'd side
With the drifting lights

Oh angel
