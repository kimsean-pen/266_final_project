Tell me more, time time and again
That you're down with your one eye
Wink
Will I tell you
When I shoot the only apple in my eye
Tell me more time time and again
That I'm down and I need you
Blink for a second
Miss my only chance to have you for the night
So do I want to feel alive while I grow old
You combine with all my friends
Seems like they love you
Tell me more, time time in my head
That you know when I'm fiendin'
I inhale you
I derail too far to make it back to bed

You say I'm blind tonight
And don't you know I fought to play your games
Facetious ways
It's six in the morning
I can't slow my heart, and I gave all my money to death
For life stuck in a bag
I'll get over you if I stay alone in my home today

You might say you love me now
But don't assume tomorrow's entrance and exits might define you
You might say you know me so
But don't expect tomorrow's interest to nothing
Makes your heart roam
For more if you need it

Well i sit around and watch the colossal skies
And i stay up late and watch my head divide
I sit around and bathe in tungsten light
I stay up late and die

You might say you love me now
But don't assume tomorrow's entrance and exits might define you
You might say you hate me now
But don't assume tomorrow's entrance and exits might define you
You might say you love me now
But don't assume tomorrow's entrance and exits might define you
You might say you know me so
But don't expect tomorrow's interest to nothing
Makes your heart roam
For more if you need it
