Don't waste my time now
Don't call me, "Baby"
When you don't know if you love me
If you're coming or going

And don't leave the back door open
And look for a way out
And then say maybe you love me
But there's no way of knowing

Why does the wind blow
Through my house at night?
Why does the wind blow
Through my heart each time
I look into your eyes?

Don't look for reasons
Don't tear your heart out
Wondering why the light starts fading
When the day the is ending

Embrace the seasons
And get to believing that it's only
Something broken
That seems worthwhile mending

Why does the wind blow
Through my house at night?
Why does the wind blow
Through my heart each time
I look into your eyes?

Your heart is sore
Like mine was before
You look to the sky
And no one cares why
Not even the wind
So where to begin

And since we exist
And why not just?
Why not just?
And why not just kiss?
