Hello, Dolly
This is Louis, Dolly
Finally get you back where you belong
You're lookin' swell, Dolly
I can tell, Dolly
Still glowin', still crowin', you're still goin' strong
I feel the room swayin'
The band playin'
Old favorite tunes from way back when
Take her wrap fellas
Find her an empty lap
Dolly never go away again

I feel the room swayin'
The band playin'
Old favorite tunes from way back when
Golly gee, fellas
Have a little faith in me
Dolly never go away, our love never goes away
Dolly never go away again
