Newton-John Olivia
Soul Kiss
Queen Of The Publication
Somethin' strange is goin' on and you're in the middle
I'll do anything to solve the riddle
I've got a city editor who put me on a deadline
If I don't come through I'm on the breadline

I'll invade your privacy, please don't take it personally

Chorus:
I'm oh so sorry but the readers got a right to know
You're gonna help the circulation grow
When I get the story right, I'll be queen of the publication

I've got a hidden camera, shadow on your trail
And I'm tape-recording every detail

All the walls have ears tonight
They're listenin' in case you might talk in your sleep

(chorus)

In every supermarket check-out line they'll be starin' at your face
Make you a legend in your own time, you can triple column space
When I get the story right, I'll be queen, I'll be queen, I'll be queen

(Solo)

I'll get the story right and I'm gonna be queen of the publication

I'm oh so sorry but the readers got a right to know
You're gonna help the circulation grow
When I get the story right, I'll be queen, I'll be queen, I'll be queen
Oh, queen of the publication... (to fade)
