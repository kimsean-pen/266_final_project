Picture perfect images on the outside
But you have seen me late at night and know it isn't bright
'Cause I drink too much, want my mind stuck
I'm avoiding getting too in touch with deep stuff

Heard a song of mine today on the radio
Should be proud of what they say
'Stead I feel astray
You are the perfect melody
I'm the wrong chord that ruins the harmony

I'm a horrible person deep down you know I'm bad
I'm a horrible person although it may seem sad
I seem to do fine you know you love my fire
We're the example that disasters can stay alive
I'm a horrible person and sometimes it makes you glad

Picture perfect failure on the inside
Dare to take a chance just know I might bite
Sometimes we hurt others we work
Let's walk this line between coffee and herbal tea

Saw a plastic smile on the TV screen
Saying opposites make a great team
You and your cosmic convictions
Me the cold one who says the wrong pun

I'm a horrible person deep down you know I'm bad
I'm a horrible person although it may seem sad
I seem to do fine you know you love my fire
We're the example that disasters can stay alive
I'm a horrible person and sometimes it makes you glad

Remember when we promised to be always there no matter what
You said that storms just wouldn't phase us wouldn't change us
So promise me it's the same that we won't turn words to bullets no
When I say go away I mean I need you bad

I'm a horrible person deep down you know I'm bad
Yes I'm a horrible person and sometimes it makes you [?]

I'm a horrible person, horrible person
Yes I'm a horrible person, horrible person
I seem to do fine you know you love my fire
We're the example that disasters can stay alive
I'm a horrible person and sometimes it makes you glad
