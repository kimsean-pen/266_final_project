I hear the sounds repeating echos in the distance
Familiar rounds of sunder telegraph a war
The evil winds it way through every television
The fear is blinding me to shatter to the core

Who
You can't control love
Soon
It's time you see

We're standing our ground
You can't push us around
We're not paralyzed in a panic
Won't bow to you anymore
You're fear's a disease
How long 'till you see
We're not giving in to your madness
If hate is the crime, love is the cure

You tried to pull the wool over the eyes of justice
Convince yourself you do it only for your god
But all your ignorance is sick inside your silence
Put down your guns, it's time we heal the mess you made

Because

We're standing our ground
You can't push us around
We're not paralyzed in a panic
Won't bow to you anymore
You're fear's a disease
How long 'till you see
We're not giving in to your madness
If hate is the crime, love is the cure

If hate is the crime, love is the cure
If hate is the crime, love is the cure
If hate is the crime, love is the cure
If hate is the crime, love is

We're standing our ground
You can't push us around
We're not paralyzed in a panic
Won't bow to you anymore
You're fear's a disease
How long 'till you see
We're not giving in to your madness
If hate is the crime, love is

We're standing our ground
You can't push us around
We're not paralyzed in a panic
Won't bow to you anymore
You're fear's a disease
How long 'till you see
We're not giving in to your madness
If hate is the crime, love is the cure
