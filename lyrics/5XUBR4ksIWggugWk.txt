Thick flows the river of depravity
And thick flows the flood of vile sin
We sing softly to the gates for them to open
And let the holy fire in
Have no mercy upon us, Lord
We seek no justice, only death
Earth's heavenly mirror lies broken
And the web of souls has been torn apart
Take now this handful of whoredom and filth
And fill the hole in your heart
Have no mercy upon us, Lord
We seek no justice, We seek no trial or chance
Have no mercy, Lord
We seek naught but death
Waken now sinner and consider
The itching teeth of what's to come
All that you've created even that sign from God
Shall with you now be undone
Have no mercy upon us, Lord
We seek no justice, we seek no trial or chance
Have no mercy, Lord
Let perdition rise and take form
The moon is bleeding the sky is sackcloth and ash
Have no mercy, Lord
Let our destruction run its course
We stand measured in the now
Blessed but yet to earn
The language of the void
The lost tongue of the depths
Beneath us float spells of power
Above us worlds of light
The phlegm of the Holy Mother
We hang gutted on the cross
Cleansed but yet to learn
The mantras of the dead
The chorus of decay
Before us lie aeons of black
Behind us shreds of life
The skin of the first and the last
