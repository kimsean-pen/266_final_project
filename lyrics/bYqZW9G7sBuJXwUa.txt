I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love, I did, I did
And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot, I did

And now, when all is done, there is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won, you can go ahead, tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken

All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worse
Broken trust and broken hearts, I know, I know
Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear, I know, I know

And now, when all is gone, there is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead, tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible (let me tell them)
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

Ooh, impossible, yeah, yeah

I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love, I did

Tell them all I know now (yeah)
Shout it from the roof tops (shout it from the roof tops)
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now (hey)
Tell them I was happy (tell them I was happy)
And my heart is broken (and my heart is broken)
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be (wow)
Impossible (impossible), impossible (impossible)
Impossible, impossible (let me tell them)
Impossible, impossible (hey, let me tell that)
Impossible, impossible

I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love, I did
