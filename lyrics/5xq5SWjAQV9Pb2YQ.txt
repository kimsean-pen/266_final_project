Hot-kickin' on a million, yeah
She's never lived like this before
She want a ring and my children, yeah
She's always askin' me for more

But I can't lie
I kinda like it
Yeah, I can't lie (nah)
She lifts me up
Yeah, I can't lie

But girl don't forget, hey

The day you fall in love with me, I'll break your fuckin' heart
'Cause I've been married to the game just way too fuckin' long
You beg me, I'm in love with it, yeah I can't give it up
I can't give it up, oh-woah

Rollin' in the car on the way home
She think she not the only one
Walk through the door, she gets me on the floor all made up
That's a different kind of love

But I can't lie
I kinda like it
Yeah, I can't lie (nah)
She lifts me up
Yeah, I can't lie
I kinda like it
But girl don't forget, hey

The day you fall in love with me, I'll break your fuckin' heart
'Cause I've been married to the game just way too fuckin' long
You beg me, I'm in love with it, yeah I can't give it up
I can't give it up, oh-woah
Can't give it up, oh-woah

Been livin' in a fuckin' daydream
(Oh, fuckin' daydream)
Tryna keep you outta my nightmares (nightmares)
Been livin' in a fuckin' daydream
(Oh, fuckin' daydream)
Tryna keep you outta my nightmares (nightmares)

When I close my eyes, baby, I see you in my dreams
I know that you're the reason I can never sleep
You're all that I think of
You're my only feelin'
Usin' my self
Yeah I need you, yeah
You're brokenhearted, but love ain't gone
You make me feel like the only one
