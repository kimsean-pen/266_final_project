Break! Break! Break!
Break! Break! Break!
Break! Break! Break!
Break! Break! Now!

Hold up the leaders
Follow the leader
They're marching one by one
Stand at attention with tunnel vision
Venom on their tongues
But in the silence something has begun

This is your resistance
Raise your flame and burn it
Return in the system
This is your downfall
This is your resistance
We're breaking down the wall

Wake up the fever
Ignite the fever
Backs against the wall
The veil has been lifted, hearts have shifted
What are you waiting for
Oh when we bleed, we bleed as one

This is your resistance
Raise your flame and burn it
Return in the system
This is your downfall
This is your resistance
We're breaking down the wall
(We're breaking down the wall, breaking down the wall!)

Yeah
Break it down!
Break! Break! Break!

This is your resistance
Raise your flame and burn it
Return in the system
This is your downfall
This is your resistance
We're breaking down the wall
We're breaking down the wall, breaking down the wall!
We're breaking down the wall!
Yeah!
