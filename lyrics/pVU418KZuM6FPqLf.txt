"There are no trains that leave from the maze
Me only chance was a ship to escape
if you are the light house in the storm
I'll be the ship with a thousand dead souls
how long will they believe in a light so dim

Down in the gallows the darkness allows
it was hard to see in the hearts of them
if you see a light call down below
I'll be moving and sorting out our tears

How long will we believe in a light so dim
'cause time is all we have
so take the time
throw down the line I'll see to climb
if it's held close it may just work
if you are the light house in the storm
I'll be the ship filled with a thousand dead souls
and time is all we have so take the time
to make the time and make time to take the time..."
