Farewell, Angelina
The bells of the crown
Are being stolen by bandits
I must follow the sound
The triangle tingles
And the trumpets play slow
But farewell, Angelina
The sky is on fire
And I must go

There's no need for anger
There's no need for blame
There's nothing to prove
Everything's still the same
Just a table standing empty
By the edge of the sea
Means farewell, Angelina

The sky is trembling

And I must leave

The jack and queen
Have forsaked the courtyard
Fifty-two gypsies
Now file past the guards
In the space where the deuce

And the ace once ran wild
Farewell, Angelina

The sky is falling
I'll see you in a while

See the cross-eyed pirates sitting
Perched in the sun
Shooting tin cans

With a sawed-off shotgun
And the neighbors they clap
And they cheer with each blast

But farewell, Angelina
The sky's changing color
And I must leave fast

King Kong, little elves

On the rooftop they dance
Valentino-type tangos
While the make-up man's hands
Shut the eyes of the dead

Not to embarrass anyone
But farewell, Angelina
The sky is embarrassed
And I must be gone

The machine guns are roaring
And the puppets heave rocks
And fiends nail time bombs
To the hands of the clocks
Call me any name you like
I will never deny it
But farewell, Angelina
The sky is erupting
I must go where it's quiet
