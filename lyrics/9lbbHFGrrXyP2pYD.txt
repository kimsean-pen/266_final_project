I walk my son to the lake
A rippled reflection
Don't you lead my boy to the gate
Keep pulling in the wrong direction

I will not let my love die
I promise a world that's yours
Every little change, you know I'm watching
My little world, I see you fighting

It was a brand new way
Holding me up, suspension
You kept drifting away
I dreamt I held you

I will not let my love die
I promise a world that's yours
Every little change, you know I'm watching
My little world, I see you fighting
