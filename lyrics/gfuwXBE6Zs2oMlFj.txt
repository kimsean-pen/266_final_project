The dark side's calling now
Nothing is real
She'll never know just how I feel
From out of the shadows
She walks like a dream
Makes me feel crazy
Makes me feel so mean

Ain't nothing gonna save you
From a love that's blind
Slip to the dark side
You cross that line
On the dark side, oh yeah
On the dark side, oh yeah

Dark side's calling now
Nothing is real
She'll never know just how I feel
From out of the shadows
She walks like a dream
Makes me feel crazy
Makes me feel so mean

Ain't nothing gonna save you
From a love that's blind
Slip to the dark side
You cross that line

On the dark side, oh yeah
On the dark side, oh yeah

Ain't nothing gonna save you
From a love that's blind
Slip to the dark side
You cross that line

On the dark side, oh yeah
On the dark side, oh yeah
On the dark side, oh yeah
On the dark side, oh yeah
