You took your life on a safe bet
And never doubted your dreams you'd soon forget
But something in your past stayed frozen
And that something keeps you running, running

But how long will you stand for all
that you never, ever really wanted?
The fear keeps haunting your mind it drives you to seek another life

We're only fighting the fire
With all these good intentions
When it comes down to the wire
Will we see we're defenseless

You're looking over your shoulder
For a day that'll never come
And now you're one year older
And not a single thing was done

But now that you're starting to feel so lonely, so empty in your life
Will you stop trying to build that hollow shell you call your disguise

We're only fighting the fire
With all these good intentions
When it comes down to the wire
Will we see we're defenseless

We're only fighting the fire
With all these good intentions
When it comes down to the wire
Will we see we're defenseless

We're only, we're only fighting
We're only, we're only fighting

We're only fighting the fire
With all these good intentions
When it comes down to the wire
Will we see we're defenseless

We're only fighting the fire
With all these good intentions
When it comes down to the wire
Will we see we're defenseless

We're only, we're only fighting
We're only, we're only fighting...
