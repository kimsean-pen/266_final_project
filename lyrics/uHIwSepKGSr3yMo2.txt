Well I'm all restless but I don't care,
You don't, like me much, well me neither,
You go read my mind, like some kind of God,
You, live, let's have you trippin' on the same one you lost,
And you, are on me.
I'm in you, you're on me.

Yea...

Got this sinking feeling, I sank with the tulip,
There's, ain't no habit that I would not defend, It...
Comes back well I don't resend and,
I'm broken, house break you,
You on the mend, when,
You, you're on me.

Yea...

Those who pay, will just pay it again,
Never begin, that's a duel to the end,
Rip me from the breakage and solvents,
Taking over, I'll just take what you got when,
You, you're on me.
I'm in you, you're on me.
You're the truth, I do believe.
I'm in you, you're on me.
Easy.

Gonna follow the light to the love.
Gonna follow the light to the love.
Gonna follow the light to the love.
Gonna follow the light to the love.

Gonna follow the light to the love.
Gonna follow the light to the love.
Gonna follow, gonna follow, gonna follow the light to the love.

Well I've gone restless, well I don't care,
I got, fifteen bucks of savoir faire,
You wanna, step in my way to step it again,
I never break it, I just bend it and I resend.

And you, you're on me.
I'm in you, you're on me.
I'm in you, you're on me.
I'm in you, you're on me.
I'm in you, you're on me.me

Gonna follow the light to the love.
Gonna follow the light to the love.
Gonna follow, gonna follow, follow, the light, to the love.

Gonna follow the light to the love.
Gonna follow the light to the love.
Gonna follow, gonna follow, gonna follow, follow the light to the love.

And you...
