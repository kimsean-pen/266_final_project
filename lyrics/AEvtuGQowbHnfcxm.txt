Born a believer, I walk alone
Can't find a place where I feel at home
Well I'm crazy, but I am sane
I'm guilty, but not to blame
This is my nature, who I am
If you don't like it, here I stand

I wanna keep it, though I eat it
Shove it in my mouth
I can't control my evil I
I wanna keep it, though I eat it
Have a bigger bite
I love you baby, though I hate you
I'm a Double Nature!

Now a heretic, I have become
I've lost my faith in god and man
I am a demon, free from sin
But there's no angel who lets me in
My wheels are rolling, they're rolling fast
Straight outta hell, away from my past

I wanna keep it, though I eat it
Shove it in my mouth
I can't control my evil I
I wanna keep it, though I eat it
Have a bigger bite
I love you baby, though I hate you
I'm a Double Nature!

Now here's a warning, some final words
Turn me down, and you'll burn, burn...
I am awaken, I never sleep
My eyes are bleeding, I'm a freak
I'm short of patience, don't mean no harm
I'm just a guy with a burning heart

I wanna keep it, though I eat it
Shove it in my mouth
I can't control my evil I
I wanna keep it, though I eat it
Have a bigger bite
I love you baby, though I hate you
I'm a Double Nature!
