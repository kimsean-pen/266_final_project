Finding solace
Finding solace somewhere
Seeking comfort
Seeking comfort somewhere

Over and over
Over she calls
Over and over
Over she falls

The black widow
Waiting for her lover
The black widow
Crying in her bedroom

Over and over
Over she calls
Over and over
Over she falls

Pull me out
Pull me out
Pull me out

Seeking comfort
Seeking comfort somewhere

And she cries and she cries
Feeling lonely, she is lonely
And she dies and she dies
Feeling lonely, she is lonely

Recognize, recognize
The black widow, the black widow
Recognize, recognize
The black widow, the black widow
The black widow

Pull me out
Pull me out
Pull me out
