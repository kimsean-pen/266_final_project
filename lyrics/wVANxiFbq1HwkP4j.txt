The temple of bodies, a building with souls
Given the cosmos as we let go
As we let go
Locked in a dance surrounding the moon
This far from the clouds stargasm flows
Stargasm

Lead us by horses on the way to our graves
Father the owl, it is your faith
It is your faith
Awake in the moment, awaken the heart
Look to the spirits, stargasm glows
Stargasm

And then we shift into overdrive
But you're not here
And your legs and the stars collide
You're on fire
You're on fire
You're on fire
You're on fire

Henged from solstice, bohemian grove
Flesh lies the altar as we let go
As we let go
Glasses are empty, the owl has flown
Sever relation like you didn't know
Like you didn't know

And then we shift into overdrive
But you're not here
And your legs and the stars collide
You're on fire
You're on fire
You're on fire
You're on fire
