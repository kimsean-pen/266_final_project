Keep our heads above the water, for air
Bad imitation of other lovers, flare
With harmony beats permanent
Could you break my visions?
Little by heart, the rest decisions

And the longer we go, calling out

And the longer we go, just calling out
Someone that I knew came and took the fight
Something I did was right, just calling out
Baby what you do is gonna be alright

Feed the hungry, leave you nothing
Water waste at the bitter ending
With harmony beats permanent
Can I break your heart?
At least we tried to build up something

But the longer we go, calling out

And the longer we go, just calling out
Someone that I knew came and took the fight
Something I did was right, just calling out
Baby what you do is gonna be alright
