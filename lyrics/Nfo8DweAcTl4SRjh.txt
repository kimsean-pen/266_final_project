I know I haven't been perfect, but give it some time
Cause not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind
And we spend our lives looking for things we can't find
Oh, but not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind

All the days spent on my mind
All the times that I'd say that we'll be together, we'll be together, oh
All the ways to see through my heart
I know the good intentions, they won't be lost forever, won't be lost forever

And I know I haven't been perfect, but give it some time
Cause not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind
And we spend our lives looking for things we can't find
Oh, but not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind

All the hours spent on the line
All the times that you'd say that I never listen, I never listen
Through the conversations we've had 'til 4 AM
You say you want something different, want something different

And I know I haven't been perfect, but give it some time
Cause not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind
And we spend our lives looking for things we can't find
Oh, but not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind
But not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind
Not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind
But not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind
I know I haven't been perfect, but give it some time
Cause not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind
And we spend our lives looking for things we can't find
Oh, but not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind
Not a single day goes by where you don't cross my
Oh, not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind
