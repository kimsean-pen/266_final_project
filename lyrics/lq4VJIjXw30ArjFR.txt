Tell me it's alright, don't tell me 'cause it's fine
Not carin' who you brought, you know we hate you
You can't get into work, they say you might get hurt
I've seen you lookin' worse, I've seen it take ya

Don't see what others see, it don't relate to me
Don't need to bounce me on your knee
And pretend that it's not ya
Go and grit your teeth, yeah, you're grindin' in your sleep
And you're fizzin' underneath and you're feelin' the shakeup

It's a good grief, it's a good grief
A fine belief, a good grief

Grey sky drinking's how we do it up north
Some might say that it's moanin' but it's keepin' us warm
Grey sky drinking's how we do it up north
Some might say that it's moanin' but it's keepin' us warm

But it's keepin' us warm, yeah

On your own today, can't even find the face
To make it to the place where chemicals can take you
Dirty nails and fucked up tales of last night's off-the-rails
Not pretty when you're the oldest in the club

It's a good grief, it's a good grief
A fine belief, a good grief

Grey sky drinking's how we do it up north
Some might say that it's moanin' but it's keepin' us warm
Grey sky drinking's how we do it up north
Some might say that it's moanin' but it's keepin' us warm

Grey sky drinking's how we do it up north
Some might say that it's moanin' but it's keepin' us warm
Grey sky drinking's how we do it up north
Some might say that it's moanin' but it's keepin' us warm

Grey sky drinking's how we do it up north
Some might say that it's moanin' but it's keepin' us warm
Grey sky drinking's how we do it up north
Some might say that it's moanin' but it's keepin' us warm
