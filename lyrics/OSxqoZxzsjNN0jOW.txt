Begin hyper-communication
Restore our vision
Of natural progression
Rise in groves to reclaim the source;
This empty one

We will be the salvation the Mother seeks
Traversing in all directions

Reaching
Expanding

Balance finds it's place
Reaching for the Mother Sun
Rooted to intuition
You are the language

Ever-flowing
Ever-echoing

Drift with the ebb and flow
Ebb and flow. Intuition sets in
Branching out from your seed to seek

Contrived sense of inception;
Intuition speak to me
