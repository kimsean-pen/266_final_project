Your golden lies feed my role
In this forgotten space race under my control
Who's returned from the dead?
Who remains?
(Just to spit it in your face)

You know that I don't want you
And I never did
I don't want you
And I never will

You wanted more than I was worth
And you think I was scared, yeah
And you needed proof
Who really cares anymore?
Who restrains
(Just to spit it in your face)

You know that I don't love you
And I never did
I don't want you
And I never will
