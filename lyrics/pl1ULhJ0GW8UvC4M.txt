Oh, it's time to let it go

The world's got a funny way of turning 'round on you
When a friend tries to stab you right in the face
Losin' faith in everything I thought I hoped and knew
Don't sweat it, set off false pretense

Betray, you're not gonna be willin' to change
Yeah, and it doesn't seem likely to fade
Betray, you're not gonna be willin' to change
'Cause you know

In sacrifice
False pretense, you're letting go
Stop pretending, don't deny
False pretense, you're letting go

All alone you know, you thought you got the best of me
You were wrong and I'm laughing right in your face
I cannot believe you blamed, you were my family
Don't sweat it, set off false pretense

Betray, you're not gonna be willin' to change
Yeah, and it doesn't seem likely to fade
Betray, you're not gonna be willin' to change
'Cause you know

In sacrifice
False pretense, you're letting go
Stop pretending, don't deny
False pretense, you're letting go

Oh, it's time to let it go

I can't seem to understand it how
You've turned out to be so cold
You tried but were caught red-handed
Are you happy with your role?
It's funny to me how
You've turned into such a joke
In sacrifice
False pretense, you're letting go
Stop pretending, don't deny
False pretense, you're letting go
So play the game until you run out
And play the game into my head
