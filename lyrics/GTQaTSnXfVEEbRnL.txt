Working all day for a mean little man
With a clip-on tie and a rub-on tan
He's got me runnin around the office
Like a dog around a track
But when I get back home you're always there to rub my back

Hey Julie look what they're doing to me
Tryin to trip me up
Tryin to wear me down
Julie I swear it's so hard to bear it
And I'd never make it through without you around
No I'd never make it through without you around

Hours on the phone making pointless calls
I got a desk full of paper that means nothing at all
Sometimes I catch myself staring into space
Countin' down the hours til I get to see your face

Hey Julie look what they're doing to me
Tryin to trip me up
Tryin to wear me down
Julie I swear it's so hard to bear it
And I'd never make it through without you around
No I'd never make it through without you around

How did it come to be
That you and I must be
Far away from each other every day
Why must I spend my time
Fillin' up my mind
With facts and figures that never add up anyway
They never add up anyway

Workin all day for a mean little guy
With a bad toupee and a soup-stain tie
He's got me runnin around the office
Like a gerbil on a wheel
He can tell me what to do
But he can't tell me what to feel

Hey Julie look what they're doing to me
Tryin' to trip me up
Tryin' to wear me down
Julie I swear it's so hard to bear it
And I'd never make it through without you around
No I'd never make it through without you around
No I'd never make it through without you around
