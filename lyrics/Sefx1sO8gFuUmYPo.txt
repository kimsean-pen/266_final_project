Take me in your darkest room
Close every window and bolt every door
The very first moment I heard your voice
I'd be in darkness no more

Take me to the most barren desert
A thousand miles from the nearest sea
The very moment I saw your smile
It would be like heaven to me

There's not any mountain too rugged to climb
No desert too barren to cross
Darlin' if you would just show a sign
of love, I could bear with all loss

Take me to Siberia
And the coldest weather of the winter time,
And it would be just like spring in California
As long as I knew you were mine
