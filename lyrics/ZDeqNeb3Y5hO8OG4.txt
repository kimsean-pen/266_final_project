You've got lunch with your sister tomorrow
So we can't be up late
You don't mind if I sleep in
But then I've gotta pack my things
So I stacked a Bukowski novel
On a Blacklisted LP
& this time what it looked like

Was just what it proved to be
You said you needed a stiff drink
To take your mind off things
Hey Jess

I woke up older
Carrying two years in the bags under my eyes
Hey Jess
I watched you wake up & get dressed
You left the room, receded like my hairline
I've been avoiding Rittenhouse like the plague
Because I just can't handle seeing you today
You made this house into a home

Now, I'm a stranger on my street
& as I turned to leave
I caught myself in the mirror to see I aged a year this week
I left a note up on your bed that said

Hey, thanks again for everything you did
Hey Jess
I woke up older
Carrying two years in the bags under my eyes

Hey Jess
I watched you wake up & get dressed
You left the room, receded like my hairline
When John introduced "Woke Up New" in St. Augustine
I knew I wasn't alone
When I woke up here without you
There was nothing to do but pack up & go home
Hey Jess
I woke up older
Carrying two years in the bags under my eyes
Hey Jess
I woke up older
Carrying two years in the bags under my eyes
Hey Jess
I watched you wake up & get dressed
You left the room receded like my hairline
