Always known in all my time
A little left of center now
Reflect as I realise
That all I need is to find
The middle pillar path to sit like the sun, by a star in the sky and just be
Sinners, casting stones at me
I... I stand, not crawling, not falling down

I... I bleed the demons that drag me down
I... I stand (for nothing), not crawling (the center)
Not falling down (of calms within the eye)
I... I'll bleed (for no one), the demons (but myself)
That pull me down (for me and no one else)
Goodbye, sunshine

I've put it out again, sad
I'm over personalities conflicting
I don't need you or anyone by me
I'll just be living my own life
I feel I'm glowing, center grow
Infecting, I feel alive
Shovel dirt over lime
Plant it in myself to sit like a seed
Under covers of earth and just be
Sinners, pointing fingers at me
I... I stand (for nothing)

Not crawling (by myself), not falling down
I... I bleed (for no one)
The demons (but myself), that drag me down
I... I stand (for nothing), not crawling (the center)
Not falling down (of calms within the eye)
I... I'll bleed (for no one), the demons (but myself)
That pull me down (for me and no one else)
Come play kill

(Refuse my body, refuse my shadow)
Stone cold will
(Refuse to lead this, refuse to follow)
Bitter pills
(Refuse to feed this, refuse to swallow, I'm fueled Godless)
Come play, come play
Kill!
Just be, just be

Just be, just be
Just be, just be
I... I stand (for nothing)

Not crawling (by myself), not falling down
I... I bleed (for no one)
The demons (but myself), that drag me down
I... I stand (for nothing), not crawling (the center)
Not falling down (of calms within the eye)
I... I'll bleed (for no one), the demons (but myself)
That pull me down (for me and no one else)
