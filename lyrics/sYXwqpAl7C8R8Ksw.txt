If I'm a good lover after the rush if I'm still around to love
What if I'm still looking for that love the love that keeps my blood
I can see right through you and there's nothing on the other side
I fight with these thoughts every night
If I'm still a good love after the rush
I'm just a girl with a microphone
Singing
