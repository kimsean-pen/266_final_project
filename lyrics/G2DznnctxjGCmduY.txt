On a winters day
when the skies were gray

I went inside
the grove
beside the great oak tree

I found a journal
of one who came before
and bared his soul

Shameless curiousity
fervently reading
uncovering
the tormented soul
hoping

The twisted writer
would return to love me
so we can heal our woes

Everyday
I will stand beneath the oak
waiting for the enigmatic individual

Everyday
I will stand beneath the oak
waiting for the enigmatic individual
by the thaw of spring

My heart will be
chilled by passion
and warmed by hope
in the grove i'll stay
until the day
the diety returns
and soothes my bones
Shameless curiousity
fervently reading
uncovering
the tormented soul
hoping

The twisted writer
would return to love me
so we can heal our woes

Everyday
I will stand beneath the oak
waiting for the enigmatic individual
