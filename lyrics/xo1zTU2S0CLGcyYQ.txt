Oh, what a situation that don't wanna stop
It's the drugstore soul boy over the dub
With the sweetest inspiration, we don't wanna stop

It's the money or stop
It's the money or stop
It's the money or stop
It's the money or stop
It's the money or stop
It's the money or stop
It's the money or stop
(It's yeah) it's the money or stop
