You know we tried to make you understand
We tried to make you realise
Her fame is down and time is up
But somehow it don't seem enough
Cos the world wouldn't listen anymore

CHORUS
Caught by social evil
Wasn't streetwise after all
Was she there at all?
Pictures in the mirror
Pictures she never knew
Pictures in the mirror
Always reflecting you
Not such an ordinary life
Pictures in the mirror (twice)

The sun goes down
The moon appears on the horizon
The streets are bare
She walks alone

REPEAT CHORUS
