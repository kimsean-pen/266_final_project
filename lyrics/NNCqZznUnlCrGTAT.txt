I want to bring you all that is in my heart
I want to give you my everything
But I've failed you
I've failed you so many times
How can I stand here
How can I stand here before you

How can I stand here before you
When I begin to steal
What only belongs to you
What only belongs to you

I am able to bring you
Nothing that isn't already yours
I am so ashamed
I am so ashamed
Of what I ever called my own
Take what I have
Take these broken remains
What can I give to you
That you don't already deserve

You laid down your life
When I refused to give mine
