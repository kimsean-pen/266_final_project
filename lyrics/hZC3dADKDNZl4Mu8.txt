Just tell me why, why
It's the remix
You'll see
Tell me why

We've always been so close together
Doing things that only best friends do
Always there for one another
Through the bad times and the good
The other night you held me close
Need to know, did we just cross the line
This other side just feels so right
Won't you tell me...

Why? Why?
Why do friends and lovers take so long
Now that we've come around
We finally found a love forever strong
Why? Why?
Why are you so near and yet so far
How could I be so blind
When all the time I was in your heart

Here we go, here we go
Move to the beat and go with the flow
Tom-tom gimme tom gimme more
Move with the beat and with the tempo

For so long I've been searching
For that love that I can call my own
Now I know I was only waiting
For the face I've always known
I believe what heaven is, just like this
Every time we kiss
And deep inside I feel so high
Won't you tell me...

Why? Why?
Why do friends and lovers take so long
Now that we've come around
We finally found a love forever strong
Why? Why?
Why are you so near and yet so far
How could I be so blind
When all the time I was in your heart

As we live with integrity
Deliver the beat with Ivor PB
We young respond with celebrity
M-m-move P-p-party

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Eh,
Warm and tender touch

Oh, eh,
Every time, every time we kiss

Eh,
Warm and tender touch

Oh, eh,
Every time we kiss

When I stop and think about it
How did I ever live without
Your warm and tender touch
I need it so much

Why? Why?
Why do friends and lovers take so long
Now that we've come around
We finally found a love forever strong
Why? Why?
Why are you so near and yet so far
How could I be so blind
When all the time I was in your heart

Why were you so near to me
When all the time I could not see
Finally found a love so strong
Can't wait, can't wait, just carry on

Why, why, why, why
Just tell me why

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Eh,
Warm and tender touch

Oh, eh,
Every time, every time we kiss

Eh,
Warm and tender touch

Oh, eh,
Every time we kiss

Eh
