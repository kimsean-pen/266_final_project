We've grown
Should've known
All alone
We wait

Single file
A new desire
And all the while
We wait

I hear the warnings on the wing
I don't believe in anything

Cast aside
This great divide
With foolish pride
We wait

Off the trail
We eat our tail
I can fail
I wait and wait

I hear the warnings on the wing
I don't believe in anything
I hear the voices rise and sing
But I don't believe in anything

Used to
Believe in you
Yet all we do
Is wait
