Sometimes tears say all
There is to say
Sometimes your first scars wont ever fade, away
Tried to break my heart, well it's broke
Tried to hang me high, well I'm choked
Wanted rain on me, well I'm soaked
Soaked to the skin
It's the end where I begin
It's the end where I begin
Sometimes we don't learn from our mistakes
Sometimes we've no choice but to walk
Away, away
Tried to break my heart, well it's broke
Tried to hang me high, well I'm choked
Wanted rain on me, well I'm soaked
Soaked to the skin
It's the end where I begin
It's the end where I begin
Now I'm alive
And my ghosts are gone
I've shed all the pain
I've been holding on
The cure for a heart
Is to move along, is to move along
So move along
Now I'm alive
And my ghosts are gone
I've shed all the pain
I've been holding on
The cure for a heart
Is to move along, is to move along
So move along
Now I'm alive
And my ghosts are gone
I've shed all the pain
I've been holding on
What don't kill a heart
Only makes it strong
Sometimes tears say all
There is to say
Sometimes your first scars wont ever fade, away
Tried to break my heart, well it's broke
Tried to hang me high, well I'm choked
Wanted rain on me, well I'm soaked
Soaked to the skin
It's the end
End where I, end where I
End where I
It's the end
End where I, end where I
End where I begin
Sometimes we don't learn
From our mistakes
Sometimes we've no
Choice but to walk
Away, away
