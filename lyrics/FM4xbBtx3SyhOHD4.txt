I am a man
You fell down from that apple tree
The other day with me

We had already forgotten
We one day crawled up
From the sea

Imagine now
If we one day could build
A flying contraption and see the world

What if we could somehow
Store knowledge in a cloud
Draw a smiling face on the moon
Find the meaning of life

Riding the crest of our time
With bravado, soon complete
Will we see a new one rise behind us
A new chance, a new world

Our wave
It's about to break
And we're about to dive in the void
It echoes our fall
Our paean to avarice

I think we're closer to an animal
Every day, till we fall...

Can you believe
We have all those eyes high in the sky
And we can now see the world

One thing truly makes me blind
The wisdom of hindsight
The eye in my own hand

Riding the crest of our time
With bravado, soon complete
Will we see a new one rise behind us
A new chance, a new world

I think I'm closer to an animal
Every day, till I fall...

If you want it all
You can have it all
But greed raises oceans too

When the glacier of
Our broken dreams
Melts in your champagne glass

Someone knocks on your door
Four times...
Sand in your hour glass

Every grain is a day falling
Finding it's rightful place

If you want it all
You can have it all
But greed raises oceans too

When the glacier of
Your broken dreams
Melts in your champagne glass

Do we need it all
We can have it all
Our greed will raise oceans soon

And the glacier of
Our human dream
Gone with the champagne glass
In the sea

"I am a man
In the grand scheme of things
Only minutes have passed
Since I crawled up from the sea
But already
I've built a flying contraption
And seen the world
I've drawn a smiley face on the moon
And stored knowledge in a cloud
...What a wonderful gift our mind is.
But why am I using ot
To destroy this beautiful planet...
My only home.
If it defines me, if it makes me a human,
I need to get closer to my inner animal."
