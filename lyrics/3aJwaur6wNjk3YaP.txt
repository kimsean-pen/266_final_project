This is a night like none before
I knew it when you open up the door
With the look to paint the sky
Let me read between the lines in your eyes
Tonight

Its the event we dreamed about
Where we whispered all the voice they're shouting out
And now it's one, two, three, four
Tonight

I'm with you with the lights go down
Take my hand I'm all yours now
I know you're the only one
That would never leave me out

I'm with you with the lights go down
'Cause you're the one that...
Only you're the one that...

The only one who keeps it here
In each moment as the voices disappear
The audience stands the band begins
And it's one, two, three, four
Tonight

I'm with you with the lights go down
Take my hand I'm all yours now
I know you're the only one
That would never leave me out

I'm with you with the lights go down
Take my hand I'm all yours now
'Cause you're the one that...

Only you're the one...
Only you're the one...

I'm with you with the lights go down
Take my hand I'm all yours now
I know you're the only one
That would never leave me out

I'm with you with the lights go down
Take my hand I'm all yours now
'Cause you're the one that...
Only you're the one that...
You're the one that...
Only you're the one that...
