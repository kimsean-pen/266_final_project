How come I feel you here?
Has my time run out?
Tonight I will face you once again

Is it like they always say?
Will I see it all again?
An infinite loop of memories
Spinning and spinning into nothingness
So far apart from the state of the living
Is it anything like I am picturing it?

And if my time's up
Then let me tell you I have no regrets
Just hear me out now
I can finally let go
I'm not afraid anymore
My love, don't mourn me
Because I'll always be there for you

Lights flash before my eyes
A mystery unknown
Will your sight feel like fire?
Illuminate

Take my hand, lead me out
No matter how this ends
I'm done with my amends
So will you solemnly embrace me?

And if my time's up
Then let me tell you I have no regrets
Just hear me out now
I can finally let go
I'm not afraid anymore
My love, don't mourn me
Because I'll always be there
