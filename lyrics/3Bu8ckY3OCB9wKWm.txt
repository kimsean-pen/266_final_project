Nice to meet you
Tell me what's your name, what you want to do
Can I keep you?
Until you need something from somebody new

Love to love me when I'm high
Love to hate me when I cry
Praise me when I'm by your side
And then you'll say goodbye
Then you'll say goodbye

C'mon
Lie to me, lie to me
Tell me that you would
Die for me, die for me
So will you stay with me and we can play pretend?
And you can be my next imaginary friend

Great to know you
Was I what you wanted, was I fun to use?
A doll made for you
That you can tear apart whenever you choose

Love to love me when I'm high
Love to hate me when I cry
Praise me when I'm by your side
And then you'll say goodbye
Then you'll say goodbye

C'mon
Lie to me, lie to me
Tell me that you would
Die for me, die for me
So will you stay with me and we can play pretend?
And you can be my next imaginary friend

C'mon
Lie to me, lie to me
Tell me that you would
Die for me, die for me
So will you stay with me and we can play pretend?
And you can be my next imaginary friend

Nice to meet you
You can be my next imaginary friend
