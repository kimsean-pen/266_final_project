I'll start out fresh
A brand new beginning
It goes like this
So I never finish anything
And all of this was totally worthless

If I get through
Or we got to
Or let's just say a year or so
'Cause that's the way these days seem to go and go
And I just feel so helpless

Don't tell me to just calm down
Now there's a shortcut right under my skin
And all I want is to freak out
But my apologies are worn so thin

I'm sorry, friend
With all these fucking problems
I should pay you rent
Doors are open in the cellblock of my filthy head
And these days I smoke less

Don't tell me to just calm down
Now there's a shortcut right under my skin
And all I want is to freak out
But my apologies are worn so thin
Yeah, that's a quality I've worn so thin

When we empty out like paper cups
Yeah, parking lot
It's hard to feel like anything but garbage, wasted
Yeah, we empty out (empty out)
And we empty out (empty out)
Until there's nothing left (nothing left)
'Til there's nothing left (nothing left)

Don't tell me to just calm down
Now there's a shortcut right under my skin
And all I want is to freak out
But my apologies are worn so thin
Don't tell me to just calm down
Now there's a shortcut right under my skin
And all I want is to freak out
But my apologies are worn so thin
Yeah, that's a quality I've worn so thin
