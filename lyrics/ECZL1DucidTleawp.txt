Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
You don't care so you say, 'Cause it's
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Not to believe is what you believe
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
It's all a dream in the daylight
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
And at night, it's a nightmare
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Think too much and you go to jail
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Stupid police won't let you pay any bail
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Sitting around and you're wasting my time
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Once you were a good friend of mine
