Going out of my mind these days,
Like I'm walking 'round in a haze.
I can't think straight, I can't concentrate,
and I need to shave.

I go to work and I look tired.
The boss man said, "Son, you're gonna get fired. This ain't your style."
And behind my coffee cup I just smiled.

*Chorus*
What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in.
Spending all of my time with you, there's nothing else I'd rather do.
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in, 'cause I can't get enough.
Can't stop the hunger for your love, what a beautiful, what a beautiful
mess I'm in.

This morning put salt in my coffee. I put my shoes on the wrong feet
(I'm losing my mind I swear). It might be the death of me, but I don't
care.

*Chorus*
What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in.
Spending all of my time with you, there's nothing else I'd rather do.
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in 'cause I can't get enough.
Can't stop the hunger for your love, what a beautiful, what a beautiful
mess I'm in.

*Bridge*
Is it your eyes, is it your smile? All I know is that you're driving me wild!

*Chorus*
What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in.
Spending all of my time with you, there's nothing else I'd rather do.
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in 'cause I can't get enough.
Can't stop the hunger for your love, what a beautiful, what a beautiful.

*Chorus*
What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in.
Spending all of my time with you, there's nothing else I'd rather do.
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in 'cause I can't get enough.
Can't stop the hunger for your love, what a beautiful, what a beautiful
mess I'm in.
