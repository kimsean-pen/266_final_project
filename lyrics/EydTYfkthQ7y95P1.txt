Above the clouds
We flew to heaven
Through the eye of the storm
And into to the light

I see you
You're everywhere I go
In everything I do

I dreamed a thousand years
Just to be here where everything is right
Scrape those screamless skies
Defy the limits and fly

I see you
You're everywhere I go
In everything I do

I see you
You're everywhere I go
In everything I do
