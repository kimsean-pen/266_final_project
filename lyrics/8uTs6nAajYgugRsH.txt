Smile like a sun
Back over time
Crazy on you
Pleasure is mine

I love you, I love you, I love you
What's your name?
I love you, I love you, I love you
What's your name?

Here come through it
Giving it up
Going too far
Try understand

I love you, I love you, I love you
What's your name?
I love you, I love you, I love you
What's your name?

Whisper kiss me here
I'll tell you what I fear
Whisper kisses up here
I'll tell you what I fear

Come on home
Just ain't fair
Name of rock 'n' roll
Where love dies

Couldn't find a soul
Tell it like it is
Deep down inside
Drunken butterfly

I love you, I love you, I love you
What's your name?
I love you, I love you, I love you
What's your name?

I love you, I love you, I love you
What's your name?
I love you, I love you, I love you
What's your name?
