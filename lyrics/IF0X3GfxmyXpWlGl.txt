Music was my first love
And it'll be my last
Music of the future
And music of the past.
To live without my music
Would be impossible to do
In this world of troubles
my music pulls me through

Music was my first love
And it'll be my last
Music of the future
And music of the past
And music of the past
And music of the past

Music was my first love
And it'll be my last
Music of the future
And music of the past.
To live without my music
Would be impossible to do
'cause in this world of troubles
my music pulls me through
