Don't come looking for me
I just want to be free
So don't come looking for me

I don't wanna be found
I just wanna run away
and learn to be free
No No No

Go Go Go

My eye watch it burn

Point out no return
Will I ever learn
(No No No)

Come in over me
Since I've urgency
Think it's time to leave
(Go Go Go)
And I feel like I could fly

Don't come looking for me

I don't want to be found
I just want to be free
So don't come looking for me

I don't wanna be found
I just wanna run away
and learn to be free
Find it over ground

I am swallowed whole
The eath takes my home
So adventure happened

they drift the past away from me
I will never compromise again
(No No No)

Cause I feel like I could fly

Don't come looking for me
I don't want to be found
I just want to be free

So don't come looking for me
I don't wanna be found
I just wanna run away
and learn to be free

No No No 3Ã—
To be free 2x

I just want to rund away
and learn to be free
I'm limitless
I'm limitless
I'm limitless
I'm limitless
...
Don't come looking for me
I don't want to be found
I just want to be free
So don't come looking for me
I don't wanna be found
I just wanna run away
and learn to be free
To be free
To be free
I just want to run away
and learn to be free
