What do you expect from all the shit you say?
How will you amend all the lies that you spread every day?
When we'll be face to face
How will you pretend that you didn't want to play the game?
While you just made the rules

Is that the best that you can do?
No one cares
I'm more than glad that I don't know you
Will you grow?

Get up, open your eyes, you're just like everyone
You waste all your time faking your smiles
Wake up, look at your life, you don't need to stalk mine
Here is my advice, get the fuck out

Cause no one cares about what you say
Talk is cheap your words won't stay
Who are you to say that "what have you done, done in your whole life"
No matter what you believe in
Or how you work to keep it real
Anything you've done now will be destroyed by the same ones

They do the same to anyone
How do you feel now?
Watch out what you say

Get up, open your eyes, you're just like everyone
You waste all your time faking your smiles
Wake up, look at your life, you don't need to stalk mine
Here is my advice, get the fuck out

You can't take words back
How can you ignore that?
This is all the same
All you haters gonna hate
Go!

I'm sick of your pride
Pride
I'm sick of your pride
I'm sick of your pride
I'm sick of your pride

When will you amend all the lies that you spread everyday?
Why would you pretend that you didn't wanna play the game?

Get up, open your eyes, you're just like everyone
You waste all your time faking your smiles
Get up, open your eyes, you're just like everyone
You waste all your time faking your smiles
Wake up, look at your life, you don't need to stalk mine
Here is my advice, get the fuck out
