Your head's a see saw
It sees and then some
And i'll get some extra fingers growing
Yeah get some extra fingers growing
In, in, in

Your eyes are ramble
Light of candle
Now get some amber fluid flowing
Get some amber fluid flowing

Your lips are greying
And your mouth is saying
Get some other diamonds sparkling
Get some other people talking

You young dumb ripe thing
You're brave and you're antsy
You strong lunged new thing
You're here to get this baby dancing
You're here to get this baby dancing
You're here to get this baby dancing
You're here to get this baby dancing
You're here to get this baby dancing
You're here to get this baby dancing

I always knew
I always knew
I always knew
