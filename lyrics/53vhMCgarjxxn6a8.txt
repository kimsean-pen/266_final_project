It was bad, called obscene
And the rich were so mean
Stately homes for the Lords
Golden lawns, village green
Victoria was my queen

Victoria, Victoria, Victoria

I was born, lucky me
In the land that I love
Though I'm poor, I am free
When I go I shall fight
For this land I willl die
Let her sun never set on

Victoria, Victoria, Victoria

Canada to India
Australia to Cornwall
Singapore to Hong Kong
From the West to the East
From the rich to the poor
Victoria loved them all

Victoria, Victoria, Victoria
