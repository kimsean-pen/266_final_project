The weight
Of a simple human emotion
Weighs me down
More than the tank ever did

The pain
It's determined and demanding
To ache, but I'm okay

And I don't want to let this go
I don't want to lose control
I just want to see the stars with you
And I don't want to say goodbye
Someone tell me why
I just want to see the stars with you

You lost, a part of your existence
In the war, against yourself
Oh, the lights,
They light up in lights of sadness
Telling you, it's time to go

And I don't want to let this go
I don't want to lose control
I just want to see the stars with you
And I don't want to say goodbye
Someone tell me why
I just want to see the stars with you

Don't give it up just yet
Stay grand for one more minute
Don't give it up just yet
Stay grand

No, don't give it up just yet
Stay grand for one more minute
Don't give it up just yet
Stay grand

No, don't give it up just yet
Stay grand for one more minute
Don't give it up just yet
Stay grand

And I don't want to let this go
I don't want to lose control
I just want to see the stars with you
And I don't want to say goodbye
Someone tell me why
I just want to see the stars with you
With you
