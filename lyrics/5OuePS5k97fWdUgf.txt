The more I fight, the more I work
The more I dig into the dirt
To be fed up, to be let down
To somehow turn it all around

But then fate knocks me to my knees
And sets new heights beyond my reach
Below the earth, below concrete
The whole world shackled to my feet

Then it falls away into the great escape
Over walls and weights
This anti-gravity taking over me

And far below, the carnivores
are looking up to where I soar
Above the clouds, above the storm
Above the earth I am transformed

The energy has set me free
And pulled me through the galaxy
I've risen up beyond the sky
I am awake, I am alive

As it falls away into the great escape
Over walls and weights
This anti-gravity
Let it fly through the universe
Into the outer space
Over walls and weights
This anti-gravity taking over me

I won't come down
If you wanna break free
You know where to find me
If you wanna break free
You know where You know where.
If you wanna break free
You know where to find me
If you wanna break free
You know where.

Let it fall away into the great escape
Over walls and weights
This anti-gravity
Let it fly through the universe
Into the outer space
Over walls and weights
This anti-gravity taking over me
If you wanna break free
You know where to find me
If you wanna break free
You know where You know where.
