You are the sun to the earth
You are the light of this world
Won't you see
Why won't you see.

You are the hand I can't reach
You are the words I can't speak
Won't you sing
Why won't you sing.

I will walk till I've no shadow.
I will walk till I've no shadow.

You twist the light in your hands
It moves and sparks
It's all the love you can give.
Reasons fall from every storm that you lift.
We move through the dark
Helpless

You are the quiet in my soul
You are the pieces of gold
Won't you shine
Why won't you shine.

I will walk till I've no shadow.
I will walk till I've no shadow.
I will walk till I've no shadow.
