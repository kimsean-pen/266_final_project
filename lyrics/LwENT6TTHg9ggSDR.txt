There's rain on my window
But I'm thinking of you
Tears on my pillow
But I will come through
Josephine
I'll send you all my love
And every single step, I'll take
I'll take for you

Josephine

I'll send you all my love, babe
Josephine

I'll send you all my love, babe

Now there's a storm on my radar
But I can still fly

Oh, and you are the reason
The blue in my sky
Josephine
I'll send you all my love, babe
Josephine
A life without meaning
I was walking away
In the coldest of winters
Night becomes day
Josephine
I'll send you all my love
And every single step that I'll take
I'll take for you, my
Josephine
I'll send you all my love, babe
Josephine
I'll send you all my love, babe
Oh when I'm far away
(I'll send you all my love)
Oh, so far away
I'll send you all my love
Josephine
(I'll send you all my love)
I'll send you all my love
Josephine
(I'll send you all my love)
Josephine
(I'll send you all my love)
Josephine
(I'll send you all my love)
Josephine
(I'll send you all my love)
I'll send you all my love
Josephine
