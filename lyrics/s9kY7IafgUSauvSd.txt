You're a hotshot 10 o'clock ready for the night to rock
Tick tock waking me up time to let it run
The way you walk talk like you're bad luck
And you never wanna stop
Never turn you down right now I'm getting it on
Party's on let it run

You're in town having fun
Cause you're looking for chance to run
You're the fame scream my name
Gonna know it now the game is on
Party's on, let it run
It's 21

Hit the jackpot gather round this is how we break it down
Hit me me once again 21 is my only friend
The night is young roulette is going round
Play my favourite sound
All on the red board is set so let me spin it again
Party's on let it run

You're in town having fun
Cause you're looking for a chance to run
You're the fame scream my name
Gonna know it now the game is on
Party's on, let it run
It's 21

Come along tag along we invite you as we bring it on
Feel my heartbeat rising let's never hit a dead end
Clock has turned 5am but Tomorrow we will get back on
This chance will never come again so drop the mic
The party's on. Let it run!

You're in town having dun
Cause you're looking for a chance to run
You're the fame scream my name
Gonna know it now the game is on
Party's on, let it run
It's 21
