Well, we talked and talked and carried on from
Sundown to the break of dawn
We put the needle on the line
It just kept skippin'
And then I realized all the time I was wastin'
Tryin' to mend a broken situation
Daydreamin' of leavin'
I only had to do it
And now it's done
You still call everyday
To no avail
I never have an answer
I never seem to be there for you
But there's only so many ways that one can
Look at a given situation
And I wish you all the love in this world and beyond
I hope you get the point
I hope you get the point
I hope you get the point
The thrill is gone
I hope you get the point
I think our love is done
Well, I was feelin' sympathetic
But still sorry for myself
Flyin' blind, I really knew you weren't listenin'
So I'm tryin' to tell you plainly how I'm feelin' day to day
And I'm so sorry now that you ain't feelin' the same way
Now there's only so ways that one can
Look at a given situation
And I wish you all the love in this world and beyond
I guess, you get the point
I guess, you get the point
I guess, you get the point
The thrill is gone, gone, gone
I hope you get the point
I hope you get the point
I hope you get the point
Our love is done
