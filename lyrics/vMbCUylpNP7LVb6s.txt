You and me used to be close
And right now that means the most to me
One time you were my friend
Feels like the further we grow
The more I feel like this ain't how
It's supposed to be
I'm at my wits end
(When it's over)

I ain't do it alone
Stop throwing stones at me
I didn't string you along
Don't pin it all on me
I never prayed for love
Stuck in my ways too much
I didn't trade you up
I held my weight enough

It's never over til' it's over
Over til' it's over
It's never over til' its over
Over til' it's over
Even then it's never really over when It's over
Over when it's over
Never really over when It's over
Over when It's over (When It's over)

How can you make me feel a way
And now there's nothing left to say
Cause it was all in vain
I just miss us
But there is no us no more
You say it's me I say it's your fault
But since you're not the same no more
Tell me what you came here for?

I ain't do it alone
Stop throwing stones at me
I didn't string you along
Don't pin it all on me
I never prayed for love
Stuck in my ways too much
I didn't trade you up
I held my weight enough

It's never over til' It's over
Over til' It's over
It's never over til' It's over
Over til' It's over
Even then It's never really over when It's over
Over when It's over
Never really over when It's over
Over when it's over
(When It's over)
(When It's over)
