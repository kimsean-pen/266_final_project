I woke up one morning
All my fingers rotten
I woke up a dying man without a chance

I came to your window
Threw a stone and waited
At the door a stranger stood
The stranger's voice said nothing good
I turned to walk the frozen ground alone
All the way home

Wide-eyed walker
Do not wander
Do not wander
Through the dawn

Both my eyes are fading
No light in the evening
Planted like a seed in sand and drowned in rain

Watch you for an hour
He kept you beneath him
He kept you on lock and key
He paid the wage you sent to me
And waste the day so idly alone
All the way home

Wide-eyed walker
Do not wander
Do not wander
Through the dawn
Wide-eyed walker
Do not wander
Do not wander
Through the dawn
