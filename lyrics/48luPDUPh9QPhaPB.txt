Give me something real, something to hold on
Give me something to make us strong
I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for your love
I keep seeking, I keep seeking love

Look in your eyes for a little while
That you remind me if you'd be mine
'Cause I keep falling, I'm still falling for your love
I keep falling, falling into your world

If you love every kiss
Every time we touch lips
My love always is
Every time to remiss
If you love every cry
Every time till we die
If you love every look
In your bright blue eyes

Sometimes we can say just the way we feel
We're hiding, seeking till we reveal
I'm falling, I keep falling for your love
I'm still falling, falling into this world

If you love every kiss
Every time we touch lips
My love always is
Every time to remiss
If you love every cry
Every time till we die
If you love every look
In your bright blue eyes

In your eyes, in your eyes
In your bright, in your bright, in your bright blue eyes

If you love every look in your bright blue eyes
