I saw you playing to a crowd
Everyone was singing out
You were smiling, you were sick
They're all saying that you're "It"

I can tell you're in pain through the sound of screaming girls
Calling your name, calling your name
I can tell you're in pain, look around
Bet you feel alone, such a shame
(You don't do it for the love)

You only do it for the crowd
That's not what it's about
You just do it for the crowd
You do it for the crowd
You love to hear him sing
Hear him sing
You love to hear him sing
Hear him sing

Rose petals, rose petals thrown at you
Heavy metal, heavy metal in your red leather
Got a glove on like you're Michael, yeah
Bet you wish you were an idol
Love letters, love letters thrown at you
Never a read 'em, never a read 'em you should know better
So deep with your tattoo
Bet you think no-one understands you

I can tell you're in pain through the sound of screaming girls
Calling your name, calling your name
I can tell you're in pain, look around
Bet you feel alone, such a shame
(You don't do it for the love)

You only do it for the crowd
That's not what it's about
You just do it for the crowd
You do it for the crowd
You love to hear him sing
Hear him sing
You love to hear him sing
Hear him sing

Love, I can hear them calling
Love, can't keep 'em waiting
Feel the lights shining down on me
You're in the front row
Sold out show

Time to do it for the crowd
Do it for the crowd
Watch me do it for the crowd
Do it for the crowd
