I don't like you but I love you seems
That I'm always thinking of you
Oh, oh, oh, you treat me badly
I love you madly
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me baby
I don't want you but I need you
Don't want to kiss you but I need you
Oh, oh, oh, you do me wrong now
My love is strong now
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me baby
I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me

I want to leave you
Don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend another day here
Oh, oh, oh, I want to stick
Now I can't quite
Now you really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
Baby, I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
You really got a hold on me
I said you really got a hold on me
You know you really got a hold on me
You know you really got a hold on me.
