Nobody promised you, it would be easy, not even fair
But a lot of people said, "Lean on me", and they weren't there
If it's any consolation, they're all the same
And if you lose your head, you lose the game

And it's all an uphill run
You know it ain't much fun
You know we're all the same
Turn you round again, again

Everyone said, "Come over here and be like me"
I didn't want to know, ain't no place to be
If it's any consolation, you're all the same
But it's a different face, with a different name

But it's all an uphill run
You know it ain't much fun
You know we're just the same
Turn up and then hate, again

I'm gonna tell you something, you must believe
I've got a hat full of jokes, waiting up my sleeve
Forget cancellation, I know the game
It's a different face but the name's the same

And it's all an uphill run
You know it ain't much fun
You know we're all the same
And I'll turn you round again, again
