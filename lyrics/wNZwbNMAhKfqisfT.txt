Everything has turned around
I was standing by the passing train
Might've coughed in the rain
Dropped a dollar down the gutter drain
Everything has turned around
Been waiting for a little change
When finally it came
I just waited for another
Waited for another

You know I'm the changer
The rearranger
I'm always a stranger
And a liar
Got a tongue on fire
I ought to cut it off
I ought to cut it off
And when I do, when I do
I'm gonna let you know
Gonna, gonna, gonna let you know

'Cause everything has turned around
Now I'm sleeping in a garden bed
Tryin' to clear my head
Sittin',, waitin' to be fed
'Cause everything has turned around
Two ears above the budding grass
Let the hours pass
Always gonna catch the next one
Gonna catch the next one

You know I'm a waiter
The hesitater
I will get to it later
But I'm a liar
Got a tongue on fire
Ought to cut it off
Ought to cut it off
Ought to cut it off

You know I'm the changer
The rearranger
I'm always a stranger
I'm always a stranger
I'm always a stranger
And the liar
Got a tongue on fire
I ought to cut it off
I ought to cut it off
And when I do, when I do
I'm gonna let you know

(And I'm a liar, got a tongue on fire)
Then I think I'm gonna let you know
(I ought to cut it off, I ought to cut it off, I ought to cut it off)
Then I think I'm gonna let you know
(I ought to cut it off, I ought to cut it off, I ought to cut it off)

You know I'm a changer
The rearranger
I'm always a stranger
You know I'm a waiter
A hesitater
Gonna get to it later
