Psychotic, barney Mika rap

You were the popular one, the popular chick
It is what it is, now I'm popular, bitch
Standing on the field with your pretty pom-pom
Now you're working at the movies selling popular corn

I could have been a mess, but I never went wrong
'Cause I'm putting down my stories in a popular song
I said I'm putting down my story in a popular song

My problem, I never was a model
I never was a scholar, but you were always popular
You were singing all the songs I don't know
Now you're in the front row, 'cause my song is popular

Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were

Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do is be true to you
That's all you ever need to know

Catch up, 'cause you've got an awful long way to go
Catch up, 'cause you've got an awful long way to go

Always on the lookout for someone to hate
Picking on me like a dinner plate
I hid during classes and in between them
Dunk me in the toilets, now it's you that cleans them

You tried to make me feel bad with the shits you do
It ain't so funny when the joke's on you
Oh, the joke's on you? And everyone's laughing
Got everyone clapping, asking

How come you look so cool?
'Cause that's the only thing that I learned at school
So that's the only thing that I learned at school

My problem, I never was a model
I never was a scholar, but you were always popular
You were singing all the songs I don't know
Now you're in the front row, 'cause my song is popular

Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were

Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do is be true to you
That's all you ever need to know

Catch up, 'cause you've got an awful long way to go
Catch up, 'cause you've got an awful long way to go

Before the next time that you call him crazy
Lazy, a faggot or that fugayzee
Here's the one thing that's so amazing
It ain't a bad thing to be a loser, baby

All you ever need to know
You're ony ever who you were
All you ever need to know
You're ony ever who you were
All you ever need to know

Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were

Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do is be true to you
That's all you ever need to know

You're ony ever who you were
All you ever need to know
You're ony ever who you were (That's all you ever need to know)

All you ever need to know
You're ony ever who you were
All you ever need to know
You're ony ever who you were (That's all you ever need to know)

All you ever need to know
