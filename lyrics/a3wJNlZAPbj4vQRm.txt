All around you is to feel and watch you
They make patterns to peel the sound
And I find it a pain that goes along
With being in chaos's order
I've a field now to realize in
Watch the main jump
It has fears of you being there rising up
Like who you're introduced to saying goodbye
All again and you're always free now
I didn't fake this so you could fade away
I've been careful to take what I've spent
I remember every end
I'm pretending to face something
I've been looking straight in it's eye
Moments have you to play around with
Cuz inside actions there's no time
I'll evade you to create a reason
I hear you inside a space
An instant is forever now
A future fluctuates
Glimpse your motion
Sitting down
It's like framing a pear
Or saving sounds
I defy you to realize it
How a shattering creates a song
I've been used to help the body
Of work that will never be
A lapse of the most confused kind
Has reserved feelings jumping around
The first type plays around the souls
They have fun with everyone you know
A knot only found
Never made
Everyday we reload feelings
When we play
