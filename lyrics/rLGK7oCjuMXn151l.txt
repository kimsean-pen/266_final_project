It seems so obvious
There's something up with us
I swear I feel it
From across the room
So can I ask you this
Not to be forward miss
But I think I'll kill myself
If I never knew

What do I have to do
To get inside of you?
To get inside of you?
'Cause I love the way you move
When I'm inside of you
When I'm inside of you

Just ask and I will do
Anything you want me to
There is no limit
To how far I will go
And I'm sure I can't pretend
To be a gentleman
But before I began
I just gotta know
(Just gotta know)
(Just gotta know)

What do I have to do
To get inside of you?
To get inside of you?
'Cause I love the way you move
When I'm inside of you
When I'm inside of you

For now I'll play the game
And I'm waiting for your move
But I've got to say
That I never lose

What do I have to do
To get inside of you?
To get inside of you?
What do I have to do
To get inside of you?
To get inside of you?
'Cause I love the way you move
When I'm inside of you
When I'm inside of you
When I'm inside of you
You
You

When I'm inside of you
