I saw you in the picture, I saw you play the part
This ain't nodisco
There's thousand watching you
You take this too far
This ain't nodisco
Sometimes when I wonder if you're taking a chance
This ain't nodisco and you know how to dance

Move me disco
Baby don't you let go
This ain't nodisco

Part one, act one
Everyone pretend
This ain't nodisco
This more a story
And we're reaching the end (the end)
This ain't nodisco
Always makes me happy when you're taking a chance
This ain't nodisco and you know how to dance

Move me disco
Baby don't you let go
This ain't nodisco

I saw you in the picture, I saw you play the part
This ain't nodisco
There's thousand watching you
You take this too far
This ain't nodisco
Sometimes when I wonder if you're taking a chance
This ain't nodisco and you know how to dance

Move me disco
Baby don't you let go
Move me disco
Baby don't you let go
Move me disco
Baby don't you let go
This ain't nodisco
