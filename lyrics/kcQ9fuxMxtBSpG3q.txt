Free As A Bird,
It's the next best thing to be free as a bird.
Home, home and dry.
Like a homing bird I fly, as a bird on wings.
Whatever happened to the life that we once knew
Can we really live without each other
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much
It always made me feel so
Free as a bird,
It's the next best thing to be free as a bird.
Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird I fly, as a bird on wings
Whatever happened to the life that we once knew
Always made me feel so

Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Free as a bird.
