I've been losing myself in anger, so much broken by the rage
Nothing can take my mind off, how to make them pay
Killing myself for nothing, and the pain won't go away
Losing myself to madness, and the game's been played

If I could turn the hands of time
I would, but here I am

Tell me, why am I still here when it's all gone?
I'm living with the ghosts of yesterday
Tell me, why am I still trying to hold on?
I've gotta tear it down to let it go

I'm too tired to keep on trying, but I'm spellbound till the end
Knowing that there's no closure for my wars inside
I've buried the good and evil, only memories left behind
I am the one still standing, I will live to tell

If I could turn the hands of time
I would, but here I am, here I am

Tell me, why am I still here when it's all gone?
I'm living with the ghosts of yesterday
Tell me, why am I still trying to hold on?
I've gotta tear it down to let it go

Tell me why I'm wasting away
Tell me how to break my own chains
'Cause I'm losing after all
How can I escape this grim fate?
Tell me how to face one more day
'Cause I'm wasting away

It's all gone silent, I'm searching for fire
Nothing to fight for alone

Tell me, why am I still here when it's all gone?
I'm living with the ghosts of yesterday
Tell me, why am I still here when it's all gone?
I'm living with the ghosts of yesterday
Tell me, why am I still trying to hold on?
I've gotta tear it down to let it go
