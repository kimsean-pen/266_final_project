I know a town where people are running
Away from life, it seems always funny

They think they are smart
Don't doubt what they say
Scared of a change
Existing only

To bring me down, bring me down
Yeah, bring me down, bring me down
Down

Thoughtless in heart, desperate in honesty
Failed from the start, wasted and suffering

Supply them their drugs
Just don't take them away
Scared of a change
Existing only

To bring me down, bring me down
Yeah, bring me down, bring me down
Down, down, down

I don't feel like I should even worry about you
But I take the time and you push me away

I don't care too much no more
I always seem to waste my breath
Go my own way

Yeah, bring me down, bring me down
Yeah, bring me down, bring me down

Bring me down, bring me down
Yeah, bring me down, bring me down

Bring me down, bring me down
Yeah, bring me down, bring me down
Down, down, down
