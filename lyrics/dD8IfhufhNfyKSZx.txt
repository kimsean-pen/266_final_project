Turn off your mind
Relax and flow down-stream
It is not dying
It is not dying
Lay down all thoughts
Surrender to the void
It is shining
Oh it is shining
That you may see
The meaning of within
It is Being
Oh it is Being
That Love is All
And Love is Everyone
It is knowing
Oh it is Knowing
And ignorance and hate
May mourn the dead
It is believing
It is believing
So play the game
Existence to the end
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I dreamed of
Once in a lullaby
