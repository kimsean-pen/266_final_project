Hold me down, let me drown I don't want do you have any of it
Flow my cloud on the ground I don't want to have any of it
We could run all you want, we could talk like you never knew it
Stay as... to anyone who talk to you, like you never knew it

You don't mind, you don't mind where you want it
And you could talk loud, you could talk loud if you know you want it

I just want you to remember
Before you can carry away
What happen just till September
If you know you wanna go on baby

Hold your head up
Reach for the sun.
Hold your head up
Reach for the sun.
Hold your head up
Reach for the sun.
Hold your head up
Reach for the sun.

Reaching for the sun, reaching for the sun you know,
Reaching for the sun you know it, reaching for the sun you know it
Reaching for the sun you know it, reaching for the sun you know it

I just want you to remember
Before you can carry away
What happen just till September
Yeah I just want you to remember
Before you can carry away
What happen just till September
If you know you wanna go on baby
