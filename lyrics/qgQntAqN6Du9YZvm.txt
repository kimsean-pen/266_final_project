I put it down for a brother like you
Give it to you right in the car, that's you
We get first keys, somebody, that's you
And you're all 'I'm loving J.Lo true'

Hola, I can get you come out
Pull your trigger, go and get your gun
Upon my time, my hair up, I
Put a pin and you know I'm ready, let it rock
Keep it number one, nasty easy nothing matters
Keep it number one, baby, ain't no static
Got that hour glass for you, baby
Look at delay (delay)
No breaks go green or red
If you wanna kill the body
Gotta start with the head
Put it on ya, I'mma need a ball for five beats
'Cause I love my papi

I didn't see it
But I see it now
I think I love you
And I need you know
Ain't had none like you in a while

I luh ya papi, I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya luh ya luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya luh ya luh ya papi
Get up my papi
I luh ya luh ya luh ya papi

I put it down for a brother like you
Give it to you right in the car, that's you
We get first keys, somebody, that's you
And you're all 'I'm loving J.Lo true'

Oh that 24 hour
Feeling like I want one when it's crowded
If you wanna hear your name, I shout it
Boy, you the shit, go and take a power shower
And I'm feeling like it's me and you, I don't doubt it
You can drop it how you want, I ain't trying to call Miley
I'm loving me, some you
Started from the bottom, baby, then we went roof
Cause I love my papi

I didn't see it
But I see it now
I think I love you
And I need you know
Ain't had none like you in a while

I luh ya papi, I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
Get up my papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi

I love you, mami, I-I love you, mami
Baby, you the shit, I-I love you, mami
Shorty got me catching feelings
And that rave drop reaching for the ceiling
Southside Bronx, till it vert just overseas
Take the pants out here, drop to her knees
Oh my, I'm a don like Omar
Speed it up slow ma, throw it back, throw my
Rock-rock Gators like mother chords players
You can hate to love us
You can love to hate us
From the bottom, it been real
From the bottom, shorty been trill
And even though we made it to the top
Still J.Lo from the-the the block
Heyy, I love you, mami, I love you, mami
Baby, you the shit, I-I love you, mami

I think I love just who you are
We haven't grown apart
This is just the start where life begin a way to the end
And we started as friends, but, boy, I do love

I luh ya papi, I luh ya papi
I luh ya luh ya luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya luh ya luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya luh ya luh ya papi
Get up my papi
I luh ya luh ya luh ya papi
