Willy is my child, he is my father
I would be his lady all my life
He says he'd love to live with me
But for an ancient injury that has not healed
He said, "I feel once again like I gave my heart too soon"

He stood looking through the lace
At the face on the conquered moon
And counting all the cars up the hill
And the stars on my window sill
There are still more reasons why I love him

Willy is my joy, he is my sorrow
Now he wants to run away and hide
He says, "Our love cannot be real"
He cannot hear the chapel's pealing silver bells
But you know it's hard to tell when you're in the spell
If it's wrong or if it's real

But you're bound to lose if you let the blues
Get you scared to feel
And I feel like I'm just being born
Like a shiny light breaking in a storm
There are some many reasons why I love him

Willy is my child, he is my father
