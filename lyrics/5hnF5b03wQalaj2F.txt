The light is heavy now and I should be listening to you
In the days of September
Let's count the days I can't remember
Witness, I'm still shaking
The man with the Nixon tattoo
Reliverance, reliverance

Fell asleep during Vietnam
We were hanging in a barroom
When we clean we make our lives better
Some things are just that way
You said you don't know me and you don't love me
Another day (Another day)

The air is filled with lemon-scented displeasure
They were playing the streets of Bakersfield

There ain't no daylight in Vietnam
Will it be there when you want it to be?
If you want it to be?

When you want it to, you want it to be
I why, why, why, why wonder?
"This is normal now"

This is the new not normal
This is the new not normal
This is the new not normal

Somebody just forgot to put the glass out
You're balding

Knew there would be no song 5
On a Sunday in church

Inside the cockpit

The air is heavy now and I should be listening to you
The light is changing and a mouse is on the porch
Oh, instead I'm frozen in time

The air is heavy now and I should be listening
I should be listening to you
I should be listening
Instead I'm frozen in time

Trying to smooth out the edges
It will be where you want it
Is the new not normal?
When you want it to be

I'm in a Mexican restaurant bar
Watching surfing and it's amazing
With all I'm hearing
It comes from a clear
I found myself here

The light has changed
