Em, C (mute)

I wish my life was this song,

cause songs they never die

i could write for years and years and never have to cry
i'd show you how i live without saying a word,
i could wrap up both our hearts i know it sounds obsurde,

and i saw the tears on your face, i shot you down,
and i slamed the door but couldn't make a sound so,
please stay sweet my dear, don"t hate me know,
C D Dsus
i can't tell how this last song ends

(the way that i feel tonight
so down so down,
i pray i can swim
just so i wont drown,
and the waves that crash
over me i'm gasping for air
take my hand so i can breathe (i wrote this last song down)

and i saw the tears on your face, i shot you down,
and i slamed the door but couldn't make a sound so,
please stay sweet my dear, don"t hate me know,
C D Dsus
i can't tell how this last song ends

(Intrelude: Em, C, D/F#, G, D/F#)

broken glass
your mostioned skin was everything, was everything
and your broken voice
was quivering(youre every thing)
your everything, your everything
scream at me make it the best i've ever heard,
laugh out loud i know it sounds obsurd,
scream at me make it the best i've ever heard,
your everything, your everything

your heart beastslowly, pains are grown,
does she love you, thats worth knowing, yea
