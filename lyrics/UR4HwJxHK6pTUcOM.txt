When you feel left out take this with me
The feeling is cool in motion
I'm numb from the waist down, feeling sorrow
We spend another night alone, feeling nothing
It all falls out and leads to nothing
Its wearing off, it feels cool in motion
I'm numb from the waist down, feeling sorrow
We spend another night alone, feeling nothing
We're wasting away, dying slow
Please fall in to me now
