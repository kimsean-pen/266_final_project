The thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away
The thrill is gone, baby
The thrill is gone away
You done me wrong baby
And you're gonna be sorry someday

The thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away from me
The thrill is gone, baby
The thrill is gone away from me
Although I'll still live on
But so lonely I'll be

I'm free now baby
I'm free from your spell
Oh free, free, free now!
I'm free from your spell
And now that it's over
All I can do is wish you well
