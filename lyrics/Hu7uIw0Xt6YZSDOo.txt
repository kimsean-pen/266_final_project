You say what you want to say
Your diamonds are drops of rain
Your smile is your credit card
And your currency is your love

And the morning is for you
And the air is free
And the birds sing for you
And your positivity

Watch out

So you play where you want to play
On the main streets where the creeps all pray
And you can feel like you're in dynasty
(And where your mind is your masterpiece)

And you can be what you want to be
(Your limousine is the streets)
And the morning is for you
And the air is free

And the birds sing for you
And your positivity
And the cars crash for you
And the sunshine is free
And the sirens call you
Yes, the morning is for you
Yes, the air is free
Yes, the world spins for you
And your positivity, positivity
