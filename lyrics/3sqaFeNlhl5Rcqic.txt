I was born in a crossfire hurricane
And I howled at the moon in the driving rain

But it's all right
Now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right
I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas, gas, gas

I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag
I was schooled with a strap right across my back

But it's all right
Now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right
I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas, gas, gas

I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead
I fell down on my knees, till my foot skin bleed
I was frowned at the sun and left you a bread, yeah, yeah, yeah
I was crowned with a spike right thru my head, c'mon, yeah

But it's all right
Now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right
I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas, gas, gas

Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
