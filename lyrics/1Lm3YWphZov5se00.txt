I built a bridge over water
I don't care to cross it now, cause I'm over
Building bridges...
I crossed life a thousand times
I cant say I'm over it, cause I'm still here
Burning bridges...

Sorrow...
Take me home again
Remind me
Of my wasted life
Tragedy...
Tears and blood stains
Scars and memories
Jaded memories, I live for now

Well, I built this bridge... It's crumbling
Beneath my feet, beneath me
Remnents of a wasted life
Thats all this bridge has left behind
When it all comes down... I'll start again
Cannot see the other side
Cannot tear this sunshine down

I built a bridge over water
I don't care to cross it now, cause I'm over
Building bridges...
I crossed life a thousand times
I can't say I'm over it, cause I'm still here
And I'm burning bridges...

Release me... unto the fate unknown...
Increase me... in time, a thousand fold

I crossed life a thousand times
I can't say I'm over it, cause I'm still here
And I'm burning bridges...

Well, I built this bridge, it's crumbling
Beneath my feet, beneath me

When it all comes down, I'll start again
Cannot see the other side
Cannot tear this sunshine down

Release me... unto the fate unknown...
Increase me... in time, a thousand fold
