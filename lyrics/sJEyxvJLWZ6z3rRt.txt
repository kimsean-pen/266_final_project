Tell me what's inside your heart
Tell me that I got a part
Give me shelter in your heart
Help me wear it like a guard

Tell me what's inside your heart
Make feel the other side
Melt me ... of desire
Do you have ...inside the heart

Tell me what's inside your heart
Tell me what's inside your heart, whoa
Let me tear that heart apart.
