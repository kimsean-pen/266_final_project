Damn, damn
Oh, you used to be my man, used to be my man
And damn, damn
You were supposed to have my back, now we can't go back
'Cause you made your bed with the shit you said
Your apology was irrelevant
Oh man, oh man
Oh, you used to be my man, to be my man

I looked at you like a brother
I thought we'd make it through the summer
But I just put a block on your number
'Cause you a sketchy motherfucker
It's high time that I do thing (Woo)
High time that I scoot past (Scoot)
Gave it all, and I trusted y'all, but I realize that I should have
Verified your bank account, everyone of your checks bounced
Should be getting this cheese, bro
I'm no cheap hoe and no cash cow

Damn, damn
Oh, you used to be my man, used to be my man
And damn, damn
You were supposed to have my back, now we can't go back
'Cause you made your bed with the shit you said
Your apology was irrelevant
Oh man, oh man
Oh, you used to be my man, to be my man

I threw your ass out like a ad-lib (Ooh)
That's how many fucks about you I give (Fuck you)
I really thought that you had the chips (Thought you had 'em)
Soon as you turn on me, that's when I dipped (Really did it)
Laugh it off 'cause I'm dripping (Dripping)
Looking back, I was tripping (Tripping)
Universe is talking to you, better walk it through, you better listen
Judge, jury, executioner
You picked the wrong bitch to be confusing her
You tryna steal the crown, but who's the bitch now
When I'm switching how I used to turn?

Damn, damn
Oh, you used to be my man, used to be my man
Damn, damn
You were 'posed to have my back, can't go back

Damn, damn
Oh, you used to be my man, used to be my man
And damn, damn
You were supposed to have my back, now we can't go back
'Cause you made your bed with the shit you said
Your apology was irrelevant
Oh man, oh man (Oh man, oh man, oh man)
Oh, you used to be my man, to be my man

Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man, uh
Oh damn, oh damn, oh damn, oh damn, damn
Man, oh man, oh man, oh man, uh
Oh damn, oh damn, oh damn, oh damn, damn, damn
Damn damn, damn damn
D-d-d-damn, damn, damn, d-damn
D-d-d-damn, damn, damn, d-damn
