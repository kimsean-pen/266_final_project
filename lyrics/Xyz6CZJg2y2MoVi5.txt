Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

Got the top down, gonna baptize you bitches 'cause you know you cop out
Calm down, all you motherfuckers do is talk loud
You sold out, and every single one of you is cold now
My town, 30-deep, about to fucking roll out
Look alive as I light up the sky
And pump up the 12-gauge and blow off your disguise
No surprise, there ain't no compromise
They doped up these motherfuckers, hit 'em straight in the eyes
And the one-eyed man is king in the land of the blind
It's told you wanna live forever, but today you will die, it's your time
Here you lie as they crucify
You're the boy who will cry, and I'm the wolf who'll get by
And every single page is drawn in blood, can't you see?
Front seats because you're triple six feet in the deep
And I'll send you straight to the afterlife for fucking with me
Hollywood to the death, Undead put you to sleep

Can't fall, can't die
Tonight we're so alive
Singing whoa, we own the night
Whoa, we own the night
We call, you rise
With you, we never die
Singing whoa, we own the night
Whoa, we own the night

Own the night, we own the night
Own the night, we own the night

Broken words so often told
If you wanna throw some blows
We can go toe to toe
Kick the door and throw it open
No one knows? I thought I told 'em
Thought you had it, now you're choking
People dropping, bodies folding
Stay Undead, two coffins open
Praying to that Holy Ghost
He can't save you, there's no hope
Looking through that barrel smoke
Pull the trigger, let it go
The game is done, set in the closer
You can't sink down any lower
We couldn't get any colder
With these devils on our shoulders
There's someone popping shots, now someone called the cops
And when the dust settles, you know we gon' be on top
Smoking till I'm under six feet on the dock
Welcome to the jungle, we got beef on the block
Charlie's rolling through your hood, Funny at his side
Looking like a fucking pimp parade passing by
And we hopping out the Jeep; if you fuckers wanna die
Fucking with Undead is like committing suicide

Can't fall, can't die
Tonight we're so alive
Singing whoa, we own the night
Whoa, we own the night
We call, you rise
With you, we never die
Singing whoa, we own the night
Whoa, we own the night

Own the night, we own the night
Own the night, we own the night

This time
This time we will all rise
All rise for the lost lives
Lost lives for the last time
For the last time, we will all rise
For the last time, we will all rise
For the last time, we will all rise
For the last time, we will all rise

Can't fall, can't die
Tonight we're so alive
Singing whoa, we own the night
Whoa, we own the night
We call, you rise
With you, we never die
Singing whoa, we own the night
Whoa, we own the night

Whoa, we own the night
Whoa, we own the night
Whoa, we own the night
Whoa, we own the night
