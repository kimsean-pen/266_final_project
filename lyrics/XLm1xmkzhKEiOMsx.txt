I dressed up the horses, set them loose
Sunk the needle deep and took in every drop
A violent path and inch in time
And ever my device the anchor drops

x2
I said peel the skin raw
I said peel the skin raw
I said peel the skin raw
Pinch 'til our feeling's gone

Miles of horses gallop to the edge
[?] in their mouths we try to wear
Powerful, more muscle than stiff lip
The reins [?] chains [?] I've lost my grip

Try with all my heart I choke, I'm ready to go
And if you're through with me then please say so
Try with all my heart I choke, I'm ready to go
And if you're through with me then please just say so

x2

You build this game to play and to pretend
You are a dark machine and I'm a cult
When engines crack when fuel lines break off
I'll save your bits and let your motor rot
