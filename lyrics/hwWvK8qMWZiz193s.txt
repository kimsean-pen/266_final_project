[Refrão]
Oh who is she?
A misty memory
A haunting face,
Is she a lost embrace?

Am I in love with just a theme?
Or is Ayesha just a dream?
A mystery
Oh who is she?

[Refrão]

I call her name
Across an endless plain
She'll answer me
Where ever she may be

[Refrão]

Somewhere across the sea of time
A love immortal just like mine
Will come to me eternally

Immortal she
Return to me
