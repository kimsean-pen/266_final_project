You've wet my appetite;
I want the taste of you tonight.
I've gotta look out for me,
Like a cat whose got the cream.

Prrrr-rrrr-rrr!
I take you for a gambling man...
I'll place my bets as high as I can.
Maybe youre the one who can realize my dream.
Shall we see?

Meet me in the bedroom
At quarter-past eleven...
Say the lucky words Im looking for,
And well be locking up the door.

Baby, if you wanna be in my world,
Youve gotta know the password (password)
To make it right (to make it right).
Tell me your thinking hard,
I dont want this to fall apart...
I've gotta feeling that we could just make a team.

I'm careful with my heart,
I'm a fussy girl and loves an art.
Tell me that your hiding something up your sleeve,
Please...
