If there's one thing I adore
It's mutters of the ceiling fans, Hitachi saying goodnight through a double glaze
I'm a boy then, you understand?
It's like sweetness over me
It's watching a laundry white stained cloth tumble on returning to its base colour
I should be glad

Motherfuckers act like they don't know
