There's every good reason
To let down your hair
It's nobody's business
And nobody cares
I would know
I would know
Ask our neighbors
I would know

In spite of the weather
We can have a good time
We can go out for dinner
You can make up your mind
But you don't have to close your eyes
The way you used to do
Every time you change your look
You feel like someone new
So put on your makeup
And get the car
It's take such a long (long) time
To drive that far

I would know
I would know
Ask our neighbors
I would know
Ask our neighbors
I would know

Ask our neighbors
Ask our neighbors
Ask our neighbors
I would know
