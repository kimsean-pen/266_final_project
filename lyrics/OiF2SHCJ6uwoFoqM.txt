It's so sad to see you sway.
It's so sad to see you this way.
Lipstick won't cover the cracks.
Your sunglasses can be your mask.

There is no anything to...
Down by the river
It just won't come clean
When you go to sleep.

It's so sad to you sway.
It's so sad to see you this way.
Lipstick won't cover the cracks.
Your sunglasses can be your mask.
