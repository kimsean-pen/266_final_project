I didn't understand the things you're going through
I never understood, I really never knew
Carry on (carry on), carry on (carry on)
The sun will always shine
Carry on (carry on), carry on (carry on)
We'll have a glass of wine or a cigarette

La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

Take destiny by the hand and lead it far away
Take it to another land, we will all decay

Carry on (carry on), carry on (carry on)
The sun will always shine
Carry on (carry on), carry on (carry on)
We'll have a glass of wine or a cigarette

La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
