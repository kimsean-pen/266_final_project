I wish you...
I wish you would see what I see

Lead a lead a light of thee
You used to use to see
How you only only need
To blow them out

Yesterday was your birthday
Happy birthday

200 candles
A liar, a scandal
A fire through the roof
When I called you

Were you there? Were you there?
Were you ever alive?

I wish I could see what you see

Lead a lead a light of thee
You used to use to see
How you only only need
To blow them out

Silly silly silly me
I used to use to see
Now our only light
Is blowing out
