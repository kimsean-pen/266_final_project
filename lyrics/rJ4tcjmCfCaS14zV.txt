Hey honey, are you lonely too?
I've watched my love leave and he looks just like you
Hey honey, I've been feeling so blue
Everytime I wish, oh I wish I never knew

I hope one day you'll see
Just what you've done to me
I hope one day you'll see
Just what you've done to me

Hey baby, I'll be thinking of him
Trust me it's the scaredist I've been
I can't be this naive anymore
I can't be this naive
I can't be this naive anymore
I can't be this naive

I hope I'll know better
How can I be there when you're calling my name?
How can you be there when I'm calling your name?
I need to be loved
No, I need to be tough
No, I need to grow up
I need to grow up
