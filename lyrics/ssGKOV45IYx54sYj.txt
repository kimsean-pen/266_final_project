I can't go on knowing that you're there alone, it's tearing at my soul
You're always watching and always waiting for my next dive into misery
Falling into this desperate deception you've left me to rot in
I can't be left alone, this might be your prison, but this is my home

I am a ghost that you can't lock away, so make the most out off all my mistakes
You turn your back, I'll do away with all you've ever known
I am a ghost

What do you want from me?

I won't be part of your plan to derail me
Why can't you fucking see?
How selfish can you be?
Watching and judging everything that I do
I won't play victim because you
Take everything to heart, take each word I say and tear it apart, analyze each breath I take, watch every move I make

I am a ghost that you can't lock away, so make the most out off all my mistakes
You turn your back, I'll do away with all you've ever known
I am a ghost

Until I fade and cease to breathe, I'll always feel your eyes watching me
You're all I hear; I'm all you see
The only name you'll ever speak

A constant war; you'd rather see me collapse than help me carry all the weight you love to force on my back
You watch me fall again, but I refuse to sit and watch that part of me just die, I deserve my fucking life

You're running out of steam, but you're part of me
If you'd just let yourself see, there's nothing we can't be, but there's just no way to trust you, there's no way to save you, I won't play the victim just cause you
Take everything to heart, take each word I say and tear it apart, analyze each breath I take, watch every move I make

I am a ghost that you can't lock away, so make the most out off all my mistakes
You turn your back, I'll do away with all you've ever known
I am a ghost

Until I fade and cease to breathe, I'll always feel your eyes watching me
You're all I hear; I'm all you see
The only name you'll ever speak
