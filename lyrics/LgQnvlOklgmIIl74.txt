I live on a mountainside. I've raised a family and I've made a life
I've never known no other way. The mountain man is here to stay
Today a man knocked on my door, said you can't live here anymore
He had some papers in his hand, and money for to take my land
You can buy a concrete city, buy their beaches and their sand
Count your gold and silver, hold your diamonds in your hand
Cut down all the mighty mountain timber where it stands
But you can't buy a mountain man

In the early mornin' light I see, men with guns among the trees
Inside my family safe and warm. The peaceful time before the storm
With scattered thoughts I grab my gun, while prayin' to God's only Son
Lord I don't know just what to do.
Please see this mountain family through
You can buy a concrete city, buy their beaches and their sand
Count your gold and silver, hold your diamonds in your hand
Cut down all the mighty mountain timber where it stands
But you can't buy a mountain man
