Life here in America there's hatred everywhere
We think we're all untouchable and no one seems to care
We all want all the luxuries - a car, a house, a home
We want a safe society but leave our guns alone

We cater to aristocrats we want our basic rights
If we piss off all our neighbors we'll send the poor to fight
It's hard to find the reasons where did it all go wrong?
And if you all agree with me you'll help me sing this song
It's all...

LIES - We all believe American
LIES - We won't give up we're living in
LIES - salute the flag the 4th of July
Suck it up your living in a lie

Right here in America we got college and healthcare
But if you're really smart enough to get sick you'd never dare
The laws have all been rigged now to help the upper class
You can bet their money's hidden and they're never paying tax

It's hard to tell your children the truth why you got fired
When the pay your boss is making just continues to rise
So work your whole life faithfully just trying to get ahead
Then they'll drain all of your bank accounts until you're finally dead
It's all...

LIES - We all believe American
LIES - We won't give up we're living in
LIES - Uncle Sam's just clinging to life
Suck it up your living in a lie

Life here in America there's hatred everywhere
We think we're all untouchable and no one seems to care
We all want all the luxuries - a car, a house, a home
We want a safe society but leave our guns alone

We cater to aristocrats we want our basic rights
If we piss off all our neighbors we'll send the poor to fight
It's hard to find the reasons where did it all go wrong?
And if don't agree with me you must believe...

LIES - you must believe American
LIES - We all believe American
LIES - It's enough to make a patriot cry
Suck it up your living in a lie
