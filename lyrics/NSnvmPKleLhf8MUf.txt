Justice done

People in fashion
Rattle, don't hesitate
I look at my own, your chances are slim
Victory lap, for unfettering eyes

Justice done

Caledonian, rich and young
Self-entitled portrait

I'll rush into it anyway
Forever is for everyone else
We're off a couple secrets
Another lonely Tuesday home
Stole the kisses anyone near
