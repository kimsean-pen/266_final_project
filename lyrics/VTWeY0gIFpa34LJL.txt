I hate seagulls and I hate being sick
I hate burning my finger on the toaster and I hate nits
I hate falling over
I hate grazing my knee
I hate picking off the scab a little bit too early
I hate getting toothache
I hate when it's a pisstake
I hate all the mistakes I make
I hate rude ignorant bastards and I hate snobbery
I hate anyone who if I was serving chips wouldn't talk to me
But, I have a friend
With whom I like to spend
Anytime I can find, with
I like sleeping in your bed
I like knowing what is going on inside your head
I like taking time and I like your mind and I like when your
hand is in mine
I like getting drunk on the tunes by the beach
I like picking strawberries
I like cream teas and I like reading ghost stories
And my heart skips a beat every time that we meet
It's been a while and now your smile is almost like a memory
But now you're back and I am fine 'cos you're with me
And I'm in love with you
And I can't find the words to make it sound unique but,
Honestly you make me strong!
I can't believe I've found someone this kind
I hope we carry on
'Cos you're so nice and I'm in love with you
Oh, Ohoh, Oh, Oh, Ohoh, Oh, Oh, Ohoh...
