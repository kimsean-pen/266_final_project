To create, pass on, pass on
What's mine, now yours, pass on
Written in stone, no longer in sand, pass on
Pass on, to create
To grace, what's mine, now yours, I'm gone, pass on
To create, create, pass on, pass on
What's mine, now yours, I'm gone, pass on, create, create, in stone
Not sand, pass on, I'm gone
To grace, pass on, in stone, pass on
All mine for yours, pass on
To give all, give all, pass on
Next mine, now gone, pass on
To grace, pass on
To grace, pass on
Give all, give all, give all, give all to

My children
Ain't got no mother
Came from my temple, all, when I thought them

My children
I never loved them
Why feel that way when their existence is my business?

My children
They never listen
Vaped in the brain, feral vessals of my self-interest

My children
They are the future
Good luck with the mess I left, you innovators

My children
Pay dividends
Vomit and rage spewing forth in the drive-thru

So don't lean on me man
'cause I ain't got nothing to give
To my children

My children, they're right behind you
My children, they're gonna beat you
My children, if you let them
Oh, oh, my children
