i aim to bug you on your vacancy
never complicate but you talk it cheap
you sense but you don't know
too lame to catch a cold

slowly the signs will read you dumb
surely the times will feel you numb
i know the pains you took to show me
and i'm nothing but your superbug for asking

i hate to bug you on your certainty
never compromise - you're just always weak
you care but you don't show
too proud to catch the flow

under all the truth and facts there's faith enough
if you can't live on love alone it isn't love

slowly the signs will read you dumb
surely the times will feel you numb
i know the depths you sunk to show me
i want the life the world still owes me
and i'm nothing but your superbug for asking
answer - stamp me out

and i'd love to break your fall but no-ones asking me
answer - stamp me out

slowly the signs will read you dumb
surely the times will feel you numb
i know the pains you took to show me
you said it hurts your head to know me
and i'm nothing but your superbug for asking
answer - stamp me out
