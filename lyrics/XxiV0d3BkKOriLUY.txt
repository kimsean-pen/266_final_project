Get your dose of oxytocin
Take this hit to show emotion
Feel it like you've never felt before

In the dark and in the open
You're not one who knows devotion
Feel it like you've never felt before

So apart when we're together
From the heart I feel forever
From the start I knew you better
But I fell for you
And I feel for you

When it's night and the only lights are the ones hung
Past scars like a knife and it cuts right through your lung
Find a tab on my touch and it ends up on your tongue
What I want from you
Is you to want me too

Get your dose of oxytocin
Take this hit to show emotion
Feel it like you've never felt before

In the dark and in the open
You're not one who knows devotion
Feel it like you've never felt before

I don't like my own hands touching anymore
For a moment I think it's you and then I want more
In the morning I still roll over and kiss you on the forehead
I've never been more dead
I didn't mean to force it

Everything that's suppose to be bad makes me feel so good
I know it's time to go and I could, I should, I would
But my little druggie baby your touch is what could save me
So love me like my lady and I'll hold you while I'm singing
Get your dose of oxytocin
Take this hit to show emotion
Feel it like you've never felt before
