Talk to me
Through a screen
Talk to me
Like I'm real
Talk to me
Like we are destiny
Waiting.
Sinking.

Stop me swallowing fires
I'm addicted to myself
Got vindictive desires
I've got off my grid
Trapped in death waves beneath the avalanche.
Sinking.

Slow the panic down
Watching time lapse ghosts
And you're watching flowers grow, and die...
We'll scatter ashes where we met you
Throw caution to wind.
You have seeds with new arms, reaching.

Stop me swallowing fires
I'm addicted to myself
Got vindictive desires
I've got off my grid
Trapped in death waves beneath the avalanche.
Sinking.

Stop me swallowing fires
I'm disgusted with myself
Got vindictive desires
I've got off my grid
Trapped in death waves beneath the avalanche.
And sinking.

In the mistrust that I lost
In the loss that I trust
In the times I collapse
It drips like dust
And there's dreams where I'm sleeping
And there's dreams where I don't wake up

Can't stop me swallowing fires
I'm addicted to myself
Got vindictive desires
I've got off my grid
I've got one hand on The Bible
I've got voices in my head
I've got destructive desires
I fell off my grid
I fell off my grid
I fell off my grid
I fell off my grid
I fell off my grid

(Breathe)
