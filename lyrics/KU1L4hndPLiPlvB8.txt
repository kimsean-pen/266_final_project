Your magic is my disease
Corrupt my mind with dirty dreams
It's a mindless love affair
One hot mess of bleach blonde hair
I could kiss her but your lips taste better
You could kiss him but my words are sweeter

Explosion (love you but I'm not in love
You're all I've been dreaming of)
Explosion (every breath is magnified
Wasted feelings come alive)
We live in a pink cloud, things aren't always what they seem
If people only knew, that I'm the king and you're my queen
When I'm with you there's no other
Are we sisters or are we lovers?

Explosion (love you but I'm not in love
You're all I've been dreaming of)
Explosion (all I want's to feel your stare
Grab my waist and pull my hair)
Don't call me about him I don't wanna
Hear put him out of your mind just make him disappear
Stop pretending you got nothing left to
Hide my memory is slipping and it's killing me alive

Reached the bitter end, can't pretend
I'm not in love with my best friend, my best friend
Reached the bitter end, can't pretend
I'm not in love with my best friend, my best friend
In my dreams you are my queen
I'm mad for you you're mad for me
Tell me that you'd die without me
Cry without me, can't breathe without me

Explosion (love you but I'm not in love
You're all I've been dreaming of)
Explosion (I don't want you in my dreams, be mine in reality)
Your mine all mine all mine all mine
Your mine, your mine all mine your
Mine all mine your mine, your mine, your mine
