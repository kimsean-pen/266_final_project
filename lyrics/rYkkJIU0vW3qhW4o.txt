There's one for the sorrow and two for the joy
And three for the girls and four for the boys

There's five for the silver and six for the gold
And seven for the secrets that are never to be told

There's eight in the river and nine in my head
And ten of the worst kind sleeping in my bed

There's a pattern, there's a pattern, there's a pattern there to followed
There's a pattern, there's a pattern, there's a pattern there to followed
Oh, oh, oh, to follow
Oh, oh, oh, to follow

There's one for the money and two for the sin
And three for the tongue when authority kicks in

There's four for the reason and five for the tricks
But nothing's going to save you from the six six six

There's seven for the days and seven for the nights
And seven for the heavens and the tunnel and the lights

There's a pattern, there's a pattern, there's a pattern there to followed
There's a pattern, there's a pattern, there's a pattern there to followed
Oh, oh, oh, to follow
Oh, oh, oh, to follow

(To follow... to follow... to follow...)

Oh, oh, oh, to follow
Oh, oh, oh, to follow
