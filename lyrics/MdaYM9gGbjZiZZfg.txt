The Natural disasters make it hard to mind
Birthday cake, steak and wine
The rope around the carpet make you bust a dime
They want your heart to ach and take up all your time
The broken situations that leave no resort
Must give way to playing sport
Don't want to think about it don't know what to say
So sorry that your crushed goodbye to you today

We've got to get the conversation keep it clean and dry
And if they never finish then we wont ask why
It's just a natural disaster that you've left behind
For the cut of cake for the steak and wine

We'll keep the conversation keep it clean and dry
And if they never finish then we wont ask why
It's just a natural disaster that you've left behind
For the cut of cake for the steak and wine

No more emotions to show nobody has to know
It's just a natural disaster that you've left behind
For the cut of cake for the steak and wine

We'll keep the conversation keep it clean and dry
But if they never finish then we wont ask why
It's just a natural disaster that you've left behind
for the cut of cake and for the steak and wine
No more emotions to show nobody has to know
It's just a natural disaster that you've left behind
For the cut of cake for the steak and wine
