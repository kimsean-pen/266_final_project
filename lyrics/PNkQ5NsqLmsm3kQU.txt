I delve into myself, ceaselessly
Oh but i rarely see, what i want to see
Embracing the future, forgetting the past
Loves, loss and misfortune
The chaos and the crass
Crass

I'm wary of you, but you're oblivious to me
I'm chained to your ego
But there isn't a key
I play with emotions but never my own
Don't you recognise me?
Try looking inwardly
Ah but you won't see me

Such a strange fascination as i wallow in waste
That such a trivial victory can put a smile on your face
Using me as the scapegoat, for what you want to beleive
So i'll just bow out politely
And tip my cap as i leave

Ah comme ci, comme ca, comme ci

My eyes are wide open, yours are closed
It's time you realised i'm a part of you

Look inwardly, don't bleed for me
Look to yourself
