Dragging my feet
I feel like everybody's watching
Watching me cut my teeth
Grabbing my cup and
Darling if I'm being honest
Honestly, I should go

I let you down
I know it
I let you down over and over

I don't wanna dance
I don't know how
I don't wanna dance
I don't know how to dance with you
I don't wanna dance
I don't know how
I don't wanna dance
I don't know how to dance with you

I don't, I don't know
I don't, I don't

Easing my cool
Oh this is an accidental weekend
But honey I've got nothing to prove
And I know it seems cruel
You never call me on a Monday
Baby it's got nothing to do with you, no

I let you down
I know it
I let you down over and over

I don't wanna dance
I don't know how
I don't wanna dance
I don't know how to dance with you
I don't wanna dance
I don't know how
I don't wanna dance
I don't know how to dance with you

I don't wanna let you down
I don't wanna let you down
I don't wanna let you down, no
I don't wanna let you down, oh no no no no no

I don't wanna dance
I don't know how
I don't wanna dance
I don't know how to dance with you
I don't wanna dance
I don't know how
I don't wanna dance
I don't know how to dance with you

I don't know how
I don't know how to dance with you
I don't, I don't know
I don't, I don't
