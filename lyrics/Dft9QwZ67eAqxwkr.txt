I remember when we met
Out times had just been set
You were standing in the future
And you let me be your teacher
Then I got our future planned
And I took your past in hand
Then we went our separate ways
Travelled through each phase

And here we lie in disarray
Surrounded by the present day
All this Modern Wonder
Ripped our lives asunder
The greatest crime is to be out of time
Gotta keep from going under
In all this Modern Wonder

Then our journeying was spent
In the place where we were sent
To the late Atomic Age
Turning into chronic rage

And here we lie in disarray
Surrounded by the present day
Call it Modern Wonder
Time-Life crashing thunder
We're going too fast for our lives to last
Gotta keep from going under
In all this Modern Wonder

Do we stay or do we go
Should we tell them what we know
Cos they're going too fast
For their time to last
Should we stay and watch the show

And here they lie in disarray
Surrounded by the present day
All this Modern Wonder
Ripped their lives asunder
All this Modern Wonder
Ripped their lives asunder
All this Modern Wonder
Ripped their lives asunder

I remember when we met
Out times had just been set
You were standing in the future
And you let me be your teacher
Then I got our future planned
And I took your past in hand
Then we went our separate ways
Travelled through each phase

And here we lie in disarray
Surrounded by the present day
All this Modern Wonder
Ripped our lives asunder
The greatest crime is to be out of time
Gotta keep from going under
In all this Modern Wonder
