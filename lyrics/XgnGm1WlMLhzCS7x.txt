This one goes out to the entire world that's right
I know you think you know me better than that
I bit your dog 'cause he hit on my cat
I wipe my face off and keep your kisses back, baby

You're speaking my language, baby
You're speaking my language, baby
You're speaking my language, baby
You could be my Romeo

All the boys and all of the girls
Push it up, shake it up to the world
I wanna feed you like a bush of baby birds
Put your mind, make sure that you heard

Another week of less allowance you know
You think you're winning when you're winning to lose

You're speaking my language, baby
You're speaking my language, baby
You're speaking my language, baby

I don't think you heard me
I know you think you know me better than that
I bit your dog 'cause he hit on my cat
I wipe my face off and keep your kisses back
Keep your trigger loaded, rockin' or rollin' all night

You're speaking my language, baby
You're speaking my language, baby
You're speaking my language, baby

You're speaking my language, baby
You're speaking my language, baby
You're speaking my language, baby

You're speaking, you're speaking
You're speaking, you're speaking
You're speaking, hey yeah
