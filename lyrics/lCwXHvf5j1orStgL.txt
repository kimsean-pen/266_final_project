Harvester of the night
There are no secrets left anymore
We reap, and sow, and follow the road
The deadweight finally brought me down
But I will resurface
In stillness, came balance, and ears to hear
But all I know is so frail at this moment in time
Push me aside
Hanging on the edge of what I've been told
And who's to say that it was your mind to mold?
Restore control, mend your broken bones
There is more to be found
Every path has a beginning and end
But I never chose where to begin
If love is what we're living in, so be it
I'm not afraid anymore
The great unknown, is all I've ever wanted to know
A journey not about myself, but about the test of time
Weightless love, you know me so well
Weightless love, you know me so well
Weightless love, you know me so well
Weightless love, you know me so well
Weightless love
Stripped down to nothing, humble and shameful
I have nothing to lose
Bring me back to dust, start again
I have nothing to offer
I have nothing to lose
I am dust once again, in the endless blue
Every path has a beginning and end
Every soul has a story to lend
Tell me how you perceive this life you live
Tell me do you watch it slip away?
All the knowledge you've ever retained
Burn what you know
Burn what you love and start anew
What's left of it all, is the truth
Burn what you love
What's left of it all
Is the only truth
