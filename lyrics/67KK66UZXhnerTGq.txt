You could do it better
Drakkar noir, cheap fixtures, religious tales
Light a cigarette for two, too close to get to
How come everyone knows you before they meet you?

In the jangle jungle
Jingle junkie, juggle juggle me
A better standard than mediocre
I watch you tumble up
oh oh oh

Jangle jungle
Jingle jump before you stumble
I'm just too glad to say no
Just too glad to say no

Scandinavian leather
Drakkar noir, fake rituals, oblivious tales
On a domestic airline
Swear to your god that you're mine

In the jangle jungle
Jingle junkie, juggle juggle me
A better standard than mediocre
I watch you tumble
oh oh oh oh

Jangle jungle
Jingle jump before you stumble
I'm just too sad to say no
Just too glad to say no, no

How I wish I knew
How I wish I knew you from before
'Til I die, 'til I die, 'til I die
Run the avenues until the city unfolds

Why would we have to know?
Do we have to know what truth is?
How I wish I knew
How I wish I knew you from before

'Til I die, 'til I die, 'til I die, 'til I die
I'm just too glad to say no
Just too glad to say no, no, no, no
