So sick and tired, sick and tired for so damn long
All I hear is excuses from everyone

Heavy as an anvil
Don't you let it
Drive you into the fucking ground
Hammered wills must face the ugly truth
Those days are gone and they are never coming back around
Back around

So sick and tired, sick and tired for so damn long
All I hear is excuses from everyone

This is the spirit of struggle and sacrifice
Don't believe their shit
They promise only lies
Find a sense of pride
You made it this far
All I have I fucking earned, fucking earned

So sick and tired, sick and tired for so damn long
All I hear is excuses from everyone

All I hear is excuses
From everyone

They're gonna try to kick you around
You better fight for your life
They're gonna try to kick you around
You better fight for your fucking life
Struggle
You better fight for your fucking life
