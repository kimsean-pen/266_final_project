Reading in the phone booth
Sucking on a ginger root
I never got to talk to you
Why is this the image I come back to?
Pick my jewelry from the ash
Find the box with the cold hard cash in it
Give it to the next of kin

I used to be too deep inside my head
Now I'm too far out of my skin
Too far out of my skin
I am at peace with my death
I can go back to bed
I am at peace with my death
I can go back to bed

I make a desert of my mind
Unfold myself so flat and wide
Have nothing in mind in sight
No cover for my thoughts to hide
Never went to my Monaco
But I held you hand in the pocket of my coat
I learned to be loving and then to be alone
Satisfied body and a hungry soul

I used to be too deep inside my head
Now I'm too far out of my skin
Too far out of my skin
I am at peace with my death
I can go back to bed
I am at peace with my death
I can go back to bed

I don't wanna be that man on the train
On a grey commute, imagining fame
Sweet relief, I will never be complete
I will never be complete
I'll never know everything
I will never be complete
I will never be complete
I will never be complete
I'll never know everything
I used to be too deep inside my head

Now I'm too far out of my skin
Too far out of my skin
