Turn the lights down
Careful as a serpent's tongue
Move without a sound
Gentle as the cold wind moans

It pulled the ships down
It's rising from the deep below
To drown us all in sound
It never even touched the ground

Did you know love
My heart is a monster
When you sold love
Your heart becomes a monster
You know love
My heart, my heart, my heart

Turn the lights down
It's rising from the deep below
To drown us all in sound
It never even touched the ground

Did you know love
My heart is a monster
When you sold love
Your heart becomes a monster
You know love
My heart, my heart, my heart

Move without a sound
Move without a sound
Move without a sound
