Hold me for a minute
I'm just that far away
From being considered
Clinically insane
I need your attention
Affection is my way
Out of the danger zone

I feel no lightness
Days like this are priceless
Given myself licence to indulge in all my vice

Woah, don't go
Withdrawal is my soul
Weakness, I'm cold
Smoke
Smoke blows from my nose
And keeps me warm
I know where I'm going
I've seen limbo before

Straight jacket
Put on my straight jacket
I'm on a different planet
Let it go, don't panic
I'm fine
Can't hack it
My mind is at it again
I'm maniac, I'm maniac
Straight jacket
Put on my straight jacket
I'm on a different planet
Let it go, don't panic
I'm fine
Can't hack it
I'm manic, I'm manic

Split right down the middle
And half of me is fine
My mind is a riddle
Typical Gemini
Star signs are my excuse
To hide this type of self abuse
I feel no lightness
Days like this are priceless
Given myself licence to indulge in all my vices

Please don't mind me
I'm on borrowed time
It's space I need to validate my life
I wanna roll with the punches
Go rogue, programming
Change no I don't want it
Wanna break out
No I put my straightjacket on
And go home
I don't wannna be here no more
I don't wanna go

Straight jacket
Put on my straight jacket
I'm on a different planet
Let it go, don't panic
I'm fine
Can't hack it
My mind is at it again
I'm maniac, I'm maniac
Straight jacket
Put on my straight jacket
I'm on a different planet
Let it go, don't panic
I'm fine
Can't hack it
I'm manic, I'm manic

The devil's in my head
Stirring up a mess
Taking advantage of my unsteadiness
My readiness for death
The vans are pulling up
Fuck if I know why
I'm hearing cuckoo clocks
I'm seeing angels in the sky
The war is almost started
The cavalry's on time
Fight amongst the foot soldiers
But the war is in my mind
The war is in my mind

Straight jacket
Straight jacket
Straight jacket
Don't panic
Straight jacket
Straight jacket
Don't want it
