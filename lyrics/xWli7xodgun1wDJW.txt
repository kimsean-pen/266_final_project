You just wanna see me here by your side
You don't wanna be lonely, lonely, lonely
If you want to believe in heaven you'll find
That nobody is lonely lonely lonely

We live under the sun
We love you
You're just talk to me, talk to me

Tony, talk to me you've got super power
Talk to me, friend
Tony, talk to me you've got super power
Talk to me

Everybody he's gone it's time to give up
You don't wanna be lonely, lonely, lonely
You are feeling and down it's pushing you out
You don't wanna be lonely lonely lonely

We live under the sun
We love you
You're just talk to me, talk to me

Tony, talk to me you've got super power
Talk to me, friend
Tony, talk to me you've got super power
Talk to me

You've missed your chance, Tony
Bad silly boy
They are already coming for your soul
So run, baby, run
