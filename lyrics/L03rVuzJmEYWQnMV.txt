Good God, if your song leaves our lips
If your work leaves our hands
Then we will be wonders and vagabonds
They will stare and say how empty we are
How the freedom we had turned us up as dead men

Let us be cold, make us weak
Let us, because we all have ears
Let us, because we all have eyes
Good God!

How they knew that this would happen
They knew they knew that this would
How they knew that this would happen
They knew they knew that this would
(We're so run down)
How they knew that this would happen
They knew they knew that this would
(We're so run down)
How they knew that this would happen
They knew they knew that this would

Good God, Can you still get us home?
Good God, Can you still get us home?

Good god can you still get us home...
Good god can you still get us home...
Good god can you still get us home...
Good god can you still get us home...
Good god can you still get us home...
Good God can you still get us home...

STILL GET US HOME!
How can we still get home!
How can we still get home!
(I'm not dreaming)
How can we still get home!
How can we still get home!
(We're forgetting our forgiveness)
We're forgetting our Forgiveness!
(We're forgetting our forgiveness)
We're forgetting our Forgiveness!
