Fun times in Babylon
That's what I'm counting on
Before the dam goes up at the foot of the sea
Before the new wing of the prison ribbon ceremony
Before the star of the morning comes looking for me

I would like to abuse my lungs
Smoke everything inside with every girl I've ever loved
Ride around the wreckage on a horse knee-deep in mud
Look out Hollywood, here I come

Fun times in Babylon
Momma they've just begun
Before they put me to work in a government camp
Before they do my face up like a corpse and say "get up and dance"
Before the beast comes looking for last year's rent

I would like to abuse my lungs
Smoked everything inside with every girl I've ever loved
Ride around my wreckage on a horse knee-deep in mud
Look out Hollywood, here I come
Look out Hollywood, here I come
Look out Hollywood, here I come
