Crumbling, my heart
But under this tree
I see calmly waiting
Wondering, when I fall back in

Tell me did we see anything at all in the woods last night
Because they had got me believing
And now I don't even know my left from my right
I know, I can hear you
A ghost in my mind
I swear I can see you
But my love is like a kaleidoscope

I don't wanna feel this
You're the one that gives me hope
Visions in the darkness
My love is a kaleidoscope, kaleidoscope
Everytime I wake up, the more I see the less I know
I know
Visions in the darkness
My love is a kaleidoscope

May be, though the thunder
Ligthning strikes, the cracks in the ground
Some how we got closer
To working it out, there's a way around

Tell me did we see anything at all in the woods last night
Because they had got me believing
And now I don't even know my left from my right
I swear I can see you
But my love is a kaleidoscope

I don't wanna feel this
You're the one that gives me hope
Visions in the darkness
My love is a kaleidoscope, kaleidoscope
Everytime I wake up, the more I see the less I know
I know
Visions in the darkness
My love is a kaleidoscope

I don't wanna feel this
You're the one that gives me hope
Visions in the darkness
My love is a kaleidoscope
I don't wanna feel this
Visions in the darkness

My love is a kaleidoscope
My love is a kaleidoscope
Everytime I wake up, the more I see the less I know
I know
Visions in the darkness
My love is a kaleidoscope
