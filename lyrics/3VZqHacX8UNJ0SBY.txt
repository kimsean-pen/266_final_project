Feel the raindrops come falling down
See the sunshine through the clouds and ohh
And it feels like heaven

Feel the raindrops come falling down
See the sunshine through the clouds and ohh
And it feels like heaven

Tum tum tum tum
Yeah!

Feels like heaven

Feel the raindrops come falling down
See the sunshine through the clouds and ohh
And it feels like heaven

Feel the raindrops come falling down
See the sunshine through the clouds and ohh
And it feels like heaven

I can feel the raindrops
I can feel the raindrops
I can feel the raindrops
And it feels like heaven

I can feel the raindrops
I can feel the raindrops
I can feel the raindrops
And it feels like heaven

And time has no meaning
In a place called heaven
So free your mind
Just free your mind

Feel the raindrops come falling down
See the sunshine through the clouds and ohh
And it feels like heaven
