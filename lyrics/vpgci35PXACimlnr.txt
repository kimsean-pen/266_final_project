And I don't need you right now.
What's a few more years?
I'll do fine on my own somehow.
Don't worry about me.
And I can't find the words I need that tell me how I feel.
Convincing my heart that it's not my fault and praying none of this is real.
I'd like to wake up and be gone, like a real bad memory.
Like a nightmare in a dream.
I'd love to open up my eyes and see you right there next to me, being all I'll ever need.
And I can't keep this up for long and I won't even try.
To think that it only gets harder now but you won't ever see me cry.
I'd like to wake up and be gone, like a real bad memory.
Like a nightmare in a dream.
I'd love to open up my eyes and see you right there next to me, being all I'll ever need.
And don't you tell me it's all okay.
I can't hear a single word you say.
And I'll be the one that you won't forget.
And I'll make sure that you remember this.
I'd like to wake up and be gone, like a real bad memory.
Like a nightmare in a dream.
I'd love to open up my eyes and see you right there next to me, being all I'll ever need.
I'd like to wake up and be gone, like a real bad memory.
Like a nightmare in a dream.
I'd love to open up my eyes and see you right there next to me, being all I'll ever need.
Being all I'll ever need.
I don't need you right now.
