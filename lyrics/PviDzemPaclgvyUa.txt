Tell me a story

What must I do to take a holiday
show me a bill that they can make me pay
tell me a story
and maybe I'll believe it

Me I'm just a lucky guy
Young and free
too hard to cry

Lorna from my school she's 21
She's good looking and a married girl so
tell me a story
tell me stories
and man I ain't complaining

Me I'm just a lucky guy
Young and hard
too tough to cry

Standing in a show
the lights ain't low
they're shining down on me
and I like, I like it
just like I like I like it
I'm taking like I find it

What did they do to chill the joy away
what did they do to say you had to pay
and pay
and pay
Tell me stories
you know I never can believe them
never ever

Me I'm just a lucky guy
I'm young and free
too dumb to cry

What must I do to take a holiday
show me a bill that they can make me pay
tell me a story
and maybe I'll believe it

Me I'm just a lucky guy
I'm Young and free
too hard to cry
