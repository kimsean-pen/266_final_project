You know I love it when you are down on your knees
And I'm a junky for the way that you please
You shut me up when you swallow me down
My back to the wall, your going to town.

I Almost Told You That I Loved You
Thank God I didn't 'cause it would've been a lie
I say the damndest things when your on top of me
I Almost Told You That I Loved You.

I hate to say it but it has to be said
You look so fragile as I fuck with your head
I know it shouldn't but it's getting me off
If sex is the drug, then what is the cost.

I Almost Told You That I Loved You
Thank God I didn't 'cause it would've been a lie
I say the damndest things when your on top of me
I Almost Told You That I Loved You.

I'm not the one that you want
Not the one that you need
My love is like a fucking disease
You can give me your hand
You can make your demands
I'm the hardest muthafucka to please.

I Almost Told You That I Loved You
Thank God I didn't 'cause it would've been a lie
I say the damndest things when you're on top of me
I Almost Told You That I Loved You
I Almost Told You That I Loved You.

I'm not the one that you want, the one that you need.

Thank God I didn't 'cause it would've been a lie
I say the damndest things when your on top of me.

I'm not the one that you want the one that you need.

I Almost Told You That I Loved You.
