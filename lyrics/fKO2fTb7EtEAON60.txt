You wasted so much damn time on it
You wasted half your damn life
Now watch it fall to damn pieces, pieces

It's not about the love, you know
I can't turn on the water
Too many torn apart and thrown aside
In pieces, pieces

You wasted so much damn time on it
You wasted half your damn life
Now watch it fall to damn pieces, pieces

You wasted so much damn time on it
You wasted half your damn
Life
