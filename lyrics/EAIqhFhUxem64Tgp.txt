The sun is falling now
seems like you left the town
Why would you ever leave us
well it's nothing to discuss
'cause i know
that it's over

We won't forget you now
'cause you'll be right back
am I wrong
am I wrong saying
we will see you soon

These memories will fade
the sun won't shine today
my body starts to get pain
not going anywhere
there's nothing left to say

'cause I know
that its over

We won't forget you now
'cause you'll be right back
here again
here again
with us
we can't wait to see the flowers
and when that time is here
we'll be so glad to get out
get out when you come back to us
and hang out for those months of
hang out for those months of time

We won't forget you now
'cause you'll be right back
here again
here again with us
we can't wait to see the flowers
and when that time is here
we'll be so glad to get out
get out when you come back to us
and hang out for those months of
hang out for those months of time.
