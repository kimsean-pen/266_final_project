It's 8 AM, this hell I'm in
Seems I've crossed a line again
For being nothing more than who I am
So break my bones and throw your stones
We all know that life ain't fair
But there's more of us we're everywhere

We don't have to take this back against the wall
We don't have to take this we can end it all

All you'll ever be is a faded memory of a bully
Make another joke while they hang another rope so lonely
Push them to the dirt till the words don't hurt can you hear me
No one's gonna cry on the very day you die you're a bully

Think it through you can't undo
Whenever I see black and blue I feel the past, I share the bruise
With everyone who's come and gone
My head is clear my voice is strong, now I'm right here to right the wrong

We don't have to take this back against the wall
We don't have to take this we can end it all

All you'll ever be is a faded memory of a bully
Make another joke while they hang another rope so lonely
Push them to the dirt till the words don't hurt can you hear me
No one's gonna cry on the very day you die you're a bully

It's 8 AM, the hell I'm in
Your voice is strong, now right the wrong

All you'll ever be is a faded memory of a bully
Make another joke while they hang another rope so lonely
Push them to the dirt till the words don't hurt can you hear me
No one's gonna cry on the very day you die you're a bully

All you'll ever be is a faded memory of a bully
Make another joke while they hang another rope so lonely
Push them to the dirt till the words don't hurt can you hear me
No one's gonna cry on the very day you die you're a bully
We don't have to take this back against the wall
We don't have to take this we can end it all
We don't have to take this we can end it all
We don't have to take this we can end it all
We don't have to take this we can end it all
