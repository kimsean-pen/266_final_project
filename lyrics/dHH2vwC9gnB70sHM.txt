I been smokin' a lil bit
Yes, I been drinkin' a lil bit
Been on the bish for a lil bit
Yes, I been sinnin' a lil bit
I been grindin' a lil bit
Be on that cash for a lil bit
I might get broke just a lil bit
Don't tell the mama I'm doing it

I been on fire, depressed I been down I've been low, Brother
You been looking for that cream, for that cash, for that gold, further
I can't believe how I elevated on the low, realize
When I do work I work for myself not for them others, no lies
Tell em, tell em raw
We got that dope in the machine
We got it on the grow
I been believin', I been marchin'
I got it from my own
I can't believe my shit's poppin'
I be
Riding in the desert
Hiding in the desert
You looking for me aren't you?

I been smokin' a lil bit
Yes, I been drinkin' a lil bit
Been on the bish for a lil bit
Yes, I been sinnin' a lil bit
I been grindin' a lil bit
Be on that cash for a lil bit
I might get broke just a lil bit
Don't tell the mama I'm doing it

Wah gwan fo tonight
All the boys around myself be askin'
They want them girls around
Inna di club its going down
If we are rich or nah
All of that fire im seeing
Crashing and shooting a million
Like guns was a toy, you are tripping
You get stoned for the care about you
You laugh until the joke's on you baby
While they be cashing on dead bodies
You smash your head front on the TV
I don't need your school to study me
I am studying my own body
Favela ghetto and my city
Have nothing to prove, we are somebody
This money never loved no one back

I been smokin' a lil bit
Yes, I been drinkin' a lil bit
Been on the bish for a lil bit
Yes, I been sinnin' a lil bit
I been grindin' a lil bit
Be on that cash for a lil bit
I might get broke just a lil bit
Don't tell the mama I'm doing it

Chotto, Chotto, Chotto, Chotto
I be just a lil bit
Chotto, Chotto
I be just a lil bit
Chotto, Chotto, Chotto, Chotto
I be just a lil bit
Chotto, Chotto
I be just a lil bit

Me and the squad, lil bit, that's how we does it
Me and the squad, lil bit, that's how we does it
Me and the squad, lil bit, that's how we does it
Me and the squad, lil bit, that's how we does it
