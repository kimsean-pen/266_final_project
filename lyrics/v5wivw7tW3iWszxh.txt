Driven now by fetid winds
We came to this place of despair
Fresh visions of death
Filled my mind with disgust
Yet still we stood here and stared

A world steeped in torment
Where agony prevails
With cruel sadistic torture
All hope of life now fades

The time has come
You have no choice
Now you face your death
Choke at your last breath

Your mind now screams
Could it be you're insane
To live your life
Within the lost souls domain

Lost souls domain

Plead for mercy
To your gods now pray
For in this place
You now shall stay

No way out
Trapped within
This reign of terror
Shall now begin

Shall now begin

City of the damned
Hear the screams cry out
The agony within
Untold without a doubt

Feel your life
Slipping through your hands
A new reality
Held now by this land
