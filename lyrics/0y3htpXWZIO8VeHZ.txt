It's hard to believe
You could be such a disease
I can no longer separate what is real
Hope that fate will find me safe

All my reflections laugh at me
You made me hide my name

It just feels bad to say,
That there'll be another day

What you wanted was impossible to define
The words I hear are of scrambled letters
Guess it's been there for years
Never let me know, I was alright
What you wanted is a mystery to me
The words I hear are of scrambled letters
Guess it's been there for years
Never let me know, I was alright

Building a room with no doors
Is this the last of me?
Wring the rag for the last few drops
Falling into infinity

What you wanted was impossible to define
The words I hear are of scrambled letters
Guess it's been there for years
Never let me know, I was alright
What you wanted is a mystery to me
The words I hear are of scrambled letters
Guess it's been there for years
Never let me know, I was alright

[Solo]

What you wanted was impossible to define
The words I hear are of scrambled letters
Guess it's been there for years
Never let me know, I was alright
What you wanted is a mystery to me
The words I hear are of scrambled letters
Guess it's been there for years
Never let me know, I was alright
