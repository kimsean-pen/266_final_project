I lie awake looking back
God knows this
Life goes fast
Each day harder than the last

Breaking down in the dark
I don't know how I fell this far from heaven
Can't put the pieces back together
So you lie there and dream

Here's to the lonely
To the broken-hearted
I want you to know I feel your pain

Here's to the hopeless
The almost forgotten
To those who got lost along the way

I see you
I see you
I see you

City streets
And no one sees
We all just try to make believe
That it's all better than it seems

Black and white
We color in
We see the world the way we wanna see it
You either take it or you leave it

Is it all just a dream

Here's to the lonely
To the broken-hearted
I want you to know I feel your pain

Here's to the hopeless
The almost forgotten
To those who got lost along the way

I see you
I see you
I see you

Oh

When you're alone
And you can't go back home
At the end of the day
I'll remember your face

Here's to the lonely
To the broken-hearted
I want you to know, I know
I feel your pain

Oh

Here's to the hopeless
The almost forgotten
To those who got lost along the way

I see you
I see you
