Well, I see him every morning
In the schoolyard when the school bell rings
And when he passes in the hallway
Well, he doesn't seem to notice me
He's got a crush on my best friend
But she don't care
'Cause she loves someone else
I'm standing on the outside
Not the inside where I wanna be

Chorus:
Love's unkind
Love's unkind
Love's unkind
Love's unkind

'Cause he's not mine

Just the other day
I was praying he would give me a chance
Hoping he would choose me
For his partner for the high school dance
I was standing outside the class
But it wasn't me
But my best friend he asked
I went running back inside
Teary-eyed and left the two of them behind

Chorus

'Cause he's not mine

Oh, I love him so
But I can't even let him know
'Cause he loves my best friend
But she don't care
She loves someone else
And I asked my mama
And she said: "Love's unkind
Love's so unkind"
She said: "Just keep it in mind
'Cause you may find
Love's unkind"

Chorus

Why has love to be so?
Why do I have to love him so?
