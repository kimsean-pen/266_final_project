I feel the way you want me
I see that you are lonely
If you couldn't know, you'd leave with me
It's more than curiosity
And I never long for winter
Till your presence made me shiver
Untethered you'd be better if you'd only come with me

One night I will be the moon
Hanging over you
Spilling all over your body
Covering all your wounds
One night I will be the star
Falling where you are
Swimming in the deep of my love
Filling your empty heart
One night, one night, one night
One night, one night, one night

You've come so close to tasting
Now my innocence is breaking
Like the ocean in a perfect storm
It makes me want you even more
I've never been so jealous
I've never felt so helpless
So out of breath and hungry for you

One night I will be the moon
Hanging over you
Spilling all over your body
Covering all your wounds
One night I will be the star
Falling where you are
Swimming in the deep of my love
Filling your empty heart
One night, one night, one night
One night, one night, one night

Hurry the sun
It's waking
Darling don't leave me waiting

One night I will be the moon
Hanging over you
Spilling all over your body
Covering all your wounds
One night I will be the star
Falling where you are
Swimming in the deep of my love
Filling your empty heart
One night, one night, one night
One night, one night, one night
