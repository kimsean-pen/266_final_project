Everybody's waiting on me to see what I can do
Everybody's talking about it
I can hear the whispers in the room
But you say go slow, go slow
Take all the time you need
Don't you know, yeah you know
It's in you that I believe

And so I, I never want to let you down
You live so deep in the heart of me
I just need to tell you now
All I want to do is make you proud
All I want to do is make you proud

I can't avoid the disappointments
It happened to everyone
But it's in your eyes where I
Find the strength to keep me strong
When you say go slow, go slow
Please don't forget to breathe
Yeah, you know in this home
Can never be afraid to dream
Never be afraid to dream

And so I, I never want to let you down
You live so deep in the heart of me
I just need to tell you now
All I want to do is make you proud
And even when I'm all alone
I can hear your voice inside of me
More than anything right now
All I want to do is make you proud
Proud

And so I, I'm never gonna let you down
You know every little part of me
And as the crowd gathers round
All I wanna do is make you proud
I never wanna let you down
You live so deep in the heart of me
I just need to tell you now
All I want do is make you proud
Proud
