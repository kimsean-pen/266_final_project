Love comes close to you
Your love it makes me stronger
No matter what we're going through
I won't look back won't look won't look back
I won't look back won't look won't look back

You make me wanna live forever
You're my remedy to yesterday
Now my struggle seems so far away
And life will never be the same

Living it up, living it up, living it up
Life ain't a party, you're the passion by my side
Living it up, living it up, living it up
Life ain't a party, you're the passion by my side

Love comes close to you
Your love it makes me stronger
No matter what we're going through
I won't look back won't look won't look back
I won't look back won't look won't look back

I wish love was always this easy
But every now and then it brings us down
But I know that I can count on you
To keep the music playing on

Living it up, living it up, living it up
Life ain't a party, you're the passion by my side
Living it up, living it up, living it up
Life ain't a party, you're the passion by my side

Love comes close to you
Your love it makes me stronger
No matter what we're going through
I won't look back won't look won't look back
I won't look back won't look won't look back
