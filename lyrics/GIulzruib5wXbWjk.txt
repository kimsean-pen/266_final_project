Has love intentionally shown me that
He or she hides in a the melody
We say it's hard to find, you know that love divine
That we're all talking about

Well, I been wasting all of my time
'Cause music's my Mr. Right
And I know this love will love me right

Confused my mind with ease
It's taken over me happily, happily baby
Happily play for me, happily play for me
Happily baby, happily play for me
Play for me Charlie, play for me baby
Happily, happily, happily, happily baby

I love the way you walk
(I love the way you're walking)
I love the way you talk
(You love the way I talk)

I love the way you move
(I love the way you move)
I love the way you groove
(You love the way I groove)

Hey, woman
(Hey)
Got my eyes on you
(Got your eyes on me)

I love the way you walk
(I love the way you walk too)
I love the way you talk
(I love the way you talk)
