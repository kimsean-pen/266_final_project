I'm not letting go entirely
(?) you and me
The clock is ticking and I think I can feel
My hands grow numb but I'm still (?)

It's getting hard to think of you
What I need to make it through
The clock is burning but what can we do?
All the things we never should

Now where did you go?
I wanted to know
There's something at all
Just beyond that wall
Than love

Tell me truly there's no way
Nothing I can do or say
Close just another thing to choose
Another thing that you can lose

Now where did you go?
I wanted to know
There's something at all
Just beyond that wall
Than love
