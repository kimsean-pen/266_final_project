Saviour of the Night came slowly on the silent river
And the Lord of Life came following, his sins to be forgiven
While the world sat back and laughed away the hours
Till the dawning of the daybreak

I heard them laugh I heard them cry
I saw them praying to the sky
I heard the wind howl in the trees
Down there on bended knee, and see the light
But I know I must be dreaming

Feel the soul, quiet emotion
Sail on by, helpless devotion
If that's how it feels, it better be real

Take care of your woman or you'll never, ever see the light
Take heed of the warnin' or you know it's gonna be too late
Too late
It's too late, it's too late
It's too late, it's too late

Here, there, everywhere
They keep on movin' without fear
They look me up, they look me down
They press my body to the ground but I see the light
See the light, it's comin' shinin'

And on a summer's day, when thoughts are driftin' far away
And life is good and real to see
My world is saved and I am free
But in the night
Still I know I must be dreaming, yeah

Feel the soul, quiet emotion
Sail on by, helpless devotion
If that's how it feels, it better be real

Take care of your woman or you'll never, ever see the light
Take heed of the warnin' or you know it's gonna be too late
Too late

It's too late, it's too late
It's too late, it's too late
It's too late, it's too late
Too late
