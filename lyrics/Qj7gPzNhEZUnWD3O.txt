You're not certain when you feel
Hurt yet violent when you deal
With how the world drags you along
You're not alone

And nothing good was ever free
No one gets it, no one sees
So here you stand, beloved freak
You're not alone
You're not alone
You're not alone

Sometimes we get so tired and weak
We lose the sky and leave our feet
You're not alone

Every come upthrows your work
And scars our vision 'cross the dark
And when we're gone we will remain
You're not alone
People lie and people steal
They misinterpret how you feel
And so we doubt and we conceal
You're not alone

Don't worry for me
Just think of yourself
Think of yourself
Don't worry for me
Just think of yourself
Think of yourself

When we're gone we will remain
When we're gone we will remain
When we're gone we will remain
When we're gone we will remain
So here you stand, beloved freak
The world is at your feet
Here you stand, beloved freak
The world is at your feet
This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine
This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine
This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine
Let it shine
Let it shine
Let it shine

And so you stand, beloved freak
The world lying at your feet
There you stand, beloved freak
Let it shine
Let it shine
Let it shine
