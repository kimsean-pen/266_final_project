why keep on breaking my heart?
when it's beating for you
only you

why do you toy with my dreams
they're depending on you to come true

when you invaded my mind
you took over complete control

then i surrender to you
all my dreams, my heart and soul

please say
there's a chance some day you may feel just the way
that i do

but why keep on breaking my heart
when it's beating for you
only you

why keep on breaking my heart
when it's beating for you
only you
