Their chloroform
Sub to counterpart
That one's not too hard

Their chloroform
Come to mean remorse
(Unintelligible) ants with tar

Beside those
(Unintelligible)
I'll use it
There, there

Caused and afraid
Since I'm being portrayed
(Unintelligible) away

Their chloroform
Something to desire
(Unintelligible)

Beside those
(Unintelligible)
I'll use it
There, there

Beside those
(Unintelligible)
I'll use it
There, there

There, there
There, there
