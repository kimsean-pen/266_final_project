Take me soft beyond the surface
Play me out for what it's worth
So I feel that I'm love

A diamond in the darkness
Lead me back, I might make it to
To the light

'Cause I love, love, love, love, love, I love
Oh, I love, I know now
Treading Lightly
Just so you know

Take me soft beyond the surface
I'm falling in and out for a minute
Of what do you do, do you not?
Darling leave the night off
Feeling on and I decide on you
That I love

'Cause I love, love, love, love, love, I love
Oh, I love, I know now
Treading Lightly
Just so you know
'Cause I'm falling in and out for a minute
And down for the night
Oh I'm falling in and out for a minute
And out for the evening, down for the night

Take me soft beyond the surface
Play me out for what it's worth
So I feel that I'm love

I know, I know
But Treading Lightly
Just so you know
I know, I know
