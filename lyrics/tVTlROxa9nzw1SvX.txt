Nothing really wrong with the state of your ambition
The whole world is crumbling, 'cause your crazy vision
All wars are boys and death is what you hate most

Come on, baby
Don't you want to get a new size?
A new size?
A new size?
A new size?

It's a crazy world
For a mixed up boy and a mixed up girl
It's a crazy world
For a mixed up boy and a mixed up girl

So you got no God, you got no love to tell me off
But you've got that spirit so please, stick with it
This world wouldn't be
A world without you in it

Please, shelter me
Please, shelter me
I found this crazy world

It's chewing on my brain like a desert drained locust
I find it hard to love
I find it hard to focus
The whole world is crumbling
'Cause their crazy visions

Come on, baby
Don't you want to get a new size?
A new size?
A new size?
A new size?

It's a crazy world
For a mixed up boy and a mixed up girl
It's a crazy world
For a mixed up boy and a mixed up girl

So you got no God, you got no love to tell me off
But you've got that spirit so please, stick with it
This world wouldn't be
A world without you in it

Please, shelter me
Please, shelter me
I found this crazy world

You got to keep your spirit
There ain't a world without you in it
You got to keep your spirit
There ain't a world without you in it

So you got no God, you got no love to tell me off
But you've got that spirit so please, stick with it
This world wouldn't be
A world without you in it

Please, shelter me
Please, shelter me
Shelter me
Shelter me
Shelter me
Shelter me

Shelter me
Shelter me
Shelter me
Shelter me

It's a crazy world
For a mixed up boy and a mixed up girl
For a mixed up boy and a mixed up girl
For a mixed up boy and a mixed up girl
For a mixed up boy and a mixed up girl
For a mixed up boy and a mixed up girl
For a mixed up boy and a mixed up girl
