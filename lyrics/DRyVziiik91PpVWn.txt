The blue pill opens your eyes
Is there a better way?
A new religion prescribed
To those without the faith
A hero holding a knife
And blood is not enough
Is it too late to go back?
Is it too late to go?

There's no-one here (there's no-one here)
And people everywhere (people everywhere)
You're on your own

Let's see if I'm hearing this right
Is it just that I should take
The never-ending supply
To carry out the dead
Your idols burn in the fire
The mob comes crawling up
I'm reclaiming my mind
Destroying everyone

There's no-one here (there's no-one here)
And people everywhere (people everywhere)
You're all alone
