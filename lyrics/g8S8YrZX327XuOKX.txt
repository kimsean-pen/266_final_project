Every day brings change,
And the world puts on a new face,
Certain things rearange,
And the world seems like a new place.

Secretly I've been trailing you,
Like a Fox that preys on a Rabbit,
I had to get you, and so I knew,
I had to learn all your ways and all your habbits.

You're the catch that I was after,
I looked up and I was in yout arms,
And I know I was captured.

What's this whole world coming to,
Things just ain't the same,
Anytime the hunter gets captured by the game.

I had laid such a tender trap,
Hoping you might fall into it,
But love hit me with a sudden slap,
Just one of your kisses and baby I knew it.

My plan did'nt work out like I thought,
I had laid my trap for you,
But it seems, baby, I got caught.

What's this whole world coming to,
Things just ain't the same,
Anytime the hunter gets captured by the game.

You're the catch that I was after,
I looked up and I was in yout arms,
And I know I was captured.

What's this whole world coming to,
Things just ain't the same,
Anytime the hunter gets captured by the game.

You're the catch that I was after,

And I know I was captured.

What's this whole world coming to,
Things just ain't the same,
Anytime the hunter gets captured by the game.
