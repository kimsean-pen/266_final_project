i did join the race
hunting for success
selling dreams was all i knew
for the rising stars and i did work hard/my important part
all my feelings are with you

where i am
where you are

and i changed my life
and i moved outside
where the water is clear and pure
where the lands are wide
where the air is bright
all my feelings are with you

where i am
where you are

and i walk up the hill
and i can't stand still
'till the day of our last rendez-vous
and the leaves turn red
and i bow my head
all my feelings are with you

where i am
where you are
