Yesterday, when you were young
Everything you needed done was done for you.
Now you do it on your own
But you find you're all alone
What can you do?

You and me walk on, walk on, walk on
Cause you can't go back now.

You know there will be days when you're so tired that you can't take another step
The night will have no stars and you'll think you've gone as far as you will ever get

But you and me walk on, walk on, walk on
Cause you can't go back now

And yeah, yeah, go where you want to go. yeah, yeah, be what you want to be
If you ever turn around, you'll see me.

I can't really say why everybody wishes they were somewhere else
But in the end, the only steps that matter are the ones you take all by yourself
And you and me walk on, walk on, walk on
Yeah you and me walk on, walk on, walk on
Cause you can't go back now
Walk on, walk on, walk on
You can't go back now
