First I'm killing it
Confidence gotta have it
One in a million yeah
Anything I want
I'm gonna get it
No ceilings yeah
Remember when I was timid
But I know who I am and just how I did
And I'm getting all love yeah
No kidding
I'm living on the other side

They can't tell me tell me tell me
Tell me how to get it done
Listen baby baby baby
I'm as strong as they will come
They can't tell me tell me tell me
Who I am and what I've done
Because baby baby baby baby
I'm the only one

They wondering
How do I make it so easy
証明するわ
描いている未来で
全てをChanceに変える
強さのStyleを知った
And that's why I make it so easy

Same RIRI NEO feeling
Best life I'm gonna live it
You can't say nothing
Cause I'm never changing
What are you gone do about it
And every single day
Making sure that they know
I'm in the building
I do what I want
And now I'm getting all love yeah
No matter what I'm gonna be alright

They can't tell me tell me tell me
Tell me how to get it done
Listen baby baby baby
I'm as strong as they will come
They can't tell me tell me tell me
Who I am and what I've done
Because baby baby baby baby
We're the only one

They wondering
How do I make it so easy
証明するわ
描いている未来で
一つも迷いはないわ
全て真実に変える
And that's why I make it so easy

Yes, everything has precious meaning for you
運命は君を信じ歩んでる
Don't pass the precious moment that's made for you
For you for you for you

They wondering
How do I make it so easy
証明するわ
描いている未来で
全てをChanceに変える
強さのStyleを知った
And that's why I make it so easy
