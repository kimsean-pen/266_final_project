Lately
Life moves slowly, I stop to smell a rose
Inhale
Press its thorns against my nose

Stood in one place
Careless change

Can't escape, I'm a part of you
Engraved in the stone
Do you feel it too?

Stood in one place
Restrained
Roses, like me
Need rain

Try hard not to care
The world won't cease to turn
A name you didn't choose
Is left in place of you

Can't escape
Careless change
