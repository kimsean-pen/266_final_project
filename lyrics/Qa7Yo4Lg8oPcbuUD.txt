Oh, quiet down, I've had enough
I guess it's now or never
I've been around, I've settled up
I'll bolt soon or later

I took a photograph of me
When I was only nineteen
I looked a little lost at sea
I keep trying to find me

So pray for me brother
I need redemption
I'm just a man
A man on a mission
I want no trouble
I want no trouble
I want no trouble
I want no trouble

Pray for me sister
Give me a mention
I got no faith
And oh, did I mention
I want no trouble
I want no trouble
I want no trouble
I want no trouble

Oh, pack it up and hit the road
And only take my lighter
I've seen the glitz, I've seen the glam
But I prefer the pay dirt

I took a photograph of me
When I was only nineteen
I looked a little lost at sea
I keep trying to find me
So pray for me brother
I need redemption
I'm just a man
A man on a mission
I want no trouble
I want no trouble
I want no trouble
I want no trouble

Pray for me sister
Give me a mention
I got no faith
And oh, did I mention
I want no trouble
I want no trouble
I want no trouble
I want no trouble

Maybe you could save my soul
From all the things that I don't know
Maybe you could save my soul
From all the things that I don't know

So pray for me brother
I need redemption
I'm just a man
A man on a mission
I want no trouble
I want no trouble
I want no trouble
I want no trouble

Pray for me sister
Give me a mention
I got no faith
And oh, did I mention
I want no trouble
I want no trouble
I want no trouble
I want no trouble
