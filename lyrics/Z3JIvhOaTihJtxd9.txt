Remember walking hand in hand side by side
We walked the dogs and took long strolls to the park
Except we never had dogs
And never went to the park

Remember how we used to fuck all night long
Neither do I because I always passed out
I needed lots of the booze
To handle the pain

You don't have to pretend to care
You don't have to say things that you don't mean
You don't have to pretend to care
You don't have to say things that you don't mean
It just embarrasses me
And makes you look like a fool

Remember when the tenderness stopped
And the kindness turned to pity and disgust
And the smiles were stopped
Before they could start

And understanding was now just a tool
We used it every chance we got to be cruel
And we crinched because
We couldn't make ourselves stop

You don't have to pretend to care
You don't have to say things that you don't mean
You don't have to pretend to care
You don't have to say things that you don't mean
It just embarrasses me
And makes you look like a fool

There are days when I think about you
And on those days I really feel like a fool
Because you don't deserve
To have somebody think about you

I feel so stupid cause I let myself down
I acted like a motherfucking clown
At a circus
On the outskirts sometimes

You don't have to pretend to care
You don't have to say things that you don't mean
You don't have to pretend to care
You don't have to say things that you don't mean
It just embarrasses me
Because you think you're so cool
