Rusted brandy in a diamond glass
Everything is made from dreams
Time is made from honey slow and sweet
Only the fools know what it means

Temptation, temptation, temptation
Oh, temptation, temptation, I can't resist
I know that she is made of smoke
But I've lost my wayy

She knows that I am broke
So that I must play

Temptation, temptation, temptation
Oh, whoa, temptation, temptation, I can't resist

Dutch pink and Italian blue
She is waiting there for you
My will has disappeared
Now my confusions oh so clear
Temptation, temptation, temptation
Whoa, whoa, temptation, temptation
I can't reisist
