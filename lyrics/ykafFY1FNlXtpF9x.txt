You're off to set the record straight
Hurling down the road
Your mind is heaving heavily
You will is getting old
Still you bother
Still you wish to be clear
Still you bother
To make it disappear
You're done accepting casualties
The living should live
You've seen the executioner
Permitted to forgive
Still you bother
Still you wish to be clear
Still you bother
To make it disappear
Ending themes
Find me constantly
(Look through this red window)
Stormy day
Sweep the burst away
(Steer through this red water)
Still you bother
Still you wish to be clear
Still you bother
To make it disappear
