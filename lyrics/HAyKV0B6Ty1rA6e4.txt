Oh yeah
It's my favorite feeling
Not there
What a good place to be
Too bad it's still raining inside

Alcohol

So cool
It gets better to be here
Come to
When there's nothing to say
Too bad i forgot what i's thinking

Alcohol

Sunning in the messy surroundings
Easy
It's just somewhere to be
Oh yeah
There is always another
One
Mmmmm

You look like your self from the inside
Turning into something you feel
Too bad there's this image to live with

Alcohol

I'm gone
Started feeling peculiur
Oh yeah
It's my favorite thing
Too bad
I got nowhere today
