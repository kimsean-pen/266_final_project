I guess you're late but wasn't invited
To get out your way I did everything
But I've been falling in love with you every day

It wasn't easy, I know
Some of those nights have probably seemed impossible
I've been falling in love with you every day

If it's unknown, so concern
I turn back around
I'm climbing on the walls that I've built
To keep you out
And all the bridges you, you tried to burn
Al fallen down
It's you and me now

Next to you I want to lye
I'm your shoulder when I need to cry
I'm so happy that you came
To ease the darkness and ease the pain
I've been falling in love with you
Falling in love with you
Falling in love with you

Falling in love
Falling in love with you every day

I've been falling in love with you every day
