Baby got our head down
Baby got our head down to the ground
Looking for a stranger
Looking for a stranger to love

You got to dot your i's and cross your t's
Gotta let go, come with me
Looking for a stranger
Looking for a stranger to love

You say you want it, but
You can't get it in
You got yourself a bad habit for it
Oh look at you, walking up and down the pole
A saying please save me,
(one bad habit)
You say you want it, but
You can't get in
(one bad habit)
You got yourself a bad habit for it
Look at you walking up and down the pole
I say breathe
Oh man, oh man, oh man
You know I wish I had it all!
