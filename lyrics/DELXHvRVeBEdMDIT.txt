Let there be you, let there be me
Let there be oysters under the sea
Let there be wind, an occasional rain
Chile con carne, sparkling champagne

Let there be birds to sing in the trees
Someone to bless me whenever I sneeze
Let there be cuckoos, a lark, and a dove
But first of all, please
Let there be love

Let there be cuckoos, a lark, and a dove
But first of all, please
Let there be love, love, love
Let there be love
