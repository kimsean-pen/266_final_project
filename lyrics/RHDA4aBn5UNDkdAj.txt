When we're driving
You're saying, 'go faster'
And when we're singing to the radio
You're saying, 'make it louder'

And you roll another one
You wanna get higher
And when I need the fire
You're always my lighter

When we're rolling
You always put your feet on mine
And when I'm running late
You always remind me of the time
When I'm feeling low
You lift me to the moon and back
Back into your arms, I won't let go
Until I know how much you really love me, baby

I see
A light

And I've heard
We never truly see ourselves
We gotta leave it up to someone else
To know how beautiful you really are, baby
We never get to see ourselves
Sleeping peacefully, next to the ones that we love
We never see us cry, when someone dies, see us crying
Someone new is born, baby

When we're driving
You're saying, 'go faster'
And when we're singing to the radio
You're saying, 'turn it louder'

And you roll another one
You wanna get higher
And when I need the fire
You're always my lighter

I see
A light
Coming towards me
Moving slowly
But coming quickly at the same time
I think it represents what's going on in my mind
When we're together
Everything is so sweet
There's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
As long as I've got you, and you've got me, baby
I could leave here, I don't need nothing nothing but you
When you're starting out beyond, just us two
Forever gets complicated
It don't have to be that way, baby

I see
A light
Coming towards me
Moving slowly
But coming quickly at the same time
I think it represents what's going on in my mind
What's going on in my mind
I think it represents what's going on in my mind
What's going on in my mind
I think it represents what's going on in my mind
What's going on in my mind...
