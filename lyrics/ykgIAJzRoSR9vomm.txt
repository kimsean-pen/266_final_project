Now that we're doomed
Let me show you to your room
Where we can implode by the moon
I'm a self-obsessed mess
And you can't sleep for shit
And we're both gladly losing our minds

We sure have a strange time
But we sure do it right
We sure have a strange time
We're getting stranger every night

Tonight I'll be drunk
And act like a punk (so drunk)
And you'll sit and laugh while I throw up
They say I'm too old for my age
And you're just the same
Yet we make love like kids, again and again

We sure have a strange time
But we sure do it right
We sure have a strange time
We're getting stranger every night

And I'm naked now, on your fine red couch and you
Put your body to me
You put your body to me
I'm naked now on your fine red couch and you
You can see right through me

Come on now, lets just have a strange time
Oh it's just right if we deface our minds
We can have a strange time
And get stranger every night
And get stranger every night
