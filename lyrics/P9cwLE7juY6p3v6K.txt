Oh I think it's courageous of you
Your thoughts are contagious
When you don't really know what to do
But you keep going through the stages

'nd anyway, anyday
I wish I was (ooo)
Anyone else instead of myself
Oh I keep feeling...

(the beats, beats)
You're gonna hurt yourself, it's not your birthday baby
(the beats, beats)
If there is nothing wrong, why am I down so long?

If I could ever be honest
There is not enough space or time
I could roll down the river of our
secrets, for miles, and miles, and miles
Said there is no virtue, no drawn lines
You said that no one could hurt you, but I do it all the time

(the beats, beats)
You're gonna hurt yourself, it's not your birthday baby
(the beats, beats)
If there is nothing wrong, why am I down so long?

'nd anyway, anyday
I wish I was (ooo)
Anyone else instead of myself
I wish I was (ooo)
And anyway, anyday (I wish I was (ooo))
Anyone else instead of myself
And I keep feeling...

(the beats, beats)
You're gonna hurt yourself, it's not your birthday baby
(the beats, beats)
If there is nothing wrong, why am I down so long?
