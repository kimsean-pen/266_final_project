When I hear the sounds of every peace and every art,
Every moment for God
Every word is picked out for me

When I hear the crowd
When I see my brothers proud
When our freedom is allowed
Every cell is blowing out in me

I want more
Forever
I want more

Forever more
Forever more
Life makes it harder
Don't make it harder
I say
Hopefully

So why was I afraid
to get stuck in my own shade
To be late on your parade
I refuse to be upset
Too late
Too late

I want more
Forever
I want more

Forever more
Forever more
Life makes it harder
Don't make it harder
I say
Hopefully
Forever more
Forever more
Life makes it harder
Don't make it harder
I say
Hopefully

I know who I am
And I know where I belong
I am who I am
No matter right or wrong
right or wrong
