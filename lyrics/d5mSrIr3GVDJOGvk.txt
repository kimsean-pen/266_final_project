You've been living
Right beneath my feet
I've been waiting
For the chance that we could meet
You came upstairs
To fix the hole in my roof
Oooh baby, to tell you the truth
I wanna kiss you all over!
Oh yes I do, oh yes I do
And here it is baby
Here's the pro-oooh-oof!

Now that it's on
My love is so strong
No-one can move me
In the way that you have
Don't want your rent money baby
Under my door
I don't wanna be your landlord anymore

I just wanna be
Your lover baby
I want you with me
No other lady
I don't mind if you never have a dime
I've met alot of rich men
In my time
Had a whole bunch of girls
They would call their prize
But they don't do nothing for me baby,
Like you do with your ey-yyy-yes!

Now that it's on
My love is so strong

No-one can move me
In the way that you have
Don't want your rent money baby
Under my door
I don't wanna be your landlord anymore
I don't wanna be your landlord anymore

Never call you sweetheart
No more Mr. Brown
And we can go out dancing
All over town
Since so long ago
I would lie in my bed
Thinking about you
Five floors down
Tossing and turning
You were messing with my head!

Now that it's on
See I love you so strong
And no-one can move me
In the way that you have
Don't want your rent money baby
Don't put it under my door
I don't wanna be your landlord anymore
I don't wanna be your landlord anymore
I don't wanna be your landlord anymore

I don't wanna be your landlord anymore
No I don't, no I don't uh
