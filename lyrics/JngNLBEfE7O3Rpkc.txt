You gotta wonder what I'm up to when I'm out of sight
I met a girl at work, who really wet my appetite
I got her number sent her phone a cheeky photo
Hey fella who you talking to? I dunno
And now you've got another of the kind of guy I'm really like

Take your time, while I sweat and wait and wonder
Would you jump overboard?
What a mess I made
Can't take what a mess I made, made, made
The whole truth would break your heart
Don't know what to say
Don't know what to say, say, say
You were devestated I could not be sorrier
You forgave me and I really couldn't ask for more
So I took aside the girl from work and told her
Whatever she thought we had going was over
And then she started kissing me I couldn't tell her how to stop
I wasn't good enough I wasn't good

Go down that line, devise some plan some way to tell you
So take your time, while I sweat and wait and wonder
Would you jump overboard?
What a mess I made
Can't take what a mess I made, made, made
The whole truth would break your heart
Don't know what to say
Don't know what to say, say, say

I need times where I'll teach me how to treat you better
Made my mind up, stay silent, we'll grow old together

Would you jump overboard?
What a mess I made
Can't take what a mess I made, made, made
The whole truth would break your heart
Don't know what to say
Don't know what to say, say, say

Would you jump overboard?
What a mess I made
Can't take what a mess I made, made, made
To lose you would break my heart
Never played away
Never played away, way, way

I need times where I'll teach me how to treat you better
Made my mind up, stay silent, we'll grow old together
