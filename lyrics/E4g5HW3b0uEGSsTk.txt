Everybody tells me that it's so hard to make it
It's so hard to break in
There's no way to fake it
Everybody tells me that it's wrong what I'm feelin'
I shouldn't believe in the dreams that I'm dreamin'
I hear it everyday
I hear it all the time
But they're never gonna change my mind, no

Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know, something I don't know
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know, something I don't know
Like how many inches in a mile
What it takes to make you smile
I guess get you not treat me like a child baby
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know, something I don't know

Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know

Everybody tells me I don't know I'm doing
This life I'm pursing
The odds I'll be losing
Everybody tells me that it's one in a million, no
One in a billion (oh)
One in a zillion
I hear it everyday
I hear it all the time
But they're never gonna change my mind, no

Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know, something I don't know
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know, something I don't know
Like how many inches in a mile
What it takes to make you smile
I guess get you not treat me like a child baby
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know, something I don't know

Rapper: Selena hits the track like Katrina makin' waves
Like Cold Medina make 'em say "I'm ready (what)"
Are you ready for it?
Selena: Yeah I'm ready for it
Rapper: Really for it?
Selena: Yeah I'm ready for it (for it, for it, for it)

I'm on my way
I know I'm gonna there someday
It won't be easy

Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know, something I don't know
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know (tell me)
Something I don't know, something I don't know
Like how many inches in a mile
What it takes to make you smile
I guess get you not treat me like a child baby
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know, something I don't know

Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know, something I don't know
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know, something I don't know
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know, something I don't know
Tell me...
