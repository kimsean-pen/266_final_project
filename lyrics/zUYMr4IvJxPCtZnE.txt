Excuse me, your honor and jury, pass all your judgment
I've been examined, interrogated my entire life
I never look at your verdict, but bailiffs, sometimes they read them
And when I hear your thoughts on me, I want to personally say

When you doubt me, it makes me better
When you hate me, it makes me stronger

One more round
Kick me when I'm down
But I already won
When my name rolled off your tongue

You're a kid from the future, you're passive, and you're afraid
Sound so bold when you're on paper, crumble when face to face
Yeah, I'm from the past where words were backed by confrontation
So when I hear your thoughts on me, I'm going to personally say

When you doubt me, it makes me better
When you hate me, it makes me stronger

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Take a walk in my shoes
Oh, oh, oh, oh
See how many steps you'll get through
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You wouldn't make it a block without begging to stop
Me from throwing stones
