It seems like every story told about us
Isn't meant to be
We fly on wings of gold all the way back home to me

But what I'm thinking of just this time
Why don't you lay your head down in my arms? In my arms
Lay your head down in my arms, in my arms

You know my love this was no dream of mine
But the way you ride those waves
Makes me want to follow you blind

And what I'm thinking of just this time
Why don't you lay your head down in my arms? In my arms
Lay your head down in my arms

Lay your head down in my arms, in my arms
Lay your head down in my arms

Lay your head down in my arms, in my arms
Lay your head down in my arms, in my arms
Lay your head down, lay your head down in my arms
