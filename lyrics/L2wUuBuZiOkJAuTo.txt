I'm tired of tugging my hair
And scratching my neck 'til it's red
And I'm wired from all of the coffee
I'm funneling into my head
My legs are jelly at night
From boogiein' straight into bed
And I try to straighten it out
And get tangled all over again

Some shit lingers
Just a little bit (little bit)
Way too long
Nibblin' fingers
When nothing's wrong

I should have bought you a boomerang
I should have bought you a boomerang
Spin around and around and around
Right back to you, it might never do
Spin around and around and around

One down, good valorous lives
A moment with all of my friends
And I'm up at three in the morning
For SeaQuest reruns

Some shit lingers
Just a little bit (little bit)
Way too long
Nibblin' fingers
When nothing's wrong

I should have bought you a boomerang
I should have bought you a boomerang
Spin around and around and around
Right back to you, and I never do
Spin around and around and around
