She
Was only seventeen
Oh, why are girls in songs always seventeen?

She
Was from a movie scene
And now she plays in my head all day

She called me up
And let me in
I couldn't feel my legs

She walked me back
Into her room
But just to see
A 1980s horror film

I
Oh, I was so scared
She had the curtains down
So there was no glare

She pulled up a chair
And gave me the bed
And all these crazy things
Went through my head

It seems so long
I need someone
I don't know what to say

She was sitting there
I could touch her hair
But still we watched
A 1980s horror film

Jamie
I don't know what to say to you
I feel
You're always on my mind

And now that I know what I need
I'm taking the long way round in my mind
It's not right

I can't help the way I feel anymore
And I need to ask you, Jamie:
Oh, can it be that you feel this way, too?

The lights were off
The mood was right
She came and laid with me

I looked into her eyes
Tried to make her mine
But then she said
"I'm really not that into guys."
