The drumming deceives you
The blood in your veins
And it pounds in a tattoo
It brings you to rags

And the
Guilt parade
The guilt parade
Parade, parade

The happy monotony
It drags like a nail
And it ladders your mealy mouth
Into splintering smiles

And the
Guilt parade
The guilt parade
Parade, parade

Wave and say hello
Wave and say hello
Wave and say hello
Wave and say hello
