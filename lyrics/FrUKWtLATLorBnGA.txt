got this feeling
when i heard your name the other day
couldn't say it
couldn't make it go away

it's a hard place
can't be friends we can't be enemies
it's just too much
i feel the weight crushing down on my face

the hardest part is things already said
getting better worse i cannot tell
why do good things never wanna stay?
some things you lose, some things you give away

broken pieces
try to make it good again
is it worth it?
will it make me sick today?

it's a dumb song
but i'll write it anyway
it's an old mistake
but we always make it -- why do we?

this time it'll be alright
this time it'll be okay
