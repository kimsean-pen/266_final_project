Hey, hey
She had her eyes on the prize as the girl next door
You grow up quick when you grow up poor
It's the only way to LA that she knows
The Hollywood pose, teeth, tits, and toes

Didn't take her long to leave the boulevard
So many five star friends with black credit cards
She'd try anythin' once 'cause anythin' goes
It never comes easy when you're diggin' for gold

Hey, hey
Well, she ain't no Cinderella when she's gettin' undressed
'Cause she rocks it like the naughty wicked witch of the west
Far too pretty to be givin' it cheap
That's why she's makin' six figures workin' three days a week

Yeah, she'd even break a promise in the promised land
She didn't make it this far by just shakin' hands
She'd shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can
She didn't make it this far by just shakin' hands

Hey, hey
I doubt she'd even let the devil buy her little black book
City hall would probably fall off if anyone got a look
Every A list player is a favorite friend
Says they all taste the same in the back of a vans

A congressman would call her every once in a while
Got the school girl skirt on the top of the pile
She's done everyone once and everyone knows
You gotta get a little dirty when you're diggin' for gold

Hey, hey
Well, she ain't no Cinderella when she's gettin' undressed
'Cause she rocks it like the naughty wicked witch of the west
Far too pretty to be givin' it cheap
That's why she's makin' six figures workin' three days a week

Yeah, she'd even break a promise in the promised land
She didn't make it this far by just shakin' hands
She'd shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can
She didn't make it this far by just shakin' hands

Well, someone spilled the beans and now her name's in the press
Tough to keep it all a secret when you're one of the best
The judge is goin' easy 'cause he paid for her chest
Yeah, he loves his little naughty wicked witch of the west
Far to pretty to be givin' it cheap
That's why she's makin' six figures workin' three days a week
Yeah, she'd even break a promise in the promised land
She didn't make it this far by just shakin' hands
She'd shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can
She didn't make it this far by just shakin' hands
She'd shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can
She didn't make it this far by just shakin' hands
