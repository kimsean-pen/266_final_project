Oh, knowing what we know, knowing what we don't know
This is gonna change our world
Feeling how I feel, I'll accept the unreal
If you be my no-eyed girl from nowhere mankind can go
There's too much light, blinding white
Your matter tells mine to scatter
It's alright, it's alright

From the moment that we met
I've been awake like I've never been awake in all my life
If I spoke your language I could tell you how I feel
But your language isn't real
In every myth there's a little bit of truth
But I cannot say a thing (I cannot say a thing)
Without proof, oh no

Knowing what we know, knowing what we do not know
This is gonna change our world
I might go insane if I hear your full name
If you be my no-eyed girl from nowhere mankind can go
There's too much light, blinding white
Emotions, human implosions
It's alright, it's alright

Right before the kiss I noticed something in the air
Molecules existed when there should have been none there
Chemical reactions with the surface of your skin
Some will say my actions let the no-eyed people in

And I'd do it all again, and I'd do it all again, and I'd do it all again
