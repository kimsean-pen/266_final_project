.shake us,
Shaky shake us
Fly tonight to say
What's to take up
What's to take up above the gates of the.

Chorus:
Somehow things last till I die
For a show to feel animated
Is that face integrated
These days are moment feeling
Somehow things last till I die
For a show to feel animated
That face is integrated
Some figure out the coalition we chose
Excess, excess, excess, excess

I'm supposed to,
I'm supposed to gave in to any friend
The way I'm calling,
The way I'm calling is that greater chance to spare

Chorus:
Somehow things last till I die
For a show to feel animated
Is that face integrated
These days are moment feeling
Somehow things last till I die
For a show to feel animated
That face is integrated
Some figure out the coalition we chose
Excess, excess, excess, excess
