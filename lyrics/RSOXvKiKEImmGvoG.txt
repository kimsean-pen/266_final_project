I close my eyes and take a deep breath
Try to find my place in this
Digging teeth into the hand that feeds
So inhuman, I'm surprised you bleed

Cutting teeth, fading belief
Flip the switch and drag me in
When they've had their way, I doubt I'll even dream
When they've had their way, I doubt I'll even dream
I doubt I'll even dream

Stray from the path, and you're on your own
Lightning strikes in the unknown, the unknown
The view from here, even the blind would see
That none of us were ever free

I'll be the lines in-between
The ones that tell you what you want and need, you want and needed

I am only rust on the machine, amber corrosion
The loudest truth you never heard, a silent explosion
I am only rust on the machine, amber corrosion
I'll be the lines in-between
The ones that tell you what you want and need

Take my head from the clouds
Lift my feet from the ground
Take my head from the clouds
Last note dies, they don't make a sound

Stray from the path, and you're on your own
Lightning strikes in the unknown, the unknown
The view from here, even the blind would see
That none of us were ever free, were ever free
