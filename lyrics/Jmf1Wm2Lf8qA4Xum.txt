Verse 1:
I thought it was the last time
Our ending was biter-sweet
Thought you were out of my mind
Instead just like on repeat
In my dreams you belong to me
... set me free

Chorus:
I hear your voice like a broken record
Saying my name every second
Dum-dum-daram-dum-dum-daram-dam
Voice like a broken record
In my heart I feel it echo
Dum-dum-daram-dum-dum-daram-dam

Verse 2:
I don't know why, I don't know how you're here
Impossible to make you disapá¹—ear
In my dreams you belong to me
... set me free

Chorus:
I hear your voice like a broken record
Saying my name every second
Dum-dum-daram-dum-dum-daram-dam
Voice like a broken record
In my heart I feel it echo
Dum-dum-daram-dum-dum-daram-dam
Dum-dum-daram-dum-dum-daram-dam
Dum-dum-daram-dum-dum-daram-dam

Voice like a broken record
Voice like a broken record
Voice like a broken record
Voice like a broken record

Voice like a broken record
Voice like a broken record
Voice like a broken record
Voice like a broken record

Chorus:
I hear your voice like a broken record
Saying my name every second
Dum-dum-daram-dum-dum-daram-dam
Voice like a broken record
In my heart I feel it echo
Dum-dum-daram-dum-dum-daram-dam

I hear your voice like a broken record
Saying my name every
Dum-dum-daram-dum-dum-daram-dam
Voice like a broken, broken, broken, broken, broken, broken, record
Dum-dum-daram-dum-dum-daram-dam
Voice like a broken, broken, broken, broken, broken, broken, record
Dum-dum-daram-dum-dum-daram-dam
