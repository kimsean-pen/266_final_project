We are young
With open eyes
blinded by
the citylights.
Lose control
to feel alive
just another day
in paradise

Diamond sky
Diamond sky
you and i
you and i

we are the kings and queens of suburbia.
Somewhere in time
we don't know where we are
come on, we are who we are, come on, come on.

Have you heard
the silent scream
boys and girls
born to be free.
love is our gasoline
livin on this endless dream.

Diamond sky
Diamond sky
you and i
you and i

we are the kings and queens of suburbia.
Somewhere in time
we don't know where we are
come on, we are who we are, come on, come on.

we are the kings and queens of suburbia.
Somewhere in time
we don't know where we are
come on, we are who we are, we are who we are.

God grant me the serenity
to accept the things i cannot change
courage to change the
things i can and wisdom to
know the difference.

we are the kings and queens of suburbia.
Somewhere in time
we don't know where we are
come on, we are who we are, come on, come on.

we are the kings and queens of suburbia.
Somewhere in time
we don't know where we are
come on, we are who we are, we arw who we are.

Join me under diamond skies
