Lying in a bed of my own making
Last thing I knew I was lying on a pavement
Bleeding from the head if I'm not mistaking
And the only thing to do is wallow in my blues
Maybe I don't want to be a homebody
Maybe I do
Maybe I don't want to be with nobody
Maybe it's you
Maybe I don't wanna know
Maybe I don't wanna go
Maybe I don't wanna grow
Maybe I don't wanna vote
Maybe I do

I'm not through
I'm not through

I just woke up
With the greatest hangover
I'm not sober
I'm not broken
I'm not eager
It's not over
I'm not decent
I'm not evil
I'm just me
I'm sick of being a liability

I don't really want a sex education
Fuck now, think later
I don't really want a bad reputation
I'm good, I'm tasteful
Wanna be a saint, be paid and stable
In ways I could never anticipate
I'm unbreakable
One of these days
I'm gonna wake in a place where somebody
Knows my name
I'm sick of being a liability
I wanna be okay
I wanna be okay

I just woke up
With the greatest hangover
I'm not sober
I'm not broken
I'm not eager
It's not over
I'm not decent
I'm not evil
I'm just me
I'm sick of being a liability

Let's get married, and travel to Vegas
My deplorable behavior is getting outrageous I
I need Jesus
I need relief
I need some peace of mind
Fuck, I need some sleep
I need to find a purpose in life
And find what I want
'Cause sometimes I act like a punk
When the wine is all in my trunk
And my mind is all back to front
I'm hardly a fucking monk
Maybe I'm just a little bit ittybit, still drunk

I just woke up
With the greatest hangover
I'm not sober
I'm not broken
I'm not eager
It's not over
I'm not decent
I'm not evil
I'm just me
I'm sick of being a liability
(Oh, fuck off)
