I'll be kind if you'll be faithful
You be sweet and I'll be grateful
Cover me with kisses, dear
Lighten up the atmosphere

Keep me warm inside our bed
I got dreams of you all through my head
Fortune teller said; I'd be free and that's the day you came to me
Came to me

Come to me, my sweetest friend
Can you feel my heart again?
I'll take you back where you belong
And this will be your favorite song

Come to me with secrets bare
I'll love you more so don't be scared
When we're old and near the end
We'll go home and start again

I caught you burning photographs
Like that could save you from your past
History's like gravity, it holds you down away from me
You and me, we've both got sins, and I don't care about where you been
Don't be sad and don't explain, this is where we start again
Start again

Come to me, my sweetest friend
Can you feel my heart again?
I'll take you back where you belong
And this will be your favorite song

Come to me with secrets bare
I'll love you more so don't be scared
When we're old and near the end
We'll go home and start again
Start again

Today's the day I'll make you mine, so get me to the church on time
Take my hand in this empty room
You're my girl and I'm your groom
Come to me, my sweetest friend
This is where we start again (whoa)
Again

Come to me, my sweetest friend
Can you feel my heart again?
I'll take you back where you belong
And this will be your favorite song

Come to me with secrets bare
I'll love you more so don't be scared
When we're old and near the end
We'll go home and start again
Start again
