Tough
Do you want
To know the truth
Truth is your holding me too high

Pulling me apart
All the stop and start
Do know how much I truly obsess
On every word you say
Wrong or right
Its just an hour
But it keeps me up
And all the world
Could be so new
If you would just

Believe me when I tell you
You need someone real to love
You just need someone real to love
To love
To love

Put your
Put your

Believe when I tell you
You need someone real to love
You just need someone real to love

Believe when I tell you
You need someone real
To love
You just need someone real
To love
Ooooooooh
To love
Ooooooooh
