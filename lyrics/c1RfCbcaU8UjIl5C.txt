At this time
Put the knife
In your chest
Take your life

Candlelight
Burning bright
Guide your eyes
Through the night

X I I I
Open your third eye
See through my disguise
Turn the truth to lies
X I I I
Let your demons die
When you sleep at night
I'll be your demise

Amulet
On my neck
Banish those
God protect

Pentagram
On my hands
Spirits dance
Where I stand

X I I I
Open your third eye
See through my disguise
Turn the truth to lies
X I I I
Let your demons die
When you sleep at night
I'll be your demise
