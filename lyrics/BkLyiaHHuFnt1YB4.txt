Lost in the valley of malls
The kids are all leading themselves
Living in capsules and balls
Thinking that there's nowhere else at all

Flicking a match in the sky
Turning my back on my own
Finally the bottle's bone dry
With a message inside
That says that I'm gone

I'm a dull boy with a dead dream
Searching for a pulse at any given scene
The city's shrinking down
I think it's time to leave this town
Pulling out while there's still time
Littered all my memories behind

The statues win, so let them have it
Let 'em keep this squeeky clean
Whatever was now is in ashes
There isn't anymore room here for me

'Cause I'm a dull boy with a dead dream
Searching for a pulse at any given scene
The city's shrinking down
I think it's time to leave this town
Pulling out while there's still time
Littered all my memories behind

The city's shrinking down
I think it's time to leave this town
Pulling out while there's still time
Littered all my memories behind
