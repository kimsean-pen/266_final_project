Everything is good and brown
I'm here again
With a sunshine smile upon my face
My friends are close at hand
And all my inhibitions have disappeared without a trace
I'm glad, oh, that I found
Somebody who I can rely on
This is the return of the space cowboy
Interplanetary, good vibe zone
Say, at the speed of cheeba, oh, you and I go deeper
Maybe I have to get high to get by, hey
I got that cheeba, cheeba vibe

Everything is good, oh, and green
Say, I'm red again
And I don't suppose I'm coming down
I can see clearly, so high in sky
A man with psychaedelic picture frames
Of happiness to shade his eyes
He's glad, oh, that he found
Somebody who he can rely on
This is the returnn of the space cowboy
Interplanetary, good vibe zone
Say, at the speed of cheeba, oh you and I go deeper
And now maybe I have to get high just to get by
Hey, maybe I'm gonna have to get high
Hey maybe I'm gonna have to get so high, hey
So high yeah, so high yeah, you and I (you and I)
Hey

Now, this is the return of the space cowboy
Oh interplanetary, good vibe zone

Gettin' high, oh gettin' higher
Oh, this is the return of the space cowboy
Interplanetary good vibe zone
This is the return of the space cowboy
Interplanetary, good vibe zone
Say at the speed of cheeba, oh, you and I go deeper
Hey now we're going deeper
Oh now we're going deeper
You and I, you and I, you and I, you and I
You and I, you and I, you and I, you and I, hey
We're going deeper, yeah
