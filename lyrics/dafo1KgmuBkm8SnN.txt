Everyday I wake up
And I take my medication
And I spend the rest of the day
Waiting for it to wear off
Every night I stay up late
And make my state more desperate
And I spend the rest of the night
Waiting for it to wear off
I'm waiting for a time when I can be without
These things that make me feel
This way all of the time.
Every now and then
I get an urge to drive around
Get into my car then I'll
Maybe go uptown
Take my medication
Do my best to get it on
And I spend the rest of the night
Waiting for it to wear off
I'm waiting for a time when I can be without
These things that make me feel
This way all of the time.
Everytime I say this
I just know this time I mean it
But a feeling deep inside
Says it's okay one more time
I'm waiting for a time when I can be without
These things that make me feel
This way all of the time.
Makes me feel so good
Makes me feel so fine
Makes me feel so good
Leaves me f**ked up inside
Medicate my days
Medicate my eyes
Medicate my life
Gonna feel alright
Gonna feel so good
Gonna feel just fine
Don't feel so good
Don't feel just fine
Don't feel so good
Leaves me f**ked up inside
