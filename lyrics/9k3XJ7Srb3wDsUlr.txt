Now, don't just walk away
Pretending everything's ok
And you don't care about me

And I know there's just no use
When all your lies become your truths and I don't care...
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Could you look me in the eye
And tell me that you're happy now
Ohhh, ohhh
Would you tell it to my face
Or have I been erased
Are you happy now?

Are you happy now?
You took all there was to take
And left me with an empty plate

And you don't care about it, yeah.
And I am givin' up this game
And leaving you with all the blame cause I don't care

Yeah, yeah yeah
Could you look me in the eye?
And tell me that you're happy now
Oohh oohhh
Would you tell it to my face
Or have I been erased
Are you happy now?
Ohhh, ohhhh
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Do you really have everything you want?
You can't ever give somethin' you ain't got

You can't run away from yourself
Could you look me in the eye?

And tell me that you're happy now
Yeah, yeah
Come on, tell it to my face
Or have I been replaced
Are you happy now?
Ohhh, ohhhh
Are you happy now?
Would you look me in the eye?
Could you look me in the eye?
I've had all that I can take
I'm not about to break
Cause I'm happy now
Ohhh, ohhh
Are you happy now?
