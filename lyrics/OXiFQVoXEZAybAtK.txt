Time to go and get our kicks
Dropping out and getting in the mix now
Oh oh hey hey hey

Here in the backroom, nothing to do
We're not bored, we're just sick of you, yeah
Oh oh yeah, sick of you

Break down, take down
Now it's on
Sold out, blow out
Don't get caught
Well, no! Hell, no!
What you gonna do?
When they keep coming for you

See the shadows marching on
Yesterdays dreams are dead and gone
Oh oh dead and gone
Hear 'em cheering up above
Down below is pushing shove
Oh oh yeah, pushing shove

Break down, take down
Now it's on
Sold out, blow out
Don't get caught
Well, no! Hell, no!
What you gonna do?
When they keep coming for you

Bet some, get some
Knock you down!
Alone now, show down
Kiss the ground
Well, no! Hell, no!
What you gonna do?
Lights out, coming at you
They'll be coming for you

Hey hey hey
Oh oh oh
Hey hey hey

What's up, fuck you up

Break down, take down
Now it's on
Sold out, blow out
Don't get caught
Well, no! Hell, no!
What you gonna do?
They just keep coming for you

Bet some, get some
Knock you down!
Alone now, show down
Kiss the ground
Well, no! Hell, no!
What you gonna do?
Lights out, coming at you
They'll be coming for you

They'll be coming for you
They'll be coming for you
