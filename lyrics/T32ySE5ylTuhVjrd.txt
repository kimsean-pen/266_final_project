HEY!

Sleeping through the day cause I work all night
Get out the way things are coming alive
Look over there, another fight
I guess I should have seen the warning signs

(We could be together?)
I am not looking for a fight
(Change the world forever?)
Just want to make it through the night
(They belong together)
They're really giving me the eye
eye, eye, eye

I think I'm gonna lose it, lose it, lose it
I think I'm gonna lose it, lose it, lose it

I think I'm gonna lose it

oohh The walls are growing ears
I'm paranoid
No need to feel what you can't avoid
Don't let them in, don't let them out
I'll give you something you could scream about

(We could be together?)
I am not looking for a. fight
(Change the world forever?)
Just want to make it through the night
(They belong together)
They're really giving me the eye
eye, eye, yeah

I think I'm gonna lose it, lose it, lose it
I think I'm gonna lose it
I think I'm gonna lose it, lose it, lose it
I think I'm gonna lose it

No no no nothings wrong with dreaming
Go go gotta dream it all away
One love, one life
That's enough to get you through the night
Tomorrows gotta be a brighter day, yeaheaheaayy

I think I'm gonna lose it, lose it, lose it
I think I'm gonna lose it (I think I'm gonna lose it)
I think I'm gonna lose it, lose it, lose it
I think I'm gonna lose it yeah
I think I'm gonna lose it, lose it, lose it
I think I'm gonna lose it YEAH
I think I'm gonna lose it, lose it, lose it
I think I'm gonna lose it, lose it, lose it

We could be together
Change the world forever
They belong together

No no no nothings wrong with dreaming
Go go gotta dream it all away
One love, one life
Oh that's enough to get you through the night
