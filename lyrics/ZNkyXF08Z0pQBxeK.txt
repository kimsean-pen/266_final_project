Hit the stage, hit my voodoo walk, got my polo sock
Catch no fade, if you throwin' shade, then Junebug pull the Glock
It's okay, I just keep the K, cause I got lots of guap
All these haters wanna see me dead and bitches give me top
In a drop top, perc, skrrt, swervin', I just lost control
Live to see another day, okay, that's how my dice'll roll
Judge just dropped the charges,
it's marvelous, cause ain't no body fall
Guess Erase was with me, he watchin' down, word upon my soul

Block hot, Glock cocked, 2 hits from the 45
Slipped a key of coke
Now my boogers worth more than your eyes
Who gon' hold me down
When the reaper come to take my life?
Boiler by the gun, you gon' die by a fuckin' 9
It's a damn shame, let me chain swang for these hoes
Please just look, don't touch
I'm too red to even fuck these hoes
Let the truth be told, no one hotter, they call me the GOAT
Said I'm just a dragon, they can't fathom how I spit these flows
Bad bitch, vibin' on the shake, so deep in her throat
Rest in peace my enemies, pull up on 'em and slit they throat
Be work on me, sittin' shotty with a 45
They be take the wheel, as we move these packs all through the night

Hit the stage, hit my voodoo walk, got my polo sock
Catch no fade, if you throwin' shade, then Junebug pull the Glock
It's okay, I just keep the K, cause I got lots of guap
All these haters wanna see me dead and bitches give me top
In a drop top, perc, skrrt, swervin', I just lost control
Live to see another day, okay, that's how my dice'll roll
Judge just dropped the charges,
it's marvelous, cause ain't no body fall
Guess Erase was with me, he watchin' down, word upon my soul
