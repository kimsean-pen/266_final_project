Dear saint you're safe with me
Cause I will take a sin and smash it into my sin
And I'll rip out all my teeth
And I'll cut off my tongue just to save your life
Cause I would do anything for you, the apple of my
I just want to watch your eyelids open everyday

Crash into earth
I can barely breathe
All the love I had for you was never meant to be
I lost you before you were born
Crash into earth tonight
Losing all control of life

I don't ever wanna deal with it
It's always beating in the back of my head
I wish I could see your face, but life I guess had other plans
And maybe you'll be born again, for someone I never met
I still don't believe in god, but there's a part of me that won't forget

Crash into earth
I can barely breathe
All the love I had for you was never meant to be
I lost you before you were born
Crash into earth tonight
Losing all control of life

I don't ever wanna deal with it
It's always beating in the back of my head
I wish I could see your face
But life I guess had other plans
