His frost performed its art
And it has stained my tainted heart
Just leave me to my solitude
It's where I feel at home
Since that cold night
When my love cried

Would you fall, give it all, would you give it all for me?
Suckerpunch the demons from my dreams
Would you fall, give it all, would you give it all for me?
Get out of my dreams

His sorrow cast a shade
That I refuse to walk beneath
I said leave me to my solitude
Where I am self-defined
Only replied
With my love's cries

Would you fall, give it all, would you give it all for me?
Suckerpunch the demons from my dreams
Would you fall, give it all, would you give it all for me?
Get out of my dreams
Get out of my dreams

Would you fall, give it all, would you give it all for me?
Suckerpunch the demons from my dreams
Would you fall, give it all, would you give it all for me?
Get out of my dreams
Get out of my dreams
Get out of my dreams
