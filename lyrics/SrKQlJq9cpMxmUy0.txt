And I know, I never knew you.
Your mind, Your pain
I will melt your winter tears
If you say you will
If you could say you will
Convalescing bruised, I set my mind awake
Dare to take another look
If you say you will
If you coule say you will
King of moon, gloomy afternoon
Losing track of word and meter
Still shaking, In this tear room
Like a sick child
Still shaking, nothing reconciled
Like a sick child
Melancholia colliding out of mind
In a silver swirl, I take a lungful in
Blow a fistful out, If you could say you will
King of moon, gloomy afternoon
Losing track of word and meter
Make your final touch people talk too much
Madman screams an unknown language
Still shaking, In the tear room
Like a sick child
Still shaking, nothing reconciled
Like a sick child
Still shaking, nothing reconciled
Like a sick child
