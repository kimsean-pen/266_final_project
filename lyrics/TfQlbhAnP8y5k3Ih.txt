Give me mercy and a minute now
I'm a bleed a little poison out
I'm a cry a little river down
And then I'm setting this whole thing on fire

And I'm burning up the night she died
And I'm putting every last picture aside
I'm gonna say what I need to say
In my very last letter to you

Cause you always made it clear
Said that you'd never be my pain
So here's to you and your bright baby blues
And just a pause to cool the refrain

And you said you were satisfied
And now this body's just waiting to die
And that you missed him sometimes but you said it's alright
It's just a whole lot harder alone

But I wish you knew her now
She's a better side of me now
And I'm doing the best I can
It's what you wanted

And I see you like you were there
And I know just how you'd smile
Mary, you looked just like it was 1930 that night

But here the nights they will eat you alive
But I won't give in tonight
You said it's not worth my time
And not to regard them

And not to settle just a piece of mind
But I can wait it out all night
If you'll just keep breathing

But Mary I found a sound
And this heart keeps pouring it out
And the glory hasn't come and it's probably gonna fade
Like the tattoo that hides this shame

And the reasons always fade
And the pain gets out some day
And I'm saying my goodbyes to your deep blue eyes
Cause I don't know how to say stay still in the pain

But I wish you knew her now
She's a better side of me now
And I'm doing the best I can
It's what you wanted

And I see you like you were there
And I know just how you'd smile
Mary, you looked just like it was 1930 that night

If I recall the last thing you said to me
Before it broke up, before it took you from me
And you said "I love you more than the stars in the sky
But your name just escapes me tonight"
