Take your time
Listen to the song we wrote
It could change your mind
When you hear it on the radio
I'm getting black-out drunk tonight
Said you don't know where the good dope grows
But I get flame all the time
Just call me on the phone and you can always swing by

'Cause I'd rather be at home playing video games
With the people that I've known since the glorious age
Because every now and then I just don't feel the same
Since you don't know instead you swing low

I get high
I get low
If my heart stops beating
Will you let me know?

I don't know what your mind is going through
But I'm coming up dizzy just trying to love you
I know oh, oh I know

I fuckin' know what you're saying
We'll give it all away now
We'll get it on the way home

'Cause I'd rather be at home playing video games
With the people that I've known since the glorious age
Because every now and then I just don't feel the same
Since you don't know instead you swing low

I get high
I get low
If my heart stops beating
Will you let me know?

I don't know what your mind is going through
But I'm coming up dizzy just trying to love you
I know oh, oh oh ohh

If you need fast cash in a flash you see
Front a sack flip it bring the rest back to me
I know oh oh ohh
