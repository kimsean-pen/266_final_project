Woke up with a fat lip, another hat trick
Nothing goes my way
Flatline and a backflip, never had a grip
Man it's all the same
Burn out I got no time
I'm crossing over a thin line
Take a shot like a moonlight plane
No life, I'll take what's mine

Whose side are you on?
(Pick one)
Whose side are you

Yeah, you know before too long
You'll be dead and gone
So tell me right or wrong?
Whose side are you on?

Try again not to force it
And the force is
Shouting in my brain
Back off I'm a twisted psycho
Noises, so I
Run and I run and I run and I run
That's just what I do
You think you're better than me
But who the fuck are you?

Whose side are you on?
(Pick one)
Whose side are you
Yeah, you know before too long
You'll be dead and gone
So tell me right or wrong?
Whose side are you on?

Whose side are you on?
Whose side are you on?
Whose side are you on?
Whose side are you on?

Yeah, you know before too long
You'll be dead and gone
So tell me right or wrong?
Whose side are you

Yeah, you know before too long
You'll be dead and gone
So tell me right or wrong?
Whose side are you

Yeah, you know before too long
You'll be dead and gone
So tell me right or wrong?
Whose side are you on?

Whose side are you on?
Whose side are you on?
Whose side are you on?
Whose side are you on?
