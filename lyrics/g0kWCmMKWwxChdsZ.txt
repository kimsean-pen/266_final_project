Kick the door, clear the floor
I'm in the war, I'm killin' it
Block the cocks, blow them socks
Keeping the fucks, I'm killin' it
Walk my dog, walk my dog
Read the blog, I'm killin' it

Turn me up
It's all talk, talk, talk, it's Oh

A little me time
La la lalala
A little me time
Talk, talk, talk, talk

Catch my flight, like a kite
Left and right, I'm killin' it
Feel the pace, what's her face?
Not today, I'm killin' it
Walk my dog, walk my dog
Pepe the frog, you feelin' it?

Turn me up
It's all talk, and talk, and talk, fuck out Oh

A little me time
La la lalala
A little me time
Talk, and talk, and talk, and talk Ho

La la lalala

La la lalala
A little me time
Ho
La la lalala
A little me time
Talk, and talk, and talk
