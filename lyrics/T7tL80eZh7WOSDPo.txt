Come on and lay with me
Come on and lie to me
Tell me you love me
Say I'm the only one

Come on and lay with me
Come on and lie to me
Tell me you love me
Say I'm the only one

Experiences
Have a lasting impression
But words once spoken
Don't mean a lot now

Belief is the way
The way of the innocent
And when I say innocent
I should say naive

So lie to me
But do it with sincerity
Make me listen, just for a minute
Make me think there's some truth in it

Come on and lay with me
Come on and lie to me
Tell me you love me
Say I'm the only one

Come on and lay with me (lay with me)
Come on and lie to me (lie to me)
Tell me you love me (love me)
Say I'm the only one

Promises
Made for convenience
Aren't necessarily
What we need

Truth is a word
That's lost its meaning
The truth has become
Merely half-truth

So lie to me
Like they do it in the factory
Make me think that at the end of the day
Some great reward will be coming my way

Come on and lay with me
Come on and lie to me
Tell me you love me
Say I'm the only one

Come on and lay with me (lay with me)
Come on and lie to me (lie to me)
Tell me you love me (love me)
Say I'm the only one (only one)

Come on and lay with me (lay with me)
Come on and lie to me (lie to me)
Tell me you love me (love me)
Say I'm the only one (only one)

Come on and lay with me (lay with me)
Come on and lie to me (lie to me)
Tell me you love me (love me)
Say I'm the only one
