There's not a thing that I could say
To stop your blue eyes from fading to grey
And all the blood will rush to my head
And fall out of my mouth

Am I invisible now
To a friend in a hospital gown?
I'll still call your phone to hear your voice

Am I invisible now
To a friend in a hospital gown?
I'll still call your phone to hear your voice
I learned a lot about death before I grew up

And I watched you begin to fade when I was eighteen
I swore that I would be okay
You told me that your biggest fear was waking up each day

So when I wake up in the morning
On top of blankets, fully clothed
I'll tear death's fingers from my throat
To remind me that I'll never be alone
Remind me that I'll never be alone
