All she ever wanted
When the day turned indigo
Was to leave her grubby life behind her
To the buzzing streets below

Tainted passion and temptation
Led her down a trail of lust
Now, the fate of Faye Delroy
Is written in the dust
Written in the dust

Oh, my rockin? chair
Rock me tender in the night air
Oh, my rockin? chair
Rock me back and make me be there

She said her head don't move the same way
That her hand usually does
That she's got memory bubble
Almost like the rest of us

And ADD salamanders
Cannot figure what to wear
And they'll be standing in the closet
And every dress is savoir faire
Every dress is savoir faire

Oh, my rockin? chair
Rock me tender in the night air
Oh, my rockin? chair
Rock me back and make me be there

Oh, my rockin? chair
Rock me tender in the night air
Oh, my rockin? chair
Rock me back and make me be there

Rock me here, rock me there
Rock me in my rockin? chair
Rock me here, rock me there
Rock me in my rockin? chair

Rock me here, rock me there
Rock me in my rockin? chair
Rock me here, rock me there
Rock me in my rockin? chair

Oh, my oh my, rock me
Tender in the night air

Za va ba, za ba bi ya
Ca va pas, za ba bi ya
Romeo Boyz, they'll be dancing
With the Cha Cha Girlz

Za va ba, za ba bi ya
Ca va pas, za ba bi ya
Romeo Boyz, they'll be dancing
With the Cha Cha Girlz

Oh, my rockin? chair
Rock me tender in the night air
Oh, my rockin? chair
Rock me back and make me be there

Oh, my rockin? chair
Rock me tender in the night air
Oh, my rockin? chair
Rock me back and make me be there
