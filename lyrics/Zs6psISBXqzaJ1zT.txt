The ice is thin come on dive in
underneath my lucid skin.
The cold is lost, forgotten.

Hours pass days pass time stands still
light gets dark and darkness fills
my secret heart forbidden...

I think you worried for me then
the subtle ways that I'd give in
but I know you liked the show.

Tied down to this bed of shame
you tried to move around the pain
but oh your soul is anchored.

The only comfort is
the moving of the river.
You enter into me
a lie upon your lips.
Offer what you can
I'll take all that I can get
only a fool's here...

I don't like your tragic sighs
as if your god has passed you by
well hey fool that's your deception.

Your angels speak with jilted tongues
the serpent's tale has come undone
you have no strength to squander.

The only comfort is
the moving of the river.
You enter into me
a lie upon your lips.
Offer what you can
I'll take all that I can get
only a fool's here to stay.

Only a fool's here to stay.

Only a fool's here...
