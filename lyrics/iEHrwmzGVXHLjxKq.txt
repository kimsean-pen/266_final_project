I like the way you talk about yourself
As if you're someone else
I like the way you smile when you're so proud
Of something you did yourself

Today your head is down
Your mind is somewhere else

I hate the way you talk about yourself
When you're feeling down

I hate the way you talk
About me to your friends
They tell me everything
You may as well tell to my face

I love the way we talk
To try to fill the space

I hate the way we try to hide the things
We really want to say

Have I misread
The way I feel about you
