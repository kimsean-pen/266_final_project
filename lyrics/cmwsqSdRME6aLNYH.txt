Every bit has its time
Too many pieces to keep over
With every shape and design that won't fit in
That's the best of your peers
If you can make it through the summer
Forget the paint on the walls that dizzying view
There's barely the room
I see you better when the lights are out
I see you better when the lights are out
Just give a second and I'll figure it out, yes I will
'Cause practice is over
Click stopSo we know, know how to keep this thing on moving now
We were jammed, cursed so it wouldn't begin
Find a space on the floor
Tape down the edges of your waist coat
Remember the words, the lighting cues
It's all up to you
I see you better when the lights are out
I see you better when the lights are out
Just give a moment and I'll figure it out, yeah I will
'Cause practice is over
I see you, I see you better when the lights are out
I see you, I see you better when the lights are out
I see it, just give me second and I'll figure it out, yes I will
'Cause practice is over.
