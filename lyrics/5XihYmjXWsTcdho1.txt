Well i've wasted all my time
Trying bad to make you mine
And i know it's not ok
I can't find that perfect line
And when things are not the same
Too far down in my brain
Toss my drinks into the sky
And i'm face-down in my mind

Crawling after you
Crawling after you
Crawling after you
Crawling after you

And i'm waiting for something
While you occupy my head
And it's getting far too loud
When your face is oh so proud
When i feel like i am dead
Alone all day in bed
Toss my drinks into the sky
I've been wasting all my time

Crawling after you
Crawling after you
Crawling after you
Crawling after you

And i can't get better
If i don't let you down, down
All night i sweat her
I can't get further down
Down, down, down, down

Crawling after you
Crawling after you
Crawling after you
Crawling after you
Crawling after you
Crawling after you
Crawling after you
