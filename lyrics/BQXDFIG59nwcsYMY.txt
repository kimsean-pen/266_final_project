Woah, woah

Bang, bang go the coffin nails, like a breath exhaled
Then gone forever
It seems like just yesterday, how did I miss the red flags raised?
Think back to the days we laughed
We braved these bitter storms together
Then brought to his knees he cried
But on his feet he died

What God would damn a heart?
And what God drove us apart?
What God could?

Make it stop
Let this end
Eighteen years pushed to the ledge
It's come to this
A weightless step
On the way down singing
Woah, woah

Bang, bang from the closet walls
The schoolhouse halls
The shotgun's loaded
Push me and I'll push back
I'm done asking, I demand

From a nation under God
I feel its love like a cattle prod
I'm born free, but still they hate
I'm born me, no I can't change

It's always darkest just before the dawn
So stay awake with me, let's prove them wrong

Make it stop
Let this end
Eighteen years pushed to the ledge
It's come to this
A weightless step
On the way down singing
Woah, woah

The cold river washed him away
But how could we forget?
The gatherings hold candles, but not their tongues

And too much blood has flown from the wrists
Of the children shamed for those they chose to kiss
Who will rise to stop the blood?

We're calling for
Insisting on, a different beat, yeah
A brand new song
Whoa, whoa
A brand new song

(Whoa, whoa)
(Whoa)

Make it stop
Let this end
This life chose me, I'm not lost in sin
And proud I stand of who I am
I plan to go on living

Make it stop
Let this end
All these years pushed to the ledge
But proud I stand, of who I am
I plan to go on living
