I know your leaving's too long overdue
For far too long I've had nothing new to show to you
Goodbye dry eyes, I watched your plane
Fade off west of moon
Then it felt so strange to walk away alone
Chorus:

No regrets
No tears goodbye
Don't want you back
We'd only cry again
Say goodbye again
The hours that were yours, echo like empty rooms
But the thoughts we used to share
Now I keep alone
I woke last night and spoke to you
Not thinking you were gone
Then it felt so strange to lie awake alone
Chorus:

No regrets
No tears, goodbye
Don't want you back
We'd only cry again
Say goodbye again
All friends have tried to turn my nights to day
Strange faces in your place
Can't keep the goss away
But just beyond the darkest hour
Just behind the dawn
It still feels so strange to lead my life alone
Chorus:

No regrets
No tears, goodbye
Don't want you back
We'd only cry again
Say goodbye again
