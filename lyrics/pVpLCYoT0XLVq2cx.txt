I had some stains on my soul
Yeah, I was a troubled boy
Countlessly on the road
So one day I woke up
I complained no more

But then I heard the river calling me

Saying, "Step into the water, child
Surrender, don't you try to hide your lies no more
Tomorrow when the night has died
And the dawn brings out a brand new light
You will be born again"

(Oh, oh, yeah)
The devil was breathing my name
He kept on playing in my head
But I'd seen the light and he stood no chance
Cause I found myself some sweet salvation

When I heard the river calling me
Calling me

Saying, "Step into the water, child
Surrender, don't you try to hide your lies no more
Tomorrow when the night has died
And the dawn brings out a brand new light
You will be born again"

Come, swim with me
Come in
Come, swim with me
Come in
Come, swim into the light
Come into the river
Come, swim with me
Come in
Come, swim with me
Come in
Come, swim into the light
Step into the water
Step into the water, child
Step into the water
Step into the water, child
Step into the water
Step into the water, child

"Step into the water, child
Surrender, don't you try to hide your lies no more
Tomorrow when the night has died
And the dawn brings out a brand new light
You will be born again"

Oh, oh, oh
Born again
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
