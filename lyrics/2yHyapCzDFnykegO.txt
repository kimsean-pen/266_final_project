White lights, morning comes
You open up your eyes to a brighter sun
You're feeling life is perfect
Time flies, years pass
You tell yourself now that you're all alone
You're feeling like you're crazy

Whenever you look back on your life
Spending your time there reflecting
It doesn't make sense you don't know why

When all of the signs are out of place
Remember the path you chose and your mistakes
They lead you back to where you once called home
When all of the signs are out of place
Remember the path you chose and your mistakes
They lead you back to where you once called home

Blue skies, clarity
The vision of your mind is inspiring
You're feeling life is perfect
Time flies, years pass
You tell yourself now that you're all alone
You're feeling like you're crazy

When all of the signs are out of place
Remember the path you chose and your mistakes
They lead you back to where you once called home
When all of the signs are out of place
Remember the path you chose and your mistakes
They lead you back to where you once called home

Whenever you look back on your life
Spending your time there reflecting
It doesn't make sense you don't know why

When all of the signs are out of place
Remember the path you chose and your mistakes
They lead you back to where you once called home
When all of the signs are out of place
Remember the path you chose and your mistakes
They lead you back to where you once called home
