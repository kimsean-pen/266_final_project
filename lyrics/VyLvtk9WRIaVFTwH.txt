They locked me up, put me away
Said, "You're gonna get out in forever and a day"
I didn't know what was going on
All I was doing was looking for fun

Forgot the reason, that's what I'm told
But you've gotta get it in before you get old
They thought they had me, had me for keeps
But they don't know this boy never sleeps

I'm back on the streets again
I'm back on my feet again

I'm on parole
I'm on parole
I'm on parole
I'm on parole

I like a laugh, I like a joke
It's not my fault if my sense of humour broke
I tried to tell them I was sick
They seemed to think it was some kind of trick

Well alright, I wouldn't done good
If they had listened to me like they should
I wouldn't have this loaded gun
Looking for a citizen to waste just for fun

I'm raising my sights again
I'm claiming my rights again

I'm on parole
I'm on parole
I'm on parole
I'm on parole

I'm on parole
I'm on parole
I'm on parole
I'm on parole

Stop me now before I kill myself
Stop me now before I kill myself
Stop me now before I kill myself
Stop me before I kill somebody else

You'd better watch out, you never know
Who's gonna be the next to go
Night's my friend, but it ain't yours
Fixes the odds, evens the scores

Just turn around, I won't go wrong
Before he hits the ground I'll be long gone
They won't suspect me, no, not a soul
'Cause I'm a good boy, I'm on parole

It's good to be free again
It's good to be me again

I'm on parole
I'm on parole
I'm on parole
I'm on parole

I'm on parole
I'm on parole
I'm on parole
I'm on parole

Stop me now before I kill myself
Stop me now before I kill myself
Stop me now before I kill myself
Fuck this shit, I kill somebody else
