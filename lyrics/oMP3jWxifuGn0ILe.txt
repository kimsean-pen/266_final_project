You come creepin'
Actin' like a fiend
But I've been warned
Your deceit knows no end
But you act so sweet
And you don't cut deep
You're just a little creep
It upset me
To learn you act this way
Poor thing it must be hard
To be yourself each day
But you act so sweet
And you don't cut deep
You're just a little creep
A creep
Just a creep
Just a creep
You say you're always
Right, right, right,
It's not so simple
It's not so black and white
But you act so sweet
And you don't cut deep
You're just a little creep
Oh, a creep
Just a creep
Just a creep
Just a creep
Yes, just a creep
Ya
Oh, a creep
Oh, a creep
Oh, a creep
Oh, a creep
