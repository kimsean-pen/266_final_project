Standing by his coffin thoughts have gone astray
Life is just a burden, carry yours away
Wipe the tears that fall
Moments recalled in the child's eyes
Watch the world go by
Flying through the stars won't hide the scars

Always, mourning cries
Wasted in this world
I'd never realized
Smiles in the falling rain
Wash the tears away

Face the angel of death
Soon your time will be over
Your salvation is ahead
That's why I said
There is no pain for the dead

Dying now
Hourglass counts down
Leaving this world
Your destination is-

Hiding mourning time
Face up to the world
Another day passes by
Living our minutes in vain
Wipe the tears away...

Triumph for the martyrs of the war
Fallen for the causes of the others
Worth the sacrifice?
Heroes are dying now
Hearing their mothers cry
Heaven is a metaphor
Free your mind and spirit

Mother Earth, do you part, take my soul
Oh, no!
Water, wind and fire...
Will take our spirits away!

(Victims of Sacrifice) Face the Angel of Death
(Struggling to survive) Soon your time will be over
(Revolution remains) Your salvation is ahead
It's not so sad, there is no pain for the dead

(Victims of Sacrifice) There'll be no rest til you're dead
(Struggling to survive) Liberation of soul
It's not so sad, there is no pain for the dead
Oh!

No pain for the dead
