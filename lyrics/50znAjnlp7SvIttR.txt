Big teeth in your face
Claws like a razor blade
Never again will I ever be friends
With a big bad wolf like you
Poison that'll eat you alive
Tongue like a dragon fire
Never again will I ever be friends
With a creepy little snake like you
I didn't learn the first time
But, oh, I learned the second time
Never again will we ever be friends
They told me don't feed the animals
Didn't learn the first time
Lord, I learned the second time
Never again will we ever be friends
No I won't feed the animals
Big teeth in your face
Claws like a razor blade
Never again will I ever be friends
With a big bad wolf like you
Poison that'll eat you alive
Tongue like a dragon fire
Never again will I ever be friends
With a creepy little snake like you
I didn't learn the first time
But, oh, I learned the second time
Never again will we ever be friends
They told me don't feed the animals, No
Didn't learn the first time
Lord, I learned the second time
Never again will we ever be friends
No I won't feed the animals
Almost had me down
But I know now
Ain't no friend of me
The enemy
Tried to make me bleed
On my knees
But I'm still alive
You better run and hide
Almost everybody's skin in your teeth
Tried to bite it but you couldn't catch me
Thought I'd run and hide
But I'm still out alive
Just go forth and make my day
Just go on and never look back
Don't fear
The End
