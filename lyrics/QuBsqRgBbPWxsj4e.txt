All I ever wanted was a gold chain with a gold ring
Twinkle, twinkle, 'cause they gold, man
Candy paint with the gold flakes
"Stay gold," said Granny as she smiled with her gold teeth
I got a goal to be golden like King Tut
Often those pictures of that gold
They would flicker, make it hard to call me nigga
'Cause the chains can change they chained us up with
This rope ain't the rope they hanged us up with
24k goldface with the rollie
Invisible set with the grill, that's how gold taste
Jordan 7s golden moment with the gold lace
Gold time, gold mines with the gold gates
If I die bury mine in a gold case
Slow down, never mind it's a gold chase
Goin' for the gusto in a gold place
May God forgive my sins for a gold space

Bury me in gold, bury me in gold
Just in case the old man doesn't know me and claims that I owe
Bury me in gold, bury me in gold
Just in case I'm forsaken and I have to pay for my soul

I had a patna' that went gold on the track and field
But, the gold never shined in our atmosphere
Gold bottles I ain't talking about the champagne
Malt liquor sipping gold helped us maintain
Hood niggas watching Goldie like that's us
Bagging up the gold dust with the laws rushed
Snitchin' on them golden boys with the gold trust
Represented by the lawyers with gold cuffs
They order sweet potato with the gold crust
At the same restaurant with the gold judge
That hate the confidence and sign that the gold gives
So we take away your freedom and your golden years
The only time you see your mother's golden tears
LIke what good is gold if you never here
What good is gold that you never wear
I hope it pays your way

Bury me in gold, bury me in gold
Just in case the old man doesn't know me and claims that I owe
Bury me in gold, bury me in gold
Just in case I'm forsaken and I have to pay for my soul

And this song isn't meant to be a glorification of gold
But the understanding that even if
I could take all of this with me, that I'd give it away to get to heaven
I'd give it away to see my Grandmother again
I'd give it away to be at paradise and be at peace with myself
Big houses, nice cars, all that stuff cool
But its materialistic things that we strive so hard for as human beings
And its not fulfilling
It doesn't take away the pain, it doesn't take away the loss
You have to search higher
You have to go higher for that
The Higher power, that higher energy
And that's what I'm striving for
So in the event that I go and you have to bury me
You can bury me with all these things
And as soon as I see my Maker, I would give it all back
I'd give it all away
Because it wasn't nowhere near as important
As being in heaven and being at peace
Believe that doe
Believe that doe
Bury me in gold
Haha
That's the rapper in me, just wanting to do the hook one more time
Bury me in gold
Bury me in gold
Peace to everybody, man, stay blessed
God bless, we love y'all
