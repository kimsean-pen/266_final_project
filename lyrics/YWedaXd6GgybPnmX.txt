I rule the jungle, I rule it with pride
I'm judge and jury, your life I decide
I have awakened for my nightly feast
A reign of terror, beware of the beast

Don't try to run there's no way to survive
A vicious surrender I'll eat you alive
No one is safe until I get my fill
All hear my warning I'm king of the kill

Stalking the level, the scent of my prey
Stopping for nothing don't get in my way
Left to the vultures your life is denied

I rule the jungle, I rule it with pride

Don't try to run there's no way to survive
A vicious surrender I'll eat you alive
No one is safe until I get my fill
All hear my warning I'm king of the kill

Don't try to run there's no way to survive
A vicious surrender I'll eat you alive
No one is safe until I get my fill
All hear my warning I'm king of the kill

Don't try to run there's no way to survive
A vicious surrender I'll eat you alive
No one is safe until I get my fill
All hear my warning I'm king of the kill

Kill
