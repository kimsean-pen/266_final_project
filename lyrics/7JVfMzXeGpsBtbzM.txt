Torn from the heavens
They fall from the sky
And walk the streets
Among mortal men
They hide in shadows

Keepers of the night
Mortal life is weak
Can't hold back the demons
The blood pours as rain
And soon you'll be alone

Descending angel
Stand by my side
We'll face the night
Descending angel
Guard the gates of Hell

Just one more night
For in the morning
We'll bring the light
Born or created
In the image of a god
The heavens fall

No saviour has been sent
No one to guide us
Alone we face the night
Mortal life is brief
For the rebel angels

They make their final stand
And soon you'll be alone
Descending angel
Stand by my side
We'll face the night
Descending angel
Guard the gates of Hell
Just one more night
Forever ends tonight
Descending angel
Descending angel
Descending angel
Stand by my side
We'll face the night
Descending angel
Guard the gates of Hell
Just one more night
Forever ends tonight
Descending angel
Little rebel angel
Little rebel angel
Little rebel angel
Descending angel
