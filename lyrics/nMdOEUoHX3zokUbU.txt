You're hunt in the rain
I wonder how you can sleep that much now
This time come on now
Don't bother whether you've got nothing
How could you
Thought you were
Waste my time
Whenever we start
Take notice
That's us for now

Stay calm and wait up for the signal
You know that I'm running today
We all knew [?] the sooner the ending
It starts with the [?]
Give me all your moonlight and trouble
Let's start, it's an easy escape
You don't need to worry, no

'Cause you know our back's against the wall
(I never think about it)
Acting like you never call
(I never think about it)
And I want to play it cool
(I'm always waiting on it)
So tell what I owe to you
(I never think about it)

Anyway
(I never think about it)
Anyway
([?] tell me, you're so)
Dedicate
(I'm always waiting on it)
Second wave

Hold my hands close
Into the dark
Can we keep what we've taken
I'm thinking twice
'Bout our life
I've been giving up lately

How could you
Thought you were
Waste my time
Whenever we start
Take notice
That's us for now

Stay calm and wait up for the signal
You know that I'm running today
We all knew, seems the sooner the ending
It starts with the [?]
Give me all your moonlight and trouble
Let's stop, it's an easy escape
You don't need to worry, no

'Cause you know our back's against the wall
(I never think about it)
Acting like you never call
(I never think about it)
And I want to play it cool
(I'm always waiting on it)
So tell what I owe to you
(I never think about it)

Anyway
(I never think about it)
Anyway
([?] tell me, used to)
Dedicate
(I'm always waiting on it)
Second wave
(I never think about it)
Anyway
(I never think about it)
Anyway
([?] tell me, used to)
Dedicate
(I'm always waiting on it)
Second wave
