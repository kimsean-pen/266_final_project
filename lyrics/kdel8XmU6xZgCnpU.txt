Hey you mister who the fuck cares
You try hard but we'll never be friends
Cut the bullshit you life's a waste
Cut the bullshit get out of my face
No one's given a reason to trust
No one's given a reason to love
Democracy's just a fucking trap
I will laugh
I will laugh till I crack

Hey you mister fucking disgrace
Don't look around I am your god to praise
Who cares if you hate your own life
Who cares if you don't have a mind

Hear the sounds of abomination
And be my slave
I'm the son of a troubled nation
Fuck you
Fuck you
I spit in your face
Abomination
I'm the abomination
I know that you hate me
But I'm your perversion
Abomination
I'm the abomination
