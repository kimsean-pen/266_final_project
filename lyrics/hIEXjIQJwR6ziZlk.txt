New sick psycho
Depraved with hell to pay

Kiss of death has
Set the abyss aflame

Flash of the void
Has spoiled future fame

One man mental
Left with this hell to pay

Beyond this world is where the hostility bred with hate

I shall ring the bell of Sodom
I've come back for you bitch
It's open season on these gutless fucks
We will all cease to exist

Crawling on hands and knees from birth
Biting the back of mother Earth
Stabbing the stomach of the beasts
Annihilation masterpiece

Tip toe with catastrophe hard on for havoc it lights up my body

The whore universe
Moans for more and more
I'll give it what it wants
Blood
The whore universe
Moans for more and more
I'll give it what it wants
Blood

Kiss of death has set the abyss aflame

Ripped from this life
Eyes roll back
Mind goes blank
Hell to pay

In bed with the universe
A pimp of my own pain
Flirting for penance
One and the same

The whore universe
Moans for more and more
We are one and the same

No starry eyes for the precious life that now surrounds me
No more wondrous hope
For the future that lays before me
It's a different story
For a different man
In another life
Another realm where I am one with the light
No starry eyes for the precious life that now surrounds me
No more wondrous hope
For the future that lays before me
It's a different story
For a different man
In another life
Another realm where I am one with the light

Hell to pay

Beyond this world is where the hostility bred with hate
Now I'm left with this hell to pay
