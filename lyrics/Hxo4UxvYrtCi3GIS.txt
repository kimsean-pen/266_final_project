On the leather couch
Exercising demons
No keeping secrets
Pour a cup of coffee
A few more cigarettes
God only knows
The roads I've been down
Educate me now
Break me down
To the bits and pieces

I need somebody to bring me
Back to life

What's wrong with you?
Tell me all your problems
Let it out
What's wrong with you?
Tell me all your secrets
Get it out
I don't know why these monsters
Are trapped in my head
I keep trying to put them to bed

I've got my hands my pockets
But I've felt no change in years
I've got these broken mirrors
But they keep me here
I need a higher calling
To get me out of bed
But God only knows
The roads I've been down
Liberate me now

I need somebody to bring me
Back to life

What's wrong with you?
Tell me all your problems
Let it out
What's wrong with you?
Tell me all your secrets
Get it out
I don't know why these monsters
Are trapped in my head
I keep trying to put them to bed

What's wrong with you?
What's wrong, what's wrong
What's wrong, what's wrong

What's wrong with you?
Tell me all your problems
Let it out
What's wrong with you?
Tell me all your secrets
Get it out
I don't know why these monsters
Are trapped in my head
I keep trying to put them to bed

What's wrong with you?
What's wrong, what's wrong
What's wrong, what's wrong
