Everyday I try to work out how to
In anyway clear my thoughts and doubts
Hey there, Andy, what's this all about?
He says, aim and shoot it, that's all it is to it

In my senior years the world was in my hands
You'll find sometimes things don't go to plan
We found music 'cause somewhere in our heads
Something went wrong
This is where we belong

Meet me on the surface of Jupiter
We don't need no reason, just make it up
Bring your pen and paper and some time to think
Document our progress 'til your out of ink

You don't really have to change, change for me
Nothing ever is the same, without me
You don't really have to change, change for me

This is where we belong You don't really have to change, change for me
Nothing ever is the same, without me
You don't really have to change, change for me
