I've been thinking reminiscing
'bout the days when we were wishing
We could fly and touch the sky

Laughing meeting under cover
Running hiding from your mother
If we tried we could do anything

And when the DJ came to town
People came from miles around
Baby I still recall those things

And ooh I'm missing you now
I'm missing you now

And you turned my world around
And you buned this disco down
Why d'you leave to find yourself
I can't dance with no one else
And still there's memories of this town
When you burned this disco down
Disco down, ohhh, disco down, disco down

It's been ten years now this Sunday
Since you left or was it Monday
Time can fly when you're still in love

And now I boogie in my dreams
To le Freak or Dancing Queen
Baby I still recall those things

And ooh I'm missing you now
I'm missing you now

And you turned my world around
When you burned this dicow down
Why d'you leave to find yourself
I can't dance with no one else
And still there's memories of this town
When you buned this dicso down
Disco down, down, disco down, oooh

And oh, no the dance has died for sure
Since your love ain't here no more
Still I wonder where you are
"I'll always wonder where you are"

And you turned my world around (Burned disco)
When you burned this disco down
why d'you leave to find yourself
I can't dance with no one else
And still there's memories of this town
When you burned this disco down
Disco down
