If you had a dollar, and I had a dime,
I wonder, could I borrow yours as easy as you could mine?
Because when you need my love, and I give time after time,
And turn around to find me no returns, then, my friend, you've used my dimes!

If there's water in the pitcher, and we both need a drink
To stay alive, my darlin', I'd need less water than you think...

My love, my love, these things, I swear, I say are true,
And all I'm really saying is be as good to me as I am to you...
Oh, yeah...

Listen to this!
Some people want, but they don't wanna give;
They can do all of the wrong in the world,
And got the nerve to not understand the meaning of loving me!
Starting today, tomorrow, and forevermore,
If you can't find it in your heart to do for me,
Then, baby, just don't darken my front door!

Baby, I want you to be as good to me as I am to you;
Whoo, baby! I don't think that's asking you too much to do...
Listen! Don't you walk around here, feeling like you can treat me any ole way,
Using my love, my time, my heart, day, day after day...
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, baby, baby, be as good to me as I am to you...
Whoo! Whoo!
Baby...
