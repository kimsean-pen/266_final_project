That piercing longing
Coarse within
When all that's yearned comes to...
Rising up before I knew

Reaching towards dawn
Consoled and consumed
Whisper transpire
Into gentle reminders

It's not something I sought to seek
And then it knocked the breath from me
To forgive without endeavour
Untainted and tender

The love we dreamed of
The love we dreamed of
The love we dreamed of
The love we dreamed of
