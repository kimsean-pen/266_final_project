Put your life on it
Put your life on my love
We'll get right on it
Like we always could

We can ride through it
Take the rain out of the storm
Take a chance on it
What you waiting for

Everybody wants you
You don't even have to try

Put your light on it
Shine a light on your love
We were made for it
You've been sent here from above

Tell me can you feel it
Tell me can you feel it now

And I
I wanna say I love you
Won't let you down
You're never gonna be without
(It's never gonna stop, it's never gonna stop)

Put your life on it
Put your life on my love
Take a weight from it
Take the weight out of your world

Get the car, we can run
Get a jump on everyone
There's no limit to my love
No places I won't go

Tell me can you feel it
Tell me can you feel it now
(No limit to my love, no places I won't go)

We're just gonna sing it
We're just gonna sing it loud
(It's never gonna stop, it's never gonna stop)

And I
I wanna say I love you
Won't let you down
You're never gonna be without
(It's never gonna stop, it's never gonna stop)

And I
I wanna say I love you
Just one more time
Let me scream it out
(It's never gonna stop, it's never gonna stop)

Put your life on it
Put your life on my love
Put your life on it
Put your life on my love
