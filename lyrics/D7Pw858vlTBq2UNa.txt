Time over nights we shared
Whilst now you're sitting next to me
Or were you just what I wanted?

Tonight let's not drive, just sing with me
I know things are not just like it needs
Time under the stars is what we need
And you held me close, tight into me

All of the people were blind
My view was stuck behind
No games [?] we knew the song
Of something more we could become
