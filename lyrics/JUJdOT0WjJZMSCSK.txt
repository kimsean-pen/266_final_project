Dear Spike,
I can tell that your company cares about its customers
And that's why I wrote this letter
To express my thanks to you in this endeavor
Today I got my stuff that I ordered long ago
And I wanted you to know that I also got the note
And now if you don't mind, I'd like to take some time
I hope you understand this letter from a grateful fan

I had a dream, a very strange dream
Where I was waiting for my package
Then up through the clouds
I saw this bus, a flying bus,
It was coming towards me
It hovered above, I saw my order
Floating down and softly touched ground
Then I saw Spike, he was flying the bus
He smiled and waved as the bus flew away

I just wanna let you know
How grateful I am to you
I appreciate all the hard work
And kindness you put into

Dear Spike
Dear Spike
What a task it must have been
Dear Spike
Dear Spike
I'm so glad to know you didn't forget me

I had a dream, a very strange dream,

Floating down and softly touched ground
Then I saw Spike he was flying the bus
He smiled and waved as the bus flew away.

I just want to let you know
How thankful I am to you
I appreciate all the hard work
And kindness you put into

You didn't forget me, Spike
I wrote you a letter
I ordered a T-shirt and a Cadet Package
It Didn't come for a long time
You sent me a letter and said,
"It's on its way!"

I just want to let you know
How thankful I am to you
I appreciate all the hard work
And kindness you put into

Dear Spike
Dear Spike

I'm so glad to know that you didn't forget about me.
