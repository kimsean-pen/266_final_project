I was looking at the TV news
People everywhere blowing a fuse
People everywhere under the gun
Little kids dying, never had no fun

Human beings ain't got no brains
Think you're better but you're all the same
Think you're clever but you're all to blame
Here we are again in the same old frame

Shut up, I'm talking to you
It's on television, so it can't be true
And I can't play the game no more

Wake up and see it through
Kill the many to save the few
I know what the blind man sees
On your feet or on your knees

Headline terror, crime on rise
Half ain't true and the rest is lies
Same smile on the same old face
Same old horse win the same old race

I wouldn't smile if I was you
Don't relax, 'cos it ain't so new
Watch your back, light the light outside
Somebody coming that you just can't bribe

Shut up, I'm talking to you
It's on television, so it must be true
I can't believe their lies no more

Watch out, I'm coming through
Boogeyman gonna bite you too
I know what the blind man sees
On your feet or on your knees

Hey, hey
Stop

I was reading some magazine
It was written for human beings
Can't believe all the stuff I read
Human trash for the human head

You humans shouldn't be so proud
You humans shouldn't talk too loud
You humans just ain't too smart
It's enough to break my human heart

Shut up, I'm talking to you
Pay attention, 'cos I mean you too
And I will tell you something now

Your values ain't worth a dime
Human rights, just human crime
I know what the blind man sees
On your feet or on your knees
