Tonight I think I saw the daylight,
Daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight...

In my knees, in my knees, like jelly, they say that's how you know your hit
In my voice, in my voice, it's trembling so they say but is this it
I was born a nervous wreck
With my heart in my stomach and a devil on my back
And I was born with runner's legs
Chills running down my spine all the time

So how can I tell, how can I tell
Close your eyes and if it is real, if it is real
It's gonna feel like daylight
It's gonna feel like daylight
And how will I know, how will I know
When in doubt, they say it's a no, say it's a no
It's gonna feel like daylight
It's gonna feel like daylight

Is it so, is it so
It's stronger if you cry into the phone
Am I vain, am I vain
To think that you could never let me go
I grew up with curtain falls
And applauding when the lovers rose from deaths to bow
Oh
And we would leave with tears and smiles
Thinking this is how we want to feel all the time

So how can I tell, how can I tell
Close your eyes and if it is real, if it is real
It's gonna feel like daylight
It's gonna feel like daylight
And how will I know, how will I know
When in doubt, they say it's a no, say it's a no
It's gonna feel like daylight
It's gonna feel like daylight

A wide open door
And no one seems to know
Should I go in?
No poetry helps the cause
And all the advice people tend to throw
It doesn't help no 'cause I'm on my own

So how can I tell, how can I tell
Close your eyes and if it is real, if it is real
It's gonna feel like daylight
It's gonna feel like daylight
And how will I know, how will I know
When in doubt, they say it's a no, say it's a no
It's gonna feel like daylight
It's gonna feel like daylight

Tonight I think I saw the daylight
Daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
Tonight I think I saw the daylight
Daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
Tonight I think I saw the daylight
Daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
Tonight I think I saw the daylight
Daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
Tonight I think I saw the daylight
Daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight...
