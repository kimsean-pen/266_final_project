Say me no like that kind of Babylon
Say me no dig them kind of wicked men
For me no find no righteousness
All I see is dread dread wickedness

Everybody beat down Babylon
Everybody whip them wicked men
Whip them, whip them

Oh, what a wicked situation
Must we all die for salvation
This may cause a revolution
Plenty dangerous pollution

Everybody beat down Babylon
Everybody whip them wicked men
Whip them, whip them

Never turn your back on them people
Never let them know what you're doing
