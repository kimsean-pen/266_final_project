I am a maverick
Built to create, designed to destroy
And I am the quiver in the bones when you get annoyed
And I am a nightmare
These monsters I hold, I'm bringing them home
And I am the shiver in your lungs when you're out in the cold

But my body is bored of being torn apart
And I've done this to myself
So if you're thinking of stealing the last love I have
Then you're thinking of stealing somebody else

Turn the lights down low
If this is how I go
I'll tell them that the villains on my list
They're what turned me into this
So I'll go
I'm better off alone
Run and tell them that the villains on my list
They're the reason I've been pulled so low

Monster, monster, I feel like such a monster
Tell them I've been saved
But the devil walks amongst ya, amongst ya
I'll be the ghost the haunts ya
You've seen my demons but you weren't really supposed to
You've got me locked up but I'm not like you
I'll be my own escape route, you know
I'll get you caught up
Got my attention
I'll make you my victim

Turn the lights down low
If this is how I go
I'll tell them that the villains on my list
They're what turned me into this
So I'll go
I'm better off alone
Run and tell them that the villains on my list
They're the reason I've been pulled so low
If this is how I go
I'll tell them that the villains on my list
They're what turned me into this
So I'll go
I'm better off alone
Run and tell them that the villains on my list
They're the reason I've been pulled

I don't feel anything
Because I became possessed and obsessed with the idea of revenge
Where you going now?
Everybody's looking at you
'Cos you set yourself on fire just to light up the room

Turn the lights down low
If this is how I go
I'll tell them that the villains on my list
They're what turned me into this
So I'll go
I'm better off alone
Run and tell them that the villains on my list
They're the reason I've been pulled so low
If this is how I go
I'll tell them that the villains on my list
They're what turned me into this
Yeah I know
So welcome to the show
