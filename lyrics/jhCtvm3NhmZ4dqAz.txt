The machine of a dream
Such a clean machine
With the piston's a-pumpin'
Аnd the hubcaps all gleam

When I'm holding your wheel
Аll I hear is your gear
When my hand's on your grease gun
It's like a disease, son

I'm in love with my car
Gotta feel for my automobile
Get a grip on my boy racer rollbar
Such a thrill when your radials squeal

Told my girl I have to forget her
Rather buy me a new carburettor
So, she made tracks sayin' this is the end now
Cars don't talk back, they're just four-wheeled friends now

When I'm holding your wheel
Аll I hear is your gear
When I'm cruisin' in overdrive
Don't have to listen to no run of the mill talk jive

I'm in love with my car
Gotta feel for my automobile
I'm in love with my car
String back gloves in my automolove
