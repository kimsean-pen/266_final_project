Life is cruel, these circumstances
Why were there chances
I'd fought so hard for you
The times gone right
And we both know it
But you're not to show it
Peeling apart slowly from you
Kissing me so sweetly, a taste of margarita
I won't forget that day
You're the one I dreamed of
Always be my first love
But you know that I can't stay

And I'll never get over
Leaving you
It's the hardest thing I'll ever do

Lazy days, spent in the sunshine
Drinking Ros√© wine
Feeling so easy with you
Late night walks, talking together
Hoping forever, wouldn't be coming so soon
Letting go of someone
I don't wanna part from
I won't forget today
Everything I dreamed of
So glad your my first love
But you know that I can't stay

And I'll never get over
Leaving you
But I know it's what I gotta do

And I'll never get over
Leaving you
It's the hardest thing I'll ever do

Maybe some day
Our roads will cross again
Don't say it's the end
Maybe some day, but until then

And I'll never get over
Leaving you
But I know it's what I gotta do

And I'll never get over
Leaving you
It's the hardest thing I'll ever do

I gotta leave you baby
Though it hurts me
And I'll never get over this
And when it hurts, it hurts
It's killng me, it's kiling me
