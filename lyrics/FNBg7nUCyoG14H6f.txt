We heard horns in hills ringing
The swords shining in South-kingdom
Steeds went striding to the Stoningland
As winds in morning. War was there.

Drowning in dark waters, meres of Morthond
beneath the mountain shadows
Death in the morning and at day's ending
Lords took and lowly. Long now they sleep.

Grey now as tears gleaming silver
Red then it rolled roaring water
Foam dyed with blood, flamed at a sunset
As bacon mountains burned at evening
