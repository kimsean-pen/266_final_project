It's all small town talk, you know how people are
They can't stand to see, someone else doing what they like to
It's all small town talk, you mustn't pay no mind
Don't believe a word, they try to do it everytime

You can't believe everything you hear
And only half of what you see
And if you're gonna believe in anyone
You gotta believe in me

It's all small town talk, it's well known fact
You don't ever know, how one might react to what you're thinking
And it's small town talk, they tell alot of lies
Make some people crazy never realize that they're sinking

We're only two people, trying to live together
Trying to make something work
Who are we to judge one another?
That could cause alot of hurt

It's all small town talk, you know how people are
They can't stand to see, someone else doing what they want to
It's all small town talk, you mustn't pay no mind
Don't believe a word, they try to do it everytime
