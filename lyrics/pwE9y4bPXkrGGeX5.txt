We're swimming in the blue
Nigh misfortune: Unlively like a glue
My eyes are soaked all way through

Our sinking friendships
We drown them all

I'm singing a sad tune
Is this all I do? (Ooh Ooh Ooh)
Is this all I do? (Ooh Ooh Ooh)

We should all wear two lifesaving layers
We should all wear two...

No one knows you, till it's over
You know no one true, till it's over

Is this all I do?
Is this all I do?

My lips are pale blue
My shivering half-moon
My last night's lost tune
It's the end of the end of the end

Our sinking friendships
We drown them all

I'm singing a sad tune
Is this all I do? (Ooh Ooh Ooh)
Is this all I do? (Ooh Ooh Ooh)

We should all wear two lifesaving layers
We should all wear two...

No one knows you, till it's over
You know no one true, till it's over

No one knows you, till it's over
You know no one true, till it's over

Is this all I do?
Is this all I do?
