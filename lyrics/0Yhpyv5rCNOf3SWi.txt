You my obsession (Ocean, eleven)
You my whole passion (Patience, circle)
I was looking for another challenge (This usual mission)
I needed a change (A wish, creation)

Your eyes look like a mirror
And no more spells
My mind's wearing a robe
But look now, no

Love is not enough
In order to last
Remember your laugh
Is a part of my past

Better give you up my soul now
But I'll never, never, never, stop thinking of you

Better give you up my soul now
But I'll never, never, never, stop thinking of you

Never, never in the right place
For us to stand by eachother
You have, you have, you have to replace
A fresh, no good part and find another

My heart was like a stone
When you stopped the pain
I felt like a clone
Cold-blood in my veins

Forgive my silence, this absence of time
Cry my best sins, deception was prime
I keep a secret, a grand adventure
That kind of regret, couldn't happen in the future

Now, going ahead
My hands playing touch
We're taking this new gate
You bring me so much

I Better give you up my soul now
But I'll never, never, never, stop thinking of you

Better give you up my soul now
But I'll never, never, never, stop thinking of you

Better give you up my soul now
But I'll never, never, never, stop thinking of you

Better give you up my soul now
But I'll never, never, never, stop thinking of you
