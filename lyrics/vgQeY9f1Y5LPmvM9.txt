In their eyes is a place that you finally discovered
That you love each year, you've got to stay
On this bottom of the rock, an island
On which you find the love within you twitch
You feel that itch in your petticoat
Your pretty, pretty, petticoat

Then you smiled, he got wild
You didn't understand
That there's money to be made
Beauty is a card that must get played
By organization

But ooh la, she was such a good girl to me
And ooh la, the world just chewed her up, and spat her out
And ooh la, she was such a good girl to me
And ooh la, the world just chewed her up, and spat her out

The world can be a very big place
So be yourself, don't get out of place
Love your mum and love him twice
Go to Hollywood and pay the price
Oh, go to Hollywood

And don't be a star, it's such a drag
Take care of yourself, don't begin to lag
It's a hard life to live, so live it well
I'll be your friend and not in pretend
I know you girl in all situations

But ooh la, she was such a good girl to me
And ooh la, the world just chewed her up, and spat her out
And ooh la, she was such a good girl to me
And ooh la, the world just chewed her up, and spat her out

Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, petticoat
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, petticoat
In all situations
But ooh la, she was such a good girl to me
And ooh la, the world just chewed her up, and spat her out
And ooh la, she was such a good girl to me
And ooh la, the world just chewed her up, and spat her out
