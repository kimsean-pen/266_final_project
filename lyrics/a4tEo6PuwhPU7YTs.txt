Who is in that house?

I opened the door to see
Who is up the stairs?
I'm walking up foolishly

And at the end of the hall was a door
And I got pulled in by a sound
But I wish I'd never found

In the privacy of your own room
Where flowers in the wallpaper bloom
Where I just don't understand
In the privacy of your room
Look away now, look away now
At the moon

Is somebody watching me?
You really shouldn't see
Why did you climb that last stair
You found me unaware

What I'm doing now it's my own
And I don't want it to be known
And it has to just remain

In the privacy of my own room
Where flowers in the wallpaper bloom
Where you just don't understand
In the privacy of my room
Look away now, look away now
At the moon

Puzzle me now with mystery clothes
These apples I love, these apples I loath
And always forgive the future to come
For stealing the light from the sun
