These are the days when we don't get out of bed
These are the days when nothing is all we have
We are young, we are bright
We have love on our side
Life is one big thrill
We are dumb, we are loud
As if we only can shout
Every night ends the same

We are looking for stars
But we only find sugar
We are looking for stars
These nights are all insane
We are all on a high
Night after night
Lost in outer space
We are looking for stars
But we only find sugar

These are the nights when we don't go to bed
These are the nights when nothing is already said

We are bold, play it hard
We have time on our side
Attracted by every sin
We are dumb, we are loud
As if we only can shout
Every night ends the same

We are looking for stars
But we only find sugar
We are looking for stars
These nights are all insane
We are all on a high
Night after night
Lost in outer space
We are looking for stars
But we only find sugar
