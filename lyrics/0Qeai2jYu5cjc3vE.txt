I hear you've got your troubles, or so I've been told
Maybe just a couple but I'm not quite sold
I'm indifferent to the difference between tomorrow and today
Less an indiscretion than a lesson I've been paid
And the stages of recovery can signify your age
Like rings around a stump
Oh, that's something I know a little bit about, child
Lately, it's been getting a little bit crazy
I don't wanna be complaining, complaining, oh

All my friends go to bed
Dreaming up a reason they should weep, weep
And all my friends go to the ends of the earth
For secrets they don't wanna keep

Well this is my confession
Yes, yes
This is me confessing
God bless
The sad and selfish
Stay helpless

'Cause I've always been stronger than that
Hold the weight of the world on my back
It's just love, selfish love
Love, selfish love

I've got nothing to confess, yes
I've got nothing to confess, yes
I've got nothing to confess, yes
I've got nothing to confess, yes

It's too easy to be scared sometimes
I'm not gonna lie like I don't understand
But it's like the whole world is jumping off the bridge
And you don't want to be the one standing on dry land

All my friends go to the ends of the earth
For secrets they don't wanna keep

Well this is my confession
Yes, yes
This is me confessing
God bless
The sad and selfish
Stay helpless

'Cause I've always been stronger than that
Hold the weight of the world on my back
It's just love, selfish love
Love, selfish love

I've got nothing to confess, yes
I've got nothing to confess, yes
I've got nothing to confess, yes
I've got nothing to confess, yes

Yes, yes
This is me confessing
God bless
The sad and selfish
Stay helpless

'Cause I've always been stronger than that
Hold the weight of the world on my back
It's just love, selfish love
Love, selfish love

I've got nothing to confess, yes
I've got nothing to confess, yes
I've got nothing to confess, yes
I've got nothing to confess, yes
