Something worthwhile
Something unsaid
Something I needed after you left
And I don't recognise my face anymore
I got lost without you
While I was running on a high, high
I felt like I was wasting time, time

Keep falling on a loaded gun
Tryna be someone for you
Feeling like the only one
Tryna find my way to you
Do you remember me like I remember you?
Do you remember me like I remember you?
Keep falling on a loaded gun
Tryna be someone for you
Feeling like the only one
Tryna find my way to you
Do you remember me like I remember you?
Do you remember me like I remember you?

Got my reward after the show
When I'm all rising, you let me go
I'm putting on a smile these days
Give 'em when I nearly break
I've been walking a wrong way
Feel like I am wasting time
The faces I don't recognize

Keep falling on a loaded gun
Tryna be someone for you
Feeling like the only one
Tryna find my way to you
Do you remember me like I remember you?
Do you remember me like I remember you?

Keep falling on a loaded gun
Tryna be someone for you
Feeling like the only one
Tryna find my way

Do you remember me like I remember you?
Do you remember me like I remember you?
Keep falling on a loaded gun
Tryna be someone for you
Feeling like the only one
Tryna find my way to you
Do you remember me like I remember you?
Do you remember me like I remember you?
