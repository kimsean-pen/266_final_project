Sounds of imbalance
Sleeps through the never
The artificial lightsource
Is creeping with flies

And this time i break
I will never make
Another day
Defiant to what's delivered

I will find a way
To sever myself
Exit all today
You can't see this
Did you ever say
I break sever
I will find a way
Visit me when i'm there

The weakness of hope
Is the strength of decline
Remember what's past ways
And what i've become
The joy of not being
Something i need
I'm only weather
But only to me
