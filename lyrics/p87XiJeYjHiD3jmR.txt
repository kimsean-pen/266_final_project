And we were children
We were so afraid
We built this dream
We built this dream

And when it woke you up at night
You had to find the meaning
So scared to watch it die
You were taking it apart

As soon as we looked through the dream
And all the things that led us to it
We have these needs, we have these needs
We have these needs

The things that brought us here
Not knowing what we'd find
We're heading towards the other side
And all the people left behind

Talk it through and take good care
No matter what, I will be there
First time joy and last time pain
I listen to this old refrain

I wrap my heart in words you say
But all we cherish will decay
First time joy and last time pain
Here we go again
