Fight the fight alone
When the world is full of victims
Dims a fading light in our souls
Leave the peace alone
How we all are slowly changing
Dims a fading light in our souls

In my opinion seeing is to know
The things we hold are always first to go
And who's to say we won't end up alone

On broken wings I'm falling, and it won't be long
The skin on me is burning by the fires of the sun
On skinned knees I'm bleeding
And it won't be long
I've got to find that meaning and I'll search for so long

Cry ourselves to sleep
We will sleep alone forever
Will you lay me down in the same place with all I love
Mend the broken homes
Care for them they are our brothers
Save the fading light in our souls

In my opinion seeing is to know
What you give will always carry you
And who's to say we won't survive it too

On broken wings I'm falling and it won't be long
The skin on me is burning by the fires of the sun
On skinned knees I'm bleeding
And it won't be long
I've got to find that meaning and I'll search for so long

Set a-free all
Relying on their will to make me all that I am
And all I'll be
Set a-free all
Will fall between the cracks with memories of all that I am
And all I'll be

On broken wings I'm falling and it won't be long
The skin on me is burning by the fires of the sun
On skinned knees I'm bleeding
And it won't be long
I've got to find that meaning and I'll search for so long
