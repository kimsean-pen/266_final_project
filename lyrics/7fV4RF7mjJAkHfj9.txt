Her hand in the darkness
I follow for so long
Your voice in my ear
Carry me back home
Wishing you'd consider
A change of heart
But all are so bitter
And we will never stop
We will never stop (4x)
A light in the darkness
Been dreaming for so long
Searching for a witness
Or means to carry on
Sweet talk for hours
'Bout things we're gonna' do
And sometimes I lose track of my heart
But this could never work out oh ohh
Never stop
We will never stop (3x)
We will never stop (4x)
Her hand in the darkness
Follow for so long
Your voice in my ear
Help me back home
Why won't you consider?
A change of heart (11x)
