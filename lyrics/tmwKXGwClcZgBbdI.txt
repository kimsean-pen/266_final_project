I know you're (long to play?),
In your old mental way,
Come here and (inch?) your loss,
Alone you're like (a Boss?),
You run in Circles,
Some People never learn

I, Im gonna survive
I'll stand up and fight,
It's making Me Stronger, Stronger
I, Im gonna go Wild,
And battle it out,
It's making Me Stronger, Stronger
I'm Stronger

This is my favourite Game,
You're Mean but I'm Insane,
Thinking that I would break,
Would be your last mistake,
A Storm is coming,
And teach you to Obey

I, Im gonna survive
I'll stand up and fight,
It's making Me Stronger, Stronger
I, Im gonna go Wild,
And battle it out,
It's making Me Stronger, Stronger
I'm Stronger

Cuz' this Sand Storms,
Will break my Bones,
Nothing hurts a Freak like me,
Dont (Threw it on?),
So stand and (tow?),
I kill my Agony,
It's time to let the Games begin

I, Im gonna survive
I'll stand up and fight,
It's making me Stronger, Stronger
I, Im gonna go Wild,
And battle it out,
It's making me Stronger, Stronger
Im gonna go Wild
Making me Stronger, Stronger
