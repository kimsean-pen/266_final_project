Picture Cards
Blaze Foley

Didn't try to fall in love with you
Tried everything that I could do
To keep myself from falling
Like I've done so many times

Tried to wash it all away
With anything and every day
I think of all the things we said
When we were all alone

I saw daylight in your eyes
I saw daylight in your eyes

Wish I could but I can't say
Tomorrow's still a day away
I'll always love the time
That I can spend with you

Who can know and who can tell
I never seen a wishin' well
That held what it's supposed to hold but who knows
Maybe somewhere there might be

I saw daylight in your eyes
I saw daylight in your eyes

Time will come and time will go
Can I believe the things I know
Been doing it a long time
Guess I can again

Win or draw no chance to lose
Picture cards can't picture you
But I can see you like you are
When I just close my eyes
