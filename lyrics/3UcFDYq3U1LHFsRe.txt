I'm wearing clothes, I'm all alone
I showered thinking you'd come home
But here I am just waiting here
You never came to say hello

What makes it worse
It's just a curse
I made you up
You made me down
There's nothing
Nothing at all

Mr. E, why did you leave?
Why can't I see
You're not the guy for me?
Mr. E, there's something wrong
'Cause you are never here
To listen to my song

Our history's a masterpiece of memories
Where I'm the hole and you're the key
You locked me up, I kept you in
But nothing's really here

What makes it worse
Its just a curse
I made you up
You made me down
There's nothing
Nothing at all

Mr. E, why did you leave?
Why can't I see
You're not the guy for me?
Mr. E, there's something wrong
'Cause you are never here
To listen to my song

Where would you go (would you go)
Mr. E
Who do you know (do you know)
Oh, Mr. E
Mr. C and Mr. D
Oh, Mr. E

Mr. E, why did you leave?
Why can't I see
You're not the guy for me?
Mr. E, there's something wrong
'Cause you are never here
To listen to my song
