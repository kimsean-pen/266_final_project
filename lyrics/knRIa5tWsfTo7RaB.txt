You'll never be my hometown girl
There's nothing like her in this world
I'm tired of the get around girls
Ain't nothing like my hometown girl

You told me you were cool with kickin' it
In my crib, in my pool, we be dippin' in
But some days you would look at me so different
(Ooh, why?)
Is it because I'm in the music biz?
Or you don't wanna love me when I'm just strugglin'?
But you still tell me that you're my hometown chick, why?

I'm missin' someone else
This will never be the same
But I blame it on myself
'Cause I can't make you change

You'll never be my hometown girl
There's nothing like her in this world
I'm tired of the get around girls
Ain't nothing like my hometown girl

I can't remember when we last expressed
All the feelin's in our hearts that we possess
Even though we're makin' love, it's not passionate
(Ooh, why?)
You keep on runnin' back into the past
Tyin' to hold on to my love, but you can't make it last forever
So I must confess

I'm missin' someone else
This will never be the same (never be the same)
But I blame it on myself
'Cause I can't make you change (I can't make you change)

You'll never be my hometown girl
There's nothing like her in this world
I'm tired of the get around girls
Ain't nothing like my hometown girl

Never be my...
Never be my...
