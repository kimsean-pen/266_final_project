There's a whisper in my chest
It's telling me
The best is yet to come
Hiding in the night
Shadows speak
Telling me to run

We had our chance, but it's over now
We gave it all to the lost and found

The house is burning
Better run for cover
Run for cover
Run for cover
Wheels keep turning
And I'm going under
Going under
I've already packed my promises
They're waiting by the door
The house is burning
Better run for cover
Run for cover
Run for cover

Try to turn away
Got tangled in the past
It's overgrown
I look up to the sky
Try to spread my wings
But that bird's already flown
I'm reaching out for the higher ground
But we gave it all to the lost and found

The house is burning
Better run for cover
Run for cover
Run for cover
Wheels keep turning
And I'm going under
Going under
I've already packed my promises
They're waiting by the door
The house is burning
Better run for cover
Run for cover

We are dreams of foolish gold
Live recklessly with our hearts
And with hands too hard to hold
You wrapped me into your arms
You wrapped me into your arms
The house is burning
Better run for cover
Run for cover
Run for cover

The house is burning
Better run for cover
Run for cover
Run for cover
Wheels keep turning
And I'm going under
Going under
I've already packed my promises
They're waiting by the door
The house is burning
Better run for cover
Run for cover
Run for cover
