Oh, what a cold, dark world it is to walk through
Alone with a fear-filled head
Thinking of losing you is a haunted song
And a trend much worse than the fear of dead
Now I feel the fear rising up
Climbing up, taking over my body
And I feel my pulse starting up
Begging me again
To open my eyes, I'm reaching for you
Set me on fire, set me on fire
I'm burning inside, I'm waiting for you
Set me on fire, set me on fire
I feel the fire
Two hearts that beat, oh, to feed the fire
You are a spark that shines a light where we could
Belong together, factionless
Let's keep it burning bright 'til we're floating
Away, 'til we're ashes dancing inside the flames
Now I feel the fear rising up
Climbing up, taking over my body
And I feel my pulse starting up
Begging me again
To open my eyes, I'm reaching for you
Set me on fire, set me on fire
I'm burning this time, I'm waiting for you
Set me on fire, set me on fire
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Your hands in mine, oh, I feel the fire
Two hearts that beat, oh, to feed the fire
To open my eyes, I'm reaching for you
Set me on fire, set me on fire
I'm burning inside, I'm waiting for you
Set me on fire, set me on fire
Oh, oh, oh, oh
