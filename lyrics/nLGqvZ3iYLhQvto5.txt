Another Late night on 14th and Main
Should daddy's little girl be out this late
She takes off her clothes and closes her eyes
Tears start to fall as she looks at her life

It wasn't her fault that you weren't around
To keep her away from the things that she found
God only knows what else could go wrong
Somebody come take this little girl home

They found her body face down dead in the rain
Such a shame
Such a pretty face never should have felt this pain
Who's to blame
Such a shame

Every young girl in this world needs love
Somebody to hold so they don't give up
It's our mothers and daughters and sisters you see
When your angel cries then you'll see what I mean

It wasn't her fault that you weren't around
To keep her away from the things that she found
God only knows what else could go wrong
Somebody come take this little girl home

They found her body face down dead in the rain
Such a shame
Such a pretty face never should have felt this pain
Who's to blame
Such a shame

There's a place in heaven for every little girl
Lord, that gets taken in this dirty world

They found her body face down dead in the rain
Such a shame (Shame)
Such a pretty face never should have felt this pain

They found her body face down dead in the rain
Such a shame (Shame)
Such a pretty face never should have felt this pain
Who's to blame
Such a shame

They found her body face down dead in the rain.
