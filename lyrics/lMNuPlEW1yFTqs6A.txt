I used to recognize this place
I stoned a layer of youth and body
Is it drifting in and out of space?
Is it drifting in and out of space?

Isn't it all a mess?
Soon it will go away
Isn't it all a mess?
Soon it will go away

Gonna put your flowers in a pot
Gonna wait and see what happens in spring
Is they're going to die or glow
If they gonna die, won't do anything

Isn't it all a mess?
Soon it'll blow away
Isn't it all a mess?
Soon it'll blow, soon it'll blow
Isn't it all a mess?
Isn't it all a mess?
Isn't it all a mess?
Soon it'll blow, soon it'll blow

I used to recognize your face
Is it drifting in and out of space?
Am I looking for someone who's not around

Gonna wait and see what happens in the spring
If they're going to die or glow
If their gonna die, won't do anything

Isn't it all a mess?
Soon it'll fade away
Isn't it all a mess?
Soon it'll fade, soon it'll fade
Isn't it all a mess?
Isn't it all a mess?
Isn't it all a mess?
Soon it'll fade, soon it'll fade

End
