I know I'm tripping
Baby I'm barely alive
Are my feet on the ground because my head's in the sky
A little paper
A little love on the tongue
All my memories are rushing back from when I was young
A world of color
I'm in the future and scared
I thought I knew what to expect but I just wasn't prepared
And now my brain
A private theater
Is it a 35 or 40 millimeter?
(Is it a camera? Or is it a gun?)

Live a little, dropping acid, and I'm flying away
I'm feeling like an astronaut in space
I don't think that it'll do the damage they say
Feeling like an astronaut in space

Lysergic feelings
I'm breathing barium vibes
I'm looking down from the ceiling, I've got a bird's eye
I'm in the bathtub
Swimming in lavender hymns
I'm discovering God and she is paper-thin
The question's loaded
Am I naive?
I had a vision of you watching me as I was fading in and out
In a department store
I don't want to be alone anymore

Live a little, dropping acid, and I'm flying away
I'm feeling like an astronaut in space
I don't think that it'll ever do the damage they say
Feeling like an astronaut in space
Live a little, dropping acid, and I'm flying away
I'm feeling like an astronaut in space
I don't think that it'll ever do the damage they say
Feeling like an astronaut in space

Is this the comedown?
I'm stretching back into time
A little love on the tongue
A little more piece of mind

Live a little, dropping acid, and I'm flying away
I'm feeling like an astronaut in space
I don't think that it'll ever do the damage they say
Feeling like an astronaut in space
Live a little, dropping acid, and I'm flying away
I'm feeling like an astronaut in space
I don't think that it'll ever do the damage they say
Feeling like an astronaut in space
