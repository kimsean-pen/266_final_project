Come in smooth talker
Yeah, you've got smooth words
Oh me, I'm a little bit awkward
The way I stumble and I slur

And I thought I'd be more
Something better, less than dirt
But I will never, I will never
I will never come first

Blue, oh, it's just a feeling I get with you
Oh, I wanna go there again
And blue, it's just a feeling I get
Again, again, again

And I tried to be clever
But I've closed all those doors
Anyway I liked me better
When I wasn't so insecure

And I'll wave my face like a flag in front of your's
It's so clear, it's so clear
It's so clear, it's so

Blue, oh, it's just a feeling I get with you
Oh, I wanna go there again
And blue, it's just a feeling I get
Again, again, again

I'll know more about you when it's over
I'll know more about you over and over
I'll know more about you

Blue, oh, it's just a feeling I get with you
Oh, I wanna go there again
And blue, it's just a feeling I get
Again, again
Again, again
Again, again
Again, again
Again, again
Again
