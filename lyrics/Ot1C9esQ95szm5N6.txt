She grew up with the children of the stars
In the Hollywood hills and the Boulevard
Her parents threw big parties everyone was there
They hung out with folks like Dennis Hopper
Bob Seeger and Sonny and Cher

And she feels safe now in this bar on Fairfax
And from the stage I can tell that she can't let go and she can't relax
And just before she hangs her head to cry
I sing to her a lullaby
I sing
Everything's gonna be all right

Rockabye, rockabye
Everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye, rockabye
Rockabye
She still lives with her Mom outside the city

Down that street about a half a mile
And all her friends tell her
She's so pretty
But she'd be a whole lot prettier
If she smiled once in a while
'Cause even her smile looks like a frown

And she's seen her share of devils in this angel town

Everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye, rockabye
Everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye, rockabye, rockabye

I told her I ain't so sure about this place
It's hard to play a gig in this town
Keep a straight face
And seems like everybody's got a plan
It's kind of like Nashville with a tan
Everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye, rockabye
Everything's gonna be all right
So rockabye, rockabye
Everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye, rockabye
Everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye, rockabye
Everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye, rockabye
Everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye, rockabye
Rockabye
Bye bye
Bye bye
