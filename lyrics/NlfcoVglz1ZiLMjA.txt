You're not on my list of things to do
'cause I've already done you.
And I am protective, it's so cute
but only when it suits you.
Is this all in vain?
Can these words explain

Desperate minds mean desperate measures
You've got to get this one together
You're young and in love
That should be enough.

At least you'll have nice thoughts of me
when I am cheating on you
In your dreams.
I've told you before my closet's clean
and that these bones don't belong to me.
Try this one for size
try me one more time.
You hold me down

by keeping me around.
Desperate minds mean desperate measures
You've got to get this one together
You're young and in love

That should be enough.
Desperate minds mean desperate measures
You've got to get this one together
You're young and in love

That should be enough.
You hold me down
by keeping me around.
And no one takes me home.
no one takes me home.
You hold me down
by keeping me around.
And no one takes me home.
no one takes me home.
Desperate minds mean desperate measures
You've got to get this one together
You're young and in love
That should be enough.
(Young and in love, that should be enough.)
