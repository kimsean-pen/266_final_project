the wind shook the kiss from your mouth
before i could learn whose twin i was
your face familiar like a light in the water
just your touch could cure my lonesome blood
you let go of everything you had
and everything got left here waiting for what comes next
the state of things is tied to me
and i've been careless i think too much
i want to lie still near you i want to
the wind shook the kiss from your mouth
before i could learn whose twin i was
