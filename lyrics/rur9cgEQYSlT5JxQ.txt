Your hands found a dark switch in me that I
That I didn't know existed
The lost tribes in the back of my brain
Making fires from what they've stacked for years in secret

Don't give me more than I can handle
Don't gimme more than I can take
Don't give me more than I can handle
Oh hell just give me all you've got in every way

Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh

This is not like it was before
Baby I'm not afraid
Some things fall when they're meant to fall
And you can see everything

Who knew when you brought me a storm
Who knew, who knew that I would like it
The small town of my mind as it was
Now a city, wreaking havoc, stretching endless

Don't give me more than I can handle
Don't gimme more than I can take
Don't give me more than I can handle
Oh hell just give me all you've got in every way

Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh

This is not like it was before
Baby I'm not afraid
Some things fall when they're meant to fall
And you can see everything

It's not like it was before
Some things fall when they're meant to fall
It's not like it was before
Some things fall when they're meant to fall

This is not like it was before
Baby I'm not afraid
Some things fall when they're meant to fall
And you can see everything

This is not like it was before
Baby I'm not afraid
Some things fall when they're meant to fall
And you can see everything
