There is a boy I know
We are friends, we are more than
'cause everytime he looks at me I get electric shocks
In my brain and in my heart
But he is not the one I love
Still everytime I look into his pretty eyes
I think of all the things I didn't even try
And though I know that it is only chemistry
There's nothing in the world that I can do about it
But I love my boyfriend
He is good to me, he's a good man
He takes care of me when I need aid
He's the one I want to have children with
But everytime I close my eyes I think of him
And all the things I didn't even do with him
And though I know that it is only chemistry
There's nothing in the world that I can do about it
(oh)
Ten years do I have to worry
I considered leaving for a guy that hates money
I get bored - what a bummer
Craving the intention of a blazed-out drummer
Time moves fast it's the year of the election
The blush-inducing rush of another man's affection
I don't care, I don't even know
I suppose I just wanted the attention
But I love my boyfriend
He is good to me, he's a good man
He takes care of me wherever I am
He's the one I want to have children with
Yeah I love my boyfriend
(Everytime I look into his pretty eyes)
And he loves me wherever I am
(I think of all the things I didn't even try)
He is kind to me, he's a good man
(And though I know that it is only chemistry)
And there is nothing in the world I wouldn't do for him
(There's nothing in the world I wouldn't do for him)
Yeah
