Wish I could save you
Seems like it shouldn't be so hard
Wish I could replace you
Maybe we could leave it all behind
Whoa, I wouldn't mind

State line is a hundred miles away (away)
I never felt so distant before, whoa
State line is a hundred miles away (away)
I never felt so distant before, whoa

Let me introduce you
To all of the ways I could let you down
Let me seduce you
And maybe we could get this off the ground
Next time around

State line is a hundred miles away (away)
I never felt so distant before, whoa
State line is a hundred miles away (away)
