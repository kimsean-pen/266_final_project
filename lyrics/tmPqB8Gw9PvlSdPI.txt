The earth will see our eyes
Go blank tonight
The earth will rot away
Go blank tonight

I, I really wish
These snakes were your arms
I, I really wish
You'd make up your mind

The earth disguised a way
Don't blink tonight
The earth will see our eyes
Don't blink tonight

I, I really wish
These snakes were your arms
I, I really wish
You could make up your mind

No blood, more, more blood

I, I really wish
These snakes were your arms
I, I really wish
You'd make up your mind
Blood, down, more
