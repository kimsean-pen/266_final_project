We're living in a desperate time
Our only hope is believing there's another side
To all we've known
The truth hidden before our eyes
A vision of a life beyond our view
If only we can see it through

So reach to the sky
The life we have has come
This night of our lives
We've only just begun
Together we are bright as the stars
We're a light that will never die
This is the moment we come alive

We're living in a desperate time
Waking up to dreaming of a better life
We won't give up
Our love is like a warning sign
Revealing of a life that's all brand new
If only we can see it through

So reach to the sky
The life we have has come
This night of our lives
We've only just begun
Together we are bright as the stars
We're a light that will never die
This is the moment we come alive

The moment we come alive
The moment we come alive
And the energy within us
Ignites us forever
Forever, forever

So reach to the sky
The life we have has come
This night of our lives
We've only just begun
Together we are bright as the stars
We're a light that will never die
This is the moment we come alive

This is the moment
This is the moment
This is the moment we come alive
This is the moment
This is the moment
This is the moment we come alive
