Honey here we are,
Dreaming in the dark, troubles seem so far,
Their thoughts were ours, but now we dream apart,
Now we dream apart
Boiling water
But I'm just content with time well spent
Savor the taste of sugar
But all you want is milk,
More than you can drink,
All you want is honey, you can't take the sting
You live for overkill, but you're ungrateful still.
All you want is honey, well honey I tried,
You just want more, and now it's all gone.
Honey you're so kind,
Always follow flight, you shoot me up inside,
You pick up every ru-mours in sight,
But all the roses died, I'd rather keep them alive,
Roots grow slowly.
But I'd be content with time well spent
Savor the taste of sugar
But all you want is milk,
More than you can drink,
All you want is honey, you can't take the sting
You live for overkill, but you're ungrateful still.
All you want is honey, well honey I tried,
You just want more, you just want more.
Honey I tried,
To make it work, you're unsatisfied
You make it worse,
Honey I'd die,
Still all you want is milk,
More than you can drink,
All you want is honey, you can't take the sting
You live for overkill, but you're ungrateful still.
All you want is honey, well honey I tried,
You just want more, you just want more.
You just want more,
And now it's all gone.
