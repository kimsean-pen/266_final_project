Hey Mickey! Hey Mickey!
Hey Mickey!
You've been around all night
And that's a little long
You think you've got it right
But I think you've got it wrong
Why can't you say 'good night'
So you can take me home, Mickey
'Cause when you say you will
It always means you won't
You're giving me the chills
Baby please, baby don't
Every night you still leave me all alone, Mickey
Oh Mickey, what a pity you don't understand
You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand
Oh Mickey, you're so pretty, can't you understand?
It's guys like you Mickey
Oh what you do Mickey, do Mickey
Don't break my heart Mickey
Hey Mickey!
Now when you take me by the hooves everybody it's gonna know
Every time you move I let a little more show
It's something we can use so don't say no Mickey
So come along and give it to me anyway you can
Anyway you want to do I'll treat you like a man
But please baby, please, don't leave me in the damp Mickey!
Oh Mickey, what a pity you don't understand
You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand
Oh Mickey, you're so pretty, can't you understand?
It's guys like you Mickey
Oh what you do Mickey, do Mickey
Don't break my heart Mickey
Hey Mickey!
Yes
(You're so fine)
No

Don't say no Mickey, no
Hey Mickey!
Oh Mickey you're so fine
You're so fine you blow my mind
Hey Mickey! Hey Mickey!
Oh Mickey you're so fine
You're so fine you blow my mind
Hey Mickey! Hey Mickey!
Oh Mickey, what a pity you don't understand
You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand
Oh Mickey, you're so pretty, can't you understand?
It's guys like you Mickey
Oh what you do Mickey, do Mickey
Don't break my heart Mickey
Oh Mickey, what a pity you don't understand
You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand
Oh Mickey, you're so pretty, can't you understand?
