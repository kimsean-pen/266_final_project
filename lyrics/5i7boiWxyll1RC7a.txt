Mired in illusion
Lost in the master's game
Silenced by the idea of time
Nurtured with lies and deceit

The silent seeker, the seer
Travels beyond the veil
The silent seeker, the seer
Fleeing the dense womb of ignorance

To the trained eye
There are no coincidences
The more you see
The less it makes sense
To the trained eye
There are no coincidences
If you can not see
You can not truly know

We are the current sum of all the ages
Leaving a trail of burnt pages

Thrown into darkness as stars
We travel alone as one

When the dust settles on the tavern
Is when we're liberated from illusion
Taking our first and final breath
Realizing life is always after death

Mired in illusion
Lost in the masters game
Silenced by the idea of time

To the trained eye
There are no coincidences
The more you see
The less it makes sense
To the trained eye
There are no coincidences
If you can not see
You can not truly know

The silent seeker, the seer
Travels beyond the veil
The silent seeker, the seer
Fleeing the dense womb of ignorance
