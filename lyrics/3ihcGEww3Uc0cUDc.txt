Something told me it was over, babe
When I saw you and that girl talkin', babe
Something deep down in my soul said, 'Go on and cry, girl'
When I saw you and that same girl walkin' by

And I would rather, I would rather be a blind girl, babe
Than to see you walk away, walk away from me, baby

'Cause you see, I love you so much
I don't wanna watch you leave me, baby
And another thing is, I just don't wanna be free, baby
Oh, no

Sittin here thinkin', about your sweet kiss
Whoa, and your warm embrace, baby
When the reflection in the glass that I held to my lips, baby
Revealed the tears that was on my face, yeah

Baby, baby, baby, baby
I'd rather be a blind girl
Whoa I'd rather be a blind girl
Than to watch you walk away from me, boy

Woah, woah
I'd rather be a blind girl
Than to watch you walk away from me
Baby, don't leave me

Whoa, now listen
Imma tell you all one more time
I was just sitting here a minute ago thinking, baby
I was thinking about your sweet kiss
And you're...
I was thinking about your sweet kiss
And your...
Ohh la la la
When I looked down in the glass that I held to my lips
I was looking in the glass and I saw the reflection of the tears rolling down my face

Oh baby!
Oh baby!
Whoa, baby I'd rather be a blind girl
Oh Lord!
Baby, baby
Baby, don't leave me, boy

Ohh
Baby, don't leave me, boy
Baby, don't leave me, boy
Ohh
Oh, I'd rather be a blind girl
Than to watch you walk away from me
Don't leave me
Oh Lord, don't let him leave me, no
On baby!

Oh and I'd rather
I don't wanna watch you leave me
I can't stand to see you go
Whoa baby, I'd rather be a blind girl
