He takes you out and he takes you up
â€˜Cause he can't show you so much
I go to bed and tomorrow again
There's a lot of work to be done

He gives you gold and he'll promise you
The whole world will be yours
I just can't tell you I love you so
Even though my odds are low

I'm not an actor I'm not a star
And I don't even have my own car
But I'm hoping so much you'll stay
That you will love me anyway

The dirty games and the neonshows
This is the world he knows
Watching the stars satisfies my soul
Thinking of him makes me feel so cold

The fancy cars and the restaurants
You're just so fond of the man
Sometimes I wonder if you are blind
Can't you see he's got dirt on his mind

I'm not an actor I'm not a star
And I don't even have my own car
But I'm hoping so much you'll stay
That you will love me anyway (anyway)

I'm not an actor I'm not a star
And I don't even have my own car
But I'm hoping so much you'll stay
That you will love me anyway

I'm not an actor I'm not a star
And I don't even have my own car
But I'm hoping so much you'll stay
That you will love me anyway (anyway)

I'm not an actor I'm not a star
And I don't even have my own car
But I'm hoping so much you'll stay
That you will love me anyway

I'm not an actor I'm not a star
And I don't even have my own car
But I'm hoping so much you'll stay
