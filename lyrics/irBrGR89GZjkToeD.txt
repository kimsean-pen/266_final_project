Well, I followed you home tonight
In shadows, hidin' in silence
Watching you walk inside
Radiance swallowed in light
But I know, it ain't right
But for now ... it's all I've got

No reason for alarm
Not here to haunt or harm
There's no love left anymore
But how can I be sure
Well, I know that you need more
But for now ... it's all I'm not

Damned if you do, damned if you don't
Well, I wish you would, but I think you won't

The comedown is no surprise
Delivered in blood and brine
Make-believe wears a thin disguise
This love's just a lonesome lie
Well, it's broken, bottled and blind
But for now ... it's all I've got

Damned if you do, damned if you don't
Well, I wish you would, but I think you won't

Come around, come around
Come around, come around

Damned if you do, damned if you don't
Well, I wish you would, but I think you won't

Damned if you do, damned if you don't
Well, I wish you could, but I think you won't

Come around
