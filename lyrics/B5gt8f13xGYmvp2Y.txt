Brakes on, brakes on
The car is running empty
Brakes on, brakes on
The car is running empty

Downhill, head on
This crash is coming slowly
Downhill, head on
This crash is coming slowly
Move.

Or watch the slow death of your way of life

The science to fear
It plagues my mind
And keeps us right here
And it keeps us here

My ears, my eyes
My brain is slowly busting
Black smoke, red sky
The television's saying

Downhill, head on
Another crash is coming
Downhill, head on
Another crash is coming
Move.

Or watch the murder of your way of life

The science to fear
It plagues my mind
And it keeps us right here
And the less we know
The more we sit still

My baby's stuck on a road
That leads to nowhere
Nowhere
Nowhere
Nowhere
Nowhere

Brakes on
Brakes on
Brakes on
Brakes on
Brakes on

There's a science to fear
It plagues my mind
And it keeps us right here
And the less we know
The more we sit still
Sit still
My baby's stuck on a road
That leads to nowhere
Nowhere
Nowhere
Nowhere
Nowhere
