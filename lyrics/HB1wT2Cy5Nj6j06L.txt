Hey, double bubble, I'll give you a ride
Yeah!

I'm on the edge, everyday
Ain't nothing going for you and me
I am my enemy in everyway
He planted the seed, he planted the seed

When I was a teen girl, I walked real awkward
Like a dog with three legs, I had fought my wars
I was a, misshape, mistake, misfit
Untamed mishap, with a junkie heart

Now there's been a shift, I stopped taking hits
My eyes start to flicker, flicker, my mouth starts to drip
My heart starts to tinker, tinker, what can I do
What can I do when I'm bound like this with you?

Now I really understand, understand
Now I really understand

I can't feel it
I can't feel it
I can't feel it
