This style seems wild, wait before you treat me like a stepchild
Let me tell you why they got me on file
'Cause I give you what you lack, come right and exact
Our status is the saddest so I care where you at, black

And at home I got a call from Tony Rome
The FBI was tappin' my telephone
I never live alone, I never walk alone
My posses always ready, and they're waitin' in my zone

Although I live the life that of a resident
But I be known to scheme that of the president
Tappin' my phone whose crews abused
I stand accused of doin' harm

'Cause I'm louder than a bomb
Come on
I'm louder than a bomb
Come on

I am the rock hard trooper to the bone the bone the bone
Full grown consider me stone
Once again and I say it for you to know
The troop is always ready, I yell Geronimo

Your CIA, you see I ain't kiddin'
Both King and X they got ridda' both
A story untold, true, but unknown
Professor Griff knows I ain't milquetoast

Of those with closed minds, don't know I'm rapid
The way that I rap it is making 'em tappin', yeah
Never serving â€~em well, 'cause I'm an Un-Tom
It's no secret at all

'Cause I'm louder than a bomb
Come on
I'm louder than a bomb
Come on

Cold holdin' the load, the burden breakin' the mold
I ain't lyin' denyin' because they're checkin' my code
Am I buggin' 'cause they're buggin' my phone for information
No tellin' who's sellin' out buildin' the nation

Joinin' the set, the point black target
Every brother's inside so least not, you forgot, no
Takin' the blame is not a waste, here taste
A bit of the song so you can never be wrong

Just a bit of advice, â€~cause we be payin' the price
'Cause every brother man's life is like swingin' the dice, right?
Here it is, once again this is the brother to brother
The Terminator the cutter

Going on and on, leave alone the grown
Get is straight in '88, an' I'll troop in to demonstrate
The posse always ready 98 at 98
My posse come quick, because my posse got velocity

Tapping' my phone, they never leave me alone
I'm even lethal when I'm unarmed

â€~Cause I'm louder than a bomb
Come on
â€~Cause I'm louder than a bomb
Come on

â€~Cause the D is for dangerous, you can come and get some of this
I teach and speak so when it's spoke, it's no joke
The voice of choice the place shakes with bass
Called one for the treble, the rhythm is a rebel

Here's a funky rhyme that they're tappin' on
Just thinkin' I'm breakin' the beats that I'm rappin'on
CIA, FBI, all they tell us is lies
And when I say it they get alarmed

â€~Cause I'm louder than a bomb
â€~Cause I'm louder than a bomb

â€~Cause I'm louder than a bomb
Come on

â€~Cause I'm louder than a bomb
â€~Cause I'm louder than a bomb
