Uptown, going down, old lifeline
Walking down faster, walking with the master of time
My lady woke up and she broke down, she got up, she let go
Take me, Timer, shake me, Timer, Timer let it blow, let it blow

My darling friends, oh, I belong to Timer, he changed my face
You're a fine, fine one, Timer
You've got me walking through the gates of space
I keep rememberin' indoors that I used to walk through
Baby, I'm not tryin' to talk you down
But I could walk through them doors onto a pleasure ground
It was sweet and funny, a pleasure ground
Didn't know about money, did not know about Timer
Did not know about Timer

Holding to my cradle at the start, but now my hand is open
And now my hand is ready for my heart
So let the wind blow, Timer, I like her song
And if the song goes minor, I won't mind
And Timer knows the lady's gonna love again
Timer says the lady rambles never more
If you love me true and if you love me true
I'll spend my life with you and Timer

You're a jigsaw, Timer, you're a, God is a jigsaw timer
You're a jigsaw, Timer, you're a, God is a jigsaw timer
Timer, souling with
Timer, souling with
Timer, souling with
Timer

Let it go
Timer
Timer
Timer
