(Hummm) You're like an imprint
(Hummm) You've got fire up and down your cheeks
(Hummm) You burn everything you see (hummm)
(Hummm) Gold are your fingers
(Hummm) Leaving traces everywhere you go

(Hummm) Diamonds in your skin, my blood flows (hummm)

Down of the water
Beads drippin' down your face
Calling out, calling out my name

You were december
Eyes cold, freeze my blood
Somehow, somehow not enough

Huh-huh
