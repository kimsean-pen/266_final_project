Lured away from everything in love that burns so easily
Shy away from pleasure for the fear of the pain
I feel your secret scream next to me
I need to see you open up for me
I need to get you inside of me
I need to see you open up for me
I need to get you in
Even from your shadow there's an urgency intoxicate
Dripping from your lips is a malevolous kiss
I feel your secret scream next to me
I need to see you open up for me
I need to get you inside of me
I need to see you open up for me
Ooh, I need to get you in
I need to get you inside of me
I need to see you open up for me
I need to get you in
I need to see you open up for me
I need to get you inside of me
I need to see you open up for me
Ooh, I need to get you in
