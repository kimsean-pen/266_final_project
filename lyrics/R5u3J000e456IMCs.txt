How long, 'til you leave it?
You should know that we're alone this time
Keep yourself a secret
You should know that
I will sell you a future, you don't want like I did last time
I won't go slow
All the things you tell yourself
Offer no resolution

You know that this will break us
But you push us as far as we can go
Taking every chance to find solutions
That never make anyone happy
We are done this time
You don't owe me
Take a final look at me
Take it, and drink it in

Breathe through me
Fill up your lungs with us
I will keep everything
You give me 'til the time
We let go

Breathe through me
Fill up your lungs with us
I will keep everything
You give me 'til the time
We let go

Keep me in your eyeline
Keep believing what you said before
I won't change direction
I will tell you
That everything's moving too slowly
Just another lie
One more untruth
You won't ever see through me
You will still drink it in

Breathe through me
Fill up your lungs with us
I will keep everything
You give me 'til the time
We let go

You know that this will break us
But you push us as far as we can go
Taking every chance to find solutions
That never make anyone happy
We are done this time
You don't owe me
Take a final took at me
Take it...
