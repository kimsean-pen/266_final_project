(They say drinking is a way to die
But at the end dying is a way to drink)

Unquenchable thirst burns you inside
The ruins of already burnt out mind
Inexhaustible craving for something
You're already crying

Degenerate drunk with a razor blade
Strung out spilling your own blood
Exterminate scars already made
Ready for another drink, can you wait?

Detoxing, here come the withdrawals
Whispering maybe you've gone too far
Deep within things are getting hot
Can't deny, take another shot

Blooddrunk, wasted again
All the pain inside will fade
Blooddrunk, you call me insane
Degenerate bloodrunk
With a razor blade

-Solos-

Degenerate drunk with a razor blade
Strung out spilling your own blood
Exterminate scars already made
Ready for another drink, can you wait?

Blooddrunk, wasted again
All the pain inside will fade
Blooddrunk, you call me insane
Degenerate bloodrunk
With a razor blade

Blooddrunk, wasted again
All the pain inside will fade
Blooddrunk, you call me insane
Degenerate bloodrunk
With a razor blade
