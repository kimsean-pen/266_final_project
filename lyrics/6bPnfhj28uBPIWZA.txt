I'll be doing all the day, stably upon your face
I've been drinking al day
I've been braking on today, roll it all consider games
I've been braking of today,
I've been braking of today,
Stare me block upon your face
I've been braking of today,
All of the songs I get, braking news to fade, to fade, to fade away
Tear yourself apart for this, brake your rules design to front

Caught the way to closer place
Tear yourself apart for this, brake your rules design to front
Caught the space to cross someway
Caught the space design your way

After brake you off today said I'm lost upon your face
I could break it off today
Rolling for all your gates afraid you use to play
I can break it off today, said I'm lost upon your face
I could break it off today
Rolling for all your gates afraid you use to play

All of the songs I get, braking news to fade, to fade, to fade away
Tear yourself apart for this, brake your rules design to front

Caught the way to closer place
Tear yourself apart for this, brake your rules design to front
Caught the space to cross someway
Caught the space design your way
Burn your road for that cruel game
Burn your road for that cruel game
And then sure will be back
You broke into my arms again,
And burning to your backer brake
And burning to your backer brake
