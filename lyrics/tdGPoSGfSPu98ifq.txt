Rising - From mundane existence
A new world - Seen through your eyes
To deception - Give no resistance
All your hopes and dreams are now sanctified

Blind to the hypocrisy
Goodness is all that you see

Your past life - Is cast aside
In false truths - You now confide

Pledged to a life of divinity
Superior through your own piety

Holier than thou - Alone you wear the crown

In your private asylum
Look to what you have become
Condemned to misery and strive
Alone you wear the crown of life

The crown of life
The crown of life
