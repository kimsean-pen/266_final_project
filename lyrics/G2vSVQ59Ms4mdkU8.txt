When it rains it pours and opens doors
That flood the floors we thought would always
Keep us safe and dry

And in the midst of sailing ships
We sink our lips into the ones we love

That have to say goodbye
And as I float along this ocean
I can feel you like a notion

That won't seem to let me go
'Cause when I look to the sky
Something tells me you're here with me
And you make everything alright

And when I feel like I'm lost
Something tells me you're here with me

And I can always find my way when you are here
And every word I didn't say
Caught up in some busy day

And every dance on the kitchen floor, we didn't have before
And every sunset that we'll miss
I'll wrap them all up in a kiss
And pick you up in all of this when I sail away
And while I float upon this ocean

I can feel you like a notion
That I hope will never leave

'Cause when I look to the sky
Something tells me you're here with me
And you make everything alright
And when I feel like I'm lost

Something tells me you're here with me
And I can always find my way
Whether I'm up or down or in or out
Or just plain overhead
Instead it just feels like it is impossible to fly
But with you I can spread my wings
To see me over everything
That life may send me when I am hoping it won't pass me by
And when I feel like there is no one
That will ever know me
There you are to show me
When I look to the sky
Something tells me you're here with me
And you make everything alright
And when I feel like I'm lost
Something tells me you're here with me
And I can always find my way when you are here
And I can always find my way when you are here
