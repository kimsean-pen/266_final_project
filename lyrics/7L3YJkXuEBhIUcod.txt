Conversations running through my head
I'll seal em'.
Moving mountains just to be ahead all the time
is it worth it?
Oh.
Now I'm stuck in this feeling ah-ah
like I'm up on the ceiling so shy.

Guided up to the recent silence
don't know whether to be mad or be silent.
If you suffer intrusions ah-ah
let me get on the music so bright.
Don't know if I'm a nuisance ah-ah
but I'm tired of choosing alright.
Conversations running through my head

I'll seal em'.

Moving mountains just to be ahead all the time
is it worth it?
Moving mountains...
Moving mountains...
Conversations running through my head
I'll seal em'.
Moving mountains just to be ahead all the time
is it worth it?
Oh.
