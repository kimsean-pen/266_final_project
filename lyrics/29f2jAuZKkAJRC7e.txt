We make tiny happinesses in each moment
Every little gesture is like a kiss, little kisses
I will take my coffee black
And you can have your milk and sugar, baby
We can walk home quietly
Or we can laugh, "ha ha ha", all the way

To be young
To be old
All of it is beautiful
See me young
See be old
And we'll make it beautiful

When you're feeling tiredness let me hold you
I'll say, it's a happy life to know you
Sit and watch the television
Or go out dancing on a Tuesday afternoon
We don't need a babysitter
Party with the children in the living room

To be young
To be old
All of it's beautiful
See them young
See them old
What he has made it's beautiful

And we'll fly out
Into white clouds
Watch them smile
And die together

And we'll fly out
Into white clouds
Watch them smile
And die together
