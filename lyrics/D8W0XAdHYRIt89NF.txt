I've got a good friend living it up when I'm home
Yea I've got someone waiting for me when I'm gone
Yeah I have got a good one lifting me up when I'm down
Well it's been perfect time and new moon rising
You are looking to,
I'm feeling good as new, new
feeling good as new, new
I've got excitement spilling right over my tongue
We're in a new place you had to bring me along
Hey, I've got it good, got it real good
Somewhere where I can belong
well it's been perfect time and new moon rising,
you are looking to,
I'm feeling good as new, new
feeling good as new, new
It's a new world turning,
True love burning,
You are looking to
I'm feeling good as new, new
feeling good as new, new
