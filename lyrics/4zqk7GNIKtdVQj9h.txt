Her fabulous invention
What strange imagination shown
Her glorious intentions
A sea of doubt beneath her own

"You're not the first to dream this, little girl
You know it's never happened once in this world
It never crossed my mind that one so young could hope to find
A power greater than my own"

She never did what they told her to
And they'll never see her dream come true

The edge of revelation
Believing all the stories told
A final moment taken
Before this story's end unfolds

"You're not the first to dream this, little girl
You know it's never happened once in this world
It never crossed my mind that one so young could hope to find
A power greater than my own"

She never did what they told her to
And they'll never see her dream come true

Now she flies over clouds in twilight skies
Nothing to bind her, no one will find her this high
Far above the rainy weather
All plans have come together
And for the first time, she feels just fine
