I need to feel your heartbeat when you say you love me
I don't want to hear it if it's something that you don't mean
If I had to leave you now there would be an empty space
It doesn't matter anyhow
You can take your things and go your own way

And there's two more lonely people in the world tonight
Baby, you and I are just two more lonely people
Who gave up the fight, yeah, wrong or right
Well you know my heart is aching
You don't have to break it if love don't change your mind
Then there's two more lonely people tonight

I don't want the pictures
I don't want your sympathy
We don't have to be friends
We don't have to be enemies
In my head I break it down and I'm absolutely sure
That you and I could work it out or we could kill the lights on
What we had before

And there's two more lonely people in the world tonight
Baby, you and I are just two more lonely people
Who gave up the fight, yeah, wrong or right
Well you know my heart is aching
You don't have to break it if love don't change your mind
Then there's two more lonely people

Well we got something special that should be enough
Nothing is predictable when it comes to love (oh)
Maybe lately, baby, it's been a little rough
But if you walk away tonight

We'll be two more lonely people in the world, tonight
Baby, you and I are just two more lonely people
Who gave up the fight

And there's two more lonely people in the world tonight
Baby, you and I are just two more lonely people (you and I, people)
Who gave up the fight, yeah, wrong or right
Well you know my heart is aching (oh)
You don't have to break it if love don't change your mind (you don't, change your mind)
Then there's two more lonely people tonight
