Look in the mirror and tell me, just what you see
What have the years of your life taught you to be
Innocence dyin' in so many ways
Things that you dream of are lost, lost in the haze

Hold on, baby hold on, 'cause it's closer than you think
And you're standing on the brink
Hold on, baby hold on, 'cause there's something on the way
Your tomorrow's not the same as today

Don't you recall what you felt when you weren't alone
Someone who stood by your side, a face you have known
Where do you run when it's too much to bear
Who do you turn to in need when nobody's there

Hold on, baby hold on, 'cause it's closer than you think
And you're standing on the brink
Hold on, baby hold on, 'cause there's something on the way
Your tomorrow's not the same as today

Outside your door he is waiting, waiting for you
Sooner or later you know, he's got to come through
No hesitation and no holding back
Let it all go and you'll know, you're on the right track

Hold on, baby hold on, 'cause it's closer than you think
And you're standing on the brink
Hold on, baby hold on, 'cause there's something on the way
Your tomorrow's not the same
Hold on, baby hold on, 'cause it's closer than you think
And you're standing on the brink
Hold on, baby hold on, 'cause there's something on the way
Your tomorrow's not the same
Hold on
