Yes, I believe in love
Yes, I believe in love
I believe
I believe in love

It hurts because I need you so bad
The greatest love I ever had
That's why you made me so mad, oh

Yeah, I feel
Yeah, I feel it 'cause it's real
I'm so scared because it feels
Far too real

But I believe in love
Oh yes, I believe in love
(I believe)
(I believe in love)

See I, yeah I've been spending a long old time
Repairing this mind
And I'll think you're fine
That the gears ain't crying

But I believe in love
Oh yes, I believe in love
(I believe)
(I believe in love)

I believe in love
Oh yes, I believe in love
(I believe)
(I believe in love)

I believe in love
Oh yes, I believe in love
(I believe)
(I believe in love)
