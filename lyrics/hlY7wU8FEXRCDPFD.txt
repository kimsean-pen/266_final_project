When [?] got murdered, we were all observers
Sadly so amused
In a flash-lit fire, contraband supplies can
Horribly arrive

With the ill-intentioned gathering more men from
Shame
Listing their impulsions, their captors spinning in the
Rain
Rain
Rain

Busy us with stimulation
Comatose in unfamiliar ways
We're running out of things to hurt
Never-ending ways to be absurd

Technical maneuvers don't improve your fuses
Anxious and confused
Can't help but think, can't help but think can't help but think
That everyone's been used

Used
Used

Busy us with stimulation
Comatose in unfamiliar ways
You'll think it's just an accident, mate
Otherwise they're gonna feed us [?]

At the shallow end of the pool of shadows
In a hollow shell, taking off your clothes
There's nothing you can do; cover up the inside
All dead inside
All gonna die
All gonna die

We are led into darkness and it's alright
We are left in the darkness and it's alright
