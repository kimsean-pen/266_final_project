Love, love, love don't live here anymore
You say that it's a shame and show me the door
You say that you don't need me anymore
And I said

Love, love, love don't live here any
Love, love all you want is ending
Love, love all the nights we're spending
Love, love, love don't live here anymore

Lonely hearts are always wanting more
But only parts of mine were still unsure
You say that you don't want me anymore
And I say

Love, love, love don't live here any
Love, love all you want is ending
Love, love all the nights we're spending
Love, love, love don't live here anymore

Don't know anymore, don't know anymore
Don't know anymore, don't know anymore

Love, love, love is always so unsure
But bleeding hearts have always known no law
You say that you don't need me anymore
And I said

Love, love all the nights we're spending
Love, love, love don't live here anymore

Don't know anymore

You say your life was heading downhill
The light denied, that's why you left
From me, what's left to you
I waited for you still

You say your life was heading downhill
The light denied, that's why you left
From me, what's left to you
I waited for you still
