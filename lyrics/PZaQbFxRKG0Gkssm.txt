No, you don't have to wear your best fake smile
Don't have to stand there and burn inside
(Oh, oh, oh)

If you don't like it
She's working late and making eyes at the door
She's sick of everybody up on her floor
She wants the sun in her eyes, but all she gets is ignored
She used to put it out and get it all back
But now she's slipping, trying to carry the act

She's sweating under the lights, now she's beginning to crack
(Woah)
No, you don't have to wear your best fake smile

Don't have to stand there and burn inside
(Oh, oh, oh)
If you don't like it

And you don't have to care, so don't pretend
Nobody needs a best fake friend
(Oh, oh, oh)

Don't hide it
No hesitation, now she gets up and walks
She thinks of all the pain and pride that it cost

She empties all the tip jars, it won't get back what she lost
Outside the window with two fingers to show
She lifts her head up just to blow out the smoke

She doesn't have to look back to know where she's got to go
No, you don't have to wear your best fake smile
Don't have to stand there and burn inside

(Oh, oh, oh)
If you don't like it
And you don't have to care, so don't pretend
Nobody needs a best fake friend
(Oh, oh, oh)

Don't hide it
If you don't bleed it
You don't need it anymore
If you don't need it

Get up and leave it on the floor
No more believing
Like it's a voice you can't ignore
If you don't need it
You don't need it (no)
And you don't have to wear your best fake smile
Don't have to stand there and burn inside
(Oh, oh, oh)
No, if you don't like it
And you don't have to care, so don't pretend
Nobody needs a best fake friend
(Oh, oh, oh)
Don't hide it
No, you don't have to wear your best fake smile
Don't have to stand there and burn inside
(Oh, oh, oh)
If you don't like it
(Oh, oh, oh)
No, if you don't like it
