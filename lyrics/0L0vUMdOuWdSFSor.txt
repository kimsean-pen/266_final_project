The winter sky above us
Was shining in moonlight
And everywhere around us
The silence of midnight
And we had gathered snowflakes
Remember the soft light
Of starlight on snow

Oooh... remember this
For no one knows
The way love goes
Oooh... remember this
For no one knows
The way life goes

We walked the road together
One last time by moonlight
As underneath the heavens
The slow chimes at midnight
But nothing is forever
Not even the starlight
At midnight
Not even the moonlight

Oooh... remember this
For no one knows
The way love goes
Oooh... remember this
For no one knows
The way life goes

Oooh... remember this
For no one knows
The way love goes
Oooh... remember this
For no one knows
The way life goes
