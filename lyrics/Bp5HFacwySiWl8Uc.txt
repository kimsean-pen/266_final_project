Everthing is a memory
with strings that tie to you
In my dream
i'm often running
to the place that's out of you
i'm often running
to the place that's out of you
i'm often running
to the place that's out of you
i'm often running
to the place that's out of you
i'm often running
to the place that's out of you
i'm often running
to the place that's out of you
i'm often running
to the place that's out of you
i'm often running
to the place that's out of you
i'm often running
to the place that's out of you
with strings that tie to you
