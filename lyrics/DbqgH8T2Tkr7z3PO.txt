I don't know what you expected
I need to sit around and beg for you to stay
Can't you see what you've neglected?
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

I don't know what you've been taking
Do I look like I was born just yesterday?
You're the one who will be breaking
After all

'Cause there will be tears
But they're not gonna be mine
My heart will be clear
And my eyes are staying dry
Because you again and again and again

You wish I never got away
I'll just pretend from now
I got a reason to celebrate
Tears, but they're not gonna be, not gonna be mine

You'll be begging for a shoulder
You'll be looking for someone to dry your eyes
But you ain't never getting over
What we had

And you'll be crying like a baby
'Cause you thought you'd be the one to say goodbye
And I hope it drives you crazy
Oh yeah, ah ah ah ah

'Cause there will be tears
But they're not gonna be mine
My heart will be clear
And my eyes are staying dry
Because you again and again and again

You wish I never got away
I'll just pretend from now
I got a reason to celebrate
Tears, but they're not gonna be, not gonna be mine

You don't know what you got 'til it goes away
(Goes away, baby)
Anything that you lost you're the one to blame
(One to blame)
So say that! Again and again and again

You wish I never got away
I'll just pretend from now
I got a reason to celebrate
There will be tears, oh yeah
But they're not gonna be mine

'Cause there will be tears
But they're not gonna be mine
My heart will be clear
And my eyes are stayng dry
Because again and again and again

You wish I never got away
I'll just pretend from now
I got a reason to celebrate
Tears, but they're not gonna be, not gonna be mine
