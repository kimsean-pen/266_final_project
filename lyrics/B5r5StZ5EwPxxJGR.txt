I get excited by the news of today
What seems unstable may be able to stay

My flame is heart, My baby do as she please
What good is living, when you live in disease

I dream of heaven, it's a heavenly place
Why fall in love? when you can fall from grace

Johnny Panic and The Bible Of Dreams

High time we made a stand and sup the views of the common man
And the lovetrain rides from coast to coast
D.J.'s the man we love the most
Could you be, could you be squeaky clean
And smash any hope of democracry?
As the headline says you're free to choose
There's egg on your face and mud on your shoes
One of these days they're gonna call it the blues

I spy tears in thier eyes
They look to the skies for some kind of divine intervention
Food goes to waste!
So nice to eat, so nice to taste
Politician Grannie with your high ideals
Have you no idea how the Majority feels?
So without love and a promise land
We're fools to the rules of a Goverment plan
Kick out the style! Bring back the jam!
Bring back the jam!
