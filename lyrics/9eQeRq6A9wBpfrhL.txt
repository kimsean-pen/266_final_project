A haunted soul
And yes, I know that it's all immaterial
And that's not all
See I want more of
Something that I know is not real
Is this real life
Why can't I decide
I think I'll stay awhile cause
I'm only dreaming that the cobweb's gone
And the lights are on
You're just a call away
And nothing's wrong
And nothing's going away
It never ends
When my mind sends me into oblivion
The secret place that is laced
With a dose of what could've been
Leave me behind in peace, asleep
Slipping in the sweet scenes
Of my favorite dreams
