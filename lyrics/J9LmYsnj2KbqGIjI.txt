Believe in nothing shining brighter than the sun
Take up the battle, contemplating god

Forging towards the sunset
Denying bitter reality
Until that desperate moment
When you're forced to true clarity
Make the darker world a lie everyone

Fucking hilarious, you fucking could be other
Get on your knees, soaked in history's flaming cum

Forging towards the sunset
Denying bitter reality
Until that desperate moment
When you're forced to true clarity
Make the darker world a lie everyone, everyone

All that you have desired,
All you could have loved,
All you considered sacred,
Bonds, Intentions, potentials, betrayals, lusts
Count for precisely naught.
Give the lie to all sense of is or ought.
Forging towards the sunset
Denying bitter reality
Until that desperate moment
When you're forced to true clarity
Make the darker world a lie everyone, everyone
