Don't you know what you're doing
You got a death wish

Suicide blonde
Suicide blonde
Suicide blonde
Suicide blonde

Suicide blonde was the color of her hair
Like a cheap distraction for a new affair
She knew it would finish before it began
Wahou, something tells me you lost the plan

You want to make her
Suicide blonde
Love devastation
Suicide blonde

You want to make her
Suicide blonde
Love devastation
Suicide blonde

She stripped to the beat
But her clothes stay on
White light everywhere
But you can't see a thing

Such a squeeze
A mad, sad moment
Glory to you
Glory to you
Take me there
Take me there

Got some revelation
Put into your hands
Save you from your misery
Like rain across the land
Don't you see
The color of deception
Turning your world around again

You want to make her
Suicide blonde
Love devastation
Suicide blonde

You want to make her
Suicide blonde
Love devastation
Suicide blonde

You want to make
You want to make

You want to make her
Suicide blonde
You want to make

That's the story

Everything you wanna be
Everything you are, are, are

Well

You want to make her
Suicide blonde
Love devastation
Suicide blonde, yeah

Suicide blonde
Love devastation
Suicide blonde

Love devastation
You want to make her
Suicide blonde
Love devastation
Suicide blonde
You want to make her
Suicide blonde
