Stayed up all night again
Late thinking brings me back to you (back to you)
It's easy to pretend we're gone for good
But that's untrue (yeah, that's untrue)

Was it something that I said
Or didn't do although I wanted?
Sorry for not being honest with you
You're the one I can't forget
When I'm wide awake looking back on it
It was almost

Almost like heartbreak
Wrong time at the wrong place
Left me like a heatwave
Shook me like an earthquake
Wrong call at the wrong day
Left me like a heatwave
Aha, aha, countless times I thought about us
And the way that we touched
Your heartbreak
Wrong time at the wrong place
Left me like a heatwave

You got me feeling rare
Your worst day were as good as gone (good as gone)
They way you kissed my hair
That moment sure was memorable, aah

Was it something that I said
Or didn't do although I wanted?

Shook me like an earthquake
Wrong call at the wrong day
Left me like a heatwave
Aha, aha, countless times I thought about us
And the way that we touched

Left me like a heatwave
