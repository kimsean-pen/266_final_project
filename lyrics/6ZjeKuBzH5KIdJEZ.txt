When you read this
I will not be the same
I have let my true form show
and it is my last time
lost in all my guilt for letting you fall
understand it wasn't me
where were you now i can see through your eyes
I remember the day the sun went out
it halted all progression with all its beauty
it just sacrificed we fell apart
As I ask
Why ask these questions?
Sincerely yours I've disowned you
Sincerely yours I've disowned us
