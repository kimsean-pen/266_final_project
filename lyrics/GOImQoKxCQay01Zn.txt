The words that you write, they catch me in the morning light
The lines that I read, oh they move me
We tucked it inside, aura so fine
Ooh it helps me, to find what I need

Take my hand ask me to stay
You take the lead now and show me the way
Fight for the love that you want in life
Darling, you take my hand and be mine

Handful of shells, at home in my coat
Tales of a walk, beach fire sparks
Polaroid shots, exposed in the dark
Ooh it helps me, to find what I need
