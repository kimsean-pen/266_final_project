On their long journey that leads them
Towards the light,
Winston Smith shall be their guide.
They're trying so hard to believe
That two and two always makes five.
(That two and two makes five.)

Reason won't concuss the irrevocable truth.
And if there's contradiction,
Keep the faith, burn the proof.

To protect ourselves from the
Superstitions of priests and moralists and the
Trickery of evangelists;
Let us be done with the idea
Of moral law.

Where do your values come from?
From inside yourself?
Or from some self-appointed moral cognoscentes
Who disguised their own ideas
As universal concepts?

God is dead.
