She lit a cigarette, both hands behind her back
Thought she was hungry, lack of choice saw to that
Only you can try to see what I'm really like
She said, "Only you can understand the way I feel tonight"

She blamed excesses on the American dream
So seldom witnessed, never seen

Imagination, could make a man of you
Imagination, could make me love you too
Imagination, is all I want from you

She lost her virtue before she could write
I lost mine too, on my very first night with you
You'll have to guide me, these impossible schemes
You make me steal, unstealable things

She blamed excesses on the American dream
So seldom witnessed, never seen

Imagination, could make a man of you
Imagination, could make me love you too
Imagination, is all I want from you

And she blamed excesses on the American dream
So seldom witnessed, never seen

Imagination, could make a man of you
Imagination, could make me love you too
Imagination, is all I want from you

Imagination, could make a man of you
Imagination, could make me love you too
Imagination, is all I want from you

Imagination
Imagination
Imagination
Imagination
