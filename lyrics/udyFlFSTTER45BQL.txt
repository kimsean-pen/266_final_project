You had to go get stuck in my head (And be the best)
Had to choke on unholiness (To be the best)
Had to lie to get me undressed ('Cos you're the best)
Stop thinking, let's start making a mess (And be the best)
Won't let death catch up with me, no
Won't let death catch up with me
You'd rather be the next thing, I'll be the best
You'd rather be the next thing, I'll be the best
Because it's hard to be the best
I'll be the best, you do the rest
You go do the next thing, I'll be the best
Exhausted by my unhappiness (To be the best)
Have to wear my human suit to impress ('Cos I'm the best)

'Cos it's still you when the dark takes us, oh

You'd rather be the next thing, I'll be the best
Because it's hard to be the best
I'll be the best, you do the rest
You go do the next thing, I'll be the best
If I can't be the best thing, I'll be dead (Woo!)
You'd rather be the next thing, I'll be the best
(Won't let death catch up with me)
You'd rather be the next thing, I'll be the best
(Won't let death catch up with me)
Because it's hard to be the best
I'll be the best, you do the rest
You go do the next thing, I'll be the best
You'd rather be the next thing, I'll be the best (Be the best)
You'd rather be the next thing, I'll be the best (Be the best)
Because it's hard to be the best
I'll be the best, you do the rest
If I can't be the best thing, I'll be de-
