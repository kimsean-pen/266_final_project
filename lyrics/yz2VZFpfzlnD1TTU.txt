I got a number on me
I got a number
Won't make it through the high noon sun
Well I am my father's son
And I am my father's son
His bed is made

And I was a hero
Early in the morning
I ain't no hero
In the night

I am my father's son

And I'll build a house inside of you
I'll go in through the mouth
I'll draw three figures on your heart
One of them will be me as a boy
And one of them will be me
And One of them will be me watching you run
Watching you run
Into the high noon sun
Watching you run
Farther than guns will go
You are a runner
With a stolen voice
And you are a runner
And I am my father's son

I am my father's son
I am my father's son
