Can I look awhile?
Can I look awhile beside?
Will you see me through?
Tried but I can't get to you
Picked another love
Picked another troubled time
It explains so much
Gives a glimpse of all the time
And I miss you all the time
And I miss you all the time

I got knocked around
Let me gather what I've found
And it hurt me to love
Give a glimpse of what yer not
Cause I miss you all the time
Cause I miss you all the time
And I miss you all the time
Cause I miss you all the time

Cause I miss you
And I'm lonely
And that's far enough
For my love
Been a read-through
You are hoping
Now thats long enough
Caught up

Cause I miss you
And I'm lonely
And thats far enough
For our love
Been a read-through
You won't hold me
Now thats long enough
You're caught up
Lets get into
What you showed me
You've done everything
'cept our love
I've grown cold here
While you hold me
Guess that's hot enough
