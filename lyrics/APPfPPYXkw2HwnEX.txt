No matter what
It beats me black and blue, but it fucks me so good
No matter what I do
I'm no good without you
Must be love on the brain
That's got me feelin' this way
Must be love on the brain
That's got me feelin' this way
Must be love, must be love

Mu-mu-must be love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
(Chopped vocals)

Be lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo

No matter what
Be lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
No matter what
It beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good
No matter what I do
I'm no good without you
Must be love on the brain
That's got me feelin' this way
Must be love on the brain
That's got me feelin' this way, feelin' this way
Must be love, must be love
Mu-mu-must be love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
