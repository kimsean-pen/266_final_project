Come up out the sheets
Mermaid on your beach
Aura glistening
Drifting outta reach
Cooling like the breeze
Swaying with the leaves
45 degrees

Imma sip the sun like lemonade
Let it burn through the shade
If you ain't with it you could fade away
Fade

We on that vibration
We on that vibration
We on that vibration
We on that vibration
We on that vibration
We on that vibration
We on that vibration
We on that vibration

Et je sors des draps
Chuis une sirène sur ta plage
L'aura scintille
Mais c'est mois qui brille
Côme la thérapie
Nous sommes très tranquille
45 degrés

Imma sip the sun like lemonade
Let it burn through the shade
If you ain't with it you could fade
Fade

We on that vibration
We on that vibration
We on that vibration
We on that vibration
We on that vibration
We on that vibration
We on that vibration
We on that vibration

You cant, you cant
Turn us down
We cant, we cant
Stop us now
You cant, you cant
Turn us down
You cant, you cant
Kill this vibe

We on that vibration
We on that vibration
We on that vibration
We on that vibration
We on that vibration
We on that vibration
We on that vibration
We on that vibration
We on that vibration
We on that vibration
We on that vibration
We on that vibration
