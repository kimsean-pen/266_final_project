I'd promise you forever if I could
If I could slow down the hands of time I would
I know they say all good things must end
If I could do it all over I would do it all over
Over and over again

We'll go on 'til were pushin' up daisies
We'll grow old and wild and I'll still be callin' you baby
We'll never get enough
We'll be livin' it up right down to the day we die
Naw, we ain't gettin' out of this love alive

'Til I held you close I never felt the feelin'
And now I'll feel that way 'til the last sunset goes down
You turned a stubborn southern boy into a believer
Believe me when I say
It's gonna stay that way 'til they lay me in the ground

We'll go on 'til we're pushing up daisies
We'll grow old and wild and I'll still be callin' you baby
We'll never get enough
We'll be livin' it up right down to the day we die
Naw, we ain't gettin' out of this love alive

We'll go on 'til were pushing up daisies
We'll be old and wild and I'll still be callin' you baby
We'll never get enough
We'll be livin' it up right down to the day we die
Naw, we ain't gettin' out of this love alive

When our last breath is gone
And they carve our name in stone
Oh, we ain't gettin' out of this love alive
