Serve God love me and mend
This is not the end
Lived unbruised we are friends
And I'm sorry
I'm sorry

Sigh no more, no more
One foot in sea, one on shore
My heart was never pure
And you know me
And you know me

And man is a giddy thing
Oh man is a giddy thing
Oh man is a giddy thing
Oh man is a giddy thing

Love that will not betray you, dismay or enslave you
It will set you free
Be more like the man you were made to be

There is a design
An alignment to cry
At my heart you see
The beauty of love as it was made to be

Love that will not betray you, dismay or enslave you
It will set you free
Be more like the man you were made to be

There is a design
An alignment to cry
At my heart you see
The beauty of love as it was made to be
