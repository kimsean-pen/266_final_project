Just let go, you'll find another day
As I saw the ocean rush away

Guess I saw the better part of you
You had your way and had it all to lose

Daylight storms, fallen stars
All these things are crumbling away

And it breaks your ever-aching heart
Your sun will shine you'll feel it when it starts

And we knew we'd have to fall apart
As I watched the ocean come our way

Daylight storms, fallen stars
All these things are crumbling away

Daylight storms, fallen stars
All these things are crumbling away
