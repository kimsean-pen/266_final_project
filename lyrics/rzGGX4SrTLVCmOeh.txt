I'm hardly known in this neighbourhood
But I can't help feeling like I've been misunderstood.
Right to my bones, yes my sinew shook,
I feel this ground is breaking, nothing is there underfoot

Living isn't easy, when you've been free and it's taken away
I will lay my head down, 'till some sense has been found.

Days on days, looking back I lay,
I know I'm insecure but I've been wasting away.
Solace comes like I hoped it would,
Love has overcome things I didn't know that it could.

Living isn't easy, when you've been free and it's taken away
I will lay my head down, 'till some sense has been found.
