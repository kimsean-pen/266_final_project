This thief, she keeps me grey, but all I know is you
Trapped in stone, at least I know that I will be with you
From all the things I've seen, there's got to be a better way
These old memories mean nothing to me, watch them fade

It's not, it's not, it's not the words that you say
It's not, it's not, it's not the words
It's not, it's not, it's not, the words that you say
It's not, it's not, it's not the words, oooh

These hands, they know not your touch, leave them alone
Your uncertainty, in hard times, left me scorned
And I knew the answers to questions that I asked
Now my freedom and virtues lay in dark

It's not, it's not, it's not the words that you say
It's not, it's not, it's not the words
It's not, it's not, it's not, the words that you say
It's not, it's not, it's not the words

It's not, it's not, it's not the words that you say
It's not, it's not, it's not the words
