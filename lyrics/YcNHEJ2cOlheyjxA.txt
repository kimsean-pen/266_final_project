And to reflect is to regret throwing it all away
And apathy, my one way street, it took so much from me
Separated by this divide I created through my fears
And in your tears you tried to show blind eyes and tell deaf ears
If we can make it through the landslide standing
We'll lift each other up to see the bliss on the horizon
Been looking in from the outside lately
I've seen who I used to be and it's not me
And we can keep healing
And we can keep holding on
I just want to take you where our time won't waste anymore
Through the mountains on the water
We'll stay engulfed in one another
And when I can wake up to see the sunrise in your eyes
Then we'll finally be free and I'll know I've made it home
So let's go out west and bask in the overcast
And walking through the rain we'll see the beauty in life again
And to reflect is to regret throwing it all away
And apathy, my one way street, it took so much from me
Separated by this divide I created through my fears
And in your tears you tried to show blind eyes and tell deaf ears
We can keep healing
Oh I know we can keep holding on
