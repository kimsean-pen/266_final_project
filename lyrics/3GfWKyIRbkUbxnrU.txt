Mounted men, with axe and shield
on their ride through shallow field
See your sons oh Vanadis
Light my ways oh Manalihs...

Freyas Val
Woutans half

Oaken woods as dark as night
Home of those of heathen pride
Grant me strength oh Asynja
Be my guide oh Valfreya

Freyas Val
Vingolfs's pride

Herjan!
When the moon shines bright from the dark black sky
We raise our swords to thy hail
when the runes are thrown and the ravens fly
as a sign of our heathens prevail

While the morning breaks through Tenkterian wood
while the sun sets the shores aflame
There is one thing only which never dies
The honour of thy name
Foraan!

By my side my brothers fall
Now on their way to Freya's hall
We are yours oh Vanadis
Guide their ways oh Manalihs

Hjer Foraan
Tenkteriar

Herjan!
While twilight covers the blood red skies
While the sun sets the shores aflame
There is one thing only which never dies
The honour of thy name

When time draws near for the chosen ones
To fall on the blood stained fields
Then death will grant us a place amongst
Our fathers in the halls of bronzen shields

A burning flame as blue as ice
Now I can see it in your eyes
Be my fate oh Vanadis
Through the nights oh Manalihs...
