Don't you ever be sad
Lean on me, when the times are bad
When the day comes and you're down
In a river of trouble and about to drown
Just hold on, I'm comin'
Hold on, I'm comin'

I'm on my way, your lover
If you get cold, yeah, I will be your cover
Don't have to worry, 'cause I'm here
No need to suffer, baby, 'cause I'm here

Just hold on, I'm comin'
Hold on, I'm comin'
Hold on, I'm comin'
Hold on, I'm comin'

Reach out to me for satisfaction, yeah
Call my name, yeah, for reaction
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Now, don't you ever be sad
Lean on me, when the times are bad
When the day comes and you're down, baby
In a river of trouble and about to drown
Just hold on, I'm comin'
Hold on, I'm comin'
Just hold on
(Don't you worry)
I'm comin'
(Here we come)
Hold on
(We're about to save you)
I'm comin'
(Yeah)
Just hold on
(Don't you worry)
I'm comin'
(Here I come)
