Your kingdom built on lies
Revenge I fantisize
Take me all who oppose
You thought I was disposed

You show your true intentions
What kind of man you are
The knives are sharpening
A co-conspiracy
Poison is treachery
My jude is past the flame
But now you say that I-

Breathe in the flames
The walls that built you up
They burn you down the same
Breathe in the flames
The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same
The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same

Your throat an open grave
Your tongue used to deceive
With that all sinking in
Your kind will never win

You've show your true intentions
What kind of man you are
The knives are sharpening
A co-conspiracy
Poison is treachery
My jude is past the flame
But now you say that I-

Breathe in the flames
The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same
Breathe in the flames
The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same
The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same
Burn you down the same

Breathe in the flames
The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same
Breathe in the flames
The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same
The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same
Burn you down the same
