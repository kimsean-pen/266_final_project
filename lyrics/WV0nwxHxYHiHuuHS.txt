Oh yeah

Can you feel me on the outside waiting?
Can you feel me on the outside waiting?
Can you feel the weight taking me away?
Can you see me on the inside fading, inside fading?

Ooh, look at the mess I've made
Take me down, down, down, carry me away
Oh, baby, ooh, look at the mess I've made
Let me drown, drown, drown in the water, babe, yeah
Drown, drown, drown in the water, babe

Down the river, make my heart stop beating
Down the river, make my heart stop beating
Can you hear the sound of them underground?
All my hurt is on the inside wailing, inside wailing, inside wailing, inside wailing

Ooh, look at the mess I've made
Take me down, down, down, carry me away
Oh, baby, ooh, look at the mess I've made
Let me drown, drown, drown in the water, babe, yeah

Just let me drown, oh
Get up, get up, oh
Take me down, this time I'm done
Into the river and out of the sun
Under the water, it's all out of love
I'll drown alone, who gives a fuck?

Ooh, look at the mess I've made
Take me down, down, down, carry me away
Oh, baby, ooh, look at the mess I've made
Let me drown, drown, drown in the water, babe
Ooh, look at the mess I've made
Take me down, down, down, carry me away
Oh, baby, ooh, look at the mess I've made
I'll fucking drown, drown, drown in the water, babe, yeah
