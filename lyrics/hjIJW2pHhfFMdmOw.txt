I could become more than all you like and stay
Take me in like I could keep you wide awake (Ayy)
You can clear your conscience, if you're worried, solve it
You could pick the picture, let me be the frame (Ayy)

'Cause you got too used to the bad things
Feel it in your chest, it's burning
I can be the one that makes your heart sink
Show me where it's broke, I'll get it working

I come with such good intentions
Laying by your side when you need attention
I'll be the flower, I'll be your flower
I'll be the flower to your vase

You can let your guard down, you ain't gotta fight it
You been actin' up but deep inside you're crying (Ayy)
You can clear your conscience, you can show you're honest
I could be the morning on your darkest day, oh

'Cause you got too used to the bad things
It's all in your head got you burning
I could be the one that makes your soul see
Show me where it's broken, I'll get floating

I come with such good intentions
Laying by your side when you need attention
I'll be the flower, I'll be your flower, darling
I'll be the flower to your grave

Good intentions, babe, good intentions babe

I come with good intentions (I come with)
Won't need to make assumptions (Won't need to)
I'll be the flower to your vase (I'll be the flower, flower)
Soon or later, you'll be better
I'll take away the pressure
I'll be your intervention, babe

I come with such good intentions (I come with good intentions)
Laying by your side when you need
attention (won't need to make assumptions)
I'll be the flower (I'll be the flower)
I'll be your flower, darling
I'll be the flower to your grave (Oh, oh)

I'll be the flower to your vase
I'll be the flower to your vase, oh
Babe, the flower to your vase
