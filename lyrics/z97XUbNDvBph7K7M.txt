Hold it!
We've gotta prove we're adults now
We're not a punk rock band, we're a new wave band

I'm tired of self respect
I can't afford a car
I wanna be a prefab superstar

I wanna be a tool, don't need no soul
Wanna make big money playing rock and roll

I'll make my music boring
I'll play my music slow
I ain't no artist, I'm a business man
No ideas of my own

I won't offend or rock the boat
Just sex and drugs and rock and roll

And here we go
And drool, drool, drool, drool, drool, drool
My Payola!
Drool, drool, drool, drool, drool, drool
My Payola!

You'll pay ten bucks to see me
On a fifteen foot high stage
Fatass bouncers kick the shit
Out of kids who try to dance

If my friends say, I've lost my guts
I'll laugh and say, that's rock and roll

But there's just one problem
Is my cock big enough?
Is my brain small enough?
For you to make me a star

Give me a toot
I'll sell you my soul
Pull my strings and I'll go far

Give me a toot
I'll sell you my soul
Pull my strings and I'll go far

And when I'm rich and meet Bob Hope
We'll shoot some golf and shoot some dope

Is my cock big enough?
Is my brain small enough?
For you to make me a star

Give me a toot
I'll sell you my soul
Pull my strings and I'll go far
Guitar!

Everybody put your hands together
Is my cock big enough?
Is my brain small enough?
For you to make me a star

Everybody sing one time
Is my cock big enough?
Is my brain small enough?
For you to make me a star

Shut up and dance, everybody
Is my cock big enough?
Is my brain small enough?
For you to make me a star

Give me a toot
I'll sell you my soul
Pull my strings and I'll go far

One more time
Give me a toot
I'll sell you my soul
Pull my strings and I'll go far

And drool, drool, drool, drool, drool, drool
My Payola!
Drool, drool, drool, drool, drool, drool
My Payola!
