Why am i gonna apologise
What have i even done
Why you acting like you've lost the crown
If you were never wearing one

Falling ever deeper dealing cards now
Now you can't recognise yourself on the deck
I thought i was your queen of hearts
But all the aces stole the check

A prince
A prince
Of glorious came
A prince
A prince
Check mate and you stole me away

Cursing words am i a pauper now
Even though all my shoes do fit
Won't even let my leave the house past 12
I ain't no fairy tale chick happy endings cloud your head now
You have put your expectations too high
Sit on the bed tears running down our eyes
Once upon time i wondered why

A prince
A prince
Of glorious came
A prince
A prince
Check mate and you stole me away

Darling hold on a second
You know that your eyes and your smile are a weapon
Now come here, why won't you just listen
You tell me i'm hurting your arm with my grip
See now trust me but never trust women
Yeah they're perfect, i'm at home stressed, with this skunk spliff
When i know that you're out on the road being faithless
Does it make sense
And my insecurities don't pay rent but they're living with me
And this is a disease
We live in a man's world so what you expect me to be
Na na na
Whether it's the shit sex or this limp dick
My reflection keeps telling me sick things
You know that i'm ugly, i hope that you want me, i'll make sure you love me

A prince (a prince)
A prince (a prince)
Of glorious came
A prince (a prince)
A prince (a prince)
Check mate and you stole me away

I've never been a prince no lord
And i tried to be a king oh lord
Said i've never been a prince no lord
And i tried to be a king but i let you down my queen

Oh you let me down my king.
