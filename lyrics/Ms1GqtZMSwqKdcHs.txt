I never found out what made you leave
And now the day is over, just an hour to go
I tried to phone last night but you never answered
Just left me ringing on the line

Outside, is there anyone out there
Anyone else outside
Outside love, is there anyone out there
Anyone else outside

My face in the mirror shows the break in time
A crack in the ocean it does not align
I tried to sleep last night but I've caught you dreaming
About days we used to wonder away

Outside, is there anyone out there
Anyone else outside
Outside love, is there anyone out there
Anyone else outside

Look out of the window, maybe you can call by my name
Another night over babe another light comes on in vain
I tried to phone last night but you never answered
Just left me ringing in the air

Is there anyone out there
Anyone out there, anyone out there
Anyone out there, anyone out there
