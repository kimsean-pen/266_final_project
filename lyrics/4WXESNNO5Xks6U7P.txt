Get another boyfriend
Backstreet...
Check it

Let's talk about one, baby
You gotta here me out
Do you really want to be the last to know
What it's all about
Let's talk about who you say
Is the essence of your life
But he'll eat you up from inside slow
And then he doesn't wanna know
I'm tellin' you he'll eat you up from inside
And then he doesn't wanna know

Listen, I mean it
There's nothin' that he's worthy of
He's just another playa'
Playin' in the name of love
I've seen enough
Now this must come to an end
Get another boyfriend

Let's talk about what he's done
To become your number one
Or was it all the promises of diamonds, pearls and party dresses
That turned you on
I've seen it before, (don't take) anymore
Free too you're through for sure
Just go get on with your life, stop
Actin' like you're givin' up
I'm tellin' you, go get on with your life
Stop actin' like you're givin' up

Listen, I mean it
There's nothin' that he's worthy of
He's just another playa'
Playin' in the name of love
I've seen enough
Now this must come to an end (must come to an end)
Get another boyfriend

(Why?)
(Why?)
(Get another boyfriend)
(Why?)
Stop!

Here me out, you must know what it's all about
He's just a playa' in love
This must come to an end
Get another boyfriend

Listen, I mean it (I mean it)
There's nothin' that he's worthy of (ain't nothin' that he's worthy of)
He's just another playa'
Playin' in the name of love
I've seen enough
Now this must come to an end
Get another, get another, get another boyfriend
Listen, I mean it (hear me now)
There's nothin' that he's worthy of (you must know, what it's all about)
He's just another playa'
Playin' in the name of love
I've seen enough
Now this must come to an end
