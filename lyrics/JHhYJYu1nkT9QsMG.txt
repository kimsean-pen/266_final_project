Years gone by - Awake again
In a glowing star - That shines so far
Lasting child - Remains inside
Playing around - A future denied

High overhead,
Dusk is insight

Fumbling the mist
Lingering around

Blow
Carrying winds
Take me high
Where I can see
The hidden lights
That blink far beyond

Blow
Carrying winds
Take me high
Where I can see
The hidden lights
That blink far beyond

And then
A painted dream
Colours that melt
Inside slender frames
There I'll stand
There I belong

(Instrumental)
