It's been a long time coming.
I spent a long time rotting before I got going.
I was crawling through the colors before I got going.
And when the house had flooded, I surfaced above the covers.
Then we slept in, rotting, before I kicked my addiction to ammunition.
Six years and I'm still the corpse king, still writhing in this town.
Head is on fire and you're the fuse, barely bruising.
And all the awful that I caught wind of, while trying to drown it, well, it blew me away.
