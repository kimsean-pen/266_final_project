A raven came to me
Spoke to me in my dream
A long lost prophecy
A forgotten legacy

Echoes of yesterday
Won't let these dreams fade away
All the beauty I adored
At the edge of the world

Across the universe
Time is to be reversed
No shelter can be found
To this fate, we are bound

Behold the final hour
The last times will be dour
All life falls into gorge
Of the end of the world

Burning skies
On the vengeance's night
Devastating scythe
Of the Ancient Light

I saw the might
Of the Ancient Light
And the beauty of the perishing world
There's no tomorrow
We have been warned

Across the universe
Time is to be reversed
No shelter can be found
To this fate, we are bound

Behold the final hour
The last times will be dour
All life falls into gorge
Of the end of the world

The sky's bird struck fire
Made a flame flare up
The north wind burnt the clearing
The north-east quite consumed it:
It burnt all the trees to ash and reduced them to dust.

Burning skies
On the vengeance's night
Devastating scythe
Of the Ancient Light
I saw the might
Of the ancient Light
And the beauty of the perishing world
There's no tomorrow
We have been warned
