You, me in Manhattan and together living on a roof
You, me are not sleeping together
Sleeping together
You and me are not walking together going through the park
You and me are now walking together
Not working together
I count to three in disbelief
I count to three how can it be?
I count to three with my eyes closed
It's only how we make it work
It's only how we make it work
We make the best of it, no?
Ah ah
Oh let us 'ay in
We lapsed dans la lune
Me they won't let us sleep
Relax de la nuit
Busy people walk out reach the sky as trucks are driving by
Take my arm and I'm onto last exit it's okay to wake us
Busy people walk the sky as trucks are driving
Take my hand and I'm of the logic that it's okay to make up
I count to five we're still alive
I count to five we're still alive
I count to five with my eyes closed
Somehow we make it through the days like this one
Make it through days like this one
Make it through the days I don't know how
Ahoh
Oh let us fly in
Relax dans la lune
We they won't let us sleep
Relax dans la nuit
You we and my mom have been together
But not sleeping together
