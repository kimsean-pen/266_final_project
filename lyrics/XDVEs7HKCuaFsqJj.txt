Between motionless
And this retched state of digression
Treading on the line
That I drew from my own compliance

Let me feel it rain down
I cannot wait any longer
Let's get something straight
I am not who you made me out to be

It's the awakening
Of my body's inner consciousness
A fraction of my sleepless
Numb existence

Rain down now on me
Rain down now on me

Oh, I feel it now
Pick and pull apart my limbs
Push me down now from your throne

Oh, I feel it now
Drag me down now to the floor
Press the point into my skin
Oh, I feel it now
Oh I feel it now

Something will have to collide
To end the constant spinning cycles
Strung together
I'm crawling in the streets

Where is my fix?
Where is my fix?
Where is my fix?
Where is my fix?

I stand alone in time
I stand alone in time
I stand alone in time
I stand alone in time

When they spun away
I fell apart
When they spun away
I fell apart
