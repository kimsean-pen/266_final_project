And we're at it again, I turn around another fucking war, man
I don't know where to begin, but I'll start with the radical leaders
Their steps we're followin'

Running, don't go back and fight, too many you'll lose
(And as clowns you follow suit behind
the blood between the red and white and blue
But it's too deep for you to see and
everyone eventually will take the step
Cause it's in sight you take the left I'll take the right

I fell the hate you've built for me and I say pay attention baby)
As they thank the Lord the blind can't see

Like a plague fed to the brain, deadly disease
But it wasn't a sin, a sorry life judging in every action
And as they're feeding your mind with this shit you forget

How to speak, how to ask all the questions
The business at hand tonight, make the people choose
(I see another side in you but there's not much more
I can do from on the outside looking in your government
Is listenin' to push you on the story of
Immortal father mortal son give them your mind
And all your wealth the cycle will rebirth itself)
If they had it their way,
I'd burn in Hell and your future's a fuckin' disaster
Can't you see
Don't give them all the power when
your future's in desperate trouble, baby
As they thank the Lord the blind can't see

Like a plague fed to the brain, deadly disease
I'd run away tonight with my mind
still intact, you gotta make it alright
Easier said than done with no place to hide and having no place to...
Running away from condition, I see you but
You're running away from
Your scared, seducive system
Most would claim I live a lie when
pointed out it's easy to predict these things
Every color has it's side (I have a
side), they live together vote and most embrace
the same dark ties

Please help us, please save us,
of course they have control we're all the same
Up on the cross,
crucified their problem, drove the nail and let Him rot
Family and friends,
it won't matter in the end I'm sure they'll understand
Now look at the world and see how the humans bleed

As I sit up here and wonder 'bout
tonight you sold your mind, body and soul
Looking at the fields so green I know this sounds obscene
I see you're living for tomorrow but
decisions you have made will leave you empty
As they thank the Lord the blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain, deadly disease
I'd run away tonight with my mind
still intact, you gotta make it alright
Easier said than done with no place to hide and having no place to...
Ruuuuunnnnnnn...
You've fallen asleep in denial
Look at the way we're dyin'
How it ends I'll never know
Just live your life blind like me
