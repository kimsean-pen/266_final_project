I don't have enough time
To say the things I wanna say
To do the things I wanna do
Or to be like you
I just want some time
To express the things I feel
Just to express the things I feel
And believe them too
2 + 2 has been 4 for
So many darn years, oh Lord
I wanna write a song
Oh, baby is that so wrong?
And it goes La de da de da de da de day oh
La de da de where did all the good times go?
La de da de la da dee dum dom La da de day
When will you come back home?
I went down to the mall
Then they closed down the mall
Guess they don't want me going to the mall
'Cause I'm just too small
Then I built some trains
And I'm travelling somewhere new
It's a wonderful world, but
Still no you
It's a wonderful world for two
Singin' La de da de da de da de day oh
La de da de where did all the bad times roll?
La de da de la da dee dum dom, la da de day
When can you come back home?

I just went online
To explain the things I feel
To express the things I mean
And it felt so real
Now I'm doing alright
And I'm downright feeling okay
It's the end of the world
And I just can't wait
I know that you can relate
La de da de da de da de day oh
La de da de where did all the good times go?
La de da d-de dum de da, d-d-dim
Dwaayah d-de dum dwee ayy
That's okay
(La de da de da de da
De day way oh, be dot do)
When did all the windmills start to turn so slow?
(Wondering) La de da de la d-de dum dom, la da de day
When will you come back home?
Just got home got no home
La de da d-de where did it go?
Oh no
I can't go home.
