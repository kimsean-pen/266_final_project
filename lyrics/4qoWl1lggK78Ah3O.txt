Forever and always... (always)

That time is here again
Prepare to be apart
And it drives you crazy!

Each time I go away
The distance gets longer
But it makes us stronger!

Should it all come crashing down around me
Would you be there, should I stumble or fall
And pick up the pieces?

Whoa-oh-oh!
Forget about the shit that we've been through!
I wanna stay here forever and always!
Whoa-oh-oh!
Standing here in front of all of you!
I wanna stay here forever and always!

These days are dead again
It's empty from the start
And it drives me crazy!

The hours drift away
It hurts to remember
This will soon be over!

Should it all come crashing down around me
Would you be there, should I stumble or fall
And pick up the pieces?

Whoa-oh-oh!
Forget about the shit that we've been through!
I wanna stay here forever and always!
Whoa-oh-oh!
Standing here in front of all of you!
I wanna stay here forever and always!

Forever and always! (Always...)
Forever and always!
Whoa-oh-oh!
Whoa-oh-oh!
Whoa-oh-oh!
Forever and always!
Whoa-oh-oh!
Whoa-oh-oh!
Whoa-oh-oh!
Forever and always! (Always...)
