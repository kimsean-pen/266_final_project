Stale solution is inevitable
Careless arrogance
A high-stakes game no one can win
Days are numbered
Never ending struggle of power
Man has failed
One man's war costs everything

Millions tremble as the oceans rise
The endless tide never to recede
As if nature is reclaiming itself
Trying to overcome is pointless
Engulfing this world with flames

As time draws nearer—darkness surrounds your soul
And the shadows march beyond
Born into chaos—the night will be here to stay

An endless wait
Fear the unknown
Consciousness slips beyond your grasp
Silence surrounding
Unsure if we'll die today
Fear in your heart
Mother nature
Left to sweep this earth

As time draws nearer—darkness surrounds your soul
And the shadows march beyond
Born into chaos—the night will be here to stay
Can't travel beyond the black
Emotionless—shattered
Nations swept into the sea
Clean the canvas to start again
Humanity's secrets one day unearthed again
