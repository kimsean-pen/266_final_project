When you're tired and feeling lonely
And your heart has nowhere to head
Think of me, I'll be thinking somewhere
All of those things that you said

But don't be cruel to me
Don't be cruel to me

'Cause I'm looking for someone to find me
I'm looking for someone to love
I'm hoping that someone will find me
I got no one to love

When your days are plagued by loneliness
And you got no one to call
My name's here in the phone book
I'll be straight round to yours

Don't be cruel to me
Don't be cruel to me

'Cause I'm looking for someone to find me
I'm looking for someone to love
I'm hoping that someone will find me
I got no one to love
I got no one to love

I'm hoping that someone will find me
Someone to call my own
Someone who will be kind to me
'Cause I got no one to love

When you're faced with a life that ain't working
And your heart is heavy inside
Well, it's time to think of leaving
All that darkens your mind

Don't be cruel to me
Don't be cruel to me

'Cause I'm looking for someone to find me
I'm looking for someone to love
I'm hoping that someone will find me
I got no one to love
I got no one to love, no
I got no one to love

I'm hoping that someone will find me
Someone to call my own
Someone who will be kind to me
'Cause I got no one in this world or this life
I need someone to love
