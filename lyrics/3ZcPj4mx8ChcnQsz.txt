Let's start by correcting ya tone
Lower ya finger, don't be comin' at me
With condescending demeanor
We both know that ya dead wrong

And what makes it worse
You don't even have the nerve
To ever say that you're sorry

You're never wrong and I'm never right
And you win all the rounds in every fight
That's why

Can't stay another day when you're always getting your way
You just keep getting your way
You just keep getting your way, ya selfish

So I decided not to get in your way
It's time to do it my way
And that means getting away from you, ya selfish

How is it that you can look at us and only see you?
You can look at one but never would you ever see two
You can live a lie and never be true
It's so funny now, how completely I can see you

You're never wrong and I'm never right
And you win all the rounds in every fight
That's why

Can't stay another day when you're always getting your way
You just keep getting your way
You just keep getting your way, ya selfish

So I decided not to get in your way
It's time to do it my way
And that means getting away from you, ya selfish

No, we don't need to talk
Ain't nothin' left to say
You got everything ya want
Go ahead and have ya cake

I know what's best for me
We go our separate ways
Leaving you with everything
Even all the pain

Can't stay another day when you're always getting your way
You just keep getting your way
You just keep getting your way, ya selfish

So I decided not to get in your way
It's time to do it my way
And that means getting away from you, ya selfish
