Behold the glowing embers
Of glory that once was
Still shining bright within your eyes
The beacon of my life
You are my everlasting fire
That burns with all of my desires

You are the light that conquers darkness
You are the dream that transcends
You are the hope that speaks to my heart
My faith until the end

Behind the veils of darkness
There is a pale dim light
It's shimmering and dwindling
Right at the edge of the night
I gaze towards a shining past
That days to come will never outlast

(You are the light)
You are the light that conquers darkness
You are the dream that transcends
You are the hope that speaks to my heart
My faith until the end

You are the light that conquers darkness
You are the dream that transcends
You are the hope that speaks to my heart
My faith until the end
Until the end
