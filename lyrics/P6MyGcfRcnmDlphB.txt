Sit enthroned in white grandeur
But tired
And shift a wisp of wayward silver hair
From your eyes
I'd never seen you unkempt before
As you whisper darling close the door

How have I not made a note of every word
You ever said
And time is not on our side but I'll pretend
That it's alright
She says the Lord has a plan
But admits it's pretty hard to understand

Before you leave
You must know you are beloved
And before you leave
Remember I was with you

Are you afraid
However could you not be
In this rosy light
This is strange
I feel a hand come through the mirror
Pointing at the light
Point at the light we never see
As you put your feathered arms over me

Before you leave
You must know you are beloved
And before you leave
Remember I was with you
And as you leave
I won't hold you back beloved

We'll sit and talk
The stars down from the sky
And I'll not forget the chaos in your eyes love

And as you leave
You must know you are beloved
And as you leave
I can see the wild has come for you
And as you leave
I won't hold you back beloved
And as you leave
See my children playing at your feet
