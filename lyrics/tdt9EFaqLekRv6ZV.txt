I'm clarity, still holding on to light
Disguising clouds as cooler, grey sunshine
There's no surreal emotion
In swimming open oceans
I'm clarity in hesitating eyes

Stripped down from all that's holy
With narcoleptic hoping
It's okay to look straight
Without naive impulsions

Tonight
I'm fine
I'm clean
Not blind

It's temporary, resolving to rewind
Consuming silence 'til sound gives up the fight
Can't waste my nights on hoping
The world will give in slowly
It's temporary, these catatonic lights

Stripped down from all that's holy
With narcoleptic hoping
It's okay to look straight
Without naive impulsions

Tonight
I'm fine
I'm clean
Not blind

I'm holding skies while waters rise
Watching the tide spill in with wine
Each day breaks a new space
To erase burdens you've been carrying

Tonight
I'm fine
I'm clean
Not blind
