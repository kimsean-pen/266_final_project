When they come out to find you
And they cannot describe you
Someone somewhere has to buy you
Out of your weekend

Friday is the fever
And Monday the destroyer
You are a permanent feature
Perpetual weekend

And on the wire in the morning
There? s a city growing in my head
Where there is no weekend

When they come out to find you
And they can multiply you
Someone? s been caught in the crossfire
Of your weekend

The Friday is the teacher
And Monday the tormentor
You are a new kind of creature
Perpetual weekend

And on the wire in the morning
There? s a city growing in my head
Where there is no weekend

You took the end, you took the end, you took the end
You took the end out of the weekend, weekend

You took the end, you took the end, you took the end
You took the end out of the weekend
You took the end out of the weekend
You took the end out of the weekend
