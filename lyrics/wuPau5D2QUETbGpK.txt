The feeling in
Guts to the brain
It means you got it coming and you ain't got a chain
Their only attire
Is a typical vice
But if it gets you well, well you ain't being nice, no

So follow the lives
Till they cut up your eyes
You won't be even seeing if you ain't growing lies
Then bought all the shit
That should never be sold
They put a gun above it and a narrow behold

We are the happy landfill
We are the happy landfill
All right!
