This is the last time
I let you invade my heart
With your armies

This is the last time
I let you invade
My heart, my heart

Only the stains
Could overdrive
You like to feel vain
Dozens of miles

And you look great
Open the wine
Open the lies
You keep on guard

Meet me on a lake
You lie to fake
Another take
You are mine
Oh mine

Shoot another take
And I can fake a little break
You're mine
Oh mine

Break another bed
And we can sing a little sad song
Why, oh why

Fate, you wanna hide
Still, you know
You can't replace
My eyes, oh eyes, oh eyes

Now this time you draw the line

This is the last time
I let you invade my heart
With your armies

This is the last time
I let you invade
My heart, my heart

Only the stains
Could overdrive
You like to feel vain
Dozens of miles

And you look great
Open the wine
Open the lies
You keep on guard, yeah.

Meet me on a lake
You lie to fake
Another take
You are mine
Oh mine

Shoot another take
And I can fake a little break
You're mine
Oh mine

Break another bed
And we can sing a little sad song
Why, oh why

Fate, you wanna hide
Still, you know
You can't replace
My eyes, oh eyes, oh eyes

Now this time you draw the line
