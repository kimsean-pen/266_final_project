What did you expect?
Fools often sometimes forget
Who really knows what's the truth
Often dignified

How funny changing the tide
Feels like you already knew

(Praise)
like the devil
(Connect)
You would never
(Sick man)
Running circles
Feels like you already knew

(Praise)
Like the devil
(Connect)
You would never
(Sick man)
Running circles
Feels like you already knew

Save you
I would never
Deny you
Even though your hate for me is strong

(See)
I'm not what you
(Think)
I'm the one who'll
(Be)
What you never
Thought would be nothin' and now

(Afraid to open up your eyes)
And now you realize

Always you lived in a dream
How would it feel if you could?
See past the lies
Oblivious to all of my cries
No hope when I knew that you could

Save you
I would never
Deny you
Even though your hate for me is strong
(See)
I'm not what you
(Think)
I'm the one who'll
(Be)
What you never
Thought would be nothin' and now
