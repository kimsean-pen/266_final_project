I'm going round in circles
And the door's wide open
Boy I still wanna see you
Days go by, I'm still hoping, hoping

Where we draw the line?
Tell me, baby, where we draw the line?
Tell me, baby, where we draw the line?
Tell me, baby, where we draw the line?

You told me to move on
Searching now for somebody else
But baby, tell me how will I find it?
If all I see is you? All I see is you?

All I see is you, all I see
All I see is you, all I see
Where we draw the line?
Tell me, baby, where we draw the line?
Tell me, baby, where we draw the line?
Tell me, baby, where we draw the line?

Where we draw the line?
Tell me, baby, where we draw the line?
Tell me, baby, where we draw the line?
Tell me, baby, where we draw the line?

My heart breaks to see you
Days go by, I'm still hoping

All I see is you, all I see
All I see is you
Where we draw the line?
Tell me, baby, where we draw the line?
Tell me, baby, where we draw the line?
Tell me, baby, where we draw the line?
Where we draw the line?
Tell me, baby, where we draw the line?
Tell me, baby, where we draw the line?
Tell me, baby, where we draw the line?
