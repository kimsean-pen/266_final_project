Man on a mission
Let me tell you my position
Treat my condition
With a full head on collision
It only took you one minute
To drop yourself in it
It only took me one minute, one minute
To find myself in it, testing my limit
Tied up
Tied up
I gotta get out of here

You're dragging me
Dragging me
Dragging me
Dragging me
Dragging me
Dragging me down

Give me fucking greatness
Or give me nothing at all
Give me what I came for
Or give me nothing at all
Nothing at all

What a day
What a day
What a day
What a day when
You show me love

'Cause your kings and your queens
They mean nothing to me, no
So just give it to me
All your fucking greatness
Or give me nothing at all

Wanna talk about living
The quotas you're filling
Like you're meant to be made in God's image
But you just gonna mimic

It's dragging me
Dragging me
Dragging me
Dragging me down

Give me fucking greatness
Or give me nothing at all
Give me what I came for
Or give me nothing at all
Nothing at all

What a day
What a day
What a day
What a day when you show me love

'Cause your kings and your queens
They mean nothing to me, no
So, just give it to me
All your fucking greatness
Or give me nothing at all

Ooh, we're reaching the pinnacle
Ooh, We're climbing on and on,
On and on,
On and on,
Ooh, we're reaching the pinnacle
Ooh, We're climbing on and on,
On and on,
So give it to me
Give me all your greatness

Give me fucking greatness
Or give me nothing at all
Give me what I came for
Or give me nothing at all
Nothing at all

What a day
What a day
What a day
What a day when you show me love

'Cause your kings and your queens
They mean nothing to me, no
So, just give it to me
All your fucking greatness
Or give me nothing at all
