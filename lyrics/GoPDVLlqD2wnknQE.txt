You crawl in bed, it's three a.m.
You smell of wine and cigarettes
A butterfly under the glass
You are beautiful
But you're not going anywhere

We do the same thing every night
I swear I've heard this song before
A swimmer who has seen a shark
I should really be more wary of the water

You came, you saw, you conquered... everyone
And I'm left here guessing
Oh what went wrong
Yeah, I'm down
But not out
And far from done
Hey all!
Beware! Criminal

Criminal

A prism with an intellect
You show your eyes selectivly
You stole my glow, a seasoned thief
The blacks of my eyes are turning into opals

Today I walk
There's nothing here left for me but empty promises
And the thought of all the things I'm never getting back

You came, you saw, you conquered
Everyone
And I'm left here bleeding
Oh what went wrong
Yeah, I'm down
But not out
And far from done

Beware! Criminal

Did you think, did you think I wouldn't notice?
Did you think, did you think, did you really think I wouldn't care?
Did you think, did you think I wouldn't notice?
Did you think, did you think, did you really think?

You came, you saw, you conquered
And I'm left here bleeding
Oh, what went wrong?
Yeah, I'm down
But not out
And far from done
Oh!
Beware! Criminal
