fuck you and your high class friends

they wouldn't know the difference between love and sex

and I wouldn't say that intelligence is something they possess

at least I haven't noticed in the time we've spent
on the weekends when we pretend that we're something more than friends

when we sleep in and it feels like how we feel will never end

and we pretend
we pretend
we pretend
we pretend

fuck you and your new boyfriend
I bet he doesn't know the things that I know and
I bet he doesn't know your hidden love for punk bands
or your infatuation with drunk romance
can we pretend that you leave him and we can be more than friends?
we can return to how we were when we met

and we pretend
we pretend
we pretend
we pretend

fuck you and what your parents say
im sorry that I doubted when you said that they're insane
cuz they always said I don't know how to act my age
they always said that I'm no good for you buy hey

can we pretend on the weekend that we're maybe more than friends
we can sleep in our weekend again

and we'll pretend
we'll pretend
we'll pretend
we'll pretend
oh we'll pretend
we'll pretend
we'll pretend
oh we'll pretend
