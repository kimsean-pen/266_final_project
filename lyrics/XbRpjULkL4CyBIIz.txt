Mate,
I'm stuck outside,
Looks like the sun is rising soon, and the night didn't go like I said it would.
Mate,
I can see your light,
and I know that you're up entertaining, this isn't the neighbours complaining,
The buses have stopped and it's raining

I just need to sleep, to forget about her, to forget what I said
Please throw down your keys,
and I won't interfere, get straight into bed

I'm out here in the rain, and life is throwing stones at me
It's going down the drain, it's all become too much for me
Oh can you help me mate?
Oh can you help me mate?

Mate,
I know you're home.
and I know that you're there with somebody,
If I'm talking too much then just stop me,
I'll get out of your way in a hurry

I just feel so tired, can't forget about her, can't forget

I'm out here in the rain, and life is throwing stones at me
It's going down the drain, it's all become too much for me
Oh can you help me mate?
It's all become too much
Oh can't you help me mate?

It's really getting late
I'm out here in a state
Oh I thought you were my mate!

I'm out here in the rain, and life is throwing stones at me
It's going down the drain, it's all become too much for me
Oh can't you help me mate?
I'm out here in the rain, and life is throwing stones at me
It's going down the drain, it's all become too much for me
Oh can't you help me mate?
I'm out here in the rain, and life is throwing stones at me
It's going down the drain, it's all become too much for me
Oh can't you help me mate?
