I would lie anywhere with you,
any old bed of nails would do,
ink up the wound for a crude tatoo,
a big old red heart with an anchor stuck through

Like a sister Ophelia,
tell me you're there!
Like a lifeline Ophelia,
tell me you're there!

O Ophelia i feel year fall...
O Ophelia i feel year fall...

Ah any old bed of nails for me,
just so you're there when i fall asleep,
i'd lay all the night in a lanky limbed heap

Surround me like a warm bath,
sum me up like an epitaph,
be blatant as a bailiff,
i want my lips to blister when we kiss

O Ophelia i feel year fall...
O Ophelia i feel year fall...

Our love,
Frankestein in nature and design
like the shelleys on their very fist time
when our bodies become electrified
together we bring this creature alive

It's alive... it's alive... it's alive!

I would lie anywhere with you,
any old bed of nails would do,
ink up the wound for a crude tatoo,
a big old red heart with an anchor stuck through

I would lie anywhere with you,
any old bed of nails would do,
just so you're there when i fall asleep,
i'd lay all the night in a lanky limbed heap
