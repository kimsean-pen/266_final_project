Now everybody have you heard
if you're in the game, then the strokes the word
Don't take no rhythm, don't take no style
Got a thirst for killin', grab you're vile

You put your right hand out give a firm hand-shake
Talk to me about that one big break
Spread your ear-pollution both far and wide
Keep your contributions by your side and (Stroke me, stroke me)

Could be a winner boy, you move quite well (Stroke me, stroke me)
Stroke me, stroke me
You got your number down (Stroke me, stroke me)
Say you're a winner but man you're just a sinner now

You put your left foot out keep it all in place
Work your way right into my case
First you try to bed me you make my backbone slide
But when you found you bled me, skip on by, keep on (Stroke me, stroke me)
Give me the business all night long (Stroke me, stroke me)
Stroke me, stroke me
You're so together boy (Stroke me, stroke me)
Say you're a winner but man you're just a sinner now

Stroke

Better listen now, said it ain't no joke
Let your conscience fail ya, just do the stroke
Don't cha take no chances keep your eye on top
Do your fancy dances you can't stop you just (Stroke me, stroke me)

Stroke me, stroke me

Say you're a winner but man you're just a sinner now
