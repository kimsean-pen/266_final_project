My heart, is only numb unless I dig through my veins (Mmm)
I got my rationality, he's seen better days (Mmm)

Deliria sweep through my brain, like I took a shot
Hey, Mr I Need-a-High-grade, I'm starry-eyed and lost
My heart is only dumb unless I dig through my veins

You naïve soul
Life is sugar
You naïve soul
Life is wonder
You naïve soul
Life is sugar
You naïve soul
Life is wonder
It's just me-e-e-e-e-e, I-I-I-I-I-I
I got more love to give
It's just me-e-e-e-e-e, I-I-I-I-I-I
I got more love to give

All black, no complication as I rocket out this maze (Mmm)
Ooh I'm reborn, I hit every tree I fall out of space (Mmm)

Deliria sweep through my brain, like I took a shot
Hey, Mr I Need-High-grade, I'm starry-eyed and lost
My heart is only dumb when I shoot down my veins

You naïve soul
Life is sugar (Sugar)
You naïve soul
Life is wonder (Wonder)
You naïve soul
Life is sugar (Sugar)
You naïve soul
Life is wonder (Wonder)
It's just me-e-e-e-e-e, I-I-I-I-I-I
I got more love to give
It's just me-e-e-e-e-e, I-I-I-I-I-I
I got more love to give

Blindfolded my doubts 'til I'm in a dream, in a dream
Help me outta these bars, help me find a key, run away with me
Darling you're my, answer
Oh I'm on my way out of here

You naïve soul
Life is sugar (Sugar)
You naïve soul
Life is wonder (Wonder)

Life is sugar (Sugar)
You naïve soul
Life is wonder (Wonder)
It's just me-e-e-e-e-e, I-I-I-I-I-I

It's just me-e-e-e-e-e, I-I-I-I-I-I
I got more love to give (More love to give)
