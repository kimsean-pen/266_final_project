Corridor lies with the river
All watery eyes
I stand there waitin' for my turn
I turn with a rise
The spirits blow around like a hurricane whip
The girls don't mind my high scream drip

Somebody found us dancin'
You can turn off and feel better
When everything's clear like cold weather
Go feel better, feel better

Somebody from my heart said
I could turn off and never wake up
And everything's clear, my breath feels like steam fake
Feel better
Fallin' apart, apart, apart, apart, apart

Finally they call my name
The ghost inside can wake us to life
Makin' my chair do flips
By givin' into this we'll be saved every time

Fallin' through the floor on my broken butterfly wing
Gimme me one more, the girl from the corridor sing, she sing
I hear you want it, don't you?
I know you want it, don't you? Don't you?
I see you want it, don't you?
I know you want it, don't you? Don't you?
Fallin' apart, apart, apart, apart, apart
Fallin' apart, apart, apart, apart, apart

Somebody found us dancin'
You can turn off and feel better
When everything's clear like cold weather
Go feel better, feel better

Somebody from my heart said
You could turn off and never wake up
And everything's clear, my breath feels like steam fake
Feel better

Do you want it? Do you want it?
Do you want it? Do you want it?
Do you? Do you? (She says) Do you? Do you?

Do you want it? Do you want it?
Do you want it? Do you want it?
Do you? Do you? Do you? (She says)

Fallin' apart, apart, apart, apart, apart
Fallin' apart, apart, apart, apart, apart
