We don't have a plan
Just pack your bags and run as fast as we can
We hold the future in the palm of our hands
I know you hear me but do you understand?

Yeah we've been making a scene
I'll keep on singing if you shake tamberine
Whether we're broke, whether we're living the dream
I see you laughing but you know what I mean

I'm talking about the highs
I'm talking about the lows
I'm sticking by your side
No way I'm letting go
I'm talking about forever, baby
I'm giving you forever, baby, it's yours
I'm talking about the highs
I'm talking about the lows

When we're gray and we're old
And we run out of all the silver and gold
Will you still wanna be that someone to hold?
See, I'd tell you but you already know

I'm talking about the highs
I'm talking about the lows
I'm sticking by your side
No way I'm letting go
I'm talking about forever, baby
I'm giving you forever, baby, it's yours
I'm talking about the highs
I'm talking about the lows

I'm certain that there's no other
It's banging in my heart like thunder
I know I was made to love you
No way I'm letting go
I'll be there through the highs
I'll be there through the lows
I'm staying by your side
No way I'm letting go

I'm talking about the highs
I'm talking about the lows
I'm staying by your side
No way I'm letting go
I'm talking about forever, baby
I'm giving you forever, baby, it's yours
I'm talking about the highs
I'm talking about the lows
