Last time i saw you
I was holding your hand
and I couldn't wait for
you to leave
I knew right then
that it was over and done
and I couldn't believe
that I was free
Help me now

I'm going down
and I don't know if i'll be ok
I'll be around
I'll be in town
if you need a place to stay
When the wind blows

and there's a chill in the air
I hope that someone
is taking care of you
i'm alright
yeah, i'm really ok
Just so you know
i'm always there for you
Help me now

Im going down
and i don't know if i'll be ok
I'l be around
I'll be in town
if you need a place to stay
