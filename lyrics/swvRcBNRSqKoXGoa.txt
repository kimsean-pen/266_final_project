Call her thief
Call her shallow and insincere.
'Cause you'll never see just how perfect she could be.
Then she's gone and my friends can come along
and they tell me that I'm happier.
One more fight, yeah, you tell me all the time
How do I swallow my pride?

But she's the one,
she's the one,
but she's the one,
she's the one.

Time and time I hear things that can't be true
and it's only talk cause she'll never be so cruel;
Every night there's a new name on her arm
that I don't think I recognize
and it's never strange just how long she stays away
I guess I'll have to compromise.

Though she's the one,
but she's the one,
but she's the one,
but she's the one.
