I used to wake up and dread what I was doing
I used to tell her that I was going through it
Stay up high homie and you'll get it right
When 4 years pass boy, you'll grow up and be bright

To find the answer I looked at speeding cars
Everyone I ignore thinks I am bizarre
Cut it close girl I'm falling down
Please give me a hand before I give up and drown

I walked up that hill every day
Archy in my ear, Ooz out on replay
Sitting in his room watching, where I stay
Eyes glued to the colors of Raspberry Beret
