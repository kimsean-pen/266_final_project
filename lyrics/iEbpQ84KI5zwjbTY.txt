I've never seen myself before
Spending all my time in promised lands
Our home, the only place I've ever known
I'm not alone
Lionheart, you are the one who had my back from the start
Lionheart, you are the one who had my back from the start
The very start, Lionheart

Over and over and this is how it ends
Time after time my passion never ends
This is where we came from and this is were we met
Faces remembered we'll never forget
Over and over and this is how it ends
Time after time my passion never ends
This is where we came from and this is were we met
Faces remembered we'll never forget

Now is our chance to make a stand
This is the era of the common man
Burn us alive With the fire that's in our eyes
Burn us alive Our bodies end where our souls survive

Over and over and this is how it ends
Time after time my passion never ends
This is where we came from and this is were we met
Faces remembered we'll never forget
Over and over and this is how it ends
Time after time my passion never ends
This is where we came from and this is were we met
Faces remembered we'll never forget
Over and over
Time after time
This is how it ends
