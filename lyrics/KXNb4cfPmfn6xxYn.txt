So good, so right, so good, so right

Sunshine and the rain, pleasure and the pain.
I found a reason not to cry.
colours mesmerize,
how you hypnotize, so good, so right.
Main attraction, so divine, strong reaction, so alive
You're every wish is my command
You look at me, I look at you, nothing more to say,
so good, so right

You make the moon just keep on shining
Colors like the rainbow in the air (so right)
give every cloud a silver lining (so right)
So good, so right,
so good, so right

At last I know it's real, this power I can feel.
Paradise is here for us to see.
main attraction, so divine, strong reaction, so alive,
(so good, so right)

It hurts me, I like it, you're everything to me
Deep inside I know you'll understand
You look at me, I look at you, nothing more to say,
(so good, so right)

You make the moon just keep on shining
Colours like the rainbow in the air (so right)
give every cloud a silver lining
(So right) You make the moon just keep on shining
Colors like the rainbow in the air (so right)
give every cloud a silver lining (so good, so right)
So good, so right,
KEYS
so good, so right
KEYS
So good, so right,

You make the moon just keep on shining
Colours like the rainbow in the air (so right)
give every cloud a silver lining
(So right) You make the moon just keep on shining
Colors like the rainbow in the air (so right)
give every cloud a silver lining (so good, so right)
So good, so right,
So good, so right, so good, so right

(So good, so right, so good, so right)
(So good, so right, so good, so right)
(So good, so right, so good, so right) So good, so right REPEAT X3
