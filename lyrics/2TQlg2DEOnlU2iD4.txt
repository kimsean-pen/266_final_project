I hate being so alone
When everyone I'd know is gone
And they all just leave me like ghosts
Passing through me

I pour my blood into my hands
For just enough attention
I pour my soul into these words
'Cause I feel forgotten

Maybe it's just me and I'm so fucked up
Maybe you can't see that I'm so fucked up
I feel the cold against my heart again
Want to pack up and leave
Wonder if it'll ever end, ever end

Maybe it's just me and I'm so fucked up
Maybe you can't see that I'm so fucked up
Maybe you can't see that I'm so fucked up
