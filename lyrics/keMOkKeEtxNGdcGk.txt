Sun's coming up and I can't decide
To spill my emotions or keep them inside
Go for a drive, go to the store
I'm looking for something that can't be found there
I always wear a smile
Because anything but a smile would make me have to explain
And they wouldn't understand anyway
I conceal my feelings so I won't have to explain
What I can't explain anyway
I can't decide
I can't decide
I can't decide anything
I can't decide
I can't decide
I can't decide anything
Every time I open my mouth
I always wish I had kept it shut I gotta spill my guts
but I don't dare I take a look around
I know that no one else cares
Sun's coming up and I can't decide
To spill my emotions or keep them inside
Go for a drive, go to the store
I'm looking for something that can't be bought there
I always wear a smile
Because anything but a smile would make me have to explain
And they wouldn't understand anyway
I conceal my feelings so I won't have to explain
What I can't explain anyway
I can't decide
I can't decide
I can't decide anything.
