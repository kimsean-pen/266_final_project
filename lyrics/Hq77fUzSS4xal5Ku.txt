Our senses wear out so strike us with lightning.
Let it tear us apart and shake our being. 'Cause everything I see and all that I touch isn't worth believing.
Eventually, the world's gonna end.
We should stop our grieving.
Let it destroy me.
Let it end all suffering.
The world will destroy me.
Our voices will flood rivers and valleys.
The world will destroy me.
I am the mountains crumbling.
