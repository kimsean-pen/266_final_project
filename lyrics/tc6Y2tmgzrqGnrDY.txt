They say that all is fair in love and war
And child believe it
When mama stayed in Saint Tropez
She had a fall or two

And I'm telling it to you straight
So you don't have to hear it in another way

Oh Annie, I'm not your daddy
Oh Annie, I'm not your daddy

They say that out of sight is out of mind
And child believe it
Your mama was in search of love
But all she got was used

And I'm telling it to your face
So you don't have to hear it in another place

Break it to me gently now
Don't forget I'm just a child
Oh Annie, I'm not your daddy
Mama's baby's, papa's baby
Oh Annie, I'm not your daddy
Mama's baby's, papa's baby

See if I was in your blood
Then you wouldn't be so ugly

They say that bliss is made of ignorance
And child believe it
That mama left and not confess
Perhaps I'd love you too

Yes I'm telling it to you straight
So you don't have to hear it in another way

Break it to me gently now
Don't forget I'm just a child
Oh Annie, I'm not your daddy
Mama's baby's papa's baby
Oh Annie, I'm not your daddy
Mama's baby's, papa's baby

See if I was in your blood
Then you wouldn't be so ugly

Oh Annie, I'm not your daddy
Mama's baby's papa's baby
Oh Annie, I'm not your daddy
Mama's baby's, papa's baby

Mama's baby's, papa's baby
Mama's baby's, papa's baby
Mama's baby's, papa's baby
