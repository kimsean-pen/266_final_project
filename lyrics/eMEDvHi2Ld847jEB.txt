Here in the black, there's a feeling of loss, but it's hungry and restless and it's
Looking, desperate for something and it feels like a child but they're screaming all helpless and it's
Absent of mercy, it's alive and it feels with not a shred of compassion or love
It comes like a pouring of evil, it's a stain when the ground is a desolate shadow of fear

It's dark and I'm lost, there's a breath in the wind and the breath is malicious and I
Don't know whether to run or should I drop to my knees and pretend I'm religious because
It's cold and I'm scared and the whispers are invaders and voices a question to God:
Is this real or imagined because if I'm asleep well then I don't need to scream for long

Here in the black, it comes
Here in the black, it comes
Here in the black, it comes for me
Here in the black of lust

It's here and I'm feeling like a thought in the mind but it's beautifully vicious and I
Can't hide, not sure if I want to it crawls into this like a vision of Judas and it's
So close I can feel it and I'm chilled to the bone, I'm a statue in ice but it's
Unsure if it's enough so it waits like a ghost, like a demon assassin of God

Here in the black, it comes
Here in the black, it comes
Here in the black, it comes for me
Here in the black of lust

And all you see is dark and vague
And all you feel is life in vain
And all your hopes just bleed away
And all you are is lost and fades

Here in the black, it comes
Here in the black, it comes
Here in the black, it comes for me
Here in the black of lust
