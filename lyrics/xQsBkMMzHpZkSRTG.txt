She says she's gonna come over tonight
look like a ghost sound like a whisper shivering down my spine
I'm just a traveling soul, say you'd never leave me alone,
tell me you need me so tonight
She come creeping up slow
I got no place, no place to go
but now I'm feeling like I fell for you oh baby, no don't you sell it
Story's always different, no matter who's telling it,
now I'm feeling like I fell for you

Apparition

I know she lurking the streets tonight,
sound like silence, slink like a drifter
'tween the darkness & the flickering light
She's just a wandering soul, oh I can't let it go,
tell me it isn't so tonight

I swear I heard something sneaking through my corridor,
memories loat like specters, keeps on haunting me evermore
