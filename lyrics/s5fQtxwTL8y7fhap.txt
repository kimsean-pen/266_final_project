Watching and waiting for a friend to play with
Why have I been alone so long?
Mole, he is burrowing his way to the sunlight
He knows there's someone there so strong

'Cause here there's lots of room for doing
The things you've always been denied
Look and gather all you want to
There's no one here to stop you trying

Soon you will see me, 'cause I'll be all around you
But where I come from I can't tell
But don't be alarmed by my fields and my forests
They're here for only you to share

'Cause here there's lots of room for doing
The things you've always been denied
So look and gather all you want to
There's no one here to stop you trying

Watching and waiting for someone to understand me
I hope it won't be very long
