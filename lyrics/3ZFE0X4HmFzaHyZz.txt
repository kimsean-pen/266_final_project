I couldn't tell you I'm sorry
I couldn't get the words out right
I had every chance to keep you by my side
Now I'm empty like this bottle
Like this house is gonna be
Packing your suitcase, now I can see
It was right in front of me

(Chorus)
And I'm just drunk enough to tell you exactly what I needed to say
I'm just drunk enough to tell you I need you, please stay
'Cause I'm sober enough to know that maybe it's a little too late
'Cause I'm sober enough to see you walking away

I had a moment of weakness
I hope that you can somehow find
Some forgiveness inside of you in time
I should've held you closer
I should've been there more
I was stupid, I regret it
'Cause now you're walking out the door

(Chorus)
And I'm just drunk enough to tell you exactly what I needed to say
I'm just drunk enough to tell you I need you, please stay
'Cause I'm sober enough to know maybe it's a little too late
'Cause I'm sober enough to see you walking away

Now I'm sorry
I never meant to treat you this way
You're so beautiful and I wasted every chance you gave me
If I could take it all back, you know I would
But I guess I'm too late

Now I'm empty like this bottle
Like this house is gonna be

(Chorus)
And I'm just drunk enough to tell you exactly what I needed to say
I'm just drunk enough to tell you I need you, please stay
'Cause I'm sober enough to know maybe it's a little too late
'Cause I'm sober enough to see you walking away

(Drunk enough to tell you exactly what I needed to say)
Walking away
(Drunk enough to tell you I'm sorry)
Walking away
(Drunk enough to tell you exactly what I needed to say)
'Cause I'm sober enough to see you walking away
