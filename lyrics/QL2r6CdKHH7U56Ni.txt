Sun comes up on this new morning

Shifting shadows, a songbird sings
And if these words could keep you happy
I'd do anything

And if you feel alone, I'll be your shoulder

With a tender touch, you know so well
Somebody once said, it's the soul that matters
Baby who can really tell, when two hearts belong so well
And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun may refuse to shine

But when I say 'I love you'
Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time
Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time
Moon shines down on this good evening
One warm kiss in the cold night air
For this good love I'm receiving
I'll go anywhere, just as long as you are there

And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
When I say 'I love you'
Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time

Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time
Ohh... then on these quiet days
Where souls embrace
So silently
Ohh... the rain may wash away
All these words that young lovers say
And maybe the walls will crumble
And the sun may refuse to shine

But when I say 'I need you'
Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time
Baby, you gotta know

That's for all time
Say that you'll never go
That's for all time
Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time
Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time
Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time
(That's for all time) Don't lie, Don't lie
(That's for all time) Baby, make loving
Say that you'll never go
Baby, you gotta know
