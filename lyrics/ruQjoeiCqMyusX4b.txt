Facing the night, no peace of mind
Barely live again
Blood comes out, I scream and shout
But the pain won't fade away

Yearning for the dawn

Go to hell, you demons
Go to hell, where you belong

One man war against the world
The lone wolf's on the hunt
Bless my rage with a hymn to hate
Suffocate my agony

All is said and done!

Go to hell, you demons
Go to hell, leave me alone

Go to hell, you demons
Go to hell, where you belong
Go to hell, you demons
Go to hell, leave me alone
