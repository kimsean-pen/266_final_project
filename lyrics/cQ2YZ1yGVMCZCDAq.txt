I'm crawling back into the shadow where I've always been.
My life laid out before me why do I pretend I'm screaming out with
all I have and still there's no one
listening, no one hears me struggling.
In the wind the leaves have fallen,
but the fire's still ablaze and there's a
mesmerizing picture, but all you see's the frame.
Do we fight for what we stand for, or is this a losing game?
Here I am, like a ghost amog the men.
And here I stand, I walk alone again.
You talk in whispers but I hear exactly what you say.
There was a time I'd listen now. I'm not afraid.
Behind these empty accusations there's a life
here for me, some day you'll see it's just a name.
In the wind the leaves have fallen,
but the fire's still ablaze and there's a
mesmerizing picture, but all you see's the frame.
Do we fight for what we stand for, or is this a losing game?
Here I am, like a ghost amog the men.
And here I stand, I walk alone again.
I walk alone again.
I walk alone again
I walk alone...
After all I still face this judgement,
but they'll swallow their pride tonight,
and feast on some other soul, yet I still haven't won the fight.
This memory that I've been trapped with, I won't let it all define me.
As the frame starts, to break me away, will I pray for judgement day?
Here I am, like a ghost amog the men.
And here I stand, I walk alone again.
