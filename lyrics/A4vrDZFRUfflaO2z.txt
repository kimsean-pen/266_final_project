Oh, watching me hanging by a string this time
don't, easily, the climax of the perfect lie
Oh, watching me hanging by a string this time
Don't, easily, smile worth a hundred lies

If there's lessons to be learned
I'd rather get my jamming words in first
So tell you something that I've found
That the worlds a better place when it's upside down, boy

If there's lessons to be learned
I'd rather get my jamming words in first
So when you're playing with desire
Don't come running to my place when it burns like fire, boy

Sweet about me, nothing sweet about me, yeah
Sweet about me, nothing sweet about me, yeah
Sweet about me, nothing sweet about me, yeah
Sweet about me, nothing sweet about me, yeah

...
Blue, blue, blue waves
They crash as time goes by, so hard to catch
Too, too smooth, ain't all that

Why don't you ride on my side of the tracks
If there's lessons to be learned
I'd rather get my jamming words in first
So tell you something that I've found

That the worlds a better place when it's upside down, boy
If there's lessons to be learned
I'd rather get my jamming words in first
So when you're playing with desire

Don't come running to my place when it burns like fire, boy
Sweet about me, nothing sweet about me, yeah
Sweet about me, nothing sweet about me, yeah
Sweet about me, nothing sweet about me, yeah
Sweet about me, nothing sweet about me, yeah
Sweet about me, nothing sweet about me, yeah
Sweet about me, nothing sweet about me, yeah
