I'm coming in now to shake your hand
'Cause baby we get off, get off, get off
It could be a real love, it's you
Oh, and everyone around don't seem I feel now
I know you feel the way I do
'Cause there ain't nobody else just like I feel
And there ain't nothing you can do
Hope you feel the way I feel too
That could be you running through my head
'Cause baby I haven't seen it like this before
It could be a real love, it's you
Oh, and everyone around don't seem I feel now
I know you feel the way I do
'Cause there ain't nobody else just like I feel
And there ain't nothing you can do
Hope you feel the way I feel too

'Cause there ain't nobody else just like I feel
And there ain't nothing you can do
Hope you feel the way I feel too

I know you feel the way I do
'Cause there ain't nobody else just like I feel
And there ain't nothing you can do
Hope you feel the way I feel too

'Cause there ain't nobody else just like I feel
And there ain't nothing you can do
Hope you feel the way I feel too
