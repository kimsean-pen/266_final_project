Rush
Pull me under
The world is at my feet and it's no wonder

Your eyes speak to me, they tell me be calm
They tell me be strong
Swimming out so deep, now I can't breathe
And it's exactly where I belong

'Cause it feels like a run of a lifetime
And nothing's gonna save us now
Let the waves come crashing down

'Cause it feels like I'm right for the first time
And everytime I take you in
I think my heart skip a beat again

I'm drowning in your love
'Cause I'm drowning in your love

Love
It's taking over
There is no inbetween 'till I find me some cover
Oho

The tide is coming, I don't know if I can take it
I lose my focus, lose my focus
With every breath I feel my inhibition breaking
I can't control it, no, no, no

'Cause it feels like a ride of a lifetime
And nothing's gonna save us now
Let the waves come crashing down

'Cause it feels like I'm right for the first time
And everytime I take you in
I think my heart skip a beat again

I'm drowning in your love
