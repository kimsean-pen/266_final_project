I don't wanna be the filler if the void is solely yours
I don't wanna be your glass of single malt whiskey
Hidden in the bottom drawer and
I don't want to be a bandage if the wound is not mine
Lend me some fresh air, ah

I don't wanna be adored for what I merely represent to you
An' I don't wanna be your babysitter, you're a very big boy now
I don't wanna be your mother
I didn't carry you in my womb for nine months
Show me the back door

Visitin' hours are nine to five and if I show up at ten past six
Well I already know that you'd find some way to sneak me in
And oh mind the empty bottle with the holes along the bottom
You see it's too much to ask for and I am not the doctor
Oh, oh am not the, oh

I don't wanna be the sweeper of the eggshells that you walk upon
And I don't wanna be your other half I believe that one and one make two
I don't wanna be your food or the light from the fridge
On your face at midnight, hey what are you hungry for?

I don't wanna be the glue that holds your pieces together
I don't wanna be your idol
See this pedestal is high and I'm afraid of heights
I don't wanna be lived through a vicarious occasion
Please open the window

Visitin' hours are nine to five and if I show up at ten past six
Well I already know that you'd find some way to sneak me in
And oh mind the empty bottle with the holes along the bottom
You see it's too much to ask for and I am not the doctor
Oh, oh I am not the, oh

I don't wanna live on someday when my motto is last week
And I, I don't wanna be responsible for your fractured heart
And it's wounded beat
An' I don't wanna be a substitute for the smoke you've been inhalin'
Well, what do you think me, what do you think me for?

Visitin' hours are nine to five and if I show up at ten past six
Well I already know that you'd find some way to sneak me in
And oh mind the empty bottle with the holes along the bottom
You see it's too much to ask for and I am not the doctor
Oh, oh I am not the, I
