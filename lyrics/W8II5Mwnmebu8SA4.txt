Been runnin' now, runnin' so smoothly
We'll never slow down
Been thinkin' now, thinking down on one knee
Time to say it out loud

When you love so good
Wanna give you every hour
If you said you could
I would give you all the power

But would you pay my rent?
Would you pay my rent?
Would you, would you, would you get your love well spent?
Would you pay my rent?
Would you, would you, would you, would you pay my rent?

I'll never say never to your wishes
I'll never let you fall
You always know, always know I'm with it
I'm always on call

When you love so good (love so good)
Wanna give you every hour
If you said you could (said you could)
I would give you all the power

But would you pay my rent?
Would you pay my rent?
Would you, would you, would you get your love well spent?
Would you pay my rent?
Would you, would you, would you...

How can you love me right, love me right
If you don't get your money right
Love me right, love me right
If you don't get your money
Love me right, love me right
If you don't get your money right
Love me right, love me right
If you don't get your money
Love me right, love me right
If you don't get your money right
(You gotta get your money right girl)
Love me right, love me right
If you don't get your money right

When you love so good
Wanna give you every hour
If you said you could
I would give you all the power

But would you pay my rent?
Would you pay my rent?
Would you, would you, would you get your love well spent?
Would you pay my rent?
Would you, would you, would you...

How can you love me right, love me right
If you don't get your money right
Love me right, love me right
If you don't get your money
Love me right, love me right
If you don't get your money right
Love me right, love me right
If you don't get your...

Would you pay my rent?
