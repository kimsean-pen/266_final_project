Queue the soft recordings
Float through dreams and still
Be a soft kind of prison
Jail vows unfulfilled
Drink a soft kind prison
Jail vows unfulfilled
Breathe a soft kind of prison
Jail vows unfulfilled

Freedom, a state of mind
Sold to wandering eyes
Substances controlled
To protect the mind
Substances controlled
To protect the mind
Substances controlled
To protect the mind
Substances controlled
To protect the mind
Substances controlled
To protect the mind

One did offer itself to unravel every inch
Shall we report each instant
Experience so real

Got no taste of success
Love fulfills unrest
Becoming our Earth
Skin covered in dirt
Becoming our Earth
Skin covered in dirt
Becoming our Earth
Skin covered in dirt
Skin covered in dirt
Skin covered in dirt
Skin covered in dirt
Covered in dirt, covered in dirt

Rain, bridge a nasty wall
Why do you feel so off?
First, where's the water source in each breath, each fall?
