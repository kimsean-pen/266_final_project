On the limb cut down in the middle of the night caught in a trap
Cursed by the crown of the wandering man who was never coming back
Stuck on the line spinning all of his time with his back to the throne
With the flash of the round everybody in town said leave me alone

Just like a reverend, like a reverend on the radio
Your heart will never say so
Your heart will never let you go
Just like a reverend, like a reverend on the radio
My heart will never say so
My heart will never let you go

I got caught in the middle of a hurricane fight facing the ground
Beast to the wild with the porcelain smile as it passes around
The truth in the skies from the billowing eyes isn't working on me
Don't you think you gotta give me
Give me something I want
Give me something I need

Just like a reverend, like a reverend on the radio
Your heart will never say so
Your heart will never let you go
Just like a reverend, like a reverend on the radio
My heart will never say so
My heart will never let you go

Just like a reverend, like a reverend on the radio
Your heart will never say so
Your heart will never let you go
Just like a reverend, like a reverend on the radio
My heart will never say so
My heart will never let you go

Just like a reverend, like a reverend on the radio
My heart will never say so
My heart will never let you go
