I... like the things that you hate
And you... hate the things that I like
But it hurts
Honestys your church
But sometimes
It's better to lie

I... am the vinegar and salt
And you... are the oil that dissolves
My frustration
Honestys limitation

But sometimes
It's better to lie
But sometimes
It's better to lie...

I am the vinegar and salt
And you are the oil that dissolves my frustrations
Limitations
But sometimes...
I don't dare to ask why
