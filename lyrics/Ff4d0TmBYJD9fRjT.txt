Well I've seen the midnight eyes when I'm at rest and when I'm dreaming
Those midnight wheels are turning all the time and the way they work is to wear me down
Until you come back around
Until you find another hand drown

Oh the midnight wheels
Oh the midnight wheels
They were running all the time
They were running all the time

Well I've seen the midnight eyes when I'm at rest and when I'm dreaming
Those midnight wheels are running all the time and the ground pass fast on their fleeting way
Until you come back to stay
Better find another hand to stray

Oh the midnight wheels
Oh the midnight wheels
They were turning all the time
They were turning all the time
