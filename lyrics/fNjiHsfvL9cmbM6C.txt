If you're taking a bite (*)
At the speed of light
You're shaking your heads to the band
There's a dare on your horse
But you're not on the force
We're taking this think to the ground

In the heat of the night (**)
When you're fists are alight
Touching temples of steel
And your body's on fire
About to expire
But you don't feel the pressure of pain

Pull your head back (***)
Hold your hands high
Shake your body
And it's too loud
And you put them up fill your heads
With heavy metal thunder
Heavy metal thunder

On the wings of an eagle (****)
You're hoping to fly
Holding your hands to the sky
On a blue sea of venom
You turn to the band with
Your banners and skirts blowing high

If you think something more (*****)
You'll come down to the front
Then you'll do as they say
Where an army of cars
Are surrounded by lights
Turning my face to the ground
Nobody stands in our way

(Repeat *** twice)
(Repeat *)
(Repeat **)
(Repeat ***)
(Repeat ****)
(Repeat *****)
