Baby lion goes
Where the islands go
Baby lion goes
Where the islands go
Baby lion
I-I-I-I

Gone were remains that long to lose sad
Better unsaid
Always turn, oh
And the alibi ring
The center's worse, too
Closer is the time
And the answer is
And it's all
Ending
Darkness

Answers me, to me
Answers me, to me
Answers me, to me
Answers me, to me
Answers me, to me
Answers me, to me
