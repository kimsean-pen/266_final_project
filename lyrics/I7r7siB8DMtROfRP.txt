I know you've tried your best
But that's not good enough for me
Understand, nevertheless
Love's gotta go both ways
Well, you push me to the left
And then you push me to the right
But you gotta meet me in the middle
If you wanna make things right
(But you gotta believe)
So here it is

I wanna help you out, tell you, what it's all about
What I feel, what I need, how's it gonna be
So what you wanna do, what you really wanna do
'Cause I've decided everything I gonna want from you

One sided love is never gonna work
So let me tell you something that' I'm sure you've never heard of
Tender love and care, in case you're unaware
So I tell you what, let me tell you where it's at
Hit me with your best shot

I'm giving you a second chance
But you gotta understand
If you don't know how to love me
I will find someone who can
So read my lips for the last time
I tell you now with no regret
If you don't get your act together
Even your name I will forget, yeah, yeah, yeah
(But you gotta believe)
So here it is

I wanna help you out, tell you, what it's all about
What I feel, what I need, how's it gonna be
So what you wanna do, what you really wanna do
'Cause I've decided everything I'm gonna want from you

One sided love is never gonna work
One sided love is never gonna work

One sided love is never gonna work
So let me tell you something that' I'm sure you've never heard of
Tender love and care, in case you're unaware
So I tell you what, let me tell you where it's at
Hit me with your best shot
Yeah yeah yeah

Hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Hit me, hit me, hit me
Hit me with your best shot
Yeah yeah yeah
One sided love

One sided love is never gonna work
So let me tell you something that' I'm sure you've never heard of
Tender love and care, in case you're unaware
So I tell you what, let me tell you where it's at, oh baby

One sided love is never gonna work
So let me tell you something that' I'm sure you've never heard of
