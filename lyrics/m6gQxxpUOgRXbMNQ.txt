Touch me on the inside
With a finger full of gravy
Gonna get you on the sofa, lady
Wanna shake and bake me

Bucket full of blood, got you on my mind
Gonna break my face on the sweet sunshine
Bucket full of blood, got you on my mind
Gonna break my face on the sweet sunshine

I wanna get up off the floor
I wanna run to the devil and get me some more
I wanna get up off the floor
I wanna run to the devil and get me some more

Bottle full of pain
With a hog's head screaming
With a scumbag soul
And a body always screaming

Grab your wine, tell me where you been
With a firing pan and the moon gettin' thin
Grab your wine, tell me where you been
With a violent feeling and the moon gettin' thin

I wanna climb up on the wall
I wanna swing through the city on a wreckin' ball
I wanna climb up on the wall
I wanna swing through the city on a wreckin' ball

Hail to the dawning
Of the plentiful sensation
Cosmic time and full of sound
And I killed my imagination

Bucket full of blood, got you on my mind
Gonna break my face on the sweet sunshine
Bucket full of blood, got you on my mind
Gonna break my face on the sweet sunshine

I wanna get up off the floor
I wanna run to the devil and get me some more
I wanna get up off the floor
I wanna run to the devil and get me some more
