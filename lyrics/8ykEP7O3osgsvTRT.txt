It's a bit of a pain
to be where I am
It's a bit of a pain
to be what I am

But it's all right with
But it's all right with
But it's all right with me

Who is satisfied?
Who wouldn't sell his mind?
Who is satisfied?
Who wouldn't sell his mind?
Who can really say?

Yes it's all right with
Yes it's all right with
Yes it's all right with me
