Oh oh
Oh oh

You're pushing me away from you
And there's nothing I can do
And I can't fight all of your battles for you

You're pushing me away from you
Oh and I know what I'll do
I'll hop the fence
So I can get out of this mess

Ooooh
Oh Ooooh

What's going through your mind?

You're pushing me away from you
And there's nothing I can do
And I can't fight all of your battles for you

You're pushing me away from you
Oh and I know what I'll do
Yeah, I know what I'll do
I know what I'll do

I'll get you out of my mind
I'll get you out of my mind
I'll get you out of my mind
Get you out of my mind

Shh!

Ooooh
Ooooh

You're pushing me away from you
And there's nothing I can do
And I can't fight all of your battles for you

You're pushing me away from you
Oh yeah, I know what I'll do

I'll get you right
Pick you up right
I'll get you right
Pick you up right
I'll get you right
Pick you up right
On time
