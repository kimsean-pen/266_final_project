You are the snake, get around me
Well there came one rain
Never seen what raining

So I just could lead the way
There's nowhere to ride around me
No one around, it's amazing
Elevating as it seems

But wait, never mind
Never come out
Where to ride when it's raining?
You were mine

So I'm with you baby
You where you play or else yea baby
You were mine, yeah baby
You were right

So I'm with you baby
You were more, I seen no more
You were right to enslave me
I think you would've made it

So I just could lead the way
There's nowhere to ride around me
No one around, it's amazing
Elevating as it seems

But no, never mind
Never come out
Where to ride when it's raining?
You were mine

Where to ride when it's raining?
Well it's raining
Where to ride, where to ride, yeah, oh
Where to ride when it's raining?
Well it's raining, yes
