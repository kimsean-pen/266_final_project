I took you by the hand,
And said that I was sure
I just couldn't stay here
The world is calling me
And I don't even know
How to take it from here
How did we get here?

It's too much, too much all at once
I wish that I was strong enough
But I can only fight one war at a time

So I'll fly
I wasn't meant for the ground
I won't hide
'Cause I was meant to be found
And I'll try
To run high
On a tightrope
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oooh

You say you don't know
Why we even started
Just to let it disappear like this
But when everything is changing
All that I can hold on to
Are memories
Oh, how did we get here?

It's too much, too much all at once
I wishing that having you was enough
But I can't be tied if I'm chasing the sky

So I'll fly
I wasn't meant for the ground
I won't hide
'Cause I was meant to be found
On a tight
On a tightrope

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oooh
On a tightrope
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oooh

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oooh
On a tightrope
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oooh

So I'll fly
I wasn't meant for the ground
I won't hide
'Cause I was meant to be found
On a tight
On a tightrope

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oooh
Took you by the hand, I took by the hand, I
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oooh
Took you by the hand, t-took by the hand, I

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oooh
Took you by the hand, I took by the hand, I
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oooh
Took you by the hand, t-took by the hand, I
