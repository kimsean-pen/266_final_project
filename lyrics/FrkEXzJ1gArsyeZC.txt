Why do they not believe?
I have not lied, even for this
Now no-one can conceive
The lie becomes the loving kiss

But I would not fall in love like this
I would not fall in love like this

The women stitch the shrouds
The children murder all the world
If only you believe
Then only you will die

How can you not see the stars in your eyes?
How can you not see the stars in your eyes?

Sacrifice, sacrifice
Sacrifice, sacrifice
Sacrifice, pay the price
Cold as ice, sacrifice

The pain is on you now
Do not consider flight for gain
In you the poison breeds
Crawling with the mark of Cain

And no-one shall set you free again
And no-one shall set you free again

Sacrifice, sacrifice
Sacrifice, sacrifice
Sacrifice, sacrifice
Sacrifice, sacrifice
