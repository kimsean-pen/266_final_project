Tall buildings soakin' in rain
Gotta get myself back on the train
so I can go home, go home, oh

I can't wait to kick off my shoes,
strip outta this suit,
crash on the couch and
relax my heavy mind relax my heavy eyes
And if someone decides to call
I'ma reject it and turn it off, uh huh uh

PC: Don't break my peace I want serenity

C: Heavy mind (rest yo heavy mind)
Heavy eyes (rest yo heavy eyes)
Heavy mind (rest yo heavy mind)
Heavy eyes (rest yo heavy eyes)

V: There ain't nothin' like time alone
Gonna listen to the breath of my own
Inhale easy, gon' feel good to
get in to the steam of a shower,
the chill of my room the warm of my bed to
relax my heavy mind relax my heavy eyes
And if my girls knock on the door (uh uh uh yea-ah)
I'ma ignore it and go back to sleep, yeah

PC: Don't break my peace I want serenity

C: Heavy mind (rest yo heavy mind)
Heavy eyes (rest yo heavy eyes)
Heavy mind (rest yo heavy mind)
Heavy eyes (rest yo heavy eyes)

B: I'm tired of people tellin' me what to do (uh uh uh)
I'm tired of people tellin' me what to do (uh uh uh)
I'm tired of people tellin' me what to do (uh uh uh)
See I just wanna go up to my room and

(Relax) Relax
(Relax) Relax
(Relax) Relax my heavy mind
(Relax) Relax
(Relax) Relax
(Relax) Relax my heavy eyes

O: (Rest yo heavy mind rest yo heavy eyes) Relax my heavy eyes
(Rest yo heavy mind rest yo heavy eyes) Relax my heavy eyes
(Rest yo heavy mind rest yo heavy eyes) Relax my heavy eyes
(Rest yo heavy mind rest yo heavy eyes) Relax my heavy eyes
