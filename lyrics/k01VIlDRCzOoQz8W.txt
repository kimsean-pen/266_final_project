Back, get back aah

This is a very interesting situation
I sense a gradual loss of communication
Don't you think I can see
You're changing on me

You're heading into a completely new direction
And I am having trouble making the adaptation
Don't you think I can see
You're changing on me

Let's get back together
Let's get back forever
Let's get back together
Let's get back
Let's get back together
Let's get back forever
Let's get back together
Let's get back

If I may be so bold by making a suggestion
Please ask yourself why you are making this transition
Don't you think I can see
You're changing on me

Every time I think of us I just want to make it how it was
Before we had much more
When I think of me and you I just can't believe that we are through
I can't ignore the fact you closed the door

When I think back, we had a beautiful relationship
But I see the future, what's there for me is devastation from you
Don't you think I can see
You're changing on me

Let's get back together
Let's get back forever
Let's get back together
Let's get back
Let's get back together
Let's get back forever
Let's get back together
Let's get back

Back together
Back together
Back together

Every time I think of us I just want to make it how it was
Ah before we had much more
When I think of me and you I just can't believe that we are through
I can't ignore the fact you closed the door

Don't you think I can see
Don't you think I can see, yeah
Don't you think I can see
You're changing

Get on back, get on back
Get on back, get on back
Get on back, get on back
Get on back, get on back
Get on back, get on back
Get on back, get on back to
I wanna get back
