On the beach in Hawaii

I wish you were here with me
walking on the beach in Hawaii
playing on the golden sand
looking at the ocean now I understand
love is like the open sea
and I wish you were here with me
on the beach in Hawaii

Since you've been gone away
I think about you everyday
don't you know I miss you much
and you know I need your touch
I'm on a rocky cliff
oh I wish you were here with me
on the beach in Hawaii

A little pakalolo
and I say mahalo
ujjayi breathing
to get a real feeling
yogi gonna let you know
that I wish you were here with me
on the beach in Hawaii
in Hawaii
