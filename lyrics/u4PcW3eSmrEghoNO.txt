It's not going to be a hit
So why even bother with it?
It's not going to be a hit
So why even bother with it?
Just lay it down and forget about it
Lay it down fast, forget about it
I'll never be a rock and roll saint
I'll never be a rock and roll saint
'Cause I can't sing, oh no, I can't sing
That's not the only reason
That's not the only reason
I'll never be a bowie
I'll never be an eno
I'll never be a bowie
I'll never be an eno
I'll only ever be a gary numan
I'll never be a rock and roll saint
