What if this storm ends?

And I don't see you
As you are now
Ever again
The perfect halo

Of gold hair and lightning
Sets you off against
The planet's last dance
Just for a minute

The silver forked sky
Lit you up like a star
That I will follow
Now it's found us

Like I have found you
I don't want to run
Just overwhelm me
What if this storm ends?

And leaves us nothing
Except a memory
A distant echo
I want pinned down

I want unsettled
Rattle cage after cage
Until my blood boils
I want to see you

As you are now
Every single day
That I am living
Painted in flames

All peeling thunder
Be the lightning in me
That strikes relentless
What if this storm ends?

And I don't see you

As you are now
Ever again
The perfect halo
Of gold hair and lightning
Sets you off against
The planet's last dance
Just for a minute
The silver forked sky
Lit you up like a star
That I will follow
Now it's found us
Like I have found you
I don't want to run
Just overwhelm me
