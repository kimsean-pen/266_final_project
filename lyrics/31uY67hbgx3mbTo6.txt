I don't want to see it coming closer
I can't take another word about her
Send me back to another place
Show me how I can make this way
No, I don't really wanna see it
See it take control of me
No, I don't really wanna see it
See you make a fool out of me!

I can tell that this is getting hotter
My mind's on hold,
But you're just getting stronger!
So tell me tell me tell me does it hurt in a different way?
All this time I've been told nothing
But I've just passed a day â€" my way!
No, I don't really wanna see it
See it take control of me
No, I don't really wanna see it
See you make a fool out of me!

No, I don't really wanna see it
See it take control of me
No, I don't really wanna see it
See you make a fool out of me!
