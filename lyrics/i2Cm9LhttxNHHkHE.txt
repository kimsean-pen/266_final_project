While, i, look at the moon ... alone i look out under moonlight
From in my windy tower ... from in my white and windy tower
Ye bide no moment and await no hour,
But go with solemn song and harpers tune

Through the darkest night ... through darkest night and shadow seashores
To the distant trees, the trees that brought the light to valar
Whose fruit and flower are the moon and sun,
Where light of earth is ended and begun.

Here only comes at whiles a wind to blow
Returning now down ... down the way ye go,
With perfume place, and places of unearthly trees ... of unearthly trees

Here only long ... afar through window pane
I glimpse the sound of the golden rain
that falls now down ... for ever on the outer seas ... on the outer seas.

Ir in-elenath gwennin
I' il thinna, i amar u-dartha
Am man darthon, a linnon
Nu galad hen fireb?

(When the starry host has departed
The star fades, the world does not wait
Why do i linger and sing
Under this fading mortal light?)
