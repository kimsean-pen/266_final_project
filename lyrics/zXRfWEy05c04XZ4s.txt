You watch me waste away

I know what it feels like to come undone
To wake up early
To numb myself
To throw up blood
To hide the sun

You watch me waste away
You watch me waste away
And I wonder
How you sleep at night?
How you close your eyes?
Are you still alive?

I've made mistakes
Never told the truth
I've been down and out
Falling away from you

I suffocate myself
A lifetime living in this hell
To numb myself
To hide the sun

You watch me waste away
You watch me waste away
And I wonder
How you sleep at night?
How you close your eyes?
Are you still alive?

To wake up early
To numb myself
To throw up blood
To hide the sun
Suffocation - This will be my end
