You, do you remember me?
Like I remember you
Do you spend your life going back in your mind to that time?

'Cause I, I walked the streets alone
I hate being on my own
And everyone can see that I really fell
And I'm going through hell
Thinking 'bout you with somebody else

Somebody wants you
Somebody needs you
Somebody dreams about you every single night

Somebody can't breathe, without you it's lonely
Somebody hopes that one day you will see
That somebody's me
That somebody's me, yeah

How? How did we go wrong?
It was so good, and now it's gone
And I pray at night that our paths soon will cross
And what we had isn't lost
'Cause you're always right here in my thoughts

Somebody wants you
Somebody needs you
Somebody dreams about you every single night

Somebody can't breathe, without you it's lonely
Somebody hopes that someday you will see
That somebody's me, oh, yeah

You'll always be in my life
Even if I'm not in your life
'Cause you're in my memory

You, when you remember me
And before you set me free
Oh, listen, please

Somebody wants you
Somebody needs you
Somebody dreams about you every single night

Somebody can't breathe, without you it's lonely
Somebody hopes that someday you will see

That somebody's me
That somebody's me
That somebody's me
That somebody's me, oh, yeah
