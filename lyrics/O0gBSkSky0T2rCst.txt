If you have ghosts then you have everything
If you have ghosts then you have everything
You can say anything you want
And you can do anything you want
If you have ghosts then you have everything

Wine never does that
Wine never does that
If you call it, surprised where it is
The moon to the left of me
Is a part of my thoughts
Is a part of me
Is me
Wine never does that

In the night I am real
In the night I am real
The moon to the left of me
Is a part of my thoughts
Is a part of me
Is me
Forever is the wind
Is a part of my thoughts
Is a part of me
Is me
In the night I am real

I don't want my fangs too long
I don't want my fangs too long
The moon to the left of me
Is a part of my thoughts
Is a part of me
Is me
Forever is the wind
Is a part of my thoughts
Is a part of me
Is me
I don't want my fangs too long

If you have ghosts then you have everything
If you have ghosts then you have everything
If you have ghosts then you have everything
If you have ghosts then you have everything
