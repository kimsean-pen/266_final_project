Whenever times get tough
And you feel you're broken down
It gets a little easier the second time around
When you feel like you are ready
To get down on your knees and pray
When will this get better? I won't last another day

Count 1, 2, 3, 4
Give me just a little strength
Life is a riddle, I'm stuck in the middle
With no one else to blame

And when the sun goes down tonight
That's when I know it seems there ain't no end in sight
And when there's nowhere left to run
Live for today, 'cause tomorrow may never come

When you're all alone and standing
In that dark and crowded room
There's someone out there who's singing the same sad tune
Well, there's hope in there somewhere
You got questions on your mind
How long will I be waiting? Hope is so hard to find

Count 1, 2, 3, 4
Give me just a little strength
Life is a riddle, I'm stuck in the middle
With no one else to blame

And when the sun goes down tonight
That's when I know it seems there ain't no end in sight
And when there's nowhere left to run
Live for today, 'cause tomorrow may never come
Yeah, tomorrow may never come

Whenever times get tough
And you feel you're broken down
It gets a little easier the second time around
When you feel like you are ready
To get down on your knees and pray
When will this get better? I won't last another day

Count 1, 2, 3, 4
Give me just a little strength
Life is a riddle, I'm stuck in the middle
With no one else to blame

And when the sun goes down tonight
That's when I know it seems there ain't no end in sight
And when there's nowhere left to run
Live for today, 'cause tomorrow may never come
