It's so nice to get
Get away for a day
I see a hollow man gun in hand
Gun in hands it points my way
He follows me everywhere and everyday
I got to get away
I won't miss him if he goes away and stays away

Just a hunter for the devil
Hollow man hollow man hollow man
Just a hunter for the devil
Hollow man
Hollow man
Hollow man

It's so nice to get
Get away for a day
I see a hollow man gun in hand
Gun in hands it points my way
You know he follows me everywhere and everyday
I got to get away
I won't miss him if he goes away and stays away

Just a hunter for the devil
Hollow man hollow man hollow man
Just a hunter for the devil
Hollow man
Hollow man

Just a hunter for the devil
Hollow man hollow man hollow man
Just a hunter for the devil
Hollow man
