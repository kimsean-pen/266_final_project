All my friends are, they're on vacation
But I'm just stuck here in this parking lot
Well, looking for a mirror, I'm looking at a screen
These pixelated dreams are blowing up my pocket
I'll find some action, and cut the scene
I'm on a merry-go-round, I'm in a washing machine
Just spinning

All of my friends, they don't do any favors
Unless they're partying, then they got all of 'em
All of my friends, they blow all of the paycheck
They got no money, because they're dumb and reckless

I love my friends, I love my friends
We got each other, don't need no others
I love my friends, I love my friends
We're a disaster, yeah you know it's true

We love being caught up in the action
Eating fire and smoke
It's so pleasing to go crashing all alone
You know it's nothing new, yeah we've been here before
But let's take it to my house 'cause I know I want more

All of my friends, they're crawling on the weekend
Looking for something 'cause there's nothing to do
All of my friends, they always end up leaving
For something better when it's time to cruise

I love my friends, I love my friends
We got each other, don't need no others
I love my friends, I love my friends
We're a disaster, yeah you know it's true

Pull up on Thursday, will make you do again
Even though the days feel long and the nights feel just the same
Well I believe that forced a drink and the stars stay satisfied
To live in a safer place where there's peaceful paradise

I love my friends, I love my friends
We're a disaster, yeah you know it's true
We're a disaster
We're a disaster, yeah you know it's true
We're a disaster
We're a disaster, yeah you know it's true
