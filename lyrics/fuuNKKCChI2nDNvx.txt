Gagged and tied you wake Seems real to me,
not just a dream Skin shed from the bloody tightened knots Vomiting
from the gas soaked gag Beaten unconscious when The trunk is opened
Woken up by a shovel against your head Decimated Pain, anguish,
torment, despair A touch of what this man has created Pain, anguish,
torment, despair Soon this fuckers six feet deep Asked to make his
plea Mouth un-gagged he screams Thrown to the ground as I hack his
face Still alive he begs to me Kicked into his tomb he screams to God
His empty prayers will fall upon the deaf Decimated Decimated -
eternal pain Decimated - from bone to dust Decimated - your life is
mine Kicked into his tomb he screams to god His empty prayers won't
save you now Decimated - eternal pain Decimated - from bone to dust
Decimated -your life is mine Kicked into his tomb he screams to god
His empty prayers will fail you now Stripped to flesh and bone,
this beast, this worthless human Six feet deep
he's begging now for his life Handed the shovel to dig.
The dig, for his forever' Six feet deep are the measurements given
Beaten to the point of death, he bleeds,
but fully conscious Six feet deep he's begging now for his life

Legs lie stiff.
Still bound, cannot move I fill the dig shovel by shovel "
Fuck you!" is my answer He deserves even worse Buried alive
the only way that seems fit Pain, anguish, torment, despair "
Help me God I'm better than this" Pain, anguish, torment,
despair A final breath before you're shoveled over Legs lie
stiff, still bound, cannot move I fill the dig shovel by shovel "
Fuck you!" is my answer He deserves even worse Buried alive the only
way that seems fit Decimated - I fill the dig shovel by shovel
Decimated - soon this motherfuckers six feet deep Decimated - I fill
the dig shovel by shovel Decimated -
soon this motherfuckers Six feet deeper
