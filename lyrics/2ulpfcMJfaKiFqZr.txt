Johnny' s always runnin' around
Tryin' to find certainty
He needs all the world to confirm
That he ain't lonely
Mary counts the walls
Knows he tires easily

Johnny thinks the world would be right
If it could buy the truth from him
Mary says
"He changes his mind more than a woman"
But she made her bed
Even when the chance was slim

Johnny says, "He's willing to learn
When he decides, he's a fool"
Johnny says, "He'll live anywhere
When he earns time to"
Mary combs her hair
Says, "She should be used to it"

Mary always hedges her bets
She never knows what to think
She says that he still acts
Like he is bein' discovered
Scared that he'll be caught
Without a second thought

Runnin' around...

Johnny feels he's wasting his breath
Tryin' to talk sense to her
Mary says, "He's lackin' a real
Sense of proportion"
So she combs her hair
Knows he tires easily
Johnny's always runnin' around
Tryin' to find certainty
He needs all the world to confirm
That he ain't lonely
Mary counts the walls
Says, "She should be used to it"
Johnny' s always runnin' around...

Runnin' around...
