Said, I looked really down
That I ought a come over and talk about it

On my TV screen
Tellin' us all that it's alright because
She wears this, and he said that
And if you get some of these, it'll all be alright
Yeah, if you get some of these, it'll all be alright

Well, I refuse to be a cynical goon
Passing the masses an easy answer
'Cause it won't be alright
Oh no, it won't be alright

You know, you could have it so much better
