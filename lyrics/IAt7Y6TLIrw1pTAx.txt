Oh yeah, Oh yeah
Would you believe me if I told you
Will you believe me when I say
Affairs of the heart
Together we've grown

If ever apart
All I want you to know
Is your love is life changing
And I couldn't be the same without you darling
Your love is life saving
you always catch me when I fall

When the tourbus drop off and all light lock off
And I'm a mere mortal again ...
Promoter belly full and all the fans gone home

I'm glad that you're more than a friend
woman your love is life changing
And I couldn't be the same without you dahling
Your love is life saving
you always catch me when I fall
Its People just like you and you will pass them in the traffic

that never fall in love and so mi haffi seh mi lucky
nuff of them nuh fortunate enough to have somebody
some just cannot see beyond di flesh and its so funny
Never get too caught up in yuhself to feel the magic
True love come and pass you by your life it is so tragic
opportunity is scarce so tek while you have it, no wait til you ah panic

Well the last man yuh deh wid mek ah big mistake
Lef and gone fi good and miss out something weh great
loyal and full of faith when nuff ah dem ah move fake
our things separate we cant separate
cuz i would miss you baby
and i cant do without you dahling

yes and i would miss you baby
girl you know i love you bad
Affairs of the heart

Together we've grown
If things fall apart
All I want you to know
Woman your love is life changing
And I wouldn't be the same without you dahling

Your love is life saving
you always catch me when I fall
(Guitar)

When I'm away is like my songs are waste cause you are not near to hear me
If I lost my way I know I'd be ok cause you'd be there to care me
And woman I can see tings clearly
yuh genuine because yuh love sincerely
you never let me down not even nearly
not even barely girl you know I love you bad

some see the laughter and don't see the tears
Some see the courage and don't see the fear
some for themselves and they don't intend to share

Some say I love and only pretend to care
Well nuff of them are just miss congeniality
Dem pretty face and dem nah face reality
Well them are quantity Woman you ah quality
girl you know I love you bad
Affairs of the heart
Together we've grown
If ever apart
All I want you to know
Is your love is life changing
I couldn't be the same without you dahling
Your love is life saving
you always catch me when I fall
