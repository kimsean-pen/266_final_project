When a menthol hit
Hooks a spatial girl in her summer clothes
Like a transmission
On an empty channel all lines are closed

Taking photographs
Speaking slowly through the permanent waves
The taste in her mouth
That she read about earlier today

This is happening for your pleasure at your leisure
Use your evil when you want

When a menthol hit
Hooks a spatial girl in her summer clothes
Like a transmission
On an empty channel all lines are closed

Taking photographs
Speaking slowly through the permanent waves
The taste in her mouth
That she read about earlier today

This is happening for your pleasure at your leisure
Use your evil when you want

This is happening for your pleasure at your leisure
Use your evil when you want

When the night becomes
Automatic sequence joining the day
Singing something new
Someone else is sliding into your way

When a menthol hit
Hooks a spatial girl in her summer clothes
Like a transmission
On an empty channel all lines are closed

Get you off my conscience by Friday
On Saturday I'll be wide awake
On Sunday I'm your new best friend
On Monday learn it all again

For your pleasure at your leisure
Use your evil when you want

This is happening for your pleasure at your leisure
Use your evil when you want
