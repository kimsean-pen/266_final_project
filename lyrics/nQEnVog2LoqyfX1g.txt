Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time

I hurt myself again
along with all my friends
Feels like it never ends
here comes the night again

Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time

You hurt yourself again
along with all your friends
Feels like it never ends
here comes the night again

Here comes the night time
coming on slow
Here comes the night time
I know that you know

Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time

Well
I hurt myself again
along with all my friends
Feels like it never ends
here comes the night again

Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night
