Kin after kin, and day after day.
We were waiting. Searching for answers.
Admiring sharp signs on a liquid horizon.
Prophetic words, ominous phenomena,
and the wise Mayans' calculations
betrayed their own destiny.
Failed us!

Some had prepared for this show.
Dug their salvation underground.
Concrete paradise raised for the chosen ones.
Deep enough to be deaf, bury remorses on the surface.
Blind enough no wander in the dark of own madness.

Prophetic words, ominous phenomena,
and the wise Mayans' calculations
betrayed their own destiny.
Failed us!

I've never known our beginning,
but I've found the end.
Doom lies in every creature
under the human crest.
