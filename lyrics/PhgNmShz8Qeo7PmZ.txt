She's eighteen and a beauty queen
She makes the boys feel so weak
It's all for her
or none at all
She'll pick you up just to watch you fall
It's her hands on my hips
I can't escape 'em
It's that mouth and those lips
Try not to taste 'em
It's just the way things are
and the way they'll always be

Girls do what they want (Woah, woah)
Boys do what they can
Girls do what they want (Woah, woah)
Boys do what they can

She's eighteen and a beauty queen
She's figured out all the boys like me
Head to toe, you know she's dressed to kill
And she could, the way she's lookin' at me
It's the face and those eyes
I can't escape 'em
It's that mouth and those lies
Try not to taste 'em
That's just the way things are
and the way they'll always be

Girls do what they want (Woah, woah)
Boys do what they can
Girls do what they want (Woah, woah)
Boys do what they can

(That's just the way,
Just the way,
Just the way things.)

Because the boys are feelin' jealous
And it just doesn't make any sense
Go on and tell 'em
Why the girls are into fellas
That toss 'em to the side in the end

And you know that all the,
The boys are fallin' in love
With girls who don't know what's up
I think we've all had enough of this now
These kids are talkin' 'bout love
We think we've all had enough
We've had enough of this now

Girls do what they want (Whoa whoa)
Boys do what they can
Girls do what they want (Whoa whoa)
Boys do what they can

Girls do what they want (Whoa whoa)
Boys do what they can
Girls do what they want (Whoa whoa)
Boys do what they can
