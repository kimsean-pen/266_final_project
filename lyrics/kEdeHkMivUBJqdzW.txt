See the light
On the other side
Where the leaves are green
I know you'll make it right
Going back in time
A place we wouldn't know
I thought i'd found the key
But you were filing up my head, filling up my head

The flash crushes
The doors shut
See, red skies burning down the hills
Is this how it feels?
If you don't mind
I'll take the other way
We're stuck in here
But you keep counting up the time
Counting up the time
