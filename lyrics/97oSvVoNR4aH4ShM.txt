Mmm hmm
Ohh
Ohh oh oh

Sunshine
You'll always be my sunshine
No one compares to you
Don't you go, don't you go nowhere oh (There's no one else but you)
You make all my dreams come true (They comin true, comin true for me, yeah)
And that's why you'll always be my sunshine

When I see you
I have to stop to catch my breath, oh
Because it's something that you do to me
That I just can't express
And it may seem kind of crazy but it's true
Everything is all about you, yeah

Sunshine
You'll always be my sunshine (You'll always be my sunshine)
No compares to you
Don't you go, don't you go nowhere oh
You make all my dreams come true (They comin true, comin true for me, yeah)
And thats why you'll always be my sunshine (sunshine)

Sometimes it may rain
And sometimes it may pour
But you always seem to bring me so much joy
People may not understand but who cares
You're always right there
Please don't go nowhere
And everytime I'm feelin' lonely
Mhm, you're right there
And like an angel
You're always right on time
So glad you're finally mine

Sunshine
You'll always be my sunshine
No one compares to you
Don't you go, don't you go nowhere oh
You make all my dreams come true (They comin true, comin true for me, yeah)
And that's why you'll always be my sunshine (My sunshine, my sunshine)
You'll always be my sunshine
No one compares to you
Don't you go, don't you go nowhere oh
You make all my dreams come true
And that's why you'll always be my sunshine
