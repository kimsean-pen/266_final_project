I can't ever
Understand
Why my lifes, been
Cursed poisen,
Condemned
When I been tryin every night
To hold ya near me
But I'm tellin you
It aint easy

Ever since I been
Ridin, right on the
Subway Train
You can hear the whistle blowin
Wa might think I'm goin insane

And now your friends
They're fillin up my car
But your so busy readin Suzy says
Ya can't look now
You didn't see your lovers
There all just in rags
Ya know ya hid as pushin up posies
Tryin get ya fed

We was all
Ridin, right on the
Subway Train
And you can hear the captain shoutin
He thinks I've gone insane

Cus I keep
Ridin, keep on
Ridin, cus I keep on
Ridin ridin ridin, keep on
Ridin, yeah

You stop and you stare,
As I'm lieavin my favorite place
We have no regards
Ya can't find a trace
Ya gotta get on back to daddy
That's all its gonna be
He got the poison black arts of the pimps
But don't ya st- st-

I seen em travelin
Right on the
Subway Train
Ya can hear th captain shou-ow-tin
He thinks weve all gone insane

Cus we keep on
Ridin ridin ridin
Ridin, cus we keep
Ridin ridin ridin
Keep on ridin

I think a see the train
I see ya got open track
I'm hopin
One of those gonna bring my baby back

(Cus I guess I said)
Dinah wontcha blow
Dinah wontcha blow your horn
Dinah wontcha blow
Dinah wontcha blow your horn
Someones in the kitchen with Dinah
I know whoa whoa whoa
I said someones in th kitchen with Dinah
I know

I keep on
Ridin ridin ridin
