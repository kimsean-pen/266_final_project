It's been awhile, there was you and I
Doin' things to have you
But it wasn't right, said some things
You maybe shouldn't have said, yeah

But you saved a part of my life
If another choice, what would you chose to let you go?
I can't just get, get enough, no
Always stay in love

I wanna let you go, tell me you need me
But you gotta love me or leave me, baby
Why can't I let you see, you are the only one for me?
Oh, how I need you but you gotta love me or leave me, baby
Leave me, ohh, oh leave me, baby, ohh, oh leave me, ohh

My heart is broken apart because of you, baby oh
Can't think about nobody else and I can't help it
But you're not ready for me to love you like I do
As many times that you heard me, you shouldn't desert me
But you're there forever that I won a million, yeah

I wanna let you go, tell me you need me
But you gotta love me or leave me, baby
Why can't I let you see, you are the only one for me?
Oh, how I need you but you gotta love me or leave me

Babe for you, I want to really think
Oh, anything just to bring you around
I can lie, it hurts, I can lie it hurts inside
Makin' it hard for me, so hard for me
Makin' it hard for me to let go

I wanna let you go, tell me you need me
But you gotta love me or leave me, baby
Why can't I let you see, you are the only one for me?
Oh, how I need you but you gotta love me or leave me, baby
Leave me, ohh, oh leave me, baby, ohh, oh leave me, ohh
