First off I ain't mad at you,
So don't take this the wrong way,
Just wanna put you up on some truth, if thats cool?
You know that new man you've got coming through
Hes was into me way before he was into you,
You ain't know so I ain't blaming you (no no),

Have you ever been in love with,
Thought you had you had your husband,
Then you know what I'm going through (yeah)
All that playing don't mean nothing,
Doing him for nothing

Can you do me a favor?
I know that...

Candles lit and hes on his way,
Probably got your sexy dress on,
Waiting all day for him,
Don't stop what you got goin
But when he gets there
Tell him that I love him, ooh
Tell him that I'm missing him real bad
So tell him just till (till I)
See him in the morning, ohh
Tell him that I love him

Now we be talking bout building that house,
Got me picking out everything,
With his and hers in the driveway,
I know you wouldn't purposely get in my way,
Know you heard all about to each its own,
I know you don't wanna break up a happy home,
I hear him knocking wont you let him in,
And tell me this...

Have you ever been in love with,
Thought you had you had your husband,
Then you know what I'm going through (yeah)
All that playing don't mean nothing,
