Last time I went swimming
I started to drown and my head it went down
And then the lifeguard he jumped in
Grabbed hold of my hair and he pulled me to ground

He was
A true life hero
Friend of every man and child
A true life hero
I really do think it'd be wild

I wonder what it would be like
To be the ultramaroon who was first on the moon
'Cause who could help but dislike
A man it is known has the guts of a prune

Wanna be
A true life hero
Friend of every man and child
A true life hero
Well I really do think it'd be wild

I could never be like him
I could never be strong 'cause I'm always wrong
So I'll just sit here thinking
How nice it would be if it only was me who was

A true life hero
Friend of every man and child
A true life hero
I really do think it'd be wild

A true life hero
A true life hero
A true life
A real life
A true life hero
