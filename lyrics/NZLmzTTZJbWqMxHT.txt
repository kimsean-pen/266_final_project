Mine, immaculate dream
Made of breath and skin
I've been waiting for you
Signed with a home tattoo
Happy birthday to you
Was created for you.

(Girl)
I cant help but keep from falling apart
At the seams
I cannot believe their taking my heart
Into pieces

Ohh, it might take a little time
Might take a little crime
To come undone
Now we'll try
To stay blind
To the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind, can blow me into cry
Who do you need
Who do you love
When you come undone.
Who do you need

Who do you love
When you come undone.
Words

Play me deja vu
Like a radio tune
I swear I've heard before
She'll
Resist something real
Or the magic im feeding
Off your fingers.
I cant help but keep from falling apart
At the seams

I cannot believe their taking my heart
Into pieces
Lost
In a self filled sky
Might make it alright

To come undone
Now, we'll try
To stay blind
To the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind, can blow me into cry
Who do you need
Who do you love
When you come undone.
Who do you need

Who do you love
When you come undone.
I cant help but keep from falling apart, (apartt)
At the seams, (who do you need)
I cannot believe their taking my heart, (who do you love)
Into pieces
I cant help but keep from falling apart
At the seams, (who do you love)
I cannot believe their taking my heart
When you come undone
