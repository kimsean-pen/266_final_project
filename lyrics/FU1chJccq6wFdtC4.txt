There are things in life no one should forgo.
All of which are within your control.
Things that if you treat them like gold.
They'll complete your life and make you whole.

First of all there is yourself
You must take care of you.
Your body is the temple of the Lord.
Faith, family, and friends all in one accord.

When you're lost in the forest.
Can't see past the trees.
Call out to your friends
And they will hear your please.
They will pick you up
And help you find your worth.
So treat them like the greatest gifts on earth.

When you're broke down and weary.
Fallen to your knees.
These are the times we need our families.
They will pick you up.
They've been there since birth.
So treat them like the greatest gifts on earth.
You need them.

No value can be placed upon friends and family.
The greatest gifts in life they are truly free.

So keep yourself pure and to them hold true.
Take care of them they'll take care of you.
Keep yourself pure and to them hold true.
Take care of them they'll take care of you.
