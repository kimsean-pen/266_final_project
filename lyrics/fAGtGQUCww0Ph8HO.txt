I'm sinking with America
All smothered by my conscience and fear
I'm aching in the strangest places
Can't feel myself with distance

I forget that there's a world outside
Where I can be weightless in the sunlight
So many vices with me everywhere I go
And they're serving me to the lions slowly

Baby I feel like I'm alone again
And I'm fading, I know that this is how it ends
Can you help me?
Can you promise that you will carry the pain?
Oh baby, 'cause I feel I'll never break the chain

And I repeat the foolish addict's loop
The boiling over and the keeping it cool
Give me the stage, God knows my life needs staging
What the hell else should I do?

Baby I feel like I'm alone again
And I'm fading, I know that this is how it ends
Can you help me?
Can you promise that you will carry the pain?
Oh baby, 'cause I feel I'll never break the chain
Baby
