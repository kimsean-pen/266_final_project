Shades of intuition.
Shades of conspiring.
Occupying every piece.
Integrating.
We're growing in most peculiar ways(??).
Decompose.
Recreate.
All progression stems from conclusion.
Complacency is obsolete.
We're engineered to thrive, we're engineered to thrive.
And thrive we will.
Observe (this vision of??) continuous cycle.
A mandating gloom.
