Moon
Are you half empty or half full?
There's something missing I can't tell
Is there more I can't see?

Me?
Yeah I'm a track with no train
I'm a cat with no name
Sleeping through my dreams

Smoke
From palo santo and sage
Is it still the new age
Or am I too late?

Big
Big river run slow
Teach me all that you know
How do you find your way?

Time
Feel like I'm wasting time
Just wanna be where I'm going
Just wanna be where I'm going

I
I am here I am alive
Just wanna be where I'm going
Just wanna be where I'm going

Shine
Like a diamond in the dirt
Hard to tell what it's worth
But I work hard I am kind

High
As a bird in the breeze
Are there new ways to see
When the old ways die?

Time
Feel like I'm wasting time
Just wanna be where I'm going
Just wanna be where I'm going

I
I am here I am alive
Just wanna be where I'm going
Just wanna be where I'm going
