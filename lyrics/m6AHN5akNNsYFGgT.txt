And even tour's done
I see it in my sleep
And even war's won
I'll hear the distant screams

Never really want much
Know damn well what I need
And even with the lights out
I'll keep it here with me

Could've been a tradesman
I'd work a 6 till 3
Follow my father's footsteps
To work and spend and sleep
But I couldn't stray from embracing melody
And only in the dark times I'll crave normality
(Normality)

I fight trough to see tomorrow
Don't get tired, don't beg or borrow
I fight trough to see tomorrow
Held so tight, now watch me let go

And even tour's done
I see it in my sleep
And even war's won
I'll heart the distant screams

Never really want much
Know damn well what I need
And even with the lights out
I'll keep it here with me
(Here with me)

I fight troughh to see tomorrow
Don't get tired, don't beg or borrow
I fight trough to see tomorrow
Held so tight, now watch me let go
I fight trough to see tomorrow
Don't get tired, don't beg or borrow
I fight trough to see tomorrow
Held so tight, now watch me let go
(Let go)

I fight trough to see tomorrow
Don't get tired, don't beg or borrow
I fight trough to see tomorrow
Held so tight, now watch me let go

Gravity, gravity
It's everything you want to see, want to see
Gravity, gravity
It's everything you want to see, want to see
Gravity, gravity
It's everything you want to see, want to see
