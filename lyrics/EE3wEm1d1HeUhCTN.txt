Are you ready to be liberated
On this sad side city street?
Well, the birds have been freed from their cages
I got freedom and my youth

My name is Brody, I'm from Melbourne
Fitzroy Melbourne, Fitzroy Melbourne
I grew up on Bell Street, then on Bennett Street
My mum kicked out my dad for battery

Found a way, found a way
She found a way out of spiritual penury
Working single mother in an urban struggle
Blames herself now 'cause I grew up troubled

It hit me
I got everything I need
It hit me
I got everything I need

My one heart felt too much from the start
I've seen people come and go, living large and living low
You can build up your walls sittin' on death row
Let the curtain fall on your murdered soul

You can wash it all down, swallow your story
Get smacked off your head, go down in drumroll glory
You won't solve it committing self-inflicted crime
Go on, pull the trigger, this will be the last time

It hit me
I got everything I need
It hit me
I got everything I need, so...

I speak of the truth, the truth of the heart
Like a desperate thirst in a raging drought
Hey youth, time flies by
There's an everlasting battle for eternal life

I love a man from California
He's the prettiest thing, we got the same disorder
The way you feel is okay
It's never gonna change anyway

It hit me
I got everything I need
It hit me
I got everything I need

Are you ready to be liberated
On this sad side city street?
Well, the birds have been freed from their cages
I got freedom and my youth
Yeah, I got freedom and my youth
