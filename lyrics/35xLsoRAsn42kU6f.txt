You're probably the only one, though it is hard to admit
That can save me
And I never liked to ask for a helping hand
But I do now

I look into your eyes
This hard, bewildered stare
Part of me wants to hurt you
Tear in your hair
But I don't do that now

A naive, open wounded exchange of stories that transforms us
Here
But I think I am the only one breathing on this planet
Tonight

The cheap sweat smothered makeup
Makes her face look as if dissolving
Yet full of grace
Here in the darkness now

One hundred Euro wine
I do believe in heaven and I do believe its time
Yes its time now
Five inch white high heels
I do believe in heaven and I do believe its real
And its okay now

Vast scarlet leisure
Immense blood pressure
Scatterbrained love lecture
Come here and be gorgeous for me now

After all I think it's evident that I am god's favorite one
And now is the time I should have whatever I desire

One hundred Euro wine
I do believe in heaven and I do believe its time
Faceless company
It don't matter much to me
Five inch white high heels
I do believe in heaven and I do believe its real
Dreamlike mirage haze
I'm positively god's favorite one

favorite one
favorite one
favorite one
I do believe I'm the lord's favorite one
