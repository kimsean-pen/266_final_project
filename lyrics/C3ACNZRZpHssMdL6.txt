The whole world trying
To tame the spark
But we've got fire
Burning bright,

Hidden
Catch the shimmer

Of showering stars

The sky gets dimmer

And your light
Shows...
You are the vision I'm looking for (looking for)
Make me remember all I forgot
Watch me become just an animal
Naked to nothing more than who we are
Feral Hearts
In the night
Loving like we've been kept captive
Free to light
Feral Hearts
Come alive
Loving like we've been kept captive

Free to...
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Feral,

Feral,
Feral Hearts
Feral,

Feral,
Feral Hearts
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Feral,
Feral,
Feral Hearts
Feral,
Feral,
Feral Hearts
The whole world trying
To blind the way home
But we've got shelter
Deep inside,
Secret
Tame the whispers
Of winds as they blow
Feel my shivers
In your arms
Stop...
You are the vision I'm looking for (looking for)
Make me remember all I forgot
Watch me become just an animal
Naked to nothing more than who we are
Feral Hearts
In the night
Loving like we've been kept captive
Free to light
Feral Hearts
Come alive
Loving like we've been kept captive
Free to...
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Feral,
Feral,
Feral Hearts
Feral,
Feral,
Feral Hearts
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Feral,
Feral,
Feral Hearts
Feral,
Feral,
Feral Hearts
