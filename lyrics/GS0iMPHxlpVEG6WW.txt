Got me going on again
Around my smile
And I've got a thoughtless feeling inside

I've got it going X4
On...

Got you going on again
Around my smile
And I've got a thoughtless feeling inside

Why don't you take a friend
In the shade
Somewhere all the minutes stay around

I've got it going on X4
On...

Got you going on again
Around my smile
And I've got a thoughtless feeling inside

I've got it going... X14
