Shadows dancing slowly on my wall,
Moonlight painting silver to the
Sound of heartbeat.
Magical emotions take control,
Knowing we will meet before the night is over.

Then I gonna make you mine,
Love you till the end of time.

Take me to your heaven,
Hold on to a dream,
Take me to your heaven,
When my nights are cold and lonely
Flying high together,
On a journey to the stars,
Won't you take me to your heaven to your heart.

I can feel your body next to mine,
Reaching for a kiss that keeps me, warm and tender,
Seven steps to heaven, show the way,
When I'm there I give myself the sweet surrender,

Then I gonna make you mine,
Love you till the end of time.

Take me to your heaven,
Hold on to a dream,
Take me to your heaven,
When my nights are cold and lonely
Flying high together,
On a journey to the stars,
Won't you take me to your heaven to your heart,

As dawn is breaking, there is so much more to say,
So will you be my one and only,
When nights are lonely,
Hold on time forever

Take me to your heaven,
Hold on to a dream,
Take me to your heaven,
When my nights are cold and lonely
Flying high together,
On a journey to the stars,
Won't you take me to your heaven to your heart,
Wooohoohoo
So won't you take me to your heaven to your heart.
