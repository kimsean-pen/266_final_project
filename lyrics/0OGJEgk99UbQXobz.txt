Morning Star shook me from my sleep
Callin' me up from a dream so deep
Let me take you into the sky
Watch the journey
through your mind's eye

What I feel...
What I need...
What I see...
Is you...

Morning Star won't you carry me home?
Morning Star won't you carry me home?
Passed the Midnight Sun...

Morning Star brought
me to te twilight
Across the universe and
deep into the night
Free your spirit and your
mind is gonna fall down
The brave west winds are
gonna heal your sorrow

What I feel...
What I need...
What I see...
Is you...

And what I know...
And what I saw...
And what I see...
Is you...

Morning Star won't you carry me home?
Morning Star won't you carry me home?
Morning Star...
Won't you carry me home?

Passed the Midnight sun!

Morning Star won't you carry me home?
Morning Star won't you carry me home?
Morning Star...
Won't you carry me home...?
Passed the Midnight Sun.

Yeah Morning Star!
Won't you carry my home?
Yeah Morning Star! Yeah!
