It was a hot summer night when we first met
I was only seventeen
Your name was Robin
and that's all I know

I was dancing on my own in the middle of the room
When I turned around and you caught my eye
There was nothing else that I could really do
But one thing for sure is that I wouldn't be alone

You took me to your room
And you said that I was yours
I called you daddy
With your hands wrapped around my neck

You made me feel safe when you held me oh, so tight
and fucked me in your room that night
You were attracted to my innocence
Also was it because I was good at giving head?

You took me to your room
and you said that I was yours
I called you daddy
With your hands wrapped around my neck

You made me feel good
You made me feel good
You made me feel good
All night long
