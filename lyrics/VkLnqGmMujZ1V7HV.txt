I know you feel too old, but if you whisper, only I will hear you
I know you feel too old, but if you whisper, only I will hear you
Not all adults are making love, breaking their backs out of fear,
I'm here with you
I know you feel too, old, but if you whisper only I will hear you

I know you feel too old but if you whisper only I will hear you
I know you feel too old but if you whisper only I will hear you
Not all adults are making love, breaking their backs out of fear,
I'm here with you
I know you feel too old but if you whisper only I will hear you

How, how, how, oh, oh, oh
Only I will hear you
You can place your burden on my chest
The best parts of you lie at the bottom of you, bottom of you
I love you from the space beneath my
feet, and beneath that, and beneath that
My love for you runs so deep, oh
Love says you are not too much
Love says you'll always be enough
We don't have to become anything else
than this if we'd rather be custom made
Leave it all right here
There's space for you right here in this home
In this home of my body, in this home
I love you so much
Whisper it to me
