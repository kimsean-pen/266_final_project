Yeah!

I stare into the sun
Trying to find some kind of meaning
Who will save us now?
Am I the only one
Who gives a fuck if I'm still breathing?
I'm done believing
I'm grabbing for the gun
To take away this pain I'm feeling
All remains the same
Our fight has just begun
Wolves are fucking circling us
We're planning our escape

For only a moment

How can we go on
If we're already broken?
How can we be strong
If there's no place left to go?
(Oh)
Can't we fight for something more?
When all our faith is dead and gone
If we're already broken
How can we go on?

We say that we're alive
But only see our empty coffins
Calling out our names
We fall into the night
With nothing but our hands and our head
Lying here awake

For only a moment

How can we go on
If we're already broken?
How can we be strong
If there's no place left to go?
(Oh)
Can't we fight for something more?
When all our faith is dead and gone
If we're already broken
How can we go on?

How can we go on
If we're already broken?
How can we be strong
If there's no place left to go?
(Oh)
Can't we fight for something more?
When all our faith is dead and gone
If we're already broken
How can we go on?

How can we go on?
How can we go on?
