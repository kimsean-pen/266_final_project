Everything you want in broken pieces on the floor
And everything you thought you'd ever need
But it's not what you want but matters and such you want more
So go on, lie to yourself but don't lie to me

And there's the door
Didn't quit but now I believe you don't need this
Anymore
Yeah tonight lights up, show the town what you can

Open up your broken heart
And keep on wanting
Fallen saints and fallen stars
But it don't mean nothing
Everybody feels left out of a house they can't get in
So open up your broken
And keep on wanting
So keep on wanting

There's two kinds of people, those who try and those who don't
And only time will tell which one you were
And it's alright if you don't know which way you're gonna go
Just don't be afraid to feel it all

And there's the door
Didn't quit but now I believe you don't need this
Anymore
Yea tonight lights up, show the town what you can

Open up your broken heart
And keep on wanting
Fallen saints and fallen stars
But it don't mean nothing
Everybody feels left out of a house they can't get in
So open up your broken
And keep on wanting
So keep on wanting

Open up
You will find the way to go
Just take the cup
You may be stronger than you know

So open up your broken heart
And keep on wanting
Fallen saints and fallen stars
But it don't mean nothing
Everybody feels left out of a house they can't get in
So open up your broken
And keep on wanting
So keep on wanting
So keep on wanting
Keep on wanting

Keep on wanting, keep on
Keep on wanting, keep on
Keep on wanting, keep on
Keep on wanting, keep on
