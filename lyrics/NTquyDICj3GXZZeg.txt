Tried to see what it means to say
Break my bones then I praise the pain
Don't take shelter stand in the rain
It's meant to feel that way

Tired from all those things that you take
Always fighting keeps you awake
Crying when your heart seems to break
It's meant to feel that way

Hiding 'til you're numb and you're grey
That's no way to try win the day
Life wants you to feel it is here
It's meant to feel that way

It's meant to feel that way
It's meant to feel that way
