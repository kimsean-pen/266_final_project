You build a tower
A giant mountain
Opened a God's gate
To reach the heavens
Only power
Rules this stargate
You make a statue
A golden idol
Holding his sword high
It will be placed up
Only power
Rules this stargate
All want the power
Now all divided

You speak your words loud
And cannot hear
What the others try to say
Blind confusion
Tongues now slay
Words are burning

Babel's gate
Human's reign
Babel's gate
Sky is on flames
Babel's gate
All in vain?
Babel's gate
Nothing same

Only power
Rules this stargate
All want the power
Now all divided

You speak your words loud
And cannot hear
What the others try to say
Blind confusion
Tongues now slay
Words are burning
