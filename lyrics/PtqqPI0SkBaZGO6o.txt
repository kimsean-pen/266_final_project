I Woke up this morning
Wanting every single bird to fly
Kissing every single flower of my life
Looking for the touching of your arms in my arms
I woke up this morning
I turned around and there you were right next to me
Your pillow brought me pictures of the night before
You said good morning
With the smile that I adore
I adore

This is my life
Day after day
This is the love that I love in you
This is your life
Day after day
This is the love that you love in me

We woke up this morning
We turned around and there we were right in next to us
Our pillow brought us pictures of the night before
we said good morning
With the smile that we adore
We adore

This is my life
Day after day
This is the love that I love in you
This is your life
Day after day
This is the love that you love in me

La, la, la ...
