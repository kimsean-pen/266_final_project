I've been waiting for something for so long
To show me the answers that I want
A reason to believe in that's so strong
But I don't think that it exists

I've been waiting for something for so long
To show me the answers that I want
A reason to believe in that's so strong
But I don't think that it exists

Yeah, give me reason to believe
This world's not a sick machine
When everywhere's a dead end
In every direction

Yeah, can you give me what I need
Or just sit bad and watch me bleed
'Cause after all you can't get
Everything you want now

But all I would need is one
Thing to keep me moving on

Everybody's got a secret
Can you tell me, what is mine?
Can you tell me what you'd find?
I'll tell you if you keep it, I promise not to lie

Well I have the fears
The pain and the tears
I just can't hide
It all disappears
'Cause everything passes
With the time
All you need
Is reason to believe
