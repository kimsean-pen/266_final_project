Don't look back into the sun
Now you know that the time is come

And they said that it would never come for you
Oh my friend you haven't changed
Looking rough and living strange

And I know you've got a taste for it too
They will never forgive you but they won't let you go, oh no

She will never forgive you but she won't let you go, oh no
Don't look back into the sun

You cast your cards but you're on the run
And all the lives said hurt, did you say
And then they played that song at the death disco

It started fast but it ends so slow
And all the time it reminded me of you
They will never forgive you but they won't let you go (let me go)
She will never forgive you but she won't let you go, oh no
They will never forgive you but they won't let you go (let me go)
She will never forgive you but she won't let you go, oh no
