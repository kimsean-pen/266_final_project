Money just changed everything, I wonder how life without it would go?
From the concrete, who knew that a flower would grow?
Lookin' down from the top and it's crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago

Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit
When I hear talkin', I just don't know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracin' it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me, it could take a bit

Yeah, and my dreams are who I'm racing with
As you can see I'm pacin' it so that I'm always chasin' it
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship

Yeah, this life is something I would die for
October's on but it's lookin' like July four
I just wish they'd let you try it first
This time I'm really goin' off, fireworks

Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think I just realized what it means

All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks
Every night is fireworks, every night is fireworks
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks, taking off like

I'm just such a gentleman, you should give it up for me
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery
I could tell it wasn't love, I just thought you fuck with me
Who coulda predicted lucky strike would have you stuck with me

Damn, I kept my wits about me, luckily
What happened between us that night, it always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden, these gossip rags wanna cover me
And you making it seem that it happened that way because of me

But I was curious
And I'll never forget it, baby, what an experience
You coulda been the one but it wasn't that serious
There was smoke in the air before that was me clearing it

That felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it, though
You never see it coming you just get to see it go
Yeah, I shoulda looked up in the sky at first
Now I see it in her eyes, fireworks

Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think I just realized what it means

All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks
Every night is fireworks, every night is fireworks
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks, taking off like

Everything the same but it feels different
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen
And he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin'
It's been years though, I just learn to deal with it

For real, me and my realtor, we built up a better rapport
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city, I let her explore
And now she sayin' she more lonely than ever before

How many of our parents' marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the Heritage Classic
Searching for that feeling, tell me, where is the magic?

Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I wanna witness love, I never seen it close
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first
That's why I'm really going off, fireworks

Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think I just realized what it means

All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks
Every night is fireworks, every night is fireworks
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks, taking off like
