It's not time for conversation, no
I don't want to complicate this for you
And I leave them other girls alone
If you'll be the one that I come home to

All of my love, all of my love
My time, my attention
My patience, I'm giving it all
All the above, all the above
No this ain't the way
That I usually play this
No, no

Would I lose
If I bet my heart on you?
Would I lose
If I bet my heart on you?
I don't wanna slow down
Won't you let me know now
Would I lose, oh
If I bet my heart on you?
(Bet my heart on)

Is it real? Is it fake?
Would you leave? Would you stay?
Will the night turn into day?
Will we get closer? Or will it be over?
I'm only hoping
I don't waste, I don't waste

All of my love, all of my love
My time, my attention
My patience, I'm giving it all
All the above, all the above
No this ain't the way
That I usually play this
No, no

Would I lose
If I bet my heart on you?
Would I lose
If I bet my heart on you?
I don't wanna slow down
Won't you let me know now
Would I lose, oh
If I bet my heart on you? (Bet my heart on)
If I bet my heart on you? (Bet my heart on)

It's not time for conversation, no
I don't want to complicate this for you

Would I lose
If I bet my heart on you?

If I bet my heart on you?

If I bet my heart on you?
Would I lose
If I bet my heart on you?
I don't wanna slow down
Won't you let me know now
Would I lose, oh
If I bet my heart on you? (Bet my heart on)
If I bet my heart on you? (Bet my heart on)
If I bet my heart on you?
