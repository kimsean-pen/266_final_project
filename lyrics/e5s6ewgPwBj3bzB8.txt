Ooh...

You don't want me anymore
So I walk out of the door
I play the game right from the start
I trust you, you use me, now my life's all torn apart

So I'm sailing, yeah I'm sailing on
I'm moving, yeah I'm moving on
Sail on sail on sail on sail on - aaaaah

Tried to see if I'll give up
But there wasn't any luck
It's a fact, a fact of life
That's the game, game of strife everything is all in stride

So I'm sailing, I'm sailing on
I'm moving, yeah I'm moving on
Sail on sail on sail on sail on - aaaaah

Yeah

So I'm sailing, yeah I'm sailing on
I'm moving, yeah I'm moving on
Sail on sail on sail on sail on - aaaaah

Yeah la la la
La la la
La la la

Too many years with too many tears
And too many days with none to say
So how will we know when there's nowhere to grow
The fact of life, life too short oh

There's too many years with too many tears
There's too many days with none to say no no
So how will we know when there's nowhere to grow
The fact of life, the fact of life yeah

Too many years with too many tears
And too many days with none to say
So how will we know when there's nowhere to grow
The fact of life, life too short oh oh...
