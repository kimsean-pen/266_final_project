Oh the lights outside they're as bright as the sun
They're much brighter than anyone
Oh the girls in the queue yes they're waiting for you
Well they're waiting for their song to be sung
And when the night turns to day and all the people go away
It's not the same, tell me who's to blame?
And when the stars shine so bright on the cold December night
I wish that I was on the stage

Oh won't you take a ride with me
Through the Barrowland history
And I'll sing you a song or two
People they may stop and stare but baby I just don't care
It's only me and you
And the drink and dance and drugs you know
It's all part of the show we go to
Maybe I should tell you
That people they may stop and stare but baby I just don't care
Tonight, it's only me and you

Oh nothing beats the feeling of the high Barrowland ceiling
When the band start to play
Won't you buy me a drink and I'll tell her what I think if she gets in my way
And when the night turns to day and all the people go away
It's not the same, tell me who's to blame?
And when the stars shine so bright on the cold December night
I wish that I was on the stage

Oh won't you take a ride with me
Through the Barrowland history
And I'll sing you a song or two
People they may stop and stare but baby I just don't care
It's only me and you
And the drink and dance and drugs you know
It's all part of the show we go to
Maybe I should tell you
That people they may stop and stare but baby I just don't care
Tonight, it's only me and you

And when the night turns to day and the lights they fade away
I wish that love and life would pass me by
And when the band stops a song because there's something going on
Well there is magic in the air I swear
And I wish that I saw Bowie, playing on that stage
I wish that I saw something, to make me come of age

Oh won't you take a ride with me
Through the Barrowland history
And I'll sing you a song or two
People they may stop and stare but baby I just don't care
It's only me and you
And the drink and dance and drugs you know
It's all part of the show we go to
Maybe I should tell you
That people they may stop and stare but baby I just don't care
Tonight, it's only me and you
