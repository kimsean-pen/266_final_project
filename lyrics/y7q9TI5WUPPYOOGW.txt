I am afraid of my grandmother's notes
'Cause someday they will stop showing up
A sweet note and a couple of bucks says "I love you"
But the dead cannot love
And this grave, it means nothing to you
Still something sweet about the flowers and perfume
I assumed you'd live forever but if you are never gone
Then everything you do will never leave a mark

I will never understand my twitch
Or why anxiety is hanging on to every situation with an iron grip
If you want peace, you will find nothing in me
Every day I am afraid I'll see my family fade away
Every decision that I make is making it harder to sleep
If you want peace, you will find nothing in me

Who'd have thought that one of us would lose their lives
Oh, every night I lay awake and think
that I'm the one that should have died
Ever since you left I've just been trying to make you proud
If nothing else then maybe I can
take some pride in what I've done myself

I will never understand my twitch
Or why anxiety is hanging on to every situation with an iron grip
If you want peace, you will find nothing in me
Every day I am afraid I'll see my family fade away
Every decision that I make is making it harder to sleep
If you want peace, you will find nothing in me
I will never understand my twitch
Or why anxiety is hanging on to every situation with an iron grip
If you want peace, you will find nothing in me
And I tried to find that in you
