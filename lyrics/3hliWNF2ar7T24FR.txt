(You cannot hide from a grace already perceived
that's a fierce grace indeed!
and you cannot hide a tree this is growing
valiantly stretching for the stars
angels weep as they count your scars)

These rivers of blood -
Fields scorched to ask
Lament of life: A love-song
We all share our sorrows
In light suspended...
Smiling at the ever dying sun.

Flakes of snow are melting
On the top of your eyes;
Shedding heaven's stars
The tracks we left
Almost buried now...

This is a beautiful place!
Here Cassiel wedded winter
So man could grieve
So man could see
These trees are dark and old
In solitude unified...
Licking the ground, tasting the rough
Cold wind, so man could breathe

(There's no masquerade in your silence,
just pages filled of Winter
the seeds of ascendance are hiding...
let's drench the hours!)

These wastelands of dusk -
Oceans bled and barren
Lament of life: A love-song
The only death awoken;
A fear transcendence,
Keeps us from the rapture of one

And the blood of the sphere
It emptied their mouths...
Drowning the world

Hammer me down as pillars!
Veiled from creation unchanging,
Patching the holes and the cracks
Tightening the rope around your necks
And we see mankind aimlessly breeding.
Desperately bleeding
Erasing you, erasing me from here

- So tired, so tired...
I need to feel the freezing blue
Leave me here!
Let the coming of spring
Carry me back to earth.
Leave me here!
