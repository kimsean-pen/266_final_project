Today could have been the day that you blow out your candles,
Make a wish as you close your eyes.

Today could have been the day
Everybody was laughing;
Instead I just sit here and cry.

Who would you be?
What would you look like when you looked at me for the very first time?
Today could have been the next day of the rest of your life.

And not a day goes by that I don't think of you.
I'm always asking why this crazy world had to lose.
Such a ray of light we never knew.
Gone too soon yeah, yeah, yeah.

Would you have been president?
Or a painter, an author, the same like your mother?
But one thing is evident;
Would have given all I had,
Would have loved you like no other.

Who would you be?
What would you look like?
Would you have my smile and her eyes?
Today could have been the next day of the rest of your life.

And not a day goes by that I don't think of you.
I'm always asking why this crazy world had to lose.
Such a ray of light we never knew.
Gone too soon yeah, yeah, yeah.

(Oh wooahh)
Not a day goes by...
(Oh woah) Oh wooahh...
(Oh wooahh)
I'm always asking why...
(Oh woah) Oh woaahh...

And not a day goes by that I don't think of you.
I'm always asking why this crazy world had to lose.
Such a beautiful light we never knew
Gone too soon.
You were gone too soon...
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Oh oh oh, oh oooh...
Not a day goes by... that I don't think of you...
