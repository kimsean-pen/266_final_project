I tried to kill the pain
But only brought more (so much more)
I lay dying
And I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal
I'm dying praying bleeding and screaming
Am I too lost to be saved
Am I too lost?

My God, my Tourniquet
Return to me salvation
My God, my Tourniquet
Return to me salvation

Do you remember me?
Lost for so long
Will you be on the other side?
Or will you forget me?
I'm dying, praying, bleeding and screaming
Am I too lost to be saved?
Am I too lost?

My God, my Tourniquet
Return to me salvation
My God, my Tourniquet
Return to me salvation
(Return to me salvation)

I want to die

My God, my Tourniquet
Return to me salvation
My God, my Tourniquet
Return to me salvation

My wounds cry for the grave
My soul cries for deliverance
Will I be denied Christ?
Tourniquet
My suicide
Return to me salvation
Return to me salvation
