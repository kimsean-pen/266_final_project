There's a lot of talk about me
People lining up to meet me
I'm on the verge of celebrity
So whatcha think about that

I've got friends in high places
Louis Vuitton suitcases
Look at all the pretty faces
So whatcha think about that

So why do I feel like it's all just a show

You make me want to shut it all down
Throw it away
Cause I'm nothing if I don't have you
What's the point in being on top
All the money in the world
If I can't blow it all on you

So send the cars back
Put the house on the market
And my big dreams too
Cause it's all so clear
Now without you here
I'm the loser of the year

I'm at the party in a mansion
There's a lot of high fashion
And I'm cooler that I've ever been
So whatcha think about that

I'm living life in the fast lane
I've got a fridge full of champagne
And I'm hanging out with lil' Wayne
So whatcha think about that

So why do I feel like it's all just a show

You make me want to shut it all down
Throw it away
Cause I'm nothing if I don't have you
What's the point in being on top
All the money in the world
If I can't blow it all on you

So send the cars back
Put the house on the market
And my big dreams too
Cause it's all so clear
Now without you here
I'm the loser of the year

I'm the loser of the year
(Loser, loser)

I can try real hard
I can try to pretend
But all these dreams make any sense
Without you
But that just ain't true

I thought these things will make me forget
About you and me
But you're stuck in my head

I'm a loser if I lose her

You make me want to shut it all down
Throw it away
Cause I'm nothing if I don't have you
What's the point in being on top
All the money in the world
If I can't blow it all on you

So send the cars back
Put the house on the market
And my big dreams too
Cause it's all so clear
Now without you here
I'm the loser of the year
