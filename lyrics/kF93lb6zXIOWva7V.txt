Encaged in a memory
Encaged in a prison of guilt
Surrounded by reproach
And everybody knows

She flies over town in white shades
But you're left behind
With a thousand troubled minds
You cannot speak, you're blinded by your grief
She flies over town in white shades
And guides every step
But still you feel alone
'Cause angels don't come home
Angels don't come home

As the sky is clearing
You clear your mind
Hide all mirrors not to see
What the morphine couldn't hide
Shattered faces on the floor
Your broken mask serves you no more

She flies over town in white shades
But you're left behind
With a thousand troubled minds
You cannot speak, you're blinded by your grief
She flies over town in white shades
And guides every step
But still you feel alone
'Cause angels don't come home
Angels don't come home

She flies over town in white shades
She flies over town in white shades

She flies over town in white shades
But still you feel alone
'Cause angels don't come home
'Cause angels don't come home
