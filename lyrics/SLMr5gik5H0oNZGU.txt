I wish that I could touch the sky
Elevate me
I hope that I don't burn my eyes
As I drift free
Don't think that I can help myself
Guess it's true

Polythene, Polythene Girl
Wrap me up in a cellophane world
Polythene, Polythene Girl
I'm breaking the seal, never thought I would

I wish that I could heal myself
Addicted to you
Wrap me up in cotton wool
Just to feel new
Don't think that I can help myself
But it's true

Polythene, Polythene Girl
Wrap me up in a cellophane world
Polythene, Polythene Girl
I'm breaking the seal, never thought I would
Polythene

Suffocate
Elevate
Suffocate
Elevate
But it's true

Polythene, Polythene Girl
Wrap me up in a cellophane world
Polythene, Polythene Girl
I'm breaking the seal, never thought I would
