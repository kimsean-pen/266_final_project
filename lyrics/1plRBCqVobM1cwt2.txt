How do you turn from fear?
How do you make dark thoughts disappear?
When knowing to go feels right,
Maybe I can't hide from the night,
Maybe I'll just turn on the lights,

So it's you, and me,
Hard times pass peacefully,
Is that true?
We'll see,
Maybe once or twice in awhileaway,

My heart skips every time,
Your sleepy grin, your still closed eyes,
I don't need anyone,
I'm sure I've said all that before,
Please don't laugh when, I see you some more,

When you and me,
We don't even have to agree,
Is that true?
We'll see,
Maybe once or twice in awhileaway,

Things get better sometimes,
But when we're not in,
Takes forever, it's in the sign,
If we're together,

Please don't laugh when I say it some more,
With you and me,
Hard times pass peacefully,
Is that true?
We'll see,
Maybe I'll believe what you say or...
Maybe I can quiet my brain...
Maybe once or twice in awhileaway.
