Can't you hear me screaming, once again?
Voices you can't hear
Because you are consumed and incontent
With everlasting greed

Don't you see me on my hands and knees?
Begging and pleading
You're smiling as you bite the hand that feeds
But will you never see?

Always wanting what your eyes can't see
(Needing what your arms can't reach)
Thinking you are in need
Always hearing what your ears can't hear
(Feeling what your hands can't touch)
Thinking you're incomplete

(Enough)
It was
Never enough that I gave to you
All of the horror that you've put me through (never enough)
How can I make up my mind this time?
This is where I will draw the line

Sacrificed my life to be with you
Why did you leave me?
There's nothing more from me you can consume
Cause you are incomplete

Always wanting what your eyes can't see
(Needing what your arms can't reach)
Thinking you are in need
Always hearing what your ears can't hear
(Feeling what your hands can't touch)
Thinking you're incomplete

(Enough)
It was
Never enough that I gave to you
All of the horror that you've put me through (never enough)
How can I make up my mind this time?
This is where I will draw the line

Everlasting need
Would you please?
Answer me and
Make me complete

Everlasting greed
Would you please?
Set me free
Fulfill all my needs and make complete

(Enough)
It was
Never enough that I gave to you
All of the horror that you've put me through (never enough)
How can I make up my mind this time?
This is where I will draw the line

Never again will I be with you
No promise eternal carrying us through
I finally made up my mind this time
This is the end, I've drawn the line
Never enough to devour your greed
