Another lifetime lived in a long night
I'm watching the sunrise before I lay down to sleep
Livin' at parties, watching my twenties
Hittin' my thirties, lettin' it go

But that's all I've been livin' for
When there's nothing left to lose anymore
If there's a door, I'll go through
And walk right into my lonesome blues

Runnin' my friends off, well, I cheat and I get caught
They tell me that I'm lost but I don't care anymore
I'm having a free mind, living a free life
Knowing that my flight is gonna crash and burn, alright

But that's all I've been livin' for
When there's nothing left to lose anymore
If there's a door, I'll go through
And walk right into my lonesome blues

I'm writing my stories on my worst mornings
I'm pulling my heart strings to help me find myself
Living with my past, smokin' up my grass
And having a good laugh just to lose myself

That's all I've been livin' for
When there's nothing left to lose anymore
If there's a door, I'll go through
And walk right into my lonesome blues
Yes, I'll walk right into my lonesome blues
