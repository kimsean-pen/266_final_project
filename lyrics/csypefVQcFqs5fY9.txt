If you want to feel loved
Come lie with me
I just want the company
And you do that perfectly
Unfold your creases
The ones from your brow too
In such a way that makes you unwind and undo

And if you lie there still you'll feel the heartbeats collide
Their fights will slowly subside until they're one

And I'm thinking this is

Bliss
Bliss, this is happiness
Bliss, to have something to miss

If we tangle our fingers
Capture our fears
We could hold them captive
'Til they hold us no more
Feel the grooves that show my journey
Read the patterns
Read the stories in each one

And I'm thinking this is

Bliss
Bliss, this is happiness
Bliss, to have something to miss

And I know it's far too forward to say I love you
And I know it's far too soon to say I'll miss you
And I'm far too proud to say that I need you
But the way you make me feel is so untouched

Bliss, bliss

Oh this is Bliss (baby tell me now do you feel it too, oh baby)
Bliss (oh this is bliss, oh this is bliss)
Bliss (oh this is bliss, oh this is bliss, oh baby)
Bliss
