Revolution in their minds
The children start to march
Against the world in which they have to live
And all the hate that's in their hearts

They're tired of being pushed around
And told just what to do
They'll fight the world until they've won
And love comes flowing through

Children of tomorrow live in
The tears that fall today
Will the sun rise up tomorrow bringing peace in any way?
Must the world live in the shadow

Of atomic fear?
Can they win the fight for peace
Or will they disappear?
So you children of the world

Listen to what I say
If you want a better place to live in
Spread the words today
Show the world that love is still alive
You must be brave
Or you children of today are
Children of the grave, Yeah!
