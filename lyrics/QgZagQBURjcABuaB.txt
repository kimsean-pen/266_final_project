Hallelujah, the king is dead
He said "Love was the knife"
And now he'll dream some magic queen
Might try and save his life

They say his famous final words
Came from the heart of the man
He made his bed on love denied
Played Jekyll and Hyde till the day he died

Too late for the young gun
To lead a simple life
Too late for the young gun I said

This is the year of the knife, this is the year of the knife
This is the year of the knife, this is the year of the knife
This is the year of the knife, this is the year of the knife

See the mountains crumble
Feel the fire go cold
Summer will turn to winter
Love will turn to stone

They say his famous final words
Came from the heart of the man
I made my bed on love denied

Too late for the young gun
To lead a simple life
Too late for the young gun

Sun and the moon
Sun and the moon
The wind and the rain

This is the year of the knife, this is the year of the knife
This is the year of the knife, this is the year of the knife
This is the year of the knife, this is the year of the knife

This is the year of the knife, this is the year of the knife
This is the year of the knife, this is the year of the knife
This is the year of the knife, this is the year of the knife

This is the year of the knife, this is the year of the knife
Too late, much too late
Too late for the young gun, this is the year of the knife
