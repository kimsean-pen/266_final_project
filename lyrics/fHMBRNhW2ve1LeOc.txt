Woman, when I walked with you last night
My mind saw that you'd soon hold me tight
I can't concede, no
I can't believe you love me, too

You don't realize what you can do
I just sympathize, but still it's true
I can't concede, no
I can't believe you love me, too

Woman, when I walked with you last night
My mind saw that you'd soon hold me tight
I can't concede, no
I can't believe you love me, too

I want you to understand my mind
Seems that girls who do are hard to find
I can't concede, no
I can't believe you love me, too
