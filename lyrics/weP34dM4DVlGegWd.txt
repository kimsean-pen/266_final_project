I'd like to find out what places she's been
What's behind her locked door
Or better yet know if I'm out or I'm in
If her elevator still runs the top floor

Perhaps she would say she was a student of hope
And I'm dangling from the end of a disintegrating rope
But I don't wish to spark off her outraged imagination
I don't wish to get into any double edged conversation

It's a touchy situation
Woah, yes
It's a touchy situation
Oh-oh-oh, yeah

Someday I'll find out what I'm now afraid to ask
And I'll discover what lies there beneath the door mats
Perhaps she would say that I'm just deathly afraid
To see her make the same mistake that I made

And it might lead to some sweet revelation
She knows I hate even this conversation

It's a touchy situation
Woah, yes
It's a touchy situation
Oh-oh-oh, yes

I said, "Are you doing well baby?"
She says, "Go ask your father"
I said, "Give me yes, no, or maybe"
She says, "Why should I bother?"
I said
She says
I said, ohhh
I'll ask you tomorrow
I'll ask you tomorrow

If I could only break the coat of her fears
I could expose the secrets to the river of her tears
Rattle her senses 'til she's pouring forth her tears
Before she could exercise those powers of manipulation

It's a touchy situation
It's a touchy situation
It's a touchy situation
Woah
It's a touchy situation
Woah

It's a touchy situation
It's a touchy situation
It's a touchy situation
