I feel I come from better conditions
buried deep in my mind I forgot
awake my soul
I want to find and drink this light

Images of the past
other lives and other places
always the same embraces
I return to where I've been

I take inside a forward movement
Involved in desire of consciousness
progress, understand
I want to find the keys of the past

remember the past present future
memory is a force
so many things have happened
to me the hardest of all

But the gates would never again
be opened to me unless
I could bid them open at my
own will and command

I feel I come from better conditions
(opened them at my own will and command)
buried deep in my mind I forgot
(opened them at my own will and command)
always the same light, same embraces
(opened them at my own will and command)
I take inside a forward movement
