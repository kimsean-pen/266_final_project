Oh, save us all again
From a cynic's Armageddon
When your mind didn't wanna break
Your rusty mouth consented

I think you're all afraid
Too afraid to admit pollution
Now there's no easy way
To avoid such a hard solution

Did you tell the world today that
We would say goodbye?
Digital
Did you tell the world today that
We would say goodbye?

Here we go again
With a brilliant overreaction
My advice isn't gonna change
Dysfunction over fashion

I think you're all ashamed
Too ashamed to admit your faults
No daylight in the bunker
Just darkness in the vaults

Digital
Did you tell the world today that
We would say goodbye?
Digital
Did you tell the world today that
We would say goodbye?

There's only one way out of this
But do we have the nerve to try?
'Cause there is no way out of this
If all our answers say goodbye

Goodbye
There's only one way out of this
But do we have the nerve to try?
'Cause there is no way out of this
If all our answers say goodbye

We would say goodbye?
