Don't speak my name
Like you have my attention

I'm still fighting
Something you'll never see
So be careful
When you believe what you see
I'm still bending
Now you're breaking me
So I'm leaving
Never how I thought it would be

Don't speak my name
Like you have my attention
Don't forget you only know
What's right in front of your eyes

Can't stop writing
About the things you do to me
Can't stop lying
When you ask if I'm ok
I'm still falling
But I swear I'll land on my feet
Not the ending
Just done until you see clearly

I'm still bending
Now you're breaking me
So I'm leaving
Never how I thought it would be
I'm still falling
But I swear I'll land on my feet
Not the ending
Just done until you see clearly

But I swear I'll land on my feet
Just done until you see clearly

Don't speak my name
Like you have my attention
Don't forget you only know
What's right in front of your eyes
