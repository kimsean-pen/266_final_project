Every time I wear this dress
I'm back to the way I was when we met
Every time a little less
I'm not like before, hey

When you go to London next
Remember the way I was
Caught up in a useless test
That nobody grades so I never got what I thought I deserved

Girl, you got a wounded look
Give it a rest
Lay your weapon down beside my bed
Isn't it behind you yet?
It's not like before, hey

All abandoned hopes I have
With a best case escape plan
I remember you descent
And the only way to land
Is to crash and burn

What we do is grotesque
The pleasure we get, filling up a poison well of revenge

Every time I wear this dress
I'm back to the way I was when we met
Every time a little less
I'm not like before, hey

That's what we all say
That's what we all say

I remember you descent
And the only way to land
Is to crash and burn
