Walk me home
I don't want to go all the way alone
Baby would you walk with me home
Baby would you take my hand
Come with me now to a special land
Baby would you walk with me home (Ohh)

Three A.M.
You're on my mind once again
I must have been dreaming
Thought I felt your heartbeat just then
And I wondered how it would be
If I was your lady
And you were my friend

I would put my heart in your hand and it would never end

Baby would you walk me home (Walk me home)
I don't want to go all the way alone (All alone)
Baby would you walk with me home
Baby would you take my hand (Take my hand)
Come with me now to our special land (Oh Oh)
Baby would you walk with me home Home Home la la la la la la

I hold your picture next to my heart all the time
Oh yeah baby
You're my dream come true so glad you're mine
And I wondered how it would be
If I was your lady and you were my friend
I would put my heart in your hands
And it would never end

Baby would you walk me home (Baby Would you walk me home)
I don't want to go all the way alone (All alone)
Baby would you walk with me home
Baby would you take my hand
(Baby would you take my hand)
Come with me now to our special land (ooh)
Baby would you walk with me home (ohh ohh oh)

Every day and night I want to hold you (Hold you)
Understand that I am going to love you
In my (Love you in my) own special way (Special way)

Baby would you walk me home (Ohh)
(Ohh) I don't want to go all the way alone
Baby would you walk with me home
(If you take my hand) Baby would you take my hand
Come with me now to our special land
Baby would you walk with me home (Ohh)

Baby would you walk me home (Baby Would you walk me home)
I don't want to go all the way alone (All alone)
Baby would you walk with me home
