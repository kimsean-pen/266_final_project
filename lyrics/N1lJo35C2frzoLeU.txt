Breathless I stand free
blind to fates which fall to men
embracing the chilling winds, still I am
the mist freeze falls from my breath
steel gray skies encompass my sight
caring not for other worlds
(and there are other worlds than these)

Your Fathers tried to slay me
Your Brothers fell before me

Clashing, as hates collide
Through echoed cried I wade
Upon frozen ground, my victims lay

Pounding the frozen earth,
The hooves of horses carrying men
Swords raised high,
The rush of war flowing through their veins
The warm blood soon to meet the earth
from which it came

Your fathers tried to slay me
Your brothers fell before me
Ageless, Still I Am

Heathens, they bring their crusades to me
Failing, they've come to die in vain
Nameless, their meaningfulness is none
I summon the strength of the gods
and we are one

Hear this, see this, know this
for this is the ways that it must be

For solace I eat the heart
to steal the power, this magic holds
and to taste the bitter vengeance
that within me has dwelled

Men of kings have come to end me
only to die in vain
legends, have cursed my name
spells are spoken,
believed to ward me away

Your fathers tried to slay me
Your brothers fell before me
Ageless, Still I Am
