Lately, it's not hard to destroy me
My body feels so weak and fragile
I think that I need you here by me
I think that I need you here now

Tell you how I have been awful
And God, I feel tired and lonely
You know that I need you
Need someone to sing
So why don't you just sing for me?

Why don't you just sing for me?
Why don't you just sing for me?
Why don't you just sing for me?
Why don't you just sing for me?

You make me smile with my eyes closed
Laying in the living room
I wanna take you everywhere
Anywhere you wanna go
I'll take you there, just let me know
Although we both know that isn't true

For now, fuck it, there's so little time
I'll do everything I can
I've got to stuff it in my mind
I'll be there, I'll be there
Smiling with my eyes closed

My words, they get tangled and mixed up
It's hard to explain how this feels
I've played it all out in my head now
Once or twice but that just isn't real

I've said far too many goodbyes
Can't imagine the day you're gone
I can write you a letter, I couldn't feel better
I might even write you a song

Why don't you just sing for me?
Why don't you just sing for me?
Why don't you just sing for me?
Why don't you just sing for me?

You make me smile with my eyes closed
Laying in the living room
I wanna take you everywhere
Anywhere you wanna go
I'll take you there, just let me know
Although we both know that isn't true

For now, fuck it, there's so little time
I'll do everything I can
I've got to stuff it in my mind
I'll be there, I'll be there
Smiling with my eyes closed

All I need
Sing for me
All I need
Sing for me
All I need
Sing for me

Smile with my eyes closed
Laying in the living room
I wanna take you everywhere
Anywhere you wanna go
I'll take you there, just let me know
Although we both know that isn't true

For now, fuck it, there's so little time
I'll do everything I can
I've got to stuff it in my mind
I'll be there, I'll be there
Smiling with my eyes closed
Smiling with my eyes closed
I'll be there
Smiling with my eyes closed
