What did you see?
Shadows are gone
In the light of the day
How did you feel?
A hero
A victim with nothing to say
What did you find?
A place in the dark
Or in shining light
What did you hide?
Shadows and secrets
No matter the side

The quickest
The fastest
Under the sonic sign
Stars are aligned
Still
Under the sonic sign
Where stars are aligned

What did you reveal?
Something to touch
Something so real
Still you conceal
The inner and outer
You disappear
Nothing to fear
Everything to gain
Nevermind the pain
How did you deal with
The equations of the sun
And the rain
