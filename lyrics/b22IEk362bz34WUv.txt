I stole the keys to the skies
We'll leave this place for the final time
No crying words, no goodbyes
Yet tonight we're burning all the dark times
Drown all the fears that we had
These are the things that we'll never understand
This time, fight fire with fire
'Cause baby, tonight the world belongs to you and I
This boy's in love
Love
This boy's in love
Under the city, under the city lights
Don't tell the world what we've known
We've come so far but there's still a ways to go
It's dark there's no need for light
When the fire in his eyes is so bright
This boy's in love
Love
This boy's in love
Under the city
Under the city lights
Tonight, turn out the lights.
Don't wait, too late to die.
Look out, hold on, hold tight.
Tonight all night I'm getting ready so...
Love, love, love, love
This boy's in love...
This town, these streets, your friends
We'll never see this place again
They'll think about you now and then
They'll never see our faces again
This boy's in love...
Good-bye this town, these streets
Your friends, we'll never see this place again
They'll think about you now and then
They'll never see our faces again
