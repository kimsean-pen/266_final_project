I'd like to take my time
There's a good reason I must find
I want to put a few miles down
I'd like to feel my two feet on the ground
Another year's hard work done
I've paid for it with all of my blood

I've given you more than I'm worth
I want to dig my fingers into the earth

Because I know there's beauty buried beneath
The surface of what we seek
All hopes left unfelt
They lie between the wish and the well

The sun is just rising up
Mother birds feeding their young
The light of a brand new day
I think we've finally found a home in this place

Now I know there's beauty buried beneath
The surface of what we seek
All hopes left unfelt
They lie between the wish and the well
Now I know there's beauty buried beneath
The surface of what we seek
All hopes left unfelt
They lie between the wish and the well
