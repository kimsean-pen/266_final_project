All the people that you know
They take the current from the flow
There is no place you can go
Besides your head to be alone
'cause nothing gold can stay

It's too late to call it off
I try to find a way around
Feels like you should have known
We all use

All this people I don't know
Shaking hands and dying slow
There is no place I can go
It's time my head to be alone
'cause nothing gold can stay

It's too late to call it off
I try to find a way around
Feels like you should have known
It's all in vain
Watch it all come and go
The pain I can't live without
Feels like you should have known
We all use

All the people that you know
They take the current from the flow
'cause nothing gold can stay

It's too late to call it off
I try to find a way around
Feels like you should have known
It's all in vain
Watch them all come and go
The pain I can't live without
Feels like you should have known
We all use
