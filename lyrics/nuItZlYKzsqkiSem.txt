I wanna take you home
A night out on the town
Say that you're pretty so you stand up, stand up
Before I drag you down

Crawling up your skin
Potions, pills and medicines
To drain you
And bleed your magic out

Lonely little life
And nobody believes you now
You're bleeding magic out

Don't want to scare you off
Don't want to know your name
You'll never know a single thing about me
Until it's far too late

Crawling up your skin
Potion, pleasing medicines
To circumvent your brain

Lonely little life
And nobody believes you now
You're bleeding magic

Lonely little life
Oh, and nobody believes you now
You're bleeding magic out somehow
And nobody believes you now
You're bleeding magic

Enough
