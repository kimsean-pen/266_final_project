The realm's bleeding
It suffers - Old and weak

No further arguing there is war at hand
(The system's failing) - Engine's running

Then after all, I sense the end is dawning
These lunatics deny the truth

I know I will not fail
There'll be war, It's now or never
We shall stand together
One by one
This world is sacred
I'm coming home
War, It's now or never
We shall stand together
One by one

This world is sacred
I'm coming home
Coming home
You chase in twilight and you know
You will be on your own
On your own!

The misery show
I'll be alone in this hour
I face the unknown
Witness the end

I'm bleeding, I'm fading
Here in my final hour
When long lost memories return
And a voice keeps calling

"All dead and gone
It's out of hand, life is in motion
(I'm wishing) Time to wake up
Face the truth"

I'm sinking, I'm drowning
There's no doubt and no regret
(Time to reveal now)
This is no illusion, it is real
Carry on the flame
It's not over now
Watch me, I will rise
Time to reveal now

I know I will not fail anymore
I'm the one forever
All that really matters
Blessed realm
This world is sacred
I'm coming home
War, it's now or never
We shall stand together
One by one
This world is sacred
I'm coming home

Yesterday's gone
There's no today, no tomorrow
I'm raised from the dead
The ritual failed

Now at the gates
I'm left alone in this hour
Driven insane
I am left alone

And now I drown in deepest shadows
While the golden hall is sealed
I'm wishing, I'm fading
And I'm part of the machine

My eyes are the eyes of a dead man
And feel the unholy stream
The source of my power
T-energy, I'm in control
I'M IN CONTROL!!

I will live forever
All that really matters
I'm the one
This world is sacred
I'm coming home
War, it's now or never
We shall stand together
One by one
This world is sacred
I'm coming home

I spread my wings, but keep on falling
I should have known, can't see it coming
(War is over) Whispering in the wind
Just let me out of here
There is no end, there's no way
While all the suffering goes on
All that I know is that I'm not insane
It's not over
