My life served on a plate
For all of you to eat
Take my love and hate
But what is this inside of me?

Pity me, pity me - Don't you pity me
Pity me, pity me - Don't you pity me
Don't you pity me
Don't you pity me

Under everything
Is something that you can't see
I can't even believe
Something is wrong with me

Pity me, pity me - Don't you pity me
Pity me, pity me - Don't you pity me
Don't you pity me
Don't you pity me

You swear that all of this is real
But sometimes I can't seem to feel
Nothing ever satisfies - One day I will realize

Am I really scared
Of something that I don't know?
Do you even care? What is really wrong?

Pity me, pity me - Don't you pity me
Pity me, pity me - Don't you pity me
Don't you pity me
Don't you pity me

You swear that all of this is real
But sometimes I can't seem to feel
Nothing ever satisfies - One day I will realize

Don't you pity me!
Don't you pity me!
Don't you pity me!
Don't you pity me!
Don't you pity me!
Don't you pity me!
Don't you pity me!
