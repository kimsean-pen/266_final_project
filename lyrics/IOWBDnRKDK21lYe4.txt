Well I'm not going to draw my curtains today
No, I'm not going to force a grin today
There's a world outside that's full
of shit but no guts inside to admit it
No, I'm not going to look outside today, today

There's harsh truth in plain view
A room of egg shells that we walk through
There's harsh truth in plain view
But we just stand and watch it as it all falls down
Watch it as it all falls down
Watch it as it all falls down

Not going to draw my curtains
Not going to force a grin today
Because...

There's harsh truth in plain view
A room of egg shells that we walk through
There's harsh truth in plain view
But we just stand and stare

There's harsh truth in plain view
A room of egg shells that we walk through
There's harsh truth in plain view
But we'll just stand and watch it as it all falls down

There's harsh truth in plain view
A room of egg shells that we walk through
There's harsh truth in plain view
But we'll just stand and watch it as it all falls down
Watch it as it all falls down
Watch it as it all falls down, down, down
