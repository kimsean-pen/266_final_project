A terrible mistake was made
The weight would break the backs of ten strong horses tried to save
The castle in the frayed
If you knew, that I could take the pain
Inflicted at thou battle
With faithful arrows
You might get back in the saddle
But It's a special death you say
For me the brown eyed daughter
Once you made it hotter
The thankless holy praise
Is left alone why bother
To cast a stone in water
