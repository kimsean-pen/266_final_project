I see people in love,
This wall is tumbling down,
I see people in love,
This picture's crumbling now,

You scream at me with a hiss,
And I will take it with a kiss,
You scream at me to go,
But then, you go,
You scream at me with a hiss,
And I will take it with a kiss,
You scream at me to go,
But then, you go...

She Goes,
She Goes,
She Goes,
She Goes,
She Goes,
She Goes,
She Goes,
She Goes on and on and,
On and on and,
On and on and,
On and on.

For all the loves I've sqaundered,
Of all the loves I've passed,
For all the times I've splintered, (Huh)
You make me feel so lost

You scream at me with a hiss,
And I will take it with a kiss,
You scream at me to go,
But then, you go,
You scream at me with a hiss,
And I will take it with a kiss,
You scream at me to go,
But then, you go...

She Goes,
She Goes,
She Goes,
She, Goes,
She Goes,
She Goes,
She Goes,
She Goes on and on and,
On and on and,
On and on and,
On and on,
She Goes on and on and,
On and on and,
On and on and,
On and on.

My best and only friend,
We've gone and lost again,
My best and only friend,
We've gone and lost again,
So,

She Goes,
She Goes,
She Goes,
She Goes,
She Goes,
She Goes,
She Goes,
She Goes on and on and,
On and on and,
On and on and,
On and on,
She Goes on and on and,
On and on and,
On and on and,
On and on.
