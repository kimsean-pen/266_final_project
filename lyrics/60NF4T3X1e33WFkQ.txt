I'm going back and forth
been going back and forth
been going back and
I want you to feel
Everything that I feel
It's enough
Pendulous until the sun comes up

I'm going on and off
been going on and off
been going on and off
I'm twisting like a screw
Baby please
Won't you
Show me how to get into it

Baby, oh baby

I'm going in and out
been going in and out
been going in and out
I just don't know what to do
see the truth
To move with you
Stuck between two shades of you

I'm going back and forth
been going back and forth
been going back and forth
And that's just what I do
Baby please
Let us be
And we'll move like nobody can see

Baby, oh baby
Baby, oh baby

I got a brother says he got the right of way
I got a sister says everything will be okay
I got a morrita too, nos ense침칩 este ritmo sucio
I got a brother says he got the right of way
I got a sister says everything will be okay
I got a morrita too, nos ense침칩 este ritmo sucio
I got a brother says he got the right of way
I got a sister says everything will be okay
oh yeah

We're going back and forth
We're going back and forth
