I never thought I would return
To be consumed by you again
Think you're cured
You'd see it come
The folly of a monster love like you

Gray is good, the light is good
We went down to Hollywood
You only get one chance in Tinsel Town
I save the part, the sweetest part
Shook for you

Everything comes around
Bringing us back again
Here is when we start
And where we end

It was thought I would return
To be consumed by you again
But I know a paper moon
The folly of a monster love like you

The pavement smell just after rain
The sun leaps out, it's clear again
I told you how I felt the earth could move
The folly of a monster love like you

Everything comes around
Bringing us back again
Here is when we start
And where we end

Everything comes around
Bringing us back again
Here is when we start
And where we end

Everything comes around
Bringing us back again
Here is when we start
And where we end

Everything comes around
Bringing us back again
Here is when we start
And where we end

Everything comes around
