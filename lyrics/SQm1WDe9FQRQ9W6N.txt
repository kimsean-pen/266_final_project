Why tie a ribbon in her hair?
She knows that he don't even care
Please help her find a way to a better place
Hurt is the way he makes her feel
Pain doesn't seem to be for real

Caroline your time is near
Caroline must wait in here

Lies alone inside her room
Now she knows that she's the fool
Please let her find a way to a better place
Chose to live with too much pain
Sixteen years of life go straight away
