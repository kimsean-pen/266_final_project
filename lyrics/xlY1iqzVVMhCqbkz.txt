All hype, no heart
Brain dead as fuck without a clue
You just follow those around you
I got no respect for the way you dress; you just do this for effect
I've never changed
We might look the same but you're everything I hate
You have no idea just how I got here
And no matter what you do you're just a fake

You'll never understand just what this is
Or what this is about
You'll never fit in with me or my friends
So go fuck yourself
