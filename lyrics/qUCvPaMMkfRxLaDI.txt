"EVERYTHING IS WRONG"
(Gibbs/Hurley/Weidlin)

I want to go back
I want to go home
I had everything planned
Now I don't understand
Why I feel so alone
I don't recognize this place
But I've been here before
I let it all go
Now I don't even know
What I came here for

'Cause everything, everything is wrong
Now all my faith, all my faith is gone
Once there was a time
When I thought I was strong
But everything, everything is wrong

I figured it out
Or so I said
But then I found
When I put it all down
It was all in my head
Now I want to go back
Give up this fight
I'm feeling weak
I'm too tired to sleep
And nothing feels right

Everything, everything is wrong
Now all my faith, all my faith is gone
Once there was a time
When I thought I was strong
But everything, everything is wrong

Everything, everything is wrong
And all my faith, all my faith is gone, gone, gone
Everything, everything is wrong
Once there was a time
When I thought I was strong

I used to understand this
But it's been so very long
Everything that once was right is wrong
