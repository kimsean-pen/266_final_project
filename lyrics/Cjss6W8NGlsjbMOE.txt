You and I, we two
Alone here in this terrace by the sea
The sun is going down
And in your eyes I see the changing colors of the sea

It's time for you to go
The day is done
And shadows stretch their arms to bring the night
The sun falls in the sea and down below
A window lighted sea
Just you and me

You and I, we two
Alone here in this bar with dimming lights
A falling rising room comes from the scene
And soon the bar will close for you and me

But there will always be a song to tell
A story you and I cannot dismiss
That same old simple story of desire
And suddenly that kiss
That kiss

A story you and I cannot dismiss

And suddenly that kiss
That kiss
