Break down the weirs in the brooks
Crush the bulwarks of my soul
Let the rapids run white and foaming

The bad blood cut off my ears
The bad blood blinded my eyes
The bad blood choked up my mouth

Draw the poison from my veins
Let out the bad blood in me
Let the stream run golden and true
Let out the bad blood in me

Drive away the bad and the ugly
Divert the dreary dregs
Pierce a stream that rushes anew

I can't see my path
I don't hear your voice
I have forgotten my song

Draw the poison from my veins
Let out the bad blood in me
Let the stream run golden and true
Let out the bad blood in me

Bleed out the dross and the dead
Bleed out the dross and the dead

The bad blood cut off my ears
The bad blood blinded my eyes
The bad blood choked up my mouth

Draw the poison from my veins
Let out the bad blood in me
Let the stream run golden and true
Let out the bad blood in me

Bleed out the dross and the dead
Bleed out the dross and the dead
