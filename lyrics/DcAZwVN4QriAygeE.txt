Save your breath
My brother
It's not going in
I'm not your disciple
I choose how I sin
I've got a distant memory of previous lives
So don't say I'm not ready
Back off with those knives

You don't know me like you used to
You can leave
But I refuse to
You can tell me that I'm crazy
But I won't stop
And this won't make me

Uh
Oh
Don't tell me I'm not ready
Uh
Oh
Don't tell me
I'm not ready for love
For love

I don't feel connected
To all of your lies
But you can do a kindness
And look me in the eyes
My soul's resurrected
Yeah It's been there before
So, don't say I'm not ready
Till I fall on my sword

You don't know me like you used to
You can leave
But I refuse to
You can tell me that I'm crazy
But I won't stop
And this won't make me

Uh
Oh
Don't tell me
I'm not ready
Uh
Oh
Don't tell me
I'm not ready for love

The course that you have set for me
The shadows you cast over me
The road is getting hard to see
But I'm gonna make it through
Horizons that are outta sight
Lost behind the fading light
I'm ready for what's coming
And they best be ready too

Uh
Oh
Don't tell me
I'm not ready for love
Uh
Oh
Don't tell me
I'm not ready for love
Uh
Oh
Don't tell me
I'm not ready
Uh
Oh
Don't tell me
I'm not ready for love
