Arise mother of misery
Arise as divine sorrow
I offer up all I am
So that you may feast on me
Daughter of the dark
Dance with me to the sound of God's infinite silence
And when the sun rises again
I will be made new

Safe from your touch
From your poison thoughts
And your heart breaking power
If I could see the sun
Just one last time
I would be made new
