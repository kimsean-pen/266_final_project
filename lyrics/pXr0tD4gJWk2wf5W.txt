Quiet rest, with a rope around my neck
I assure you that the time is coming near
Fight them all, break the spirit and the bone
All I care for is what's happening to me
Pushed away and rejected from first day
Aever felt that I am like everyone else
Architects of my intellect and flesh
Always pressured me towards the common frame
So now, chuck it down your throat
See me stand
Among the waves
The slaying hand
Still I am
The dream and fall
A hateful grace
Growing darkness war within
Emptiness
Shadows alter my reflection
Desolation marks my skin
Loneliness
Visions alter my perception
In Isolation, I slowly drown
Vague destination
For words I shout
Victimized by my equals all my life
Consequently rival of the obedient mass
Parody, be submissive to act free
Be what dividend is telling you to be
Mockery of the essence of our kind
In the mirror you see nothing but a farce
Linger on, aiming far but ending close
Bearing excess as an instinct not a choice
Desire, downfall
Possessed by greed and numbers
The more we want it all
The worse we treat each other
Desire, downfall
Possessed by greed and numbers
The more we want it all
The worse we treat each other
Growing darkness war within
Emptiness
Shadows alter my reflection
Desolation marks my skin
Loneliness
Visions alter my perception
In Isolation, I slowly drown
Vague destination
For words I shout
