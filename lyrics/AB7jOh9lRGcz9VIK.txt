Tried to talk politics today
I even thought about my bank account and all the bills I need to pay
Need to get my hair done before it's too late
Got so much going on but I still find a way

'Cause all the roads lead back to you
My destiny and destination is beside you

Ooh, all my thoughts couldn't make me veer off
Find myself lost in you again, find myself lost in you again
And all those days when I couldn't find my way
Find myself lost in you again, find myself lost in you again

No matter what I do I get you as a consequence
And I just can't shake you off my mind
Boy it don't make no sense, north, south east or west
You're the only one that gets me there
Where we going baby I don't care, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

'Cause all the roads lead back to you
My destiny and destination is beside you

Ooh, all my thoughts couldn't make me veer off
Find myself lost in you again, find myself lost in you again
And all those days when I couldn't find my way
Find myself lost in you again, find myself lost in you again

And I don't wanna be found
Unless it's by you, you baby, right now
Your arm's where it's safe and sound
So I am stuck on you, it's not hard to figure out

Ooh, all my thoughts couldn't make me veer off
Find myself lost in you again, find myself lost in you again
And all those days when I couldn't find my way
Find myself lost in you again, find myself lost in you again
All my thoughts couldn't make me veer off
Find myself lost in you again, find myself lost in you again
And all those days when I couldn't find my way
Find myself lost in you again, find myself lost in you again
