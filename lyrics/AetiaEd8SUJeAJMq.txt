if you dig under my feet
you will find things that you don't want to see
things that i hide deep down inside
a menagerie of the tragedy i caused and all of my flaws
and my demons are all that can see
then what would you do ...if you only knew

[chorus]
all of the things that I've done
terrible things... you would never believe
things that I've done
Oh how you'll run
if you knew a single one
all of the things that I've done

would my face give me away
but i know it wont
cause i don't even feel
i just reflect what you expect
so you don't suspect that...
i could be exactly who i am

[chorus]

i know that I'm inflected
but who could have predicted
that monster that I've become
i keep things carefully covered
so no one will discover
that i could be the culprit
I'm sorry i cant help it

[chorus]
