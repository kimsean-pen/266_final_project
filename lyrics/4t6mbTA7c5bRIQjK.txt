I'm building a wall
a fine wall
not so much to keep you out
more to keep me in
I'm building a wall
a fine wall
not so much to keep you out
more to keep me in

Back then on a bomb-site
we were spies among the ruins
Such precocious barbarians
On TV we saw
cold war

I'm leaving the world
It's all wrong
not so much what men are doing
much more what they're not
I'm building a wall
a fine wall
not so much to keep you out
more to keep me in

Jesus and The Man From U.N.C.L.E.
Caesar conquered Gaul
Scouting for centurions
on a Roman wall

"Through the woods, the trees
and further on the sea
We lived in the shadow of the war
Sand in the sandwiches
wasps in the tea
It was a free country"
"Who d'you think you are? Captain Britain?"

I'm building a wall
a fine wall
not so much to keep you out
more to keep me in
I'm losing my head
Well, why not?
More work for the undertaker
means there's less for me
I'm building a wall
a fine wall
not so much to keep you out
more to keep me in
