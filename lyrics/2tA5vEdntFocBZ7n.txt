I can feel the raindrops (the raindrops)
Running down my back
With the words you used to ruin me
You ruin me

And I remember the rain in my eyes
The day you turned to run away
You ruin me!

And... I feel paralyzed, you leave me broken!
And... I feel paralyzed, you leave me so broken

Can you make the pain stop (the pain stop)
Swallow all those thoughts
You used to have, that crippled me
You ruin me

Can you remember the pain in my eyes
The day you turned to run away
You ruin me!

And... I feel paralyzed, you leave me broken!
And... I feel paralyzed, you leave me so broken
You keep me tied down, you're stealing my crown
You leave me hopeless
And I feel paralyzed!

And... I feel paralyzed, you leave me broken!
And... I feel paralyzed, you leave me so broken
You keep me tied down, you're stealing my crown
You leave me hopeless
And I feel paralyzed!

I feel paralyzed!
I feel paralyzed!
