Throwing same things against the wall
keeping same thoughts about nothing at all
maybe nobody notice
I don't want to do anything
they said you have to do something
maybe nobody notice
I can't make anything serious
they need serious things
maybe nobody notice
name your kids in a similar way
then die in a similar way
maybe nobody notice
everything's the same all the same
everyone's the same
everything's the same all the same
everyone's the same
do you talk about me boy
