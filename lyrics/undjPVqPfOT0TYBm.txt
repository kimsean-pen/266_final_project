I was your sailor, your demon, your lover, your overbearing
Best friend hoping for some attention
I saw through your automatic heartache, and now I know
That love is as love was, it's downhill from here...

Should I run a million miles away from every memory of you?
Let that be a lesson to me, think not with my heart but with my head.

No I never really had it in me, did I, did I?
No I never really had it in me, did I, did I?
(No) I never really had it in me, did I, did I?

I was your mattress, your armchair, your TV, your everlasting
Talk show host, mouthing "baby, you're wonderful"
I fell under your control, switch on switch off, robotic
I lost every ounce of myself.

Should I run a million miles away from every memory of you?
Let that be a lesson to me
Think not with my heart but with my head.

No I never really had it in me, did I, did I?
No I never really had it in me, did I, did I?
(No) I never really had it in me, did I, did I?

No I never really had it in me, did I, did I?
No I never really had it in me, did I, did I?
(No) I never really had it in me, did I, did I?

I was your sailor, your demon, your lover, your overbearing
