Hey angel
consider
your position
Afraid to be consumed

Savory
Savoring your sympathy
Hey angel
fly over

and bless me
See you feign surprise
And I'm all eyes

And you're all you need to be

Hey angel
whatever

position
We consider fit
to put you in
You protest your complicity

Easy now

One hand will wash the other
One hand will wash the other
Hey angel
fly over
and bless me
See you feign surprise
And I'm all eyes
And we're all we need to be, need to be
Easy now
One hand will wash the other
One hand will wash the other
