I'm a little lost
Without you
That could be an understatement
Now I hope I have paid the cost
To let a day go on by and not
Call on you

'Cause I'm so busy, I'm so busy
Thinking about kissing you
'Cause I'm so busy, I'm so busy
Thinking about touching you

Now I want to do that
Without entertaining another thought

I'm out on the ocean surf
I'll have to pull myself together

But it's harder I'm not on my turf
Just me and me and those big old waves
Rolling in

'Cause I'm so busy, so busy
Thinking about kissing you
'Cause I'm so busy, I'm so busy
Thinking about touching you

Now I want to do that
Without entertaining another thought

I'm so unfinished
Our love affair
A voice in me
Is telling me to

I'm so unfinished
Our love affair
A voice in me
Is telling me to

I'm so unfinished
Our love affair
A voice in me
Is telling me to

Run, run away
Run, run away

I'm a little lost
Without you
That could be an understatement

I hope your feeling hasn't gone
I hope you need someone in your life
Someone like me

'Cause I'm so busy, so busy
Thinking about kissing you
'Cause I'm so busy, I'm so busy
Thinking about touching you

'Cause I'm so busy, so busy
Thinking about kissing you
'Cause I'm so busy, I'm so busy
Thinking about touching you

Now I want to do that
Without entertaining another thought
