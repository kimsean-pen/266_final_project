I won't back down
I got my crown
And it's mine
It's all mine
[?] design
It takes my time
Because it's mine
It's all mine

At night when the tempest blows out
Where the whirl gets on like a smear of blood
Our bodies mesmerize
It's like a superiour life
I'll touch and tear my way through the light
And our bodies fantasize

I won't back down
I got my crown
And it's mine
It's all mine
[?] design
It takes my time
Because it's mine
It's all mine

At night when the tempest blows out
Where the whirl gets on like a smear of blood
Our bodies mesmerize
It's like a superiour life
I'll touch and tear my way through the light
And our bodies fantasize

On my skin
Under mine
In the end
It's all mine

At night when the tempest blows out
Where the whirl gets on like a smear of blood
Our bodies mesmerize
It's like a superiour life
I'll touch and tear my way through the light
And our bodies fantasize

Won't back down
I got my crown
And it's mine
It's all mine
