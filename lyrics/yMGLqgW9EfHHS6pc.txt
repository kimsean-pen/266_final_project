You hold my hand
The hour's dark
From where I stand
I'll make my mark
Don't hold me back
With softened talk
The way I act
Will hurt your heart

Please, listen close
To what I say
The hour's light
A brand new day
Sometimes, I fall
Harder than most
I can't control
My violent ghosts

You're unstable
You're unable
To control me
Now, unfold me
(Repeat x 2)

A heavy hand
To hold me down
It's all I need
So stand your ground
My fragile bones
Cease to desist
Intentions known
I won't resist

Attention close
Don't close your eyes
Dismantle you
Cut through your lies
Leave me alone
I'll be okay
A softer tone
Will get your way

You're unstable
You're unable
To control me
Now, unfold me
(Repeat x 2)

(Repeat x 4)
