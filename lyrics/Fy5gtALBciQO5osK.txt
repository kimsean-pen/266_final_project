Many men have crossed my way
Promising peace and my soul to save
But I've already heard it all
I have seen what they made with their freedom
But I, I have no need for your God
The shallow truth of your poisonous tongue
Brothers, it's time to make a stand
To reclaim our lives
Because only steel can set us free

Rise my brothers, we are blessed by steel
In my sword I trust!
Arm yourselves, the truth shall be revealed
In my sword I trust!
Tyrants and cowards for metal you will kneel
In my sword I trust
Till justice and reason will wield
In my sword I trust

The sword that shimmers in my hand
Do you have the mind to eat the guilty flesh,-
To drink the blood of those who are to blame?
The time of change is here, unveil your blade!

Rise my brothers we are blessed by steel
In my sword I trust
Arm yourselves the truth shall be revealed
In my sword I trust
Tyrants and cowards for metal you will kneel
In my sword I trust
Till justice and reason will wield
In my sword I trust

Cling your souls to your Gods
Kneel, obey, follow their laws
Deceit, subjugate, cherish their greed
Disdain Verity, glorify futile faith

Glorify futile faith!

Oh Old Man
Bring me a fiery fur coat
Put on me a blazing shirt
Shielded by which I may make war
Lest my head should come to grief
And my locks should go to waste
In the sport of bright iron
Upon the point of harsh steel

Rise my brothers we are blessed by steel
In my sword I trust
Arm yourselves the truth shall be revealed
In my sword I trust
Tyrants and cowards for metal you will kneel
In my sword I trust
Till justice and reason will wield
In my sword I trust
In my sword I trust
