Cleft on a pyramid
has shown you a secret passage
You carelessly force your way in
Smell of death frightens ruthlessly

A sentence of cipher
An unknown, forgotten language
You decipher it as a name
but don't know it welcomes you to death

You are damned...

Many dangers
have wounded you and your friends
Some embalmed corpses
have blinked their eyes - no, that's an illusion

But you feel there's something wrong
You've seen too many corpses
Maybe this is a mass tomb
If not you know you'll never be back

You are doomed...

More and more corpses
Some of them dismembered
and every member embalmed
Now you are horrified to death...

You are doomed...

You enter a hall
Thousands of corpses lying there
Stench smarting your nose
Horror paralyzing all the thoughts

Suddenly all the corpses awake
You're trying to escape
But soon you'll be one of them
Sleeping embalmed beauty sleep...
