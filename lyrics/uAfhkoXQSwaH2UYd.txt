The sounds are calm
When we become the animals
That were made in the jungle

Why you staying so far away?
Minding manners and looking on by
Why don't you come out and play?
And get closer to your animal inside, oh

Baby, I act like the gentleman
That your mama would love
Ooh, get to know me
Baby, you act like a lady
Don't have to cover it up
The things you wanna show me
Make me remember the reason why
I wanted your love, please me slowly
I think you're ready to try
Walk a little closer and

Now take me to your jungle
I'm not afraid
And if you're looking for your animal
Hop in my cage
Crawl in and tear off your hide
Don't talk
Come in (come in)
Gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in (come in)
Gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in (come in)
Gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in (come in)
Gimme what I don't know, don't know, I want
Come in (come in)
Gimme what I don't know, I want

Show me your teeth and then spread your wings
(Spread your wings)
Down and dirty, you're loving me so loud
Play it breeze, but you wild as a stray
(Wild as stray)
Side show it in front of the whole crowd, oh

Baby, I act like the gentleman
That your mama would love
Ooh, get to know me
Baby, you act like a lady
Don't have to cover it up
The things you wanna show me
Make me remember the reason why
I wanted your love, please me slowly
I think you're ready to try
Walk a little closer and

Now take me to your jungle
I'm not afraid
And if you're looking for your animal
Hop in my cage
Crawl in and tear off your hide
Don't talk
Come in (come in)
Gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in (come in)
Gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in (come in)
Gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in (come in)
Gimme what I don't know, don't know, I want
Come in (come in)
Gimme what I don't know, I want

The sounds are calm
When we become the animals
That were made in the jungle
Give it to me now

Now take me to your jungle
I'm not afraid
And if you're looking for your animal
Hop in my cage
Crawl in and tear off your hide
Don't talk
Come in (come in)
Gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in (come in)
Gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in (come in)
Gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in (come in)
Gimme what I don't know, don't know, I want
Come in (come in)
Gimme what I don't know, I want

The sounds are calm
Give it to me now
The sounds are calm
Give it to me now

Come in (come in)
Gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in (come in)
Gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in (come in)
Gimme what I don't know, don't know, I want
Come in (come in)
Gimme what I don't know, I want
