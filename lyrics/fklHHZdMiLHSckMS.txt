Every evening, everyday
Calling for love that's from above
Everyone wanting it for real
Mistaking devotion and love

Isolation, isolation
Isolation, isolation

Surrender to self preservation
And brothers who care for themselves
Life can be touched through perfection
This is like anything else

Isolation, isolation
Isolation, isolation

Mother, I tried, do believe me
I'm doing the best things that I can
I'm ashamed of the things that I've been put through
I'm ashamed of the person who I am

But if you could just see the beauty
These things I could never describe
Pleasurable ways of distraction
This is my wanting cry

Isolation, isolation
Isolation, isolation
Isolation, isolation

Isolation, isolation
Isolation, isolation
Isolation
