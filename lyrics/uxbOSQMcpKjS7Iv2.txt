She can hold my dreams right there in her pocket
And shut down fear with your hand
She's a parachute, bulletproof, oh
And she's the softest place to land
On the front line she's a statue, a safe place to run to
The strength I need to get through every day

So if anybody thinks I'm a hero
When they watch me walk right into the flames
I'm just marching to the sound of her heartbeat
Yeah, I'm a solider but if I'm a solider
She's an army, an army, an army
Yeah, she's an army, an army, an army

I ain't never been one to back down for the battle, yeah
And she knows that better than anyone
When I'm under fire, when it's down to the wire
I know she's my loaded gun

So if anybody thinks I'm a hero
When they watch me walk right into the flames
I'm just marching to the sound of her heartbeat
Yeah, I'm a solider but if I'm a solider
She's an army, an army, an army
Yeah, she's an army, an army, an army, ooh yeah

On the front line she's a statue, a safe place to run to
The strength I need to get through every day

So if anybody thinks I'm a hero
When they watch me walk right into the flames
I'm just marching to the sound of her heartbeat
Yeah, I'm a solider but if I'm a solider
She's an army, an army, an army
Yeah, she's an army, an army, an army
