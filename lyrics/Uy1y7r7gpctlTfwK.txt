Call me by my astral name
Breeding fear through wordless tongue
Heavenly thirst - unspeakable pain
Emptied from all human motion
Confront the faceless wrath

Beckoning silent from a sphere behind space
Through twisted ruins of uncompleted dreams
Sights of towers reaching for the moon
Clawing at the skies - they gonna pull it down

Intensity - I feel the lava rushing through my veins
Stars are reforming - to enter the fourth dimension

Beyond all galaxies
Through timeless eons of frost
Unearthly hunger - angels descent

We are entering dimensions behind space

Beyond all galaxies
Through timeless eons of frost
