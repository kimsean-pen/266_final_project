He watches her while she is sleeping
He wonders if he could watch her forever
He wants to know every secret she keeps
He wants to know what it is that keeps them together
He doesn't know what is real anymore
He tries to read the reflections from her eyes
He never stopped to think about love and direction
He only took the truth from his paranoid lies

Sometimes the beauty starts to die
When it's over
Torture yourself by asking why
But it's over

She watches him as he is leaving
She waits all night 'til he comes home
She fabricates another reason to stay
She's always so afraid of being alone
She doesn't know what is real anymore
She tries to read the reflections from his eyes
She never stopped to think about love and direction
She only took the truth from her paranoid lies

Sometimes the beauty starts to die
When it's over
Torture yourself by asking why
But it's over
