Last night is sinking in
It's in my blood and on my skin
I feel it ringing in my head
Colliding with my day

When you let go of all your fear
The perfect life does not exist

Last night is sinking in
This is the way I deal with things
When I feel nature pressing in
Colliding with my day

When you let go of all your fear
The perfect life does not exist

Release the quaking in the temple now
I feel it shaking in the river now
You can escape but hey, I don't know how
You can escape but hey, I don't know how

Last night has dragged itself back in
Colliding with my day

When you let go of all your fear
The perfect life does not exist
