Somewhere, someone special just for me
Somewhere, someone special must be
Somewhere, someone special just for me
Somewhere, someone special must be

Somebody made for me, somebody made for you
Somebody made for me, somebody made for you
Ask and you'll receive, dear God in Heaven, won't you help me please?

Somewhere, someone special just for you
Somewhere, someone special it's true
Somewhere, someone special just for you
Somewhere, someone special it's true

Somebody made for you, somebody made for me
Somebody made for you, somebody made for me
Ask and you'll receive, dear God in Heaven, won't you help me please?

I've been searching all my life, guess I've looked most everywhere
Many girls have caught my eye but that special one's not there

Somewhere, someone special just for me
Somewhere, someone special must be
Somewhere, someone special just for you
Somewhere, someone special it's true

Somebody made for you, somebody made for me
Somebody made for me, somebody made for you
Ask and you'll receive, dear God in Heaven, won't you help me please?
