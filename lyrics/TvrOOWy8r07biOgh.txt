Looking back upon the path and I, I can't believe my eyes
The boy that I was and the man that I've become
Breaking through some memory I still recall the scene
From across the room like something right out of a dream
And now I sit here trying to find the words to show you my love
But they don't come they just stay locked up in my head
So I will vow until the day this body fades away
To hold you high and I'll sing
When the winter comes I'll scream your name
Don't be afraid of what's beneath
When the reaper comes I'll hold you tight and I'll scream
"Don't you take her away from me
Don't you take her away"
I lived my life of vagabond
The path that I was on, better than leave than leaving broken in the end
But like a moth into the flame, your fire burned away
All of the fear that I held deep inside my heart
And though I like it everyway, you still decided to stay
Dare to look inside and see me for who I am
So I will vow until the day this body fades away
To hold you high and I'll sing
When the winter comes I'll scream your name
Don't be afraid of what's beneath
When the reaper comes I'll hold you tight and I'll scream
"Don't you take her away from me
Don't you take her away"
And I'll see the face that I desire
Don't let it burn away
A small spark that grew into a fire
Don't let it burn away
When the winter comes I'll scream your name
Don't be afraid of what's beneath
When the reaper comes I'll hold you tight and I'll scream
"Don't you take her away from me
Don't you take her away"
And I'll see the face that I desire
Don't let it burn away
A small spark that grew into a fire
Don't let it burn away
