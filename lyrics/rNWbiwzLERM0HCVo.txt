So we've both moved on and I know
that you were the stronger one
it was easy for you to let go
but I'm still in love with you
and I just want you to know
that this pain won't drag me down
are you happier now that im gone?

cause I'm so much higher now
cause I'm so much higher now

let the time fly by like the wind
and open our hearts again
we were born to a world with dead ends
so talk to me as a friend
but limitation is only a world
thats keeping us on the ground
well gravity when will you learn
that I'm so much higher now
that I'm so much higher now
