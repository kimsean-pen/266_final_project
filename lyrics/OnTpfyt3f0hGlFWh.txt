Get up.

Yeah I know you're fucking feelin me now.
And if you're with me standing out in the crowd,
Bounce.

If you got my fucking back then just say (Hell Yeah)
You're down with me and my team (Hell Yeah)
You're fucking sick of the scene (Hell Yeah)
cuz nothing is what it seems.

Let's get to the point.

You know it, you know it, you know it, you know it,
You know it all, you know it all.
Turns out you know nothing at all.

You want it, you want it, you want it, you want it,
You want it all, you want it all.
But you cannot get what you want.

Tonight, I wanna see you moving from side to side.
From the front to the back,
If you're with me, then where the fuck are you at?

Nothing is what it seems.
Nothing is what it seems.

What?

If you got my fucking back then just say (Hell Yeah)
You're down with me and my team (Hell Yeah)
You're fucking sick of the scene (Hell Yeah)
cuz nothing is what it seems.

And if you're keeping it real then I'm keeping it real.
So if you're with me, then where the fuck are you at?
