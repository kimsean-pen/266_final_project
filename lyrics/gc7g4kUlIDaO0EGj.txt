I seen the shadows and you were blocking my light
Didn't know for two years that I was living your lie
You covered all your tracks so perfectly clear
You never talked, told me everything I wanted to hear

Oh, I never thought I'd hear myself say:
"Go, get out of my life, outta my bed, you're wasting my time.
Just go! This time for sure, we're so no more!
Conversation over!"

Go! Get out! Go, go!
Get out! Go, go!

You had it all, had everything then you threw it all away
I tried but couldn't get you higher than the cocaine
I'm sick and tired of trying to save your life
Only you can!

Never thought I'd hear myself say:
"Go, get out of my life, outta my bed, you're wasting my time.
Just go! This time for sure, we're so no more!
Conversation over!"

Go! Get out! Go, go!
Get out! Go, go!

Out of my head, out of my life, wasting my time
Out of my bed, get what I said.
I'm out of my head, out of my life, wasting my time.
Out of my head!

I tried to fix you, tried to help you, tried to understand
But we always end up right back here again
I'm out of hope, end of the rope and I'm scared to death how the story ends.

Never thought I'd hear myself say:
"Go, get out of my life, outta my bed, you're wasting my time.
Just go! This time for sure, we're so no more!
Conversation over!"
Conversation over!
Conversation over!
Go! Get out! Go, go!
Get out! Go, go!
Get out! Go, go!
Get out! Go, go!
