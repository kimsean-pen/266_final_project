I've been falling fast through the trees
Tripping over the vines and the leaves
I'm done
Feels like we're both choking to breathe
Holdin' tight to a false memory
I'm done

We aim and shoot the breeze
Falsify the common things
Make no bones about it
I wish that we could make a change
Give up the ghost and walk away
Show ourselves that we can do without it

Once you know better, it's hard to retreat
Can't ignore how I feel, now I know what I need
It's you, it's you
Once you know better, it's hard to go back
Rather live in the present than hide in the past
With you, with you

I won't pretend you weren't more than a friend
And I won't ignore how it hurt at the end
I won't pretend you were more than a friend
And I won't ignore how it hurt at the end
I'm done
I'm done

Holding on by the skin of our teeth
Drag our heels in the dust 'til we bleed
I'm done
Nothing left for our egos to prove
Now we know there's too much to lose
I'm done

We'll find a flame within the freeze
Unlock the words, hear what we mean
Make no bones about it
Let's turn and face the strange
Give up the ghost and walk away
Show ourselves we can do without it

Once you know better, it's hard to retreat
Can't ignore how I feel, now I know what I need
It's you, it's you
Once you know better, it's hard to go back
Rather live in the present than hide in the past
With you, with you

I won't pretend you were more than a friend
And I won't ignore how it hurt at the end
I won't pretend you were more than a friend
And I won't ignore how it hurt at the end
I'm done

I'm done
I'm done
I'm done
I'm done
I'm done
I'm done
I'm done

Once you know better, it's hard to retreat
Can't ignore how I feel, now I know what I need
It's you
