I saw you in a photograph
The answer is in your eyes
It's dragging me back to everything else we left behind
You're hiding inside the perfect life
A picture of us
I'm hearing you whisper alibis

There is a shadow here,
but there's no light behind me
There's stains of blood on the floor,
served to remind me
The time is drawing near
Turns like a knife inside me
I've never wanted it more,
Come stand beside me

The walls are moving closer now
This feeling won't wash away
The message is clear, there's nobody here
Just walk away
I'm moving for you, I'm all alone
And through the wall, I'm hearing you whisper alibis

There is a shadow here,
but there's no light behind me
There's stains of blood on the floor
served to remind me
The time is drawing near
Turns like a knife inside me
I've never wanted it more,
Come stand beside me

(there's a shadow that we cast aside in the blood that we left behind)
I've never wanted it more,
Come stand beside me
(there was never any light behind, I feel it turn like a knife inside me)
I've never wanted it more,
Come stand beside me
Come stand beside me
