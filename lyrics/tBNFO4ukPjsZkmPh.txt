Little lamb that you are
Now you've wandered too far
And you can't find your car
You don't know where you've been
When the night closes in
You feel it under your skin
You won't let me in

You can switch it off and on
You were here but now you're gone
From your head down to your toes
It's just how the shock wave goes
And you're running all the way
When will you be here to stay
You were with me all the time
Now you're out of sight and out of mind

And you look like a dove
Something sent from above
Always in and out of love
You try to run but you slip
Now you got a bloody lip
You just can't get a grip
You won't let me in

You can switch it off and on
Now you're here and now you're gone
From your head down to your toes
It's just how the shock wave goes
And you're running all the way
When will you be here to stay
You were with me all the time
Now you're out of sight and out of mind

Little lamb that you are
Now you've wandered too far
And you can't find your car
You don't know where you've been
When the night closes in
You feel it under your skin
You won't let me in, yeah

You can switch it off and on (on)
You were here but now you're gone (gone)
From your head down to your toes (toes)
It's just how the shock wave goes (goes)
And you're running all the way (way)
When will you be here to stay (stay)
You were with me all the time (time)
