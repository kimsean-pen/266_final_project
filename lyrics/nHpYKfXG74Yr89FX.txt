Butterfly butterfly burning up my only sky
This is your highway this is your heart
Never felt more far away than when I fly
My heart is a violin
And I feel my skin coming off of me again

Bu-bu-bu-butterflew up up and forgot about the only things I knew ohoh
Oh my god as I grew up up that I knew ya

Pulling up gettin' down
This whole place is crazy town
Music bumping and the lights come down
Never felt at home in any place I found
Oh I live in a cold wet wind
And I feel the chill coming over me again

Bu-bu-bu-power grew up up and forgot about the only things I knew ohoh
Oh my god how I flew up up
And the crowd went hush
And the worldwind shook
And my body was crushed by the loose window
That I knew ya that I knew ya
