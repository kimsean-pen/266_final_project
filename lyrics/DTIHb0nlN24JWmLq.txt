When I can't find the words to say how much it hurts.
You are the healing in my heart.
When all that I can see are broken memories.
You are the light that's in the dark.

You are the Song, You are the Song
I'm singing
You are the air, You are the air
I'm breathe in
You are the hope, You are the hope.
I'm needing
Whoa... You are

And when my circumstance leaves me with empty hands.
You're the provider of my needs.
When all my dirtiness has left me helpless.
You are the rain that washes me.

You are the Song, You are the Song
I'm singing
You are the air, You are the air
I'm breathe in
You are the hope, You are the hope.
I'm needing
Whoa... You are

You are the Song, You are the Song
I'm singing
You are the air, You are the air
I'm breathe in
You are the hope, You are the hope.
I'm needing
Whoa... You are

If I had no voice.
If I had no tongue.
I would dance for You like the rising sun.
And when that day comes and I see Your face
I will shout Your endless glorious praise.
If I had no voice.
If I had no tongue.
I would dance for You like the rising sun.
And when that day comes and I see Your face
I will shout Your endless glorious praise.
If I had no voice.
If I had no tongue.
I would dance for You like the rising sun.
And when that day comes and I see Your face
I will shout Your edless glorious praise.

You are the Song, You are the Song
I'm singing
You are the air, You are the air
I'm breathe in
You are the hope, You are the hope.
I'm needing
Whoa... You are

You are the Song, You are the Song
I'm singing
You are the air, You are the air
I'm breathe in
You are the hope, You are the hope.
I'm needing
Whoa... You are
