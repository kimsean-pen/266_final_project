The pleasure to see you smile
I spend hours just to see you sleep
While the world spins in vain
I drink time
An old man spends his solitude
Among the birds at Praça da Sé1
The sunset invades divinely
My living room floor
They come to me red, your kisses
Profoundly sweet, your eyes
See that all can rewind and change
The old man can be me
Deep in your soul there's loneliness
The cold that pleads shelter
They come to me red, your kisses, almost burn me
Profoundly sweet, your eyes, languid face
They come to me red, your kisses, almost burn me
Profoundly sweet, your eyes, languid face
See that all can rewind and change
The old man can be me
Deep in your soul there's loneliness
The cold that pleads shelter
They come to me red, your kisses, almost burn me
Profoundly sweet, your eyes, languid face
They come to me red, your kisses, almost burn me
Profoundly sweet, your eyes, languid face
