Sailin' away on the crest of a wave, it's like magic
Oh, rollin' and ridin' and slippin' and slidin', it's magic
And you and your sweet desire
You took me, oh, (higher and higher, baby)

It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a givin' thing
What a terrible thing to lose

I'm takin' a dive
Dive

Makin' believe this is what you've conceived
From your worst day (I'm takin' a dive)
Oh, movin' in line, then you look back in time
To the first day (I'm takin', I'm takin')
And you and your sweet desire (Don't you do it, don't you do it)
You took me, oh, (higher and higher, baby)

It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a givin' thing
What a terrible thing to lose

I'm takin' a dive
All the same
Hey

Takin' a dive, 'cause you can't halt the slide
Floating downstream (I'm takin' a dive)
Oh, so let her go, don't start spoiling the show
It's a bad dream (I'm takin', I'm takin')
And you and your sweet desire (Don't you do it, don't you do it)
You took me, oh, (higher and higher, baby)

It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a givin' thing
What a terrible thing to lose

It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a givin' thing
