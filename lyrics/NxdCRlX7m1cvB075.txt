White like the snow
Precious as gold
My love for you
Can light up the world
If painted in black
It won't be undone
'Cuz my love for you
Can always be sung
Who would have thought
Miles apart
My love for you
Is strong from the start
Now that I'm here
You won't fear the dark, no
'Cuz my love for you
Is an undying spark
Go tell your friends
This one's for you
Let it be heard
That your man is true
This one's for you
