Sitting on the porch smoking cigarettes
Wishing I could float away and get out of my head
Dreaming about a place where its always summer time
Taking about a place where the sun always shines

I found where the wild ones roam
The sandy beach is where they make their home
Surf all day and party all night
My West Coast Brothers, man they got it right

Sitting on the porch thinking of better times
Going to the happy place way in the back of my mind
Dreaming about a place where the water is warm and clear
Talking about place where its summer time all year

I found where the wild ones roam
The sandy beach is where they make their home
Surf all day and party all night
My West Coast Brothers, man they got it right

Sitting on the porch smoking cigarettes
Wishing I could drift away and live on the coast instead
Dreaming about a place where the future is always bright
Talking about a place where I cloud live a simple life...

I found where the wild ones roam
The sandy beach is where they make their home
Surf all day and party all night
My West Coast Brothers, man they got it right
