through war-hollowed buildings and forests of trash,
the tar-thickened waters and wastelands of ash,
now freed of flesh, speeding through the clouds,
the kiss-chase starts as our bones break down,
a nuclear sunset sounds;
the hole where life, for us, was drowned

through cavernous ice floes
and mountains of shale,
the daisy-swept meadows
and oceans so pale.
we'll meet on the iceblink,
some secrets we'll share,
while prismatic light-beams
add color to air.
leave inhibitions there,
the godless skies left unaware...

radiation filled the space where
angels ought to be.
with a disaffected smile she turned
and said to me (this is forever)

whatever cloud you're on i will find you,
i will find you
in time.
