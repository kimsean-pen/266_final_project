Silver couches to recline upon
And ornaments of gold
Silver moonbeans dance in fountains
Below shining citadels

Surrounded by silver gates
Ascending silver stairs
Eureka on angelic prayer
Wafts in and scents the air

With ornaments of gold
Warm my soul from the growing cold
Ornaments of gold

We can drink from silver vessels
We can feed from silver bowls
Then I'll give you gilded treasures
Anointed by intoxicating oils

Drenched in riches unimagineable
Your splendor drips with jewels that are so beautiful

And ornaments of gold
Warm my soul from the growing cold

Adorable
Rewardable you
From head to toe
I'd love to cover you
And smother you
With ornaments of gold

Ornaments

In honeydew
I'd love to cover you
Oh lover do bring
Ornaments of gold

Protect our hearts from the cruel world

Ornaments of gold
Ornaments of gold
