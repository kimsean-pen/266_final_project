The sky is cryin', look at the tears roll down the street
The sky is cryin', look at the tears roll down the street
I been lookin' for my baby, yeah, an' I wonder where can she be

I saw my baby early one mornin', an' she was walkin' on down the street
I saw my baby early one mornin', an' she was walkin' on down the street
You know it hurt me so bad, yeah, it made my poor heart skip a beat

I got a bad feelin', my baby don't love me no more
I got a real bad, bad feelin', my baby don't love me no more
You know the sky is cryin', yeah, the tears rollin' down my nose

The sky is cryin', look at the tears roll down the street
