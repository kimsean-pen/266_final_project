Sleep all day
Just waiting for the sun to set
I hang my clothes
Up on the line

When I die
I'll hang my head beside the willow tree
When I'm dead
Is when I'll be free

And you can take my body
Put it in a boat
Light it on fire
You can use the kerosene

Take my body
Put it in a boat
Light it on fire
Send it out to sea

Woo, woo

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Sleep all day
Just waiting for the sun to set
I hang my clothes
Up on the line

When I die
I hang my head beside the willow tree
When I'm dead
Is when I'll be free

So you can take my body
Put it in a boat
Light it on fire
Use the gasoline

Take my body
Put it in a boat
Light it on fire
Send it out to sea
