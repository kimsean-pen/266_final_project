dream it all the time, girl
Waking up warm in your arms and without a care
Nobody ain't a problem, girl
Just give me the time and the place, and I'll be there Oh oh
[Pre-Chorus] Cause I would go the distance for you, baby I'd travel 'round the world if you would let me
I'll meet you where the sun it always shines You're on my mind, all the time We are not wasting this
Cause you and I we're good together, oh
You always get me feeling better
And I know you stay by my side
You make me feel much better Cause girl we're good together

And I tell you all too much, girl But I want you to know what you got is a natural gift
I don't wrap you all the time, girl Don't wanna be rude but
I would, do you catch my drift? Yeah [Pre-Chorus] Cause I would go the distance for you, baby
I'd travel 'round the world if you would let me
I'll meet you where the sun it always shines
You're on my mind, all the time We are not wasting this
Cause you and I we're good together, oh
You always get me feeling better
And I know you stay by my side
You make me feel much better
Cause girl we're good together

Oh, you know I would go the distance
Just to be amongst your presence
Cause I am losing my mind
Every second of time Keep wait
Cause you and I we're good together, oh
You always get me feeling better
And I know you stay by my side
You make me feel much better
Cause girl we're good together
Cause you and I we're good together, oh You always get me feeling better
And I know you stay by my side
You make me feel much better
Cause girl we're good together, oh

Stay by my side Stay by my side
