I woke up this morning with a grudge the size of a short story
Oh, I feel, I feel so low
Let me start at the end
The part I haven't figured out yet
Yes I am, I'm moving slow
You are playing the lead
The headache that my actions feed
Oh I've only got myself to blame
This is another test which I would fail when at my best
Always ending the same

If I were an honest guy
I'd give this role another try

What do I do when I'm so in love with you
I forgot what I wanted to say
What do I do when you won't change your ways
It's time
It's time
If I just save you, you could save me too
If I just save you, then you could save me too

I woke up the next morning, and I didn't see it coming
Oh, your bags were packed and gone
Called all your friends, they said they hadn't seen you yet
Oh, my head is going to explode

If I were an honest guy
I'd give this role another try

What do I do when I'm so in love with you
I forgot what I wanted to say
What do I do when you won't change your ways
It's time
It's time
If I just save you, you could save me too
If I just save you, then you could save me too

I believe in the finer things and you don't
If I just save you, you could save me too
If I just save you, then you could save, you could save me too

What do I do when I'm so in love with you
I forgot what I wanted to say

What do I do when I'm so in love with you
I forgot what I wanted to say
No one does it, oh
No one does it better
No one does it, oh
No one does it
I woke up this morning with a grudge the size of a short story
Which now I have told you all
