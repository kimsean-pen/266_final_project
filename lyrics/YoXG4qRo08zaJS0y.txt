Yes it's number 1, it's Top of the Pops

I've just come in at number 25
I'm oh so happy, so glad to be alive
And everybody says it's going to get to the top
Life is so easy when your record's hot

Go tell my mama and my sister too
To press my trousers and polish my shoes
I might even end up a rock and roll God
It might turn into a steady job
And my agent said to me,? Son, I always told you so"

Now my record's number 11 on the BBC
But number seven on the N.M.E.
Not the Melody Maker want to interview me
And ask my view on politics and theories on religion

Now my record's up to number 3
And a woman recognized me and started to scream
This all seems like a crazy dream
I've been invited to a dinner with a prominent queen
And now I've got friends that I never knew I had before

It's strange how people want you when you record's high
'Cos when it drops down they just pass you by
Now my agent called me on the telephone
He said,? Son your record's just got to number 1?

And you know what this means?
This means you can earn some real money
