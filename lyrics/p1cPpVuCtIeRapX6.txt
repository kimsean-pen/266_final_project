I can't talk
I was blinded by your beauty
I am choked
By the things you never said
In silence lies no beauty when the words you said not truly made their point
And so I choke

How can I understand
How you disappeared like a thief in the night
How can I understand
How you vaporised like ether my love

And so I smile
To hide all my sorrow
In a while
You'll just be one more scar
A scar that will remind me of your cold and painful beauty
But I will
I will survive

How can I understand
How you disappeared like a thief in the night
How can I understand
How you vaporised like ether my love

How on earth are you able
To put me with the trash
Treating me like a stranger
Amputating all we had
You told me you do love me
Is this the way to show
Why did you give me that final blow

And so I smile
To hide all my sorrow
In a while
You'll just be one more scar

How can I understand
How you disappeared like a thief in the night
How can I understand
How you vaporised like ether my love
