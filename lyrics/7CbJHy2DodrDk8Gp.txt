I'm in love, alright
With my crazy beautiful life
With the parties, the disasters
With my friends all pretty and plastered
Every night we're down to go out
Waking up on a different couch
'Til the next night on the next flight
Yeah, I guess we're doin' alright
Oh, oh, oh, we're fallin' in love
Oh, oh, oh, 'til the sun's comin' up
Oh, oh, oh, just livin' the life
Oh, oh, oh
Every single night we fight
To get a lil' high on life
To get a lil' something right
Something real, at least we try
Time after time
Tried dodging all the douche bag guys
Tried trading all the wasted times
For something real in this crazy life
I just hope some people see
There's nothing that I'm trying to be
Let me just stop, all the shit talk
I know I'm the new bitch on the block
I've been through my sketchy phases
Been broke, been a shitty waitress
But I'm not now, guess it worked out
Got here by runnin' my mouth
Oh, oh, oh, we're fallin' in love
Oh, oh, oh, 'til the sun's comin' up
Oh, oh, oh, just livin' the life
Oh, oh, oh
Every single night we fight
To get a lil' high on life
To get a lil' something right
Something real, at least we try
Time after time
Tried dodging all the douche bag guys
Tried trading all the wasted times
For something real in this crazy life
Every single night we
Every single night we fight
To get a lil' high on life
To get a lil' something right
Something real, at least we try
Time after time
Tried dodging all the douche bag guys
Tried trading all the wasted times
For something real in this crazy life
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
