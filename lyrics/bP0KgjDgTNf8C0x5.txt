Baby, baby you wanna run with me
To Marrakech, to Marrakech?
Baby, baby you wanna run with me
To Marrakech, to Marrakech? (Ooh)
Baby, baby you wanna run with me
To Marrakech, to Marrakech? (She did)
Baby, baby you wanna run with me?

When the sun comes up
We can tell a new lie
You can tell in my eye
And baby, drive, just drive
When the sun comes up
We can tell a new lie
You can tell in my eye
Just baby, drive, just drive

Drive

Baby, baby you wanna run with me
To Marrakech, to Marrakech?
Baby, baby you wanna run with me
To Marrakech, to Marrakech? (Ooh)
Baby, baby you wanna run with me
To Marrakech, to Marrakech? (She did)
Baby, baby you wanna run with me
To Marrakech?
