lies and deceiving is what i'm believing
up to my knees so hard to breathe
it helps that you aren't there
can't figure out what's the right thing for me
guess i'll have to wait and see

so understanding but so far from the truth
it's what i have to live with
it's not all i wanted to be
it's not all i wanted to see
i can't keep on leading
i've left what i'm leaving
guess that's just what i believe

consciously taking and overly faking
i can't believe all the things that you're saying
seems all so simple it's all up to you
time after time
you lost what you couldn't find
it's what you could (what you could)
it's only what you could (its what you could)
don't take what you could
but i know what's up

so understanding but so far from the truth
it's what i have to live with
it's not all i wanted to be
it's not all i wanted to see
i can't keep on leading
i've left what i'm leaving
guess that's just what i believe
