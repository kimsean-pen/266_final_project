In our term
Oh, we never know for sure
Oh, you followed the people
Really got nothing on you
Why do they make you feel small?

Anyway

In silence
It's alright
You can be the beautiful one
Shine a light
Of broken sounds
Between language and thought

Holding on to pictures you want to believe
Oh, ignorant bliss to set you free

Anyway

And when it's gone, it's gone for you like all of us
Want to belong, belong here
And when it's gone, it's gone for you like anyone
Wants to belong, belong here
Wants to belong
Wants to belong
Here

Anyway

How do life
How do life
How do life gives in?
How do life
How do life
How do life gives in?
I hope you work it all out
