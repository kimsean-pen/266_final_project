I'm so into you
I'm so into you
I'm so into you
I'm so into you

Baby, can't you see I got a thing for you
I really like the way you do the things you do
Take control of me, fulfill my fantasies
Here's my pager number, won't you get with me?

It's just the little things you do that turns me on
You really turn me on
And you got it goin' on
I'm into you

I'm so into you
I'm so into you
I'm so into you
I'm so into you

My dear, I feel so weak, you knock me off my feet
And it's good to know you love me just for me
I'll be here all the time, I'll never let you go
There is something that I have to let you know

It's just the little things you do that turns me on
You really turn me on
And you got it goin' on
I'm into you

I'm so into you
I'm so into you
I'm so into you
I'm so into you

Well can't you see Aaliyah's got a thing for you
And the second chapter like the things you do
So pull up to my bumper and I'll ride wit' you
And let's go rollin' down a block or two
Now add a little bass to the EQ button
Now all of a sudden I gotta whisper sweet little nothings
Aaliyah told me to tell you to call her
I'm so into you

I'm so into you
I'm so into you
I'm so into you
I'm so into you

I know that you're the one for me
Ooh baby, can't you see?
I'm so into you
And every little thing you do

I'm so into you
I'm so into you
I'm so into you
I'm so into you

I'm so into you
I'm so into you
I'm so into you
I'm so into you
