Take it on the base, take it on the westbound line
Every time I love, I always seem to end up crying
So this is my goodbye, wrote it on the way back home
You say you never loved me, I wish somehow I could have known

One more tear to cry, here come the lonely nights
One more tear to cry, here come the lonely nights

Back in Massachusetts, walking by the old high school
It's just the way I left it, except this time it's without you
Soaking under starlight, just can't keep it from my dreams
My motorcycle red beam (?) is ripping right down, it seems

One more tear to cry, here come the lonely nights
One more tear to cry, here come the lonely nights

One more tear to cry, here come the lonely nights
One more tear to cry, here come the lonely nights
One more tear to cry, here come the lonely nights
One more tear to cry, here come the lonely nights
