Do you ever feel like you just landed on this earth?
You see the creatures all do their dances back and forth
You get restless and then you join them on the floor
Suddenly it's tomorrow

It's not today anymore (X2)

Chorus:

You talk to the ceiling every day
The speakers are shaking
Why do i hear you okay?
They're playing soul at the wrong speed
It sounds right now
What are you doing to me?

D'you ever feel like what we call real life is not so real?
Tripping up on the same old problems you had last year
We'll pretend it's another planet not so uptight
The stars are shining above the city every night
They come every night

Chorus (x1)

Where are we going?
I don't care
Our friends all left
Let's go anywhere
It's getting late
I don't care
It's just you and me
Let's go anywhere
