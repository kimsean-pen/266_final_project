There'll be no strings to bind your hands
Not if my love can't bind your heart
There's no need to take a stand
For it was I who chose to start
I see no need to take me home
I'm old enough to face the dawn

Just call me angel of the morning, Angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, Angel
Then slowly turn away from me

Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow
If morning's echo says we've sinned
It was what I wanted now
And if we're the victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light

Just call me angel of the morning, Angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby.
Just call me angel of the morning, Angel
Then slowly turn away
I won't beg you to stay with me
Through the tears of the day
of the years, baby.

Just call me angel of the morning, Angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, Angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, Darling
Just call me angel of the morning, Angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, Darling
