Oh-oh-oh-oh
Uuh, uuh

Stained coffee cup
Just a fingerprint of lipstick's not enough
Sweet where you lay
Still a trace of innocence on pillow case
Waking up
Beside you, I'm a loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control

Powerless
And I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control

Uuh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Uuh

Taste on my tongue
I don't wanna wash away the night before
In the heat where you lay
I could stay right here and burn in it all day

Waking up
Beside you, I'm a loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control

Powerless
And I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control

Lost my senses
I'm defenceless
Her perfume's holding me ransom
Sweet and sour
Heart devoured
Lying here I count the hours

Waking up
Beside you, I'm a loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control

Powerless
And I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control

Oh-oh-oh-oh
No control
Oh-oh-oh-oh
No control

Powerless
And I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control
