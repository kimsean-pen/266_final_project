In the heat of the summer, better call out a plumber
Turn on the steam pipe, cool me off
With your big crime fighters and your newspaper writers
Still need a drugstore to cure my buzz

Wild in the streets, running, running
Wild in the streets, running, running
Wild in the streets, running, running
Wild in the streets

'64 valiant, hand full of valiums
Couple of beers really do me right
You better believe us, better trust us
Teenage jive, walking wreck

Wild, running

Wild in the streets, running, running
Wild in the streets, running, running
Wild in the streets, running, running
Wild in the streets

Got a gang called the wolves, you have to choose
Play with the boys, you're bound to lose
A bottle in one hand, a can in the other
Don't fool around 'cause they're real mean mothers

Mrs. America, how's your favorite son?
Do you care just what he's done? No!

Wild in the streets, running, running
Wild in the streets, running, running
Wild in the streets, running, running
Wild in the streets

Wild in the streets
Running wild in the streets
Running wild in the streets
We're running wild in the streets

Running wild in the streets
We're running wild in the streets
Running wild in the streets
We're running wild in the streets
