I can tell there's something you
Don't wanna tell me
It's killing you cause the words
Are hard to find
I know you want to break it to me gently
Well sweet baby say what's on your mind
Let 'er rip, Let it fly
Come on baby say it do you think
I'm gonna cry
I ain't about to bawl and I ain't gonna die
So if you're gonna say goodbye
Don't take all day and night
Let 'er rip Let it fly
Why the drama, we don't have to drag
Out this situation
It wasn't you, it wasn't me, sometimes
The chemistry don't ignite
There ain't no rings, no morgage, there ain't any complications
It's just a hyphenated word, get it out and
I'm sure I'll be all right
Let 'er rip, Let it fly
Come on baby say it, do you think
I'm gonna cry
ain't about to bawl, and I ain't gonna die
So if you're gonna say goodbye
Don't take all day and night
Let 'er rip, Let it fly
It ain't no big deal, ain't no great loss
You and I are on the same train of thought
So you don't have to tell me where to get off
Maybe I misunderstood you
But if you're leaving baby would you
Let 'er rip, let it fly
Come on baby say it, do you think
I'm gonna cry
I ain't about to bawl, and I ain't gonna die
So if you're gonna say goodbye
Don't take all day and night
Let 'er rip, let it fly
So, if you're gonna say goodbye
Don't take all day and night
Let 'er rip, let it fly
