Hello it's me
I've thought about us for a long long time
Maybe I think too much but something's wrong
There's something here doesn't last too long
Maybe I shouldn't think of you as mine

Seeing you or seeing anything as much I do you
I take for granted that you're always there
I take for granted that you just don't care
Sometimes I can't help seeing all the way through
(it's important to me...)

(that you know you are free...)
'Cause I never want to make you change for me...

Think of me you know that I'd be with you if I could
I'll come around to see you once in a while

Or if I ever need a reason to smile and spend the night if you think I should
(it's important to me...) Me...

I'll come around to see you once in a while
