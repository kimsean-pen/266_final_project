1) I can remember when,
You were always there.
Everyday was made for you,
You每 always felt my hand.
Forever, I hear you say,
That you needed me.
Forever, I hear you say,
That you can't.

Ref: When I每 needed your lovin,
You were always by my side.
When I needed your lovin
You were always by my side.

2) Just way that love每 you show me,
What it means to feel good.
You opened up my world,
And show me that we could.
Be only won, be only know,
Then you left me alone.

Ref: When I每 needed your lovin,
You were always by my side.
When I needed your lovin,
You were always by my side.
By my side
By my side
