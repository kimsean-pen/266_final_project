I don't want to give you up
I don't want to hold you up
I don't want ambiguous
I just know that I've had enough
I want you to travel with me
Let loose and let your mind go free
Show you things that you've never seen
You've just gotta go with me

Ooh
Your love is so good
That I want to show you
Don't make me responsible
For something that you can't find
Ooh
Your lovin' is so good, so good
The closer
I want it, I want it
Into me
I want it, I want it
Reel it in
I want it, I want it
I wanna get closer to you, Baby
Experience
I want it, I want it
Generous
Lay down what's impedin' you
Cause I want to get closer to you, Baby

I don't want to give you up
I'm tired of the pull and push
I'm tired of the makin' love
Don't you feel like you've had enough

I want you to journey with me
Explore all the hidden scenes
I don't mind just a bit of tension
But we've got to move in the same direction

Ooh
Your love is so good
That I want to show you
Don't make me responsible
For something you that you can't find
Ooh
Your lovin' is so good, so good
The closer
I want it, I want it
Into me
I want it, I want it
Reel it in
I want it, I want it
I wanna get closer to you, Baby
