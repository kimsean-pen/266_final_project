Crossed my heart, broke your promise, told me lies
Why did you watch me suffer?
Make me feel like I deserved to
Everybody takes everybody breaks
Somebody's heart leaving someone alone
But this felt more like you ripping flesh from bone.

You made a mess outta me
Where do I begin?
You pay for your sins.

Like a reckoning
You never saw coming
I'm the reaper outside your door
You took everything
Made me feel less than nothing
I'm getting what I came for
Like the sound of falling stars
Crashing in the dark
I said a prayer and buried your name
And up through the ashes
I rose like wildfire
The Reckoning

I gave you more than my heart could hope for
You misused it
Scraped up every piece that fell to the floor
When you tore through it
Laying me to ruin, you knew what you were doing
Leaving me just skin and bone
But trusting you was no one's fault but my own
You get what you give, so take your last breath 'fore I lay you to rest

Like a reckoning
You never saw coming
I'm the reaper outside your door
You took everything
Made me feel less than nothing
I'm getting what I came for
Like the sound of falling stars
Crashing in the dark
I said a prayer and buried your name
And up through the ashes
I rose like wildfire
The Reckoning

I should've known better than that
I should've known all along
I should've known better than that
I should've known but now I'm moving on...

Like a reckoning
You never saw coming
I'm the reaper outside your door
You took everything
Made me feel less than nothing
I'm getting what I came for
Like the sound of falling stars
Crashing in the dark
I said a prayer and buried your name
And up through the ashes
I rose like wildfire
The Reckoning

You never saw coming, you never saw me coming
The Reckoning
I'm the reaper outside your door
I am The Reckoning
For every wrong you did to me
I am The Reckoning
