Want to, want to hang on
Yeah, I got you
We're gonna make it through
One life to live
Please don't give up yet, 'cause
We got so much to do

And we all have a life, have a life
I'll go to war, baby

Just come back to life, back to life
We will survive
We're gonna see this through

Even when we're way down
Way down low
We dream, yeah
We dream on up
When we're way down
Way down low
The stars light a new hope in us

Ay-ah, Ay-ah, Ay-ah

Just come back to life, back to life
We will survive
We're gonna see this through

Even when we're way down

Fight for your love
