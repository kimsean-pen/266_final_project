Before I go please know I'm trying
trying to be a better man
before I leave please don't get angry
just try your ass and take my hand

I will make this right, oh I will try

Jenny, don't you cry
Close your eyes
Everything is gonna be alright
You're so young and still so free
Jenny, take my hand
I understand
I will try to be a better man
Without you there is no me
Jenny.

There is a boy
Inside me runnin'
From a man I've yet to meet
I see your space, it only scares me
I hope things change, eventually

I will make this right, oh I will try

Jenny, don't you cry
Close your eyes
Everything is gonna be alright
You're so young and still so free
Jenny, take my hand
I understand
I will try to be a better man
Without you there is no me
Jenny.

Jenny

I will make this right, oh I will try

Jenny, don't you cry
Close your eyes
Everything is gonna be alright
You're so young and still so free
Jenny, take my hand
I understand
I will try to be a better man
Without you there is no me
Jenny.
