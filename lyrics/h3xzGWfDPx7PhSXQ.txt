Here we all feel alive*
Here we use our minds
Let us form together
Use our minds
Recreate, redesign
Visualize it

With a new world in our hands, we will gain control
With a new world in our hands, we will gain control

Re-a-LIZE that you will never feel this way again (again)
And what you want is right in front of your eyes (this is the life)
So take it in, and embrace

No more wasted faith, 'cause we are wrong
No more wasted faith, 'cause we are wrong ('cause we are wrong)

Don't let it be easy
You needed such a direction to visualize perfection
Visualize perfection

We are wrong, We are free
This is serenity

Stop holding on for nothing
I'm ready to face this world and gain control

With a new world in our hands
With a new world in our hands
With a new world in our hands
With a new world in our hands
Gain control

No more wasted faith, 'cause we are wrong
We are at ease with the way we've grown
And only when the timing's right
We can start to feel the stars align

Don't let it be easy
Visualize perfection
Stop holding on for nothing
Visualize perfection
