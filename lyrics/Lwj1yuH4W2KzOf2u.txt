Was it already there in the womb?
Were we pulled out way too soon?
Were we quiet too long?
Were we too small?
Or were we dropped on the floor?

Could it be something we ate?
Did they let us stay up too late?
Were there not enough rules?
Did we get too much love?
Was it something they taught us in school?

'Cause inside something bad's awakened
The evil opens it's eyes
The temper's rising and the house is shaking
To get out is no longer an option
These are the deeds of the beast

We're the kids who wanna play with the dead
We must have lost our minds
'Cause we might lose our heads
We're the kids who wanna play with the dead
See us, pretty brides, and the evil we wed
Oh Lord, we play with the dead

Was it something we saw on TV?
The films that were gross and obscene?
Is it the clothes and the black-dyed hair?
Or were we just not aware?

There must have been some dangerous toys
And the music sings of murderous ploys
It's not like we did not have a choice
Backward masking gives the devil a voice

'Cause inside something bad's awakened
The evil opens it's eyes
The temper's rising and the house is shaking
To get out is no longer an option
These are the deeds of the beast

We're the kids who wanna play with the dead
We must have lost our minds
'Cause we might lose our heads
We're the kids who wanna play with the dead
See us, pretty brides, and the evil we wed
Oh Lord, we play with the dead

To get out is no longer an option
These are the deeds of the beast

We're the kids who wanna play with the dead
We must have lost our minds
'Cause we might lose our heads
We're the kids who wanna play with the dead
See us, pretty brides, and the evil we wed
Oh Lord

Now we wanna play with the dead
We lose our heads
Now we play with the dead
We lose our heads
Oh Lord
Oh Lord
Oh Lord
Now we play with the dead
