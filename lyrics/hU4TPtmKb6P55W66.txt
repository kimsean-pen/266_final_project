Time moves so strangely when you're moving all the time
Can't wait to see you, baby
When it's over and you're mine
All we ever wanted was a heart that kept on trying
Searching for some magic
Freeze from the thought of dying

I'm feeling kinda tired
But I know it's for the best
Even when you're dreaming, you're not getting any rest
Grasping at the meaning of a love to call my own
Wish it were as easy as just picking up the phone

Time moves so strangely when you're moving all the time
Can't wait to see you, baby
When it's all over and you're mine
All we ever wanted was a heart that kept on trying
Find myself some magic
Freeze from the thought of dying

I'm feeling kinda tired
But I know it's for the best
Even when you're dreaming, you're not getting any rest
In the darker hour when you're far away from home
Never sure exactly of the last time you were known

Wish it were as easy as just picking up the phone
Wish it were as easy as just picking up the phone

Time moves so strangely when you're moving all the time
Can't wait to see you, baby
When it's over and you're mine
When it's over and you're mine
When it's over and you're mine
