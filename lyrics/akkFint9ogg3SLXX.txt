What is this information
That sits before my eyes
I feel the need to spend some cash I feel the need to buy
I see the bright colors and shapes that hypnotize
Transmissions to my brain
They were in disguise
I was in a place
I could feel the change
I slipped into a darkness
Of colors and haze
This useless information that feeds upon my brain
Transmissions to my brain
They were in disguise
You're now hypnotized
You're now hypnotized
Hold on to you're life
Hold on to you're life
What's left of me I cannot see
Because my eyes they burn
Erosion of my clarities
My darkness of concern
This useless information that I cannot help
I feel the need for merchandise
I feel the need for help
The images of violence
That burn inside my soul
-I feel the need for food because that just what i'm told
This useless information that I don't want no more
This useless information turning me into a whore
You're now hypnotized
You're now hypnotized
Hold on to you're life
You're now hypnotized
You're now hypnotized
Hold on to you're life
(WAKE UP)
(WAKE UP)
(WAKE UP)
