There's a song playing
On the radio
Sky high in the airwaves
On the morning show

And there's a lifeline slipping
As the record plays
And as I open the blinds in my mind
I'm believing that you could stay

And, oh, if you stay, I'll chase the rain blown fields away
We'll shine like the morning and sin in the sun
Oh, if you stay, we'll be the wild ones
Running with the dogs today

There's a song playing
Through another wall
All we see and believe is the
DJ and the debts dissolve

And it's a shame the plane is leaving
On this sunny day
'Cause on you my tattoo will be bleeding
And the name will stain

But, oh, if you stay we'll ride from disguised suburban graves
We'll go from the bungalows where the debts still grow each day

And, oh, if you stay, I'll chase the rain blown fields away
We'll shine like the morning and sin in the sun
Oh, if you stay, we'll be the wild ones
Running with the dogs today

We'll be the wild ones
Running with the dogs today

Oh, if you stay
oh, if you stay
oh, if you stay
Oh, if you stay
oh, if you stay
oh, if you stay
Oh, if you stay
oh, if you stay
oh, if you stay
