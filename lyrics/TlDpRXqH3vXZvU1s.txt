Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo

Dance with my dogs in the night time (wroof)
Trap niggas with the chickens like Popeyes (Popeyes)
Money changing colors like tie-dye (tie-dye)
I am just tryna get it, I ain't trynna die (no)
She got a big ol onion booty, make the world cry (cry)
In the kitchen, wrist twisted like its stir-fry (whip it)
Hold them bands down (hey)
Hold your mans down (hey)
Who told you come around? (who?)
This that trap sound (sound)
Designer clothes, fashion shows
Trap house, made of gold
Control the bag now (control it)
No need to brag now
And put the mask down (mask)
We living fast now (fast)
Finest hoes, wrist froze

We can go, coast to coast

Keep watchin' me whip up, still be real in fame
Dance with my dogs in the night time, yeah (woo, woo, woo, woo, wroof)
In the kitchen, wrist twisted like its stir-fry (whip it)

Offset
Make her whip it, intermission, let the birds fly (brrr)
I get money, tunnel vision through my third eye (money)
In that skillet, watch me flip it like its Five Guys (flip it)
Look at my drip, check out the ceiling, look at the blue skys
I took a tech check (yeah)
Booties, they sit on lap (ice)
I don't regret shit, yeah, I am praying I don't got no debt
You crawl 'fore you walk, you can ball every week
For my dogs 'hind the wall, we gon' ball when you free (ball)
Stop watching me, democracy, you wanna copy me
Life's Monopoly, go cop me some land and property

AP froze (whoa)
Pink diamonds, whoa (whoa)
Whip up the soda, diamonds off the warder

Keep watchin' me whip up, still be real in fame

In the kitchen, curry chicken, callin' it stir-fry
Takeoff from the bird keeper, let the birds fly
5's tryna take my pride, you a dead guy
Of course I gotta keep a watch hawk in my bird eye
No cash, get dropped dead, fresh and I got dead guys
Don't discriminate, ball players come on all sides

Finger roll, post move up so we can roll
They mad that way we went, they think we used a cheat code
Why'd you keep lookin' at me, I feel like a nigga got static
It must be the Patek

Pockets blue cheese, I am in the kitchen
