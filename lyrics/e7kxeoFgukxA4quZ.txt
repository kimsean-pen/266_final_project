You keep falling for the wrong type
No I'm not saying you should be mine
I'm just promising you good times
I just wanna show you good vibes

Don't trust men, don't trust women
Don't trust your heart, you never should've

Cause you left your heart in LA
You left your mind in Paris
Traded emotions in for cocaine

Maybe it's right, but just the wrong time
Maybe love's something you won't find
You've been searching for a long time
Now you wanna move on with your life

Don't trust men, don't trust women
Don't trust your heart, you never should've

Cause you left your heart in LA
You left your mind in Paris
Traded emotions in for cocaine

Cause you left your heart in LA
You left your mind in Paris
Traded emotions in for cocaine

Traded emotions
