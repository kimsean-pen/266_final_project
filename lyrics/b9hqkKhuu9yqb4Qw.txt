If the world's going to end then let it end
On my knees and I'm sick to death
Put that bullet in the barrel
And we know what happens next

This is the end
I feel it in my chest
Laid to rest

If the world's gonna end then let it fucking end
I'll be right here as the flame burns bright
We're all dying in slow motion
Nameless, faceless and hopeless

Die without hope got stuck inside my head
Every word I wrote pushed me closer to the end
Dreams of death just for pretend
A final breath, laid to rest

Six feet closer to hell
Going down
Six feet closer to hell, yeah
Six feet closer to hell

A final breath, laid to rest
Six feet closer to hell

A final breath, laid to rest
Six feet closer to hell

These are words for the hopeless
Only they would understand
Cut us open, torn and broken
I feel just like death

Just let me slip away
I have myself to blame
Let the blood fill my lungs
I hear the dead scream my name

If the world's gonna end then let it fucking end
I'll be right here as the flame burns bright
We're all dying in slow motion
Nameless, faceless and hopeless, hopeless, hopeless

Six feet closer to hell
Six feet closer to hell

If the world's gonna end then let it end
On my knees and I'm sick to death
Put that bullet in the barrel
And we know what happens next

This is the end
I feel it in my chest
Laid to rest

Die without hope got stuck inside my head
Every word I wrote push me closer to the end
Dreams of death just for pretend
A final breath, laid to rest

Six feet closer to hell
Going down
Six feet closer to hell, yeah
Six feet closer to hell

A final breath, laid to rest
Six feet closer to hell

A final breath, laid to rest
Six feet closer to hell.
