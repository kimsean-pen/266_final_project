She walks home late at night
As she says her goodbyes
She's close to sacrifice
She knows something ain't right
It ain't easy
And it ain't pleasing
She's just tryna find a way out there
She put our faith in
And all that chasing
She's just tryna find love out there
And she cries
I need you
Like the wave needs an ocean
Like the love needs devotion
I need you
Like the desert pleads for water
Like a mission needs a martyr
I need you
Every minute, every hour
I lay broken like a flower
'Cause I need you, I need you
She's lost her way of life
Feels like a hole inside
She wants to feel alive
And nothing satisfies
It ain't easy
And it ain't pleasing
She's just tryna find a way out there
She put our faith in
And all that chasing
She's just tryna find love out there
And she cries
I need you
Like the wave needs an ocean
Like the love needs devotion
I need you
Every minute, every hour
I lay broken like a flower
'Cause I need you
Like the wave needs an ocean
Like the love needs devotion
I need you
Like the desert pleads for water
Like a mission needs a martyr
I need you
Every minute, every hour
I lay broken like a flower
'Cause I need you
