Vague shadows, purple-toned sky
Full moon and nightbirds on my mind
Cloud demons with wands of doom
Chanting lines of solitude

Boogie bubble refrain, boogie, boogie bubble refrain, again

Upon clouds of purple they ride
Upon clouds of purple they ride, doing evil

Come demon and chant for me
Come bring my eye some mystery
Strange things and stranger one finds
In them cloudlands of my mind

Boogie bubble refrain, boogie boogie bubble refrain, again

Upon clouds of purple they ride
Upon clouds of purple they ride, doing evil

Boogie bubble refrain, boogie boogie bubble refrain, again

Upon clouds of purple they ride
Upon clouds of purple they ride, doing evil

Every boogie bubble holds a demon inside,
Each and every demon rides upon a purple cloud
Every boogie bubble holds a demon inside,
Each and every demon rides upon a purple cloud

Rides upon a purple cloud...
Rides upon a purple cloud...
Rides upon a purple cloud...
Rides upon a purple cloud...
Rides upon a purple cloud...
