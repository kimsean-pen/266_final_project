I've lost the will to
I've lost my way
I've lost this ocean
That poisoned me

People collecting
People collecting
I'm on the move
For you

Oh, and I
Wouldn't lie
What I feel

A bowl of bones, a bowl of skin
To save me from
The hell I'm in, your fantasy
And every time I think of you
I see the dark, I hear the hills
They're coming
They're coming for you

I've lost the will to
I've lost my way
I've lost this ocean
That poisoned me

People collecting
People collecting
I'm on the move
For you

Oh, and I
Wouldn't lie
What I feel

A bowl of bones, a bowl of skin
To save me from
The hell I'm in, your fantasy
And every time I think of you
I see the dark, I hear the hills
They're coming
They're coming for you
