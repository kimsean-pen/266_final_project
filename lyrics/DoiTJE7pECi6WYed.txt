There's no life, without love they say
None worth having anyway, you're a mystery to me some days
that's what keeps me sane, the heart that yearns is always young, you can't

love just anyone, it's been a while since 21, I still feel the same
So take me home, don't spare the horses, wait to salads i need
Take me home, don't spare the horses, wait till the gardens and breze
I don't need to build a house of stone

Cause wherever you are's where I call home
Cause we're just you me, can drink and laugh and dance 'till 3
Cause I have everything I need, when I'm with you alone
Home is where we stay all night, no roof above our starry sky

Outlaw here, 'till the day I die, and our time together's flown
So take me home, don't spare the horses, wait to salads i need
Take me home, don't spare the horses, wait till the gardens and breze
I don't need to build a house of stone

cwherever you are's where I call home

And I know I've made mistakes at times, every now and then I've made you cry, for
that I'm sorry, but they were few and far between, we're closer now than we've ever
been, and you know I'm sorry
I used to wonder, why I'm here, no rhyme no reason would appear, but since we've
met, it's loud and clear, I'm here to see you, home
