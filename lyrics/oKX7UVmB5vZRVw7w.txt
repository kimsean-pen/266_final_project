I, touch the sky,
all around,
your eyes
and who would believe
What's happening to me
Expectations all around
My intuition knows no bounds
I could lose my way on this merry-go-round

So I, like a bird will fly
To see
Just what could it be
And patience I will learn
Before this fire burns
Intuition's got a hold on me
There's magic in the air
I wanna breathe
Change, change all around
Go with the rhythm

The soul sound (mmmmm)
The soul sound (mmm,)
The soul sound (mmmmm)
The soul sound (sound)

So I, like a bird will fly
To see
Just what could it be
(What could it be yeah)
Patience I will learn
Before this fire burns
Intuition's got a hold of me
There's magic in the air
I wanna breathe
Change, change all around
Just go with the rhythm

The soul sound (mmmmm)
The soul sound (mmm)
The soul sound (feeling free)
The soul sound

teda-teda, teda-teda, teda-teda oooh
Soul sound
teda-teda, teda-teda, teda-teda, tedada
Wait a minute soul sound
Ahh, ooh ahh, ooh ahhh, ooh ahhh

The soul sound (mmmmm)
The soul sound (mmmmm)
The soul sound (mmmmm yeah)
The soul sound (mmm, mmm)
The soul sound (wait a minute soul sound)
the last sound, downtown, all around, soul sound
Wait a minute soul sound
(the last sound, downtown, all around, soul sound)
Repeat to fade
