God reached his hand down from the sky
He flooded the land then he set it on fire
He said, "Fear me again, know I'm your father
Remember that no one can breathe underwater"

So bend your knees and bow your heads
Save your babies, here's your future
Yeah, here's your future

God reached his hand down from the sky
God asked Noah if he wanted to die
He said "No sir, oh, no, sir"
God said "Here's your future, it's gonna rain"

So we're packing our things, we're building a boat
We're gonna create the new master race
Cause we're so pure, oh, Lord, we're so pure
So here's your future

God told his son, "It's time to come home
I promise you won't have to die all alone
I need you to pay for the sins I create"
His son said, "I will, but Dad, I'm afraid"

Yeah, so here's your future
Here's your future
Yeah, here's your future
So here's your future

So here's your future
So here's your future
