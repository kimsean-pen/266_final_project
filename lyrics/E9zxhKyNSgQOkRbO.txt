I'm waiting for thunders to see the dust of my old life
I'm taking a breath to see where the shadows slip behind blue light

All of us are lost in this hell
But I sit in the hum of a new sun
What dreams shall come to pass?

I'm waiting myself hidden somewhere in my heart
I'm waiting mercy and decline, that's all we will find
