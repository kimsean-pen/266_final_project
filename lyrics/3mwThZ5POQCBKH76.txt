Where there's music and there's people
And they're young and alive
Driving in your car
I never never wanna go home
Because I haven't got one
Anymore

Take me out tonight
Cause I wanna see people and I
Wanna see lights
Driving in your car
Oh, please don't drop me home
Because it's not my home, it's their
Home, and I'm welcome no more

And if a double-decker bus
Crashes into us
To die by your side
Is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten-ton truck
Kills the both of us
To die by your side
Well, the pleasure - the privilege is mine

Take me out tonight
Take me anywhere, I don't care
Care, care
And in the darkened underpass
I thought: Oh God, my chance has come at last
(But then a strange fear gripped me and I
Just couldn't ask)

Take me out tonight
Take me anywhere, I don't care
Care, care
Driving in your car
I never never wanna go home
Because I haven't got one, da ...
Oh, I haven't got one

And if a double-decker bus
Crashes into us
To die by your side
Is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten-ton truck
Kills the both of us
To die by your side
Well, the pleasure - the privilege is mine

There is a light that never goes out
There is a light that never goes out
There is a light that never goes out
