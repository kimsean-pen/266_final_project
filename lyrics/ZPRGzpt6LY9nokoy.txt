I push back all my plans
You've stayed up, Christ, I love it
And I'd write off every chance
That I've ever had with someone
If should this mean the start
You switched my faith then phone off
Just sat there sifting through my demos
That I've never had with someone

Why pass all the times?
The disciplines left me
Left me with you

Here's to the nights we'd come in
Having lost all judgement
And those dreams that we made
Would remind me of the ways in
Which the nights off come in
And you were 'round mine singing
And you'd act out the
Lines with an arm up to the sky

I pushed back all my plans
'Cause you've waited up, Christ, I love you
And I'd write off every glance
That I've ever had with someone
If should this mean the start
You switched my faith now phone off
Just sat there sifting through my B-sides
That I've never had with someone

Why pass all the times?
The disciplines led me
Led me to you

Here's to the nights we'd come in
Having lost all judgement
And those dreams that we made
Would remind me of the ways
Which the nights off come in
And you were 'round mine singing
And you'd act out the lines
With an arm up to the sky

So pull the love over my eyes
'Cause I fluctuate about you
If you're a blessing in disguise
How did I realise?
So pull the love over my eyes
'Cause I fluctuate about you
If you're a blessing in disguise
I did not realise
I did not realise

Here's to the nights we'd come in
Having lost all judgement
And those dreams
Would remind me of the ways
(So pull the love over my eyes)
In which the nights off come in
('Cause I fluctuate about you)
And you were 'round mine singing
(If you're a blessing in disguise...)
(I did not)
