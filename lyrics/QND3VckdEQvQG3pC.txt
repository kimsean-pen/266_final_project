The final chapter's not end of a story
We're living our lives in a creepiest love
All that I know it's you can't count on me
Am I the person is still in your heart?

I don't know how you can stay with me
I'm a dreamer and it's all you see
Against illusions and reality
You are everything that I'll ever need

In solitude we are both felling happy
But it's so hard just to be all alone
I'm waiting a day when you finally leave me
But I don't know how to live on my own

I don't know how you can stay with me
I'm a dreamer and it's all you see
Against illusions and reality
You are everything that I'll ever need
