She told me add the bassline
And everything will be fine
She told me add the sound of the drums
Drums
To set the mood and foundation
She told me add the bassline
And eveything will be fine
She told me add the sound of the drums
To set the mood and foundation
Sweet south of July
Sweeter the blackberry pie
Sweeter then the breeze of the night
