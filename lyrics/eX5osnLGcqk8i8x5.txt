Let me get this straight
We both want to throw stones
But we're living in a cheap glass house
And every windows broke
It's a tie for first in the race to the bottom
It's too close too close to call
And that's probably the problem

Just give me a minute
I want to gather my thoughts
I guess I've never said enough
But I remember a lot
You got your hand on the door like it's some kind of warning
God this is boring

So you think we're done, just wait and see
Tell me is it fun to get back what you gave to me
And if you want me gone and we're at the end of our road
So long and see ya, finally there's one thing we agree on

I know it's going down tonight
I know you know you know
We're not going to be alright
We're not going to be alright

Just give me a minute
I want to gather my thoughts
I guess I've never said enough
But I remember a lot

If you're mad at me now it's just a matter of time
And I'm so over reading between the lines

So you think we're done, just wait and see
Tell me is it fun to get back what you gave to me
And if you want me gone and we're at the end of our road
So long and see ya, finally there's one thing we agree on

This is broken let's break it some more
Finally there's something we agree on

This is broken let's break it some more
Finally there's something we agree on

So you think we're done, just wait and see
Tell me is it fun to get back what you gave to me
And if you want me gone and we're at the end of our road
So long and see ya, finally there's one thing we agree on

finally there's one thing we agree on

if you want me gone and we're at the end of our road
So long and see ya, finally there's one thing we agree on
