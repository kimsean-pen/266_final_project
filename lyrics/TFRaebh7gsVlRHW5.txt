Heaven's gone and hell is here
There's nothing left for you, my dear
So grab a glass and pour a drink
Learn to swim before you sink

GO!

I can't remember the last time
I smiled
God, it's been a while
So much hate I've held inside

Behind these eyes there's a devil inside
Behind these eyes there's a devil inside

Life's too short for you to die
Ignore the lows, make sure you're high
And don't you ever look back

Let it sleep
Let it sleep
Let it sleep

I've almost given up
Oh God, I know I'm fucked!
Something is just not right
I need to leave this place

Out of mind, out of sight
My evil thoughts can't hide
And I am trapped in my
Own mind
Own mind

There's not a thing you can do
You're fucked and I am too
There's not a thing you can do
You're fucked and I am too

Trapped in hell I'm all alone
With my sins staring through my soul
I guess there's no way out

Let it sleep
Let it sleep

And beg he won't wake up

Let it sleep
Let it sleep

Oh God, I know I'm fucked!

Pray
For
Death

Nothing left for you to live for
Sick of your goddamn lies
Hiding behind dead eyes
I never needed you

No god above
No hell below me
Screaming but no one's there
Praying that someone cares

No one believes in you
Still alive but barely breathing
Stabbing me in the back
I never asked for that

Drinking away your pain
Taking everything for granted
I
Hate
You!

Something is just not right
I need to leave this place
Out of mind, out of sight
My evil thoughts can't hide
And I am trapped in my

Own mind
Own mind

There's not a thing you can do
You're fucked and I am too
There's not a thing you can do
You're fucked and I am too

I can't remember the last time
I can't remember the last time
I smiled!
I can't remember the last time
