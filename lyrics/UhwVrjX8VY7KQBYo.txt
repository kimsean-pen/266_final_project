I did over time the magasin
I dream about being with you
We can't hear a word they say
Least of time we're on the world today
I know it's cold outside
But weather together I got nothing to hide
Forever I will never let you down
It can rain on our side of town
You'll be swept from my head
Tell me we're not better now
Wipe the sheets from my bed
Cause I need time just to see where we are
