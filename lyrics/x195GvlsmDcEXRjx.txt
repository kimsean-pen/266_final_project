It's haunting
It's haunting

He wanted you, did you want him to?
When demons keep you up for weeks
You beg for sleep

He wanted you, did he force you to?
This system doesn't sell the truth
So death to youth

Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
You die to dream
And you dream to die
It's haunting
It's haunting
You run away to feel alive
It's haunting
It's haunting

You worship him, did he lead you in?
When idols give you peace of mind
Then cross the line

He wanted you, did he force you to?
When evil sinks its poisoned teeth
There's no relief

Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
You die to dream
And you dream to die
It's haunting
It's haunting
You run away to feel alive
It's haunting
It's haunting

(Another tragic lullaby)
Can you feel your sister staring at your grave?
(Another tragic lullaby)
Would you take it back if you could see her face?

Can you hear me?
You die to dream
And you dream to die
It's haunting
It's haunting
You run away to feel alive
It's haunting
It's haunting

Can you feel your sister staring?
It's haunting
It's haunting
Can you feel your sister staring?
It's haunting
It's haunting
