You'd said we'd never get this far
You said your words
We've played our parts
Said your two cents now it's my turn

So sit down
Shut up
Are you ready
So you think you know

How this story goes
Are you ready for this
Sit down

Are you ready for this
Shut up
Are you ready for this

Stand up
Are you ready for this
Restrain
Are you ready

I thought you'd never come this far
I thought your words meant something more
Said my two cents now it's your turn
So stand up and scream

Are you ready
So you think you know how this story goes
Are you ready for this

Sit down
Are you ready for this
Shut up

Are you ready for this
Stand up
Are you ready for this
Restrain

Are you ready
Are you ready
Are you ready
Are you ready

Are you ready for this
Sit down
Are you ready for this
Shut up
Are you ready for this
Stand up
Are you ready for this
Restrain
Are you ready for this
