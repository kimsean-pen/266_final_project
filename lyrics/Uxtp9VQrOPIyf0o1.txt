I can't talk
My mind is so blank
So going for a walk
I've got nothing left to say

I can't see
The darkness on the rise
I'll be waiting here
Until the under tide

All my life
Been shaking
Wanting something
Holding everything I have like it was broken
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good

I was playing dead
Doesn't make a sound
Holding my breath
Going underground
So I can't talk
I got nothing to say
It's like there's no tomorrow
Barely yesterday

All my life
Been shaking
Wanting something
Holding everything I have like it was broken
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Oh no

All my life
Been shaking
Wanting something
Holding everybody back
Round and round
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Oh no
