slept high up in the Rockies
set my clock for californ-i-ey-aye
and i dreamed up somethin special to give that ocean
man, she cuffs me anyway

so i'm banking on virginia
to keep me clear and calm and straight
just like clock work seems to tell us
with every passing storm there's just a harder hail

so light my way, Virginia May
i can't sit still, just pace across this hallway
we spent all this time
just trading crimes,
while the tune-smith packed a lunch,
he's headed down the coastline

there's a loneliness thats blowin
well i heard it from the radio man
he's been locked up in the belfry
listening close, to a string upon a can

me, i'm sailin on to that savior,
she's a pilgrim living on the modern time
and ever since i found her magic
now every car or cloud that passes is a sign

light my way, Virginia May
i can't sit still just pace across this hallway
we spent all this time
just trading crimes

and i'm saving all my sleep for another life
i'm saving all my sleep for another life.
