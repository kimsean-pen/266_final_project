I am the darkness and I am the light
I have the money and she has the vice
A flash in the window the night has begun
Waiting in silence until I am done

I will take you downtown

Cheap dollar theatres and neon red lights
Dance clubs and liquor and tramps all in
sight
So many killers will wind up away
They'll sober up slowly when night turns to
day
I will take you downtown
So many losers in dark alley dives
So many bruisers that thrive
So many lovers in violent romance
So many others with no chance
