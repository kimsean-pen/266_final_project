The corpes all hanging headless and limp
Bodies with no surprises
The blood drains down like the devil's rain
We'll bathe tonight

I want your skulls
I need your skulls
I want your skulls
I need your skulls

Demon I am and face I peel
See your skin turned inside out
'Cause I've gotta have you on my wall
Gotta have you on my wall, 'cause

I want your skulls
I need your skulls
I want your skulls
I need your skulls

Whoa

Collect the heads of little girls and
Put 'em on my wall
Hack the heads off little girls and
Put 'em on my wall

Whoa
Whoa

I want your skulls
I need your skulls
I want your skulls
I need your skulls
I want your skulls
I need your skulls
I want your skulls
I need your skulls
Skulls
