Three sleepless nights
this isn't how it's supposed to be
but you're so good at taking your time
to get back to me

I will wait for you forever
if you would just ask me
I thought that I could change you
but you changed me

It doesn't feel right holding someone else's hand
Together on phone lines and living at two opposite ends

It scares me to think that you could find takers
Other than me
And better than me

But your head, it's elsewhere
And I'm talking enough for both of us
When will you see it's not so easy for me

You're careless and whispered
insulting and bruising
And I thought that you said
things were improving
These laces are untied
but my feet are still walking away
Away
(I fall from your eyes. Your eyes I trusted. You said forever.)

I never thought that you could say these words
Is this really happening?

I never thought that you could say these words
Is this really happening? (don't say...)

I never thought that you could say these words
is this really happening? (don't say that we...)

I never thought that you could say these words
Is this really happening? (don't say that we can still be...)

I never thought that you could say these words
Is this really happening? (don't say that we can still be friends)

Erase my name from this page

How can you take all these days (What is inside me? What have I done?)
And throw them away (is this the only way that you'll notice me?)
as i sit here waiting for you (Dead words for closed ears all this is sung for you)
I stay up nights (If you are still pretending this is what's right)
until stars leave the sky (why can't you look at me can you only see)
Knowing what my dreams can take away (one side, your side, can take away)

Walk away from me
This night is done.
