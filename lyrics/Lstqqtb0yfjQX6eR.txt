they wanted me
to be a man
they wanted me to become one of them
straight and repressed
emotions grotesque
ready for war and the cubicle desk
straight america you won't ruin me!
sports and tv indoctrinate the kids
seems so simple'
cause it is
they told us to die
we chose to live
they told us to die but we chose to live
straight america you won't ruin me!
sick american dream
combating
the crap
bad girls have each others backs
lined lips
spiked bats
gotta take femininity back
