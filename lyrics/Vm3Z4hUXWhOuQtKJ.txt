Every time I say I give up hope
I sit and think about the songs you wrote
And each day I realize
It can get better over time
But what about your darkest days?
When it feels like the clouds won't go away
I've been there and I've seen it through
I'll be here when you need me to

And this our war, war
I want you to know that I hear you
War, war
I want you to know that I feel you
War, war
I want you to know that I'm like you
War, war
I want you to know that I'm fighting too

Some people say that it's the cowards way
They don't know what it's like to feel this pain
Growing deeper like roots from a tree
It soon becomes all encompassing
But there's a way to find an escape
Without throwing your life away

And this our war, war
I want you to know that I hear you
War, war
I want you to know that I feel you
War, war
I want you to know that I'm like you
War, war
I want you to know that I'm fighting too

Sometimes the world feels like an empty place
Sometimes it's hard to face your demons day to day
Staring face to face in a mirror of shame
I know because we're all the same

And this our war, war
I want you to know that I hear you
War, war
I want you to know that I feel you
War, war
I want you to know that I'm like you
War, war
I want you to know that I'm fighting too
