Tambourine, the sun is in your wings
Some other dream, mind dreams
At your best and soon you'll lose your mind
Summertime, two girls know that summertime feeling
When you see the colors in my dreams
When you feel something
And so, can't do that they'll know
Still I dream everything

I've go memories in my soul (imagine hearts)
I'll drown (imagine hearts)
And I'm dizzy with these hits (imagine hearts)
I'm losing imagine hearts, imagine hearts hearts
Imagine hearts, imagine hearts hearts

Tambourine, the sun is in my hands
Some other dream, mind dreams
At your best and soon you'll lose your mind
Summertime, two girls

I've go memories in my soul (imagine hearts)
I'll drown (imagine hearts)
And I'm dizzy with these hits (imagine hearts)
I'm losing imagine hearts, imagine hearts hearts
Imagine hearts, imagine hearts hearts
