She sang for you last night, she heard you were calling
Drowning in tears a thousand times.
Your spirit was floating, your spirit was searching
On a cloud of dreams.

A moon beam shines bright in the city of angels
Guiding the dreamers back to life
And they'll do the same every tomorrow
Till the pain subsides.

Don't be scared now
Close your eyes
She holds guard tonight.
Go forward
No remorse
Life will take its course.

She danced with you last night so you will remember
All you have shared, a lifetime.
The angels were watching and death will be waiting
Until the time is right.

Don't be scared now
Close your eyes
She holds guard tonight.
Go on forward
No remorse
Life will take its course.
Hold on to memories
See what lies ahead.
Life will go on and we are one
With every step you take.
