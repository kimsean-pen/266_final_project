Through, the eyes of weaken souls tears.
The drowned life acquires all his fear.
A hollowed body stands to represent thy.
Apologies release his life.

Douse away fears
With all of the
Divine strength.
Divine strength.

If a bruised bird can fly
Then why must a modest burden
Shatter my wings.

Our word is true.
We live in every note we sing.
Our word is true.
These voices will not fade away.
Our word is true.
True.

My eyes are bloodshot.
They have seen the damned.

Bloodshot.
They have seen the damned.

Bloodshot.
They have seen the damned.
Bloodshot.
They have seen the damned.
Mountains block the sight of virtue
Which shadows to all for they are blind.
They have never seen the sun
They have never seen the sun
Which shows all hope.
Sun.
Which shows all hope.
Dynasty will reign over thee.
