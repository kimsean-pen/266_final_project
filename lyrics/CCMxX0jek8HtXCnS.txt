My ambitions as a rider is to drive right off a fucking cliff
Road stay froze in cold weather
The snow leopard don't even grip
Floating in the ocean
Roller coasting
Watch the fucking dip
Pistol whip your fucking lips
Split you with the fucking clip
$uicide boy bitch
Slick's the one who whips the brick
Who am I?
Boy slit your wrist I'll add you to the list
(Ruby does not exist)

Raised by the schizo's
Right next to your bed when I tip toe
10 4, I'm the psycho, Michael
Lights low till them guns make a light show
Oz. of the OG
Fade away with the night breeze
Black Glocks in the trunk
Face a whole blunt now I don't give a fuck
I'm in the 7th rolling
Car might be stolen
Bitch my carry's open
Locin' jocsin'
My blunt be swollen always smoking
I be that slave with the gold chain
Ridin' in the get away
Throw another bitch away
Fuck it, I'ma die today
