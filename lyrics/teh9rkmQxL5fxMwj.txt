Contrite, commercial, arrogance, leprosy
Consume the bitch, the fucker, mindless like a child
For pity's sake, I've had all that I can take
We try, but in the end, we'll see
There are no more codes, only who is shit and who's still free
I was gonna change the world with honor and aggression
No one listened, no one cared, all they saw was misdirection

Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again
Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again
Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again
Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again

I don't want you anymore, I don't want you anymore
I don't need you anymore, I don't need you anymore
Fingerprint of God, your new religions covet
This vessel wasn't built to last, but I will live forever
You'll never have to say surrender because you're so part of it
My total honesty has no place for tomorrow
Guilty pleasures give me pain, tell my people I can't follow

Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again
Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again
Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again
Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again

You'll never censor me
You better cherish me
My reason has a voice
Freedom's gone, but we'll always have a choice
My present future tense
It doesn't make much sense
I'm coming after you
Fuck you all, I'm the only point of view
Violence and dollar signs
Another processed piece of shit
You hide your fault in diamonds and give away the only cost
You can't delay the inevitable lost
Don't understand the incredible path
I'm losing ground, but I won't care when I go down

Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again
Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again
Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again
Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again
Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again
Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again
Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again
Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again
I'm giving up again
I'm giving up again
