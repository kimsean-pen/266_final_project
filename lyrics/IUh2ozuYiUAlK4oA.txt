Crawl. Crawl over me.
Take what you can.
Waste. Waste everything hidden beneath your plans.
And I'm settling.

Walked on.
Taking advantage of my love.
You only care about yourself.
Have you ever thought about how I feel?
So used and worn down.

Drain. Drain my head.
I don't want to feel anymore.

Silently choking on my words.

Walked on.
Taking advantage of my love.
You only care about yourself.
Have you ever thought about how I feel?
So used and worn down.
