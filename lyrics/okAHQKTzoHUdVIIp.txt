How can Midas put his hands on me again?
He said one day I'd realise why I don't have any friends
I find myself alone at night
Unless I'm having sex
But he can make me golden if I just show some respect

But I don't let him touch me anymore
I said "I'm not something to butter up and taste when you get bored
'Cause I have spent too many night on dirty bathroom floors
To find some peace and quiet right behind a wooden door"

He said "Please, don't go away"
He said "Please, don't go away"
I said "It's too late"
I said "It's too late"
He said "Please, don't go away"
He said "Please, don't go away"
I said "It's too late"
I said "It's too late"

And now I can't stop thinking that I can't stop thinking
That I almost gave you everything
And now the whole thing's finished and I can't stop wishing
That I never gave you anything

I wrote a hundred letters just for me
And I find them in my closet, in the pockets of my jeans
Now I'm constantly reminded of the time I was 19
Every single one's forgotten in a laundromat machine

But I don't let him touch me anymore
I said "I'm not something to butter up and taste when you get bored
'Cause I have spent too many nights on dirty bathroom floors
To find some peace and quiet right behind a wooden door"

He said "Please, don't go away"
He said "Please, don't go away"
I said "It's too late"
I said "It's too late"
He said "Please, don't go away"
He said "Please, don't go away"
I said "It's too late"
I said "It's too late"

And now I can't stop thinking that I can't stop thinking
That I almost gave you everything
And now the whole thing's finished and I can't stop wishing
That I never gave you anything
And then I can't stop thinking that I can't stop thinking
That I almost gave you everything
(I said "It's too late")
And now the whole thing's finished and I can't stop wishing
That I never gave you anything

He said "Please, don't go away"
He said "Please, don't go away"
I said "It's too late"
I said "It's too late"
He said "Please, don't go away"
He said "Please, don't go away"
I said "It's too late"
I said "It's too late"
