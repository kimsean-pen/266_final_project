Down there naked, out of luck
Looking into back and just things you brought from the street
Yeah, you did it, but your shoe's lonely
Looking at the heavens, but they disown you

You were tryin' to understand what's the illusion
You faith in man, but you keep on losing
And you let yourself go like you as a kid
Look, what you are feeling again

Birds fly, the woman climbs, and I know
Oh, that I could use some winter sun
They're dancing in a pool down the proper moon
Oh, let my tears all fall

Did you know that birds, they fly too on the clouds?
Did you know that birds, they fly?
Yeah, they fly
Yeah, they fly
Yeah, they fly

They say, that time's a great healer, but it's taking away
To get me to the place where you will be the waves
And the signs, they would flash on your boats while
Maybe you remember to give me a call

If you ever get to heaven, give me a shout
I need to know what the story is about
Will you say my name to saints on the way?
Will you give me some charge, just take this plane away?

Birds fly, the woman climbs, and I know
Oh, that I could use some winter sun
They're dancing in a pool down the proper moon
Oh, let my tears all fall

Birds fly, the woman climbs, and I know
Oh, that I could use some winter sun
They're dancing out on the line sometime
They're out wondering where you've gone

Did you know that birds, they fly too on the clouds?
Did you know that birds, they fly too on the clouds?
Did you know that birds, they fly too on the clouds?
Did you know that birds, they fly too on the clouds?
Did you know that birds, they fly too on the clouds?
Did you know that birds, they fly too on the clouds?
