Where my ladies at? (Where my ladies at?)
Dude swear he a boss?
Still living with his moms,
Stay fresh though
And you wonder why it ain't you?
Ooh ooh
Why it ain't you
Oooh ooh oh

This one is for all my ladies
All these fellas in these songs talking crazy
More than loyal, I'm royal
And you can bet, look better than I do on the internet
Take a step back 'cause I'm too fresh
Need a pack of gum do the breath
You're not an OG you're an OMG
You could say hi, but don't touch me
Already know who I wanna talk to
Got my eye on him when I walk through
Yeah, we came here to party
I ain't tryna see your fucking car keys

I'm a little too smart for you babe
May look pretty, but I've got a brain
Need a pause, here's some twix
Hope that keeps you busy, boy I'm really over it, cauusee

Dude swear he a boss
Still living with his moms
Stay fresh though
And you wonder why it ain't you?
Ooh ooh
Why it ain't you?
Oooh ooh oh

Ain't enough a couple shots
My type you are not,
So many girls have been here, why me?!
You already don't flop,
Got curve like my curls,
Couldn't be with me, now you try my girl
Please!
Did your mama helped you to get dressed?
Boy say it with your chest
Say VIP is where I gotta be
'Cause I can't get people up off of me
Acting all drunk like you wanna fight
But you've been sipping on the same drink the whole night
Stepping up like a jerk,
Who in the world told you that shit would work?
I am the fliest boss up in this skirt
Me and my ladies run this thing, you heard!

Dude swear he a boss
Still living with his moms,
Stay fresh though
And you wonder why it ain't you?
Ooh ooh
Why it ain't you?
Oooh ooh oh

You wondering why it ain't you?
You didn't even know what to do
Ooh, why why why why why why
Straight fair, I'm a win you're an L

Dude swear he a boss
Still living with his mom,
HE stay fresh though
And you wonder why it ain't you?
Ooh ooh
Why ain't you?
Oooh ooh oh
Yeah yeah

This one is for all my ladies
All these fellas in these songs talking crazy

And that's it.
