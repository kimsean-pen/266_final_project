I've been watching while you sleep, baby.
Hoping i'm the only one that frequents your dreams (dreams)

I can't take another breath without feeling the regrets
of my jealousy
horrified that you might have really lied
tell me is it a possibility
overwhelming proof that you're nothing but a fake.

i've seen those hush hush looks you give
when you're talking to him
I've heard your undercover tone of voice
the one you use for all the boys
i've been nonchalant about the calls at 2 a.m.
but do you really think that i would believe it was just your mother again

I can't take another breath without feeling the regrets
of my jealousy
horrified that you might have really lied
tell me is it a possibility
overwhelming proof that you're nothing but a fake

i've seen those hush hush looks you give
when you're talking to him
I've heard your undercover tone of voice
the one you use for all the boys

i've witnessed all your sneaking around
in every corner of town
ive listned while you've pretended to cry
defending your hush hush alibi

your heart is charcoal smoking black
why don't you just tie the mattress to your back

i've seen those hush hush looks you give (hush hush)
i've seen those hush hush looks you give when you're talking to him
i've heard your undercover tone of voice the one you use for all the boys
