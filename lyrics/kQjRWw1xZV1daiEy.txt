Them belly full, but we hungry
A hungry mob is a angry mob
A rain a-fall, but the dirt it tough
A pot a-cook, but the food no 'nough
You're gonna dance to Jah music, dance
We're gonna dance to Jah music, dance
Forget your sorrows and dance!
Forget your troubles and dance!
Forget your sickness and dance!
Forget your weakness and dance!
Cost of livin' get so high
Rich and poor, they start to cry
Now the weak must get strong
They say, "Oh, what a tribulation!"
Them belly full, but we hungry
A hungry mob is a angry mob
A fain a-fall, but the dirt it tough
A pot a-cook, but the food no 'nough
We're gonna chuck to Jah Music- chuckin'
We're chuckin' to Jah music- we're chuckin'
A belly full, but them hungry
A hungry mob is a angry mob
A rain a-fall, but the dirt it tough
A pot a-cook, but the food no 'nough
A hungry man is a angry man
A rain a-fall but the dirt it tough
A pot a-cook, but the food no 'nough
A hungry mob is a angry mob
A hungry mob is a angry mob
