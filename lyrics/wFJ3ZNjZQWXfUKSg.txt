Brothers in arms
Are you ready for the stand
Blood on the ground
And mud on your hands
Take another breath
Make another try
You think you're gonna break
You think you're gonna die
Get off the dirt
Listen to the crowd
Screamin' your name
Screamin' it loud
I know you think you can't
I know you think you're done
But we can't stop
Until we've won

You're not alone
We're not afraid
This is our moment

It won't come again

So lean on me

And find your feet
We will not accept defeat

Get up
When your body's screaming out
Get up
And your hope is fading now
Get up
And the lights are dimming down
Get up
And your strength is waning
Raise your eyes
Tell your mind
To lift yourself
One more time

Gotta get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
The battle soon begins

You've come this far to win
Source the power within
Unleash it all again
Returning to the fight

Victory inside
The crowd will soon ignite
So light up the night
Get up

Get up
Get up

Get up
You're hands are weak

They're barely hanging on
But your body still wants more
Where in your eyes
Your mind sharp as knives
You're built to carry on
This battle will be won
Get up

When your body's screaming out
Get up
And your hope is fading now
Get up
And the lights are dimming down

Get up
And your strength is waning
Raise your eyes
One more time
Gotta get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
When your body's screaming out
Get up
And your hope is fading now
Get up
And the lights are dimming down
Get up
And your strength is waning
Raise your eyes
One more time
Gotta get up
Get up
Get up
