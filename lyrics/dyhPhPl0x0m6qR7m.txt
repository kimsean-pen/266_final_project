Learned how to rap as a little boy
Took a lot of crap as a little boy
Always had to fight back as a little boy
Always under attack as a little boy
Never got good grades as a little boy
I was locked in a cage as a little boy
Still I never was afraid as a little boy
Always feeling my rage as a little boy
It's time to blow they minds

Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha
Learned how to lose as older man
Sang a lot of blues as older man
But I saw it all through as older man
Put together my crew as older man
Felt a lot of pain as older man
I established my name as older man
People piss on my game as older man

Ain't Nothing gonna change as older man
It's time to blow they minds now baby
It's time to blow they minds now baby
I'm on the grind now baby
Yall now it's my time now baby

C'mon!
Who that is, what it say
Who that is, what it say
Who that is, what it say
What it looked like
What it looked like, Baby!
Who that is, what it say

Who that is, what it say
Who that is, what it say
What it looked like
What it looked like, Baby!
Got treated like a clown as a little boy
Kept my feet on ground as a little boy
When you're living in a dream as a little boy
Ain't nothing like it seems as a little boy
I was hating on world as a little boy

I was loving all the girls as a little boy
I was into punk rock as a little boy
I was breaking non stop as a little boy
It's time to blow they minds
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha
Got treated like a chump as older man
Mixing rock with the funk as older man
Learned what a girl wants as older man

Now I know how to love as older man
But I'm still a big kid as older man
And I'd much rather give as older man
Still I'm singing in the rain as older man
Ain't nothing gonna change as older man

It's time to blow they minds now baby
It's time to blow they minds now baby
I'm on the grind now baby
Yall now it's my time now baby
C'mon!
Who that is, what it say
Who that is, what it say

Who that is, what it say
What it looked like
What it looked like, Baby!
Who that is, what it say
Who that is, what it say
Who that is, what it say

What it looked like
What it looked like, Baby!
My life is one big dream
I'm lost in what it means

Don't wake me up cause it's Almost Over
These voices in my mind
Keep telling me it's time
To wake me up cause it's Almost Over

It's time to blow they minds now baby
It's time to blow they minds now baby
I'm on the grind now baby
Yall now it's my time now baby
It's time to blow they minds now baby
It's time to blow they minds now baby

I'm on the grind now baby
Yall now it's my time now baby
C'mon!
Who that is, what it say
Who that is, what it say
Who that is, what it say
What it looked like
What it looked like, Baby!
My life is one big dream
I'm lost in what it means
Don't wake me up cause it's Almost Over
These voices in my mind
Keep telling me it's time
To wake me up cause it's Almost Over
Who that is, what it say
Who that is, what it say
Who that is, what it say
What it looked like
What it looked like, Baby
