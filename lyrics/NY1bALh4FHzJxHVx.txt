You say you don't know me
You say you don't owe me
You say that you won't be
Happy waiting

You think that you're worth it
You think you deserve it
You want it all right now
Your way

Together we're one
There is no finish line
Together we're one
Why don't you realize
Together we're one
I know that everything's gonna be fine
Together

Together we're one one in a million
Don't be afraid don't say
It can't play out the way that we want
It's gonna be brilliant
Like it or leave it I can't help but feel like I'm one
One in a million
I'm worth all the crap that I'm putting you through
I'll be blunt the honest truth is
Like it or love it or leave it

You decide you decide
Don't waste my time
Sit back and unwind now
It's gonna be fine now
You can't justify your
Impatience

Together we're one
There is no finish line
Together we're one
Why don't you realize
Together we're one
I know that everything's gonna be fine
Together

Together we're one one in a million
Don't be afraid don't say
It can't play out the way that we want
It's gonna be brilliant
Like it or leave it I can't help but feel like I'm one
One in a million
I'm worth all the crap that I'm putting you through
I'll be blunt the honest truth is
Like it or love it or leave it

What was that line in the one movie
When he looked at her like it would last forever
Said it to her face that he'd do whatever it took
To be her love above all what he wanted most
Credits rolled curtains closed
Then you whispered in my ear

Together we're one in a million
Don't be afraid
Together we're one in a million
Don't be afraid

Together we're one one in a million
Don't be afraid don't say
It can't play out the way that we want
It's gonna be brilliant
Like it or leave it I can't help but feel like I'm one
One in a million
I'm worth all the crap that I'm putting you through
I'll be blunt the honest truth is
Like it or love or leave it

You decide you decide
Don't waste my time
You decide you decide
Leave it
