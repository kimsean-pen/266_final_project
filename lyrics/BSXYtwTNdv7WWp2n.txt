Hmmm...
Oh I heard you were trouble
And you heard I was trouble
But your name is a wave washing over me
No games just a slave to you totally
Cause I don't care what they say about you virgo
And you don't care what they say about me virgo

But you know what they say about trouble
Pull me down if you want to
And I hope that you want to
Cause I wanna be your man
And I wanna say it loud
You can show me where trouble goes
Tell me secrets only trouble knows

Cause you wanna be my girl

And you wanna say it loud
I want you to know that I've got your back
Even when the whole foundation seems cracked
Two punk kids up against the world
Ya trouble, there goes trouble
We could be king and queen of the moonlight

Two young lovers and when the moods right
You hear me say 'I want you'

So pull me down if you want to
And I hope that you want to
Because I wanna be your man
And I wanna say it loud
You can show me where trouble goes
Tell me secrets only trouble knows

Cause you wanna be my girl
And you wanna say it loud
And you wanna say it loud

...
So pull me down if you want to
And I hope that you want to
Cause I wanna be your man
And I wanna say it loud
You can show me where trouble goes
Tell me secrets only trouble knows
Cause you wanna be my girl
And you wanna say it loud
Ohhh and you want to say it loud
