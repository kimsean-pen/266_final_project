Anthony Llyod cops horse like a reporter
A two hour plane trip from his life's work
His most important story, sound is faster in water than it is in air
A hydrophone will let you know faster that your grandma and your niece are shot dead
There's a call at tonite's last hour
A bitter pill you've got to swallow it unravels like an affair your only chance to leave BOOGIE TOWN
All my life in the pink city
