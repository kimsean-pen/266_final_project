it's fine
when it's all mine
it's on my wall
it's in my head
memorize it till i'm dead
it's yours
now i'm so bored

i wanna be your joey ramone
pictures of me on your bedroom door
invite you back after the show
i'm the queen of rock and roll

i just don't care
are you that scared?
i swear they're looking right at me
push to the front so i can see
it's what i thought
it's rock'n'roll

i wanna be your thurston moore
wrestle on the bedroom floor
always leave me wanting more
throw away those old records

we go downtown
put on our best frowns
give me a chance
i know i can dance

it's fine
cus it's all mine
