Restart Electroheart
Deja vu I fall apart
Five minutes falling back
With my Electroheart

I feel divine
It's like I travel faster
As I reboot
The darkness has no empathy

It's hard to see
I feel the world is shattered
In tears they cry
Am I about to be erased
About to be erased

Soulless torn apart
Born to die right from the start
Cyanide runs in my Electroheart

Restart Electroheart
Deja vu I fall apart
Five minutes falling back renewed
Recharge Electroheart
Never left it from the start
Timer set I left the past for you

And as silence surrounds me
With echoes of cries
From my imminent life
With my Electroheart

I plant the seed
To make them struggle hard
I reap their tears
Bring harvest from their misery

Repent repeat
The force of life is scattered
Indeed I try to cleanse it
To infinity

About to be erased

Feel your soul depart
Now your flesh is my own art
Cyanide runs in my Electroheart

Restart Electroheart
Deja vu I fall apart
Five minutes falling back renewed
Recharge Electroheart
Never left it from the start
Timer set I left the past for you

And as silence surrounds me
With echoes of cries
From my imminent life
With my Electroheart

Witchcraft
It's out of context
I better come back
With my my complexity

Fractals
What I can't bring back
I came in contact
With my depravity

Restart Electroheart
Deja vu I fall apart
Five minutes falling back renewed
Recharge Electroheart
Never left it from the start
Timer set I left the past for you

And as silence surrounds me
With echoes of cries
From my imminent life
With my Electroheart

Restart Electroheart
Deja vu I fall apart
Five minutes falling back renewed
Recharge Electroheart
Never left it from the start
Timer set I left the past for you

And as silence surrounds me
With echoes of cries
From my imminent life
With my Electroheart
