Please don't invite me, please don't invite me
I wanna be alone, I wanna be alone
And don't remind me, please don't remind me
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know

Leave without me because I don't wanna go
Just add water and let me grow

Please forget me, and be happy on your own
Just add water, let me go

I'm feeling salty, but I'm not the sea
I'm fungus in fresh water,
Cobwebs in your cupboard
I saw my friends leave after the party
I wasn't invited, never invited

Leave without me because I don't wanna go
Rather keep my money safe inside my home
Please forget me, and be happy on your own
Just add water, let me go

Please don't remind me, please don't remind me
I'll sleep until it's over, fidget and roll over
And when I wake up, greet me with a hug
A body warm and loving,
Show me I'm not disgusting

Leave without me because I don't wanna go (to go)
Just add water let me grow
Please don't worry, i'll be fine on my own

I'll turn the lights off when I go
Pay my bills and fold my clothes

Take care of my family and my home
Just add water, let me go (let me go)

Da da da da da da da da dada da,
