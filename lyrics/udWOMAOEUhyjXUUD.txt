Alright, children
The lights are out and the party's over
It's time for me, Doctor D, to start running
And say goodbye for a little while
And I know you're going to miss me, so I'll leave you with this

You know that big ball of radiation we call the sun?
Well, it'll burst you into flames if you stay in one place too long
That is, if the static don't get you first
So remember, even if you're dusted, you may be gone

But out here in the desert your shadow lives on without you
This is Dr. Death Defying, signing off
