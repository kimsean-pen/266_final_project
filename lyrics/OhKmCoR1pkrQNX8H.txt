Close the door and take the stairs.
Up or down? Ups and downs,
well don't pretend you've never been there.
You kiss me like an overdramatic actor
who's starving for work,
with one last shot to make it happen.
You've won the role, you've played your part,
you've been cordially invited. But I'm not impressed,
and I'm definitely not excited,
because the film runs a shallow budget,
and the writer's subject script isn't any deeper.
So dive right in...
Hollywood hills and suburban thrills,
hey you, who are you kidding?
I'm not like them. I won't buy in.
Hollywood hills and suburban thrills,
hey you, who are you kidding?
Don't quit 'til 47,
then we'll turn it up, and we'll play a little faster.

Take back everything you ever said, you never meant a word of it.
You never did.
Take back everything you said, you never meant a word of it.
You never did. She said.

'Alright, Alright, slow down! Oh no, oh no, we won't,
'cause I regret everything I said to ever make her feel
like she was something special,
or that she ever really mattered.
Did she ever really matter?

Hollywood hills and suburban thrills,
hey you, who are you kidding?
I'm not like them. I won't buy in
Hollywood hills and suburban thrills,
just don't count on this summer.
Don't quit 'til 47. Then we'll turn it up and
we'll play a little faster.

Take back everything you ever said, you never meant a word of
it. You never did.
Take back everything you said, you never meant a word of it.
You never did.

I'm not saying that
I'm not breaking some hearts tonight, girl.
I'm not saying that
I'm not breaking some hearts tonight, girl
Alright, alright, slow down...

Take back everything you ever said, you never meant a word of it.
You never did.
Take back everything you said, you never meant a word of it.
