Reside in shadows
Antagonistic towards them
I see not individuals
No names, no colors
Destruction call receiveth
The storms are on the way
The perils nature bringeth
I welcome one and all
The dark days on horizon
The monsters pull my strings
And I in turn spew madness
Until the hell choir sings

Ohhh glory glory
Destruction to all
Ohhh glory glory
Celebrating the fall

Total destroy!
Total destruction
Total destroy!

Total destruction
Earth, air water and fire in collusion
All of nature's forces decide on the solution

Total destruction
Total destroy!
Total destroy!

Green turns to wilted, air is polluted, holy water acid and flames
The great conclusion
