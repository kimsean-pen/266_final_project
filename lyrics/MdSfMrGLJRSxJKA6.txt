Hold It, Don't Drop It (Hold It, Push It)

You don't Know what you're doin'
What you doin' to me
Try to stop me, can't stop me
Cause you know what I need
You got me all open and now you tryin to leave
Hold It, Don't Drop It (Don't Drop It)

Stop it, (cant stop it, wont stop it)

Every time I try to run, something keeps stopping me (stopping me)
I try my best to turn around, but your touch wont let me leave
I cant control it, you put something inside of me

Cause you're a problem
Boy you must have poisoned me

You don't know what you're doin'
What you doin' to me
Try to stop me, can't stop me
Cause you know what I need
You got me all open and now you tryin to leave
Hold It, Don't Drop It

Don't Drop It
Stop it, cant stop it
wont stop it
Oh I must be bugging
Let me play those things I don't understand
(I can't understand)
You don't know what you're doin'
What you doin' to me
Try to stop me, can't stop me

Cos you know what I need
You got me all open and now you tryin to leave
Hold It, Don't Drop It
Don't Drop It
Stop it, cant stop it
wont stop it
