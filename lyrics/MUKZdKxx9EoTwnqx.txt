A silent demise
Demise

From darkness
Through mists of time
Centuries, eons past
Requiem of mankind
Withdrawn in darkness
Prepared to die
Awaiting silence
Anticipation sublime

A silent demise

Indignant by nature
A tragedy profound
When put to the test
Determination found
Horror within
Dissipates away
Falling to your knees
The time has come to pray
To pray

To have no faith (silent demise)
Yet still believe
To have no faith (silent demise)
But not deceived

To have no faith - yet still believe
To have no faith - but not deceived
To have no faith - in all the lies
To have no faith - now as we die
