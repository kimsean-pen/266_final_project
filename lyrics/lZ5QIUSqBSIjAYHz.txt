Someplace far away
Echoes through the hills
Swinging through the trees
I heard you say

Something from the past
Staying as they seem
(?)Living without a fear
I heard you say

Dream about me (x3)

Snowflake in this room
Sugar from the hills
Sound going over me
I heard you say

(?)Under frequent schemes
If you're here for me
I'll be here tonight
I heard you say

Dream about me (x3)

Ooohhh for the night (x3)
Ooohhh ooohhh

Dream about me (x3)
Ooohhhh
