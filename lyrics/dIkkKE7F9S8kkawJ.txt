Aaaaah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Now, once upon a time, an old man told me a fable
When the piper is gone and the soup is cold on the table
And if the black crow flies to find a new destination
That is the sign

Come tonight
Come to the ogre site
Come to the ogre battle, fight

He gives a great big cry and he can swallow up the ocean
With a mighty tongue, he catches flies and the palm of his hand incredible size
One great big eye has to focus in your direction
Now, the battle is on, yeah, yeah, yeah

Come tonight
Come to the ogre site
Come to the ogre battle, fight

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
The ogre men are still inside, the two-way mirror mountain
You gotta keep down right out of sight
You can't see in, but they can see out
Ooh, keep a lookout

The ogre men are coming out from the two-way mirror mountain
They're running up behind and they're coming all about
Can't go east, 'cause you gotta go south

Ogre men are going home
The great big fight is over
Bugle blow let trumpet cry
Ogre battle lives forevermore

You can come along
You can come along
Come to ogre battle
