Heartache number one was when you left me,
A number that I never knew it would hurt this way
Heartache number two was when you came back again
Oh, you came back and never meant to stay

Nah, I've got heartaches by the number, troubles by the store
Every day you love me less, each day I love you more
Yes, I've got heartaches by the number, love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting it's the day my world will end

Heartache number three was when you called me
And said that you were coming home to stay
With open heart I've waited for you to knock at the door
I've waited, but you must've lost your way!

Nah, I've got heartaches by the number, troubles by the store
Every day you love me less, each day I love you more
Yes, I've got heartaches by the number, love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting it's the day my world will end
Oh, the day that I stop counting it's the day my world will end
