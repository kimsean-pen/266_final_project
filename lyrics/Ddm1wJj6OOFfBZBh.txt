I don't wanna, get left behind
So I tell you what I'm gonna do to get by
I'm gonna pick you up in my arms, give you all of my love
Soon we'll never find mine
First we gotta get high

And sail to the sun, chances are none
Oh, but we'll all die, that's just the way we live
Uhu, uuuhuuu, uhu
Uhu, uuuhuuu, uhu

I don't wanna, get left behind
So I tell you what I'm gonna do to get by
I'm gonna pick you up in my arms, give you all of my love
Soon we'll never find mine
First we gotta get high

And sail to the sun, chances are none
Oh, but we'll all die, that's just the way we live
In a grave, in a grave, in a grave
In a grave, in a grave, in a grave

In a grave, in a grave, in a grave
In a grave, in a grave, in a grave
Uhu, uuuhuuu, uhu
Uhu, uuuhuuu, uhu
