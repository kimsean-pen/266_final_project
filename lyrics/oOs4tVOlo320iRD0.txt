The preacher!

In days of old
When the books were untold
Speak of a world crushed by sin
"The people will mourn
Of a war to be born"
Nobody would listen to him
Think back in time
When the future you find
Is so faint that it's too hard to see
Don't disavow his word
For the truth must be heard
Cause the preacher tells visions he sees

In 1906
Like the future predicts
The city will crumble to the bay
Then what's in store
When the worlds go to war?
Peace will have come another day
Then came the one
In the year of '41
Warfare would light up the sky
He beckoned the call
Of the future for all
Blinded by what's in his eyes

Don't follow the preacher!
Preach!

Listen to these words I preach
(Don't follow the preacher!)
Catastrophic lessons they shall teach
