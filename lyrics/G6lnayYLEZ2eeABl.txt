Living it up, it's a big kick
It's good for you
Watch the big freeze slip
Crack the jackpot, get out of control

If you put yourself down
You'll never win, get out of that hole
Keep your mind open, your head up
You'll never ever get old

Ya ya ya ya ya ya yayaya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya yayaya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya yayaya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya yayaya

Go!

Your whole world could change
If only you just broke through
Through the fears inside your head
'Cause your fears are doing nothing for you

Keep your head up, your mind open
You'll always come through
'Cause living it up, it's a big deal
It's good for you

Swap your dull gray thoughts
For fierce demands you can stand up to
Don't put yourself down, you'll never win
So let's all smash through

Through the fear of being real
Through the fear of being really you
'Cause living it up, it's a big deal
It's good for you

Ya ya ya ya ya ya yayaya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya yayaya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya yayaya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya yayaya

Living it up, it's a big kick
It's good for you
Living it up, it's a big kick
It's good for you

Living it up, it's a big kick
It's good for you
Living it up, it's a big kick
It's good for you
