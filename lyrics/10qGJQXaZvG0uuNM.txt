Did someone, give you something, to help you ease the pain?
Like the liquor, in the bottle, we watched you slip away.
And I feel as if I know you, through the bars of a song.
Always surrounded but alone.
But no goodbyes, you'll always be Miss America.
We watched you fly, but nothing's free Miss America.
And as you fall apart, we just call it art.

Was it so hard to breathe?
Was the picture in the paper, not the face you recognize?
Did the makeup, never make up, for the pain behind your eyes?
Cause I feel as if I know you when you're on my silver screen.
But I don't know the dark places that you've been.

But no goodbyes, you'll always be Miss America.
We watched you fly, but nothing's free Miss America.
And as you fall apart, we just call it art.
Was it so hard to breathe?
Does another voice sing in Heaven's choir tonight?
To fill the silence left behind?

And I don't know what goes on in your mind.
But I'm sure it's enough to make my cry.
Someday we'll find, you live forever.
But no goodbyes, you'll always be Miss America.
We watched you fly, but nothing's free Miss America.
And as you fall apart, we just call it art.
Was it so hard to breathe?
