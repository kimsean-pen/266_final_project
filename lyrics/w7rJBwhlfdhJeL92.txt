Mister mojo's rising
I took a ride
From the L.A. mountains through time
To get you and see you as mine
I dreamt you were mine
Since my eyes saw yours
If I'm your world
Then the world is yours
If my lips kissed yours
If I'm your world
Then the world is yours
Then the world is yours
Mister mojo's dying
Rising inside me is shyness

Hesitations from youth
Eternally hold the hand of me and you
Still I dream
You were mine.
Since my eyes saw yours
If I'm your world
Then the world is yours
If my lips kissed yours
If I'm your world
Then the world is yours
Talks expensive and subtleties ring blind
Don't let bad timing be the cost of our love lost
Our crippling shyness butchering love all the time
Please please god pull the stars to align
Let's not leave it to another time
Remember in the midst of my dreams when I dreamt you were mine
Through letters of love saying the words
In the right order can be awkward and tough
Time is slipping through
To express how I desire you
It's something I don't know how to
The fear of losing you is elevating me on through
Whilst the undeniable truth is alive and true
You don't need me as much as I need you
You don't need me as much as I need you
The tables have turned to my staggering astound
The wheels in my mind go round and round
And I dreamt you were mine
And I dreamt you were mine
Since my eyes saw yours
If I'm your world
Then the world is yours
If my lips kissed yours
If I'm your world
Then the world is yours
Then the world is yours
