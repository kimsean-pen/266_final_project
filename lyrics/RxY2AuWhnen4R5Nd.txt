Midnight afternoon
Morning comes, but not too soon
First he wakes up in my bed
We are separate
Vampires in our nights we wed
I'm no longer happy there

Rosa, Rosa, Rosa
Oh where is my heart?
Rosa, Rosa, Rosa
Oh where is my heart?
Rosa's flower powers
Oh she is a witch
Sewing up my heart again
Love in every stitch

Rosa, Rosa, Rosa
Oh where is my heart?
Rosa, Rosa, Rosa
Oh where are my arms?
Born of flowers,
And one day will make me of coal
Born of flowers in mourning
Reminds me that I am getting old
