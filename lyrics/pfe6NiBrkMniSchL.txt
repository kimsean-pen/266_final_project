Well, so long, baby
I've had enough
I can't ignore it
I miss you so much
I miss you so much
I miss you so much

I'm standing in a suit
As ragged as my nerves
And I agree what I've become
Is surely worth the hatred
That you spat on me

The stars above me
The night so deep
That I could trip or drown
And still I see that you would dearly love
To shut me down

Well, so long, soldier
We're deep in dutch
I can't ignore it
I miss you so much
I miss you so much
I miss you so much

I'm standing in a suit
As ragged as my nerves
And I agree what I've become
Is surely worth the hatred
That you spat on me

The sky above me
The night so deep
That I could trip and drown
And still I see that you would dearly love
To shut me down

I miss you so much
I miss you so much
I miss you so much
