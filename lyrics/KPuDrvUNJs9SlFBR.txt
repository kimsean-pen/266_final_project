Used to tell me you where my best friend
Used to tell me that your loyalty
Would never end
Say you'd always have my back
As soon as I hit rock bottom
You were no-where to be had (no no)

Don't not give it to me
On the floor where I can see
On your knees and beg
If your searchin forgivness
Don't not give it to me
On the floor where I can see
On your knees and beg
If your searchin forgivness

Gotta you gotta

Won't let nobody bring me down
Telling you what goes around comes around
Life just filled with mystery
That's exactly what you are
Exactly what you are (to me)

Make you see friendship ain't on the mend

Can't forgive you if I could
Wanna come into my world
