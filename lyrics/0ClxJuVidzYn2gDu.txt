I can't see anything
Fade from black, we're back in this routine
I'm losing patience tracing over every word I think to speak
Why can't I rest my mind and trust what I believe?
It's all I've ever known and care to be
But I can't see
Fade from black we're back to this

I'm done, I'm done and I can't see anything
You know what I want to
I'm done, I'm done and I can't see anything
I wish that you could see

Losing sight, losing my mind
Losing the blood rush through my spine
This lackluster of color has me so damn uninspired lately

I'm done, I'm done and I can't see anything
You know what I want to
I'm done, I'm done and I can't see anything
I wish that you could see

And now we're standing face to face
Standing point blank from the target that's in range
Rearrange
I saw everything
It's a shot we have to take

Fade from black
We're back in this routine
Return to that
I saw everything

I'm done, I'm done and I can't see anything
I know what I want to
I'm done, I'm done and I can't see anything
I wish that you could see
