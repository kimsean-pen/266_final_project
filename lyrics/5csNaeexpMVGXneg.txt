Taking a ride to my old haunt
She's in my blood, I reside in my Nightlife
My favorite color's candy apple, girl
And she resides in my mind and my Nightlife

What's that I hear, you wanna go for a ride?
Oh, don't be afraid boy, to come inside
I got the thing that you want, the fix that you need
Chase this with a little lust and greed

I'll be the devil on your shoulder saying "Hey boy, come over."
My black heart beats crimson and clovers
So, operator, operator, patch my boy in
This is Nightlife and I'll get under your skin

Taking a ride to my old haunt
She's in my blood, I reside in my Nightlife
My favorite color's candy apple, girl
And she resides in my mind and my Nightlife

Short of breath, heart beat fast
Sounds like love, but you know it won't last
Cheap champagne stain on an even cheaper suit
Hope there's more in your pants than a bus route

Red-velvet balls line the sugar-coated walls
Girls on your bar stools for late last calls
This town is full of snakes, mistakes and whisky shakes
It's too late I already cut the breaks

Well, I am rolling, strolling into town (Come inside)
Is it me or am I going crazy? (It's just you)
This dirty city is my sugar town (Sugar town)
My little Angel of Death is my Nightlife

(Come inside)
(It's just you)
(Sugar Town)

Better make a move before I get bored
If you wanna explore my vocal chord
Baby girl go-go dance on the cooch
And one hand on my knee, hand on the hooch

Why don't you stick around for one more round?
This place is a circus and I know you'll be my clown
'Cause I'm a ringleader, I run the show
And only when I tell you will it be time to go
Taking a ride to my old haunt
She's in my blood, I reside in my Nightlife
My favorite color's candy apple, girl
And she resides in my mind and my Nightlife
(Hey boy) She is my Nightlife
(Hey boy) She is my Nightlife
(Hey boy) She is my Nightlife
(See you later) She is my Nightlife
