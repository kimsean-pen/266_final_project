Losing love, unrequited
Was it truly love? undecided
Hard times, I'm broken
Past lies, they leave you open
I try, I'm hopeless
At night, no way of coping
With this shredded heart
Can I get reparations for the pain?
Baby I'm afraid
Really I'm afraid

Of giving you what they all messed up
My stress up
Took them pictures and I dressed up
Looking blessed up
You need something and I got you
I spot you
Til i see your love is not true
It's not true
And I'm scared of what that feels like
Looking stupid out in real life
Baby I'm Afraid
Really I'm Afraid

Of loving you
(I'm so afraid to love you)
With all my heart, my time
(I'm so afraid of hurting again)
Baby I'm afraid
(I'm so afraid to love you)
Really I'm afraid
(I'm so afraid of hurting again)

God has not given us the spirit of fear
But the spirit of love looking like it's not here
I don't doubt your heart, I just know things change
It just leads to pain, I still bleed the same

I still say I'm fine, but I leave my brain
Dont' wanna think no more, I can't defeat my shame
Don't wanna play no more, I can't defeat this game
But that phone still rings, can't delete your name

'cuz you give to me
Everything I pray for, every single day for
Listen to me, honestly
You don't have to wait for me to feel I'm safe or
That I'm ready this time
I want no one else, not "too" focused on myself
It's just baby I'm afraid
Really I'm afraid

Of loving you
(I'm so afraid to love you)
With all my heart, my time
(I'm so afraid of hurting again)
Baby I'm afraid
(I'm so afraid to love you)
Really I'm afraid
(I'm so afraid of hurting again)
