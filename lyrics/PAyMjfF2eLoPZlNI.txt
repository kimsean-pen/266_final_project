I'm going back to where I came from
So far away, but not so far from home
Where I lay my head down by the sea
I'm going back to where we'd go
So far away, but not so far from home
Where I'd rest, where I'd lay so peacefully
But by the way, I want a break
And put this stress aside
But above all things I want to lay by the oceanside
The ocean waves, no other way, get away
Well I'm finding!
Oh no, my daily worries want to drift away, fine!
Dying and trying just to find some sort of piece of mind
Now's the time, to get away
I'm going away, oh yeah
No other place to go
I've wanna get away
Let's get away, oh
Away!
One more minute, the beaches San Diego
One more minute yeah!
One more minute, the beaches Mexico
One more minute yeah!
One more minute, we kick it back poolside
One more minute, and we're down by the Oceanside
One more minute, one more minute, one more minute!
So far away, and down on the beach
I want to clear my head and bake in the sunshine
Want to relay relaxation
With the horizon straight away
And a ring around my arm from a long day
Of making angels in the sand
Pacifico in my hand, oh yeah
No other place to go
I've wanna get away
But let's get away, oh
Away!
One more minute, the beaches San Diego
One more minute yeah!
One more minute, the beaches Mexico
One more minute yeah!
One more minute, we kick it back poolside
One more minute, and we're down by the Oceanside
One more minute, one more minute, one more minute!
The sunshine in my eyes
And the flamenco in the skies
The only way
You'll ever know, is to go
Is to go
Is to go
Here we go
Yeah yeah
Away
One more minute, the beaches San Diego
One more minute yeah!
One more minute, the beaches Mexico
One more minute yeah!
One more minute, we kick it back pool side
One more minute and we're down bye the ocean side
One more minute, one more minute, one more minute
One more minute, the beaches San Diego
One more minute yeah!
One more minute, the beaches Mexico
One more minute yeah!
One more minute, we kick it back pool side
One more minute, and we're down bye the ocean side
One more minute, one more minute, one more minute
