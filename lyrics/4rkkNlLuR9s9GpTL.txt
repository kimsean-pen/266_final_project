Save your breath.
Don't you break your neck.
I'm seeing signs inside my head.
A car crash in the woods.
I'm saving things that I think you'll need.
On and on until you bleed.
Could I be imagining worse things?
Take me for granted and a sin.

I'll be in on it.
Feeling all this energy .
Call me up when you feel sick.
I'll be in on it.

I haven't been eating much this week.
Eating's for the strong.
Sleeps for the weak.
Falling in the same routine I see.

I'll be in on it.
Feeling all this energy.
Call me up when you feel sick.
I'll be in on it.

Don't touch me.
I feel hurt when you leave.
Nobody could understand what this does to me.

And I know just what I need,
Autumn leaves and fallen trees.
To feel the cold beneath my feet.

I'll be in on it.
Feeling all this energy.
Call me up when you feel sick.
I'll be in on it.
