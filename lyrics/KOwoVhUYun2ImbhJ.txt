"Lallalllaa! Perfect night, perfect sleep, perfect morning!
I cannot wait to see how my flowers feel today.
Be a rose, be a sage, a tulip or a bluebell
Motherly joy it brings to me to give them love and care, water and...

WHAT IS THIS???"

"The garde once so red is now full of death
All is gone, torn apart are my dearest friends.
Maybe I wanna hurt you violentely
All is gone, torn apart are my dearest friends!
Maybe I'm gonna hurt you violentely
Silently you will pay...
... you will pay for this."

"Poison ivy, thorn and broom, lily of the valley
They are now my new best friends, helping me to revenge!
Snakeroot, doll's eyes, oleander and deadly nightshade.
Belladonna, how convenient a name for a plant of bane"
(Belladonna what a name!)

"All my roses torn and dead, but hail my new friends,
Poisonous and spiky are they!
Look at this venomous garden... HAHAHA
Powerful, sneaky and quick!
Now I got it... A poison apple!"

"Maybe I'm gonna hurt you violently!
Poison ivy, thorn and broom, lily of the valley!
Maybe I'm gonna hurt you violentely!
Snakeroot doll's eyes, oleander and maybe a suicide tree... HAHAHA!"
(Lalllallaa!)

"Lallallaa, into the oven goes this pie I made with "love and care".
How I always loved to cook, make you a supper.
(... the poisonous pie...)
This time you will be surprised but only for a while,
(... now take a bite...)
Cause once you swallow a piece of this pie of poison apples
(... just swallow the bite...)
I will just watch while you are squirming in your pain.
You little snake!"

"The garden once so red, is now full of death.
Poison ivy, thorn and broom are my dearest friends.
Maybe I'm gonna hurt you violently
Me and my deadly plants now have evil plans..."
