I've got this new thing, I've got a new swing
I'll make you fall to your knees, I'll make your heart sing
I'll turn the lights out, I'm gonna get down
I'll be the new king, I will be your everything
I wanna live fast, I wanna die free
My blood is pumping, why can't you feel my heart beat?
I got that new sound, and when I come round
I'll be your nightmare, I'm coming for you don't be scared
(Don't be scared, don't be scared, I'm coming for you, don't be scared)

Look into my eyes, tell me what do you see?
Don't believe the lies that you heard about me, about me, about me, about me, about me
I know what you're thinking and those secrets that you keep
Just don't believe the lies that you heard about me, about me, about me, about me, about me, about me

I'll drive you insane, life in the fast lane
So hold on tight, we're never coming back again
And there's no free ride, so once you get inside
To play the game, honey, you have got to roll the dice
I could be bad luck, you might be crazy
Yeah, I've got 9 lives, you only have 3
You're like my technique, I'm on a winning streak
So watch that pretty mouth before you go and try to speak
(Try to speak, try to speak, before you go and try to speak)

Look into my eyes, tell me what do you see?
Don't believe the lies that you heard about me, about me, about me, about me, about me (Hey, hey hey!)
I know what you're thinking and those secrets that you keep (Woah)
Just don't believe the lies that you heard about me, about me, about me, about me, about me, about me

I know what you're thinking, I know those secrets that you keep
Don't believe the lies that you heard about me, about me

Look into my eyes, tell me what do you see?
(What do you see?)
Don't believe the lies that you heard about me, about me, about me, about me, about me
I know what you're thinking and those secrets that you keep
(The secrets that you keep)
Just don't believe the lies that you heard about me, about me, about me, about me, about me, about me
