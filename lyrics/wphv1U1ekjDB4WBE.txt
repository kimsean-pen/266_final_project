Sunshine looking as the warming rain
I breathe, I'm not breathing [?]
I saw water
Forever needing more

Crescent moon

Sunshine looking as the warming rain
I breathe, I'm not breathing [?]
I saw water
Forever needing more

Crescent moon

Fly away, the dark
Is fast approaching
Lost my way to know the gates are opening

Sunshine looking as the warming rain
I breathe, I'm not breathing [?]
I saw water
Forever needing more

Crescent moon
