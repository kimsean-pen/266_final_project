Girl you got me in the mood now
Ain't there something we should do now
Once I step inside the room
Everybody know we ain't brand new, nah
With a mind like this gotta innovate
Black bimmer whipping that interstate
Take a deep breath, and I meditate
Cuz these hard times lead to better days
I promise for zeros following commas
My papa yo he done taught me to put in that work regardless
It's hardest when you surrounded by those who thirsty, dishonest
It's like I'm jumping right into an ocean full of piranhas
But we straight
I'm saucin, pass that Grey Poupon
Instead they DJ Mustard me, bruh I stay 2 On
But see I tell em we the best, I DJ Khaled them to rest
So RIP, you know that key is just another one
Look It's Juno turning round the tables
Anything is possible when you willing and able
I'm reaching for that legend title in them fables
My mind is set - he gone and ain't no way to save him
There ain't no way to save a player from the game that made him
It's make or break, I'm taking it all into my heart verbatim
These LA streets they did they job yea they made me cold as Satan
Oh now they want me cuz I'm poppin
Fuck your invitation
I'm sick of ---
Yo I got my swagger on
And my swift speed like a dagger arm
I drift six speed, now get a camera on
And you got to learn, young padawan
How this world working, I been hurting
I never show it but I'll kill for it
Make the earth stand still for it
The modern wordsworth, ill poet
That phone line I'ma let it ring
Cuz I'm moving on to those better things
I've been putting in too much of me
And not seeing enough reciprocity
Oh, been one hell of a year
No looking back no worry or fear
Loving this life that I got until my heart is stopped
You better know muhfucka I'm here
