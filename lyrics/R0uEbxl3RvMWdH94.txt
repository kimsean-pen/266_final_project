Welcome to America
Take a seat and a number
Count down and don't you dare stand up cause you might just make a difference
The city is paved without any shame and leaving your faith has become standard grade
Live with your falsehoods
Everyone is staring
Everyone is watching
This is not reality
Decide on where your soul should be
This endless trap of treachery
