If you were still around
You'd tell me I'm different
Since the last time you called me out
I'd put you down
I'd tell you it's a waste of time
To keep you by my side
If you were still around

I swear
We would sit and stare
We would be nowhere
And to this day
I look for what it's gonna take

To just let things be

Still today I wonder is it
You or me who should feel guilty
I'm pulling
I'm pushing
I'm putting it

Out of my mind
Thought that I had said

Goodbye
If you were still around
You would tell me that you're sorry

But you don't know what you're sorry about

I'd keep to myself
Keep you guessing

Make you question if it's ever gonna work itself out

If you were still around
I swear
We would sit and stare
We would be nowhere
Until this day
I look for what it's gonna take
To just let things be
Still today I wonder is it
You or me who should feel guilty
I'm pulling
I'm pushing
I'm putting it
Out of my mind
Thought that I had said
Goodbye
Yeah it still haunts me
Yeah it still haunts me
Yeah it still haunts me
And to this day
I look for what it's gonna take
To just let things be
And to this day I wonder is it
You or me who should feel guilty
I'm pulling
I'm pushing
I'm putting it
Out of my mind, yeah
Thought that I had said
Goodbye
