And it's over, it's over
I'm circling these vultures
Got me praying that it's longer
Feeling something rotten
Feeling kinda tempted
And I'm pouring out the truth
Just fading out this talk is
'Cause now all I want is you

I'm saying come over here sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word and I'll part the sea
Just come over here and sit next to me

And I'll take you high, high

Well I ain't frontin' my intention
Got your man outlined in chalk
It's a midnight intervention
Got no plans to make it stop

Last time I saw you said
You wanna keep the light?
But I'm here to tell you
I'm not trying to change your mind
It's alright, oooh
It's alright, oooh

I'm saying come over here sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word and I'll part the sea
Just come over here and sit next to me

And I'll take you high, high

It's alright, it's alright, yeah it's alright

Just saying come over here sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word and I'll part the sea
Just come over here and sit next to me
