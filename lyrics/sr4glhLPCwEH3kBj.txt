I'm condemned to the long endless night
And I live in the absense of light
And my shadow has a life of its own
Watching you while you sleep all alone

When the night is all cool, skin and bones
And you lie wrapped in sheets on your own
There's a ring on your dead telephone
Don't be scared when there's nobody home

Like a spider web kiss on your face
That familiar smell just a trace
That's my scent that I left on your lace
So you're never alone
No you're never alone

I'm condemned to the long endless night
And I live in the absence of light
