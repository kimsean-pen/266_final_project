I washed chain grease & blood off of my hands
In the ocean, I let salt water rinse the dirt away
I stood calm in a room I hadn't been in
In a decade, I felt dizzy, used to stand here every day

Wait out the storm in a harbor town
Pretend I'll see you in fall
Wait out the storm in a harbor town

Hey Hannah, don't go
We could've given you such a
Beautiful home
I won't call
No, you're waiting right outside

Thanks for the ride
I watched lines of container ships drift in
Just off of Long Beach, I thought long about where you would be today
We lose touch after college came my way
I hear you got married to some boy from California

Have a baby on the way
Wait out the storm in a harbor town
Pretend I'll see you in fall

Wait out the storm in a harbor town
Hey Hannah, don't go
We could've given you such a
Beautiful home
I won't call

No, you're waiting right outside
Thanks for the ride
Hey Hannah, don't go
We could've given you such a

Beautiful home
I won't call
No, you're waiting right outside
I'm letting balloons drift off
Sending gifts to a lonely God
Darling please wake up
I'm letting balloons drift off

Sending gifts to a lonely God
If you see her, tell her I'm not giving up
(See her, tell her I'm not giving up)
Hey Hannah, don't go

We could've given you such a
Beautiful home
I won't call
No, you're waiting right outside
Hey Hannah, don't go

We could've given you such a
Beautiful home
I won't call
No, you're waiting right outside
Thanks for the ride
Hey Hannah, don't go
We could've given you such a
Beautiful home
I won't call
No, you're waiting right outside
Thanks for the ride
