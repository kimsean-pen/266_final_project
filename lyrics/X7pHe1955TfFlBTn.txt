You don't know love like you used to,
You don't feel love like you did before.

Ohhhhhhhhhh!
Ohhhhhhhhhh!

You ran with the dead today, with the moles from the C.I.A.,
They say more than you ever say.
Headlights in your rear view mirror,
A panther's eyes as he prays on fear,
Your hunt for love, you electioneer.

Ohhhhhhhhhh!
Ohhhhhhhhhh!
Ohhhhhhhhhh!
Ohhhhhhhhhh!

You ran with the dead today,
Through the cemeteries where ghosts still play,
The more you ran, love got further away.
One look and I saw inside
Every little thing you'd die to hide,
You are the truth, when you lied.

Ohhhhhhhhhh!
Ohhhhhhhhhh!
Ohhhhhhhhhh!
Ohhhhhhhhhh!
Ohhhhhhhhhh!
Ohhhhhhhhhh!
Ohhhhhhhhhh!
Ohhhhhhhhhh!

You don't know love like you used to,
You don't feel love like you did before.
You don't know love like you used to,
You don't feel love like you did before.

Ohhhhhhhhhh!
Ohhhhhhhhhh!

You don't know love like you used to,
You don't feel love like you did before.
Oh, you don't know love like you used to,
You don't feel love like you did before.
Oh, you don't know love like you used to,
You don't feel love like you did before.
Ah, you don't know love like you used to,
Ah, you don't feel love like you did before.

You don't know love like you used to.
