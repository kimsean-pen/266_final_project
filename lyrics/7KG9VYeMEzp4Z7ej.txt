Dance dance, if you do that dance
I'm gonna let you join my one man band
Be my doll, be my baby doll
Come get to know me like the back of your hand
I like the name hanging out in shade
I like the way you do the push and the shove
You can blow my mind if you're that way inclined
All that I know is that you fell from above

She fell, she fell, right under my spell
Hold up pretty baby c'mon
She danced, she danced, right into my hands
Hold up pretty baby c'mon
Be my butterfly
You were almost shaking me
You rolled me at the top of them all
And if you feel the need
I'll send you God's speed
To me you're hangin' at the break of the dawn

Get out of the doledrums baby, now
You lie, I'll set ya' on fire
Get out of the doledrums baby, now

Do your thang on the beat of the bang
I'll put a melody inside of your head
No need to shout, what you bitchin' about?
I think those things are better left unsaid
She had a look you won't find in a book
And she smell like 1969
You could blow my mind if you're that way inclined
And I know you're gonna make it mine

She fell, she fell, right under my spell
Hold up pretty, baby c'mon
She danced, she danced, right into my hands
Hold up pretty, baby c'mon
Be my butterfly
You were almost shaking me
You rolled me at the top of them all
And if you feel the need
I'll send you God's speed
To me you're hangin' at the break of the dawn

Get out of the doledrums baby, now
You lie, I'll set ya' on fire
Get out of the doledrums baby, now

She fell, she fell, right under my spell
She fell, she fell, right under my spell
She fell, she fell, right under my spell
She fell, she fell, right under my spell
She fell, she fell, right under my spell
She fell, she fell, right under my spell
She fell, she fell, right under my spell
She fell, she fell, right under my spell
She fell, she fell, right under my spell
She fell, she fell, right under my spell
She fell, she fell, right under my spell
She fell, she fell, right under my spell
She fell, she fell, right under my spell
She fell, she fell, right under my spell
She fell, she fell, right under my spell
