Elephant spirits
Tower of ivory
Story of ancient deities

Seizure of the fleece
Protector of its place

Fly through dreamscapes
Of valleys, gullies and spires
Herd across suicidal slopes

Changeless moonshines
Circle cyclops image

A race of one-eyed beings
All feared and shunned
Rakshasa demon

Seizure of the fleece
Protector of its place

Eyes all around you
Enter the labyrinth
Visions of the hunted
Beware the birchmen
Incisors thought to be
Skulls of us
