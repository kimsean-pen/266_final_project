One time, to know that it's real
One time, to know how it feels
That's all
One call, your voice on the phone
One place, a moment alone
That's all

What do you see
What do you know
What are the signs
What do I do
Just follow your lifeline through
What if it hurts
What then
What do you do
What do you say
Don't throw your lifelines away

Don't throw your lifelines away

One time, just once in my life
Yeah, one time, to know it can happen twice
One shot, of a clear blue sky
One look, I see no reasons why we can't
One chance to be back to the point where everything starts
One chance, to keep it together
Things fall apart
Once I make us believe it's true

What do you see
Where do we go
What are the signs
How do we grow
By letting your lifeline show
What if we do
What up to now
What do you say
How do I know
Don't let your lifeline go

Don't let your lifeline go
Ahaha
Don't let your lifeline go
