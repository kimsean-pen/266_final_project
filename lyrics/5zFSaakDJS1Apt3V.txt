Wake up baby, what you in for
Start the day upon your knees
What you pissin' in the wind for
You musta snorted too much bleas
East house pinball wizard
Full tilt bozo plague
Second floor trekkie makin warp speed out the door
Julio afrokeluchie
He the only one who stayed
Counting up the days
Please no more
My fist your face
That's for sure
Hey betty boop you got me droolin
I'm buzzing round your hive tonight
You play the hooky stead of schoolin
Son of a bitch put out the light
Thirteen year old hookers
Take a sack right through the bars
You wonder why the man's outside your door
Junior acheivers, got the old bull by the horns
Back in the saddle gets yous sore
My fist your face
That's for sure
East house pinball wizard
Full tilt bozo plague
Second floor trekkie makin' warp speed out the door
Julio afrokeluchie
He the only one that stayed
Counting up the days
Please no more
Ah my fist your face
That's for sure
Ohhoo yeah
My fist your face
That's for sure ohhooo
My fist your face
That's for sure ohhoo
My fist your face
That's for sure
