I ain't looking fo trouble
I'm just staying for a few drinks
Think about a few things
Actually, make it double
'Cause now I feel like dancin'
Boy just take my hands and we'll go

Making all the bad decisions
Oh-yeah, oh-yeah, oh-yeah
Liquid Courage Ammunition
Oh-yeah, oh-yeah, oh-yeah-yeah
Pretend that we just never ended
Oh-yeah, oh-yeah, oh-yeah
Dance like all our scars are mended

So I show you the cards in my hand
And say that I want you
Say that I want you
This wasn't part of my plan
But now that I told you
Baby I told you

I ain't lookin' for trouble
I'm just staying for a few drinks
Think about a few things
Actually, make it double
'Cause now I feel like dancin'
Boy just take my hands and we'll go

Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Oh-yeah, oh-yeah
Oh-yeah, oh-yeah

I wasn't looking for trouble
But there you were in my way
Looking like the old days
Shabby with your stubble
Caught you kissing on the dance-floor
Thinkin' you're a bad boy, I start

Making all the bad decisions
Oh-yeah, oh-yeah, oh-yeah
Liquid Courage Ammunition
Oh-yeah, oh-yeah, oh-yeah-yeah
Pretend that we just never ended
Oh-yeah, oh-yeah, oh-yeah
Dance like all our scars are mended

So I show you the cards in my hand
And say that I want you
Say that I want you
This wasn't part of my plan
But now that I told you
Baby I told you

I ain't lookin' for trouble
I'm just staying for a few drinks
Think about a few things
Actually, make it double
'Cause now I feel like dancin'
Boy just take my hands and we'll go

Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Oh-yeah, oh-yeah
Oh-yeah, oh-yeah

I ain't lookin' for trouble
