Won't you let me walk you home from school?
Won't you let me meet you at the pool?
Maybe Friday I can
Get tickets for the dance
And I'll take you.
Mm, hmm.

Won't you tell your Dad, get off my back?
Tell him what we said 'bout "Paint It Black".
Rock and roll is here to stay.
Well, come inside now it's okay
And I'll shake you.
Mm, hmm.

Won't you tell me what you're thinking of?
Would you be an outlaw for my love?
If it's so, well let me know.
If it's no, well I can go.
I won't make you.
Mm, hmm.
