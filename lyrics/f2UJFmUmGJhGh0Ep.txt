I won't go away
Right, right here I stay
Stand silent in flames
Stand tall till it fades

Shoot me again, I ain't dead yet
Come on, shoot me again, I ain't dead yet
I said shoot me again, I ain't dead yet
Come on, shoot me again, I ain't dead yet

Come on, shoot me again, shoot me again, shoot me
Shoot me again, shoot me again, come on
Shoot me again, shoot me again, shoot me
Shoot me again, shoot me again, come on

All the shots I take
I spit back at you
All the shit you fake
Comes back to haunt you

All the shots
All the shots

All the shots I take
What difference did I make?
All the shots I take
I spit back at you

I won't go away, with a bullet in my back
Right here I stay, with a bullet in my back

Shoot me (take a shot)
Shoot me (take a shot)
Shoot me (take a shot)
Shoot me (take a shot)

I stand on my own, with a bullet in my back
I'm stranded and sold, with a bullet in my back

Shoot me again, I ain't dead yet
Come on, shoot me again, I ain't dead yet
Yeah, shoot me again, I ain't dead yet
Come on, shoot me again, I ain't dead yet

I said, shoot me again, shoot me again, come on
Shoot me again, shoot me again, come on
Shoot me again, shoot me again, shoot me
Shoot me again, shoot me again, yeah

All the shots I take
I spit back at you
All the shit you fake
Comes back to haunt you

All the shots
All the shots

All the shots I take
Hey, what difference did I make? (What difference did I make?)
All the shots I take
I spit back at you

I bite my tongue, tryin' not to shoot back
No compromise, my heart won't pump the other way

Wake the sleeping giant, wake the beast
Wake the sleeping dog, no, let him sleep
Wake the sleeping giant, wake the beast
Wake the sleeping dog, no, let him sleep

I bite my tongue, tryin' not to shoot back

All the shots I take
I spit back at you, yeah
All the shit you fake
Comes back to haunt you

All the shots
All the shots

All the shots I take
Hey, what difference did I make? (What difference did I make?)
All the shots I take
I spit back at you
