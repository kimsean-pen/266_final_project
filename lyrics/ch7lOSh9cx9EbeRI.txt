Well, your reputation beats you to this
Little town like breaking news
Of a devastation that you left behind
Well, I ain't scared of a little rain
And I watch that spinning weather vane
I guess I just ain't the running kind

(Ooooooooh, ooooooooh)
They all watch from windows as I ran that dark cloud down
You were nothing but trouble, baby
And I've been sifting through the rubble lately
I should've listened to the, I should've listened to the
(Ooooooooh)
Wanted to dance in the eye of danger
Knowing good well I'd regret it later
I should've listened to the, I should've listened to the
(Ooooooooh)
The warning lights were flashing like lightning
I should've listened to the, I should've listened to the sirens

Well, I let you crumble every wall
With your hail as hard as a cannonball
'Cause I like the risk that's in your reckless touch
And I've always had a weakness for
A terrible and twisted storm
'Cause your kiss is an adrenaline rush

(Ooooooooh, ooooooooh)
I knew what I was chasing when I ran that dark cloud down
You were nothing but trouble, baby
And I've been sifting through the rubble lately
I should've listened to the, I should've listened to the
(Ooooooooh)
Wanted to dance in the eye of danger
Knowing good well I'd regret it later
I should've listened to the, I should've listened to the
(Ooooooooh)
The warning lights were flashing like lightning
I should've listened to the, I should've listened to the sirens

Oh, mmm

Maybe I'll know better the next time I hear that
Ooooooooh, ooooooooh
I should've listened to the
Ooooooooh, yeah

You were nothing but trouble, baby
And I've been sifting through the rubble lately
I should've listened to the, I should've listened to the

Wanted to dance in the eye of danger
Knowing good well I'd regret it later
I should've listened to the, I should've listened to the
Ooooooooh
The warning lights were flashing like lightning
I should've listened to the, I should've listened to the sirens

Going...
(Ooooooooh, ooooooooh)
