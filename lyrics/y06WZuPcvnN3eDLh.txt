You and I got something, but it's all and then it's nothing to me
And I got my defenses when it comes to your intentions for me
And we wake up in the breakdown with
the things we never thought we could be

I'm not the one who broke you
I'm not the one you should fear
We got to move you, darling
I thought, I lost you somewhere
But you were never really ever there at all

And I want to get free, talk to me
I can feel you falling
And I wanted to be all you need
Somehow here is gone

I have no solution to the sound of this pollution in me
And I was not the answer so forget you ever thought it was me

I'm not the one who broke you
I'm not the one you should fear
We got to move you, darling
I thought, I lost you somewhere
But you were never really ever there at all

And I want to get free, talk to me
I can feel you falling
And I wanted to be all you need
Somehow here is gone

And I don't need the fallout of all the past
That's here between us
And I'm not holding on
And all your lies weren't enough to keep me here

And I want to get free, talk to me
I can feel you falling
And I wanted to be all you need
Somehow here is gone

And I want to get free, talk to me
I can feel you falling
I know it's out there
I know it's out there
I can feel you falling
I know it's out there
I know it's out there
Somehow here is gone
I know it's out there
I know it's out there
Somehow here is gone
