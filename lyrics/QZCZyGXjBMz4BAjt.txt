Gunfire left a hole in the tank, losing gasoline
Fire is on my trail and he's after me
Hope it don't get here before I get where
I'm going I gotta get where I'm going
Take off my mask to breathe
You could've been a part of a masterpiece
Fluid in the brakes was the last to leak that's the thing

Where im going I don't need my brakes
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

The lovers need to clear the road, oh oh
Because this thing is ready to blow, oh oh

I just wanna set you on fire so I
Won't have to burn alone then you
Then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb... fire bomb...

Seems cold but baby no it doesn't have to be
Microwaving a metal tragedy
Watching it burning, it's beautiful and it's blue
And it's pitiful and it's blue, it's the other half of me
I didn't do it you lit the match for me
Now we're flying from the blast baby thats the thing

Where we're going we don't need no brakes
Can't wait to see your face
when your front windows break
And I come crashing through

The lovers need to clear the road, oh oh
Because this thing is ready to blow, oh oh

I just wanna set you on fire so I
Won't have to burn alone then you
Then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb... fire bomb...

Baby we were killin' em
They couldnt handle the millionth
Degree we, were criminals
As we were burning, the world called the police
Fire department, ambulance
You can call me crazy
'Cause I believe the only move for me and you is to go out blazing

The lovers need to clear the road, oh oh
Because this thing is ready to blow, oh oh

I just wanna set you on fire so I
Won't have to burn alone then you
Then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb... (oh oh) fire bomb...
