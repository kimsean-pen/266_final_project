I feel sorrow for the fear
And everything it brings
Wonder if it will ever sleep

I know you understand
'Cause you briefly look away
Focusin' on nothin' so now everything is clear

'Cause there's no one to blame
You got no place to hide
It's only in your mind

And I saw you
In amazement
Stumblin' through the day
You told me time never waits
What is that supposed to mean

All of life
Is in one drop of the ocean
Waitin' to go home
Just waitin' to go home

And if the moon
Can turn the tides it can pull the tears and take 'em from our eyes
And make 'em into monsoons
And turn 'em into monsoons
Sooner or later they'll weave their way back to the sea

Gonna finally be free
Free for a while

Until they break
Like waves of sorrow always do all in due time
'Cause time never waits

Daddy don't daydream again
Just help me to believe and then
Show me that there's more than the meantime

Sonny do you hear the sound
You will feel it when it breaks
You will know it when its gone
How else can I explain

'Cause there's only the pain
Comin' straight through
Comin' to your mind

Cross cut to you
In amazement
Stumblin' through the day
You tell me time never waits
Thats OK cause I don't wait for time

When all of life
Is in one drop of the ocean
Waitin' to go home
Just waitin' to go home

And if the moon
Can turn the tides it can pull the tears and take 'em from our eyes
And turn 'em into monsoons
And make 'em into monsoons
Sooner or later they'll weave their way back to the sea

Gonna finally be free
be free for a while

Until they break
Like waves of sorrow always break all in due time
'Cause time never waits
