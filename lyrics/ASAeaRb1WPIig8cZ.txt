Dear diary,
This battle's on the verge of emergency
Call in a chemical warfare attack
Tempting fate with the crisis that my vices will orchestrate
Cold sweats as my bold pupils dilate
I could die from the weight of it all, or make it through another close call
Here's a note to myself, "Back to the wall
The higher you get, girl, the further you fall"
Here's a note to myself, "Alone in my pain
How close can you come to the edge before you walk away?"
Through blackened veins the evil in the needle bleeds into my brain
And sells me on the sense of a fool's escape
I could die from the weight of it all, or make it through another close call
Here's a note to myself, "Back to the wall
The higher you get, girl, the further you fall"
Here's a note to myself, "Alone in my pain
How close can you come to the edge before you walk away?"
But I just need one more taste
One more taste
Scars earned from searching for solutions
So desperate just to feel
Sold on self-prescribed pollution, just distorting what was real
And so it goes in the throes of what I can't overcome
Painfully numb
