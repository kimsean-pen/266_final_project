Have you heard the latest re-invention in the street?
Take me on a journey with the rhythm in my feet
Takes me to the left and it takes me to the right
Posing as a savior if you fall across the night
Hey, I know, there's some places that you'd like to go
Hey, that's why, you take out there and dance in time
Blink and you'll miss a revolution
Baby baby, can't you see?
(Oh, take it from me)
(Oh, take it from me)
We're on a path to eternity
(Oh, take it from me)
(Oh, take it from me)
Oh the fashion prophets, they will tell you what to do
Take this single formula and guard it's strength in you
Hey, I know, there's some places that you'd like to go
Hey, that's why, you take out there and dance in time
Baby baby, can't you see?
(Oh, take it from me)
(Oh, take it from me)
We're on a path to eternity
(Oh, take it from me)
(Oh, take it from me)
Build me up and burn it down
(Oh, take it from me)
(Oh, take it from me)
Then spread the ashes over my old town
