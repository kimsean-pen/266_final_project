I close my eyes and even when I'm sleeping I'm alright
'Cause you are in my life
Once upon a time
I only imagined this
And now you're mine
Wished for you so hard
Pray that you'd find me
Maybe you're here today
Here to remind me

If you believe the dreams come true
There's one that's waiting there for you
'Cause I believed when I saw you that when you want something enough
Then it can't escape your love
There is nothing in the world that cannot be
If you believe

Everybody said that I was a fool to think that we connect
(Everybody said that) I couldn't get my heart out of my head
They just didn't see
No they just couldn't know
The feeling that you get
The places that you go

If you believe the dreams come true
There's one that's waiting there for you
'Cause I believed when I saw you
That when you want something enough
Then it can't escape your love
There is nothing in the world that cannot be
If you believe

Never wished for material things
Never needed wind in my wings
I never wished for anything but you...
I can't explain it
Someone just told me
Go where your heart is you'll never be lonely

If you believe the dreams come true
There's one that's waiting there for you
'Cause I believed when I saw you that when you want someone enough
Then they can't escape your love
There is nothing in the world that cannot be
If you believe
