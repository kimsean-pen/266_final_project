in my time there'll be no one else
crime, it's the way I fly to you (snake eater)
I'm still in a dream of the snake eater
I give my life
not for honor, but for you (snake eater)
in my time there'll be no one else
crime, it's the way I fly to you (snake eater)
I'm still in a dream of the snake eater
I'm still in a dream of the snake eater
