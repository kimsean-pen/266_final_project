I am a robot, living like a robot, talk like a robot, in the habititting way

Look up to the sky (robot), you can trample over me (robot)
Do anything you do, now the ground has gone

I am a robot, living like a robot, talk like a robot, in the habititting way

In the future we all die (robot), machines will last forever (robot)
Metal things just turn to rust, when you're a robot

I am a robot, living like a robot, talk like a robot, in the habititting way

The best thing is our life span (I don't mind)
We last nigh on hundred years (I don't mind)
If that means we'll be together I don't mind
I have no mind, I have no mind

I'm programmed to follow you (robot), do exactly as you do (robot)
Now my nervous system's blue, I feel fine

I am a robot, living like a robot, talk like a robot, in the habititting way

The best thing is our life span (I don't mind)
We last nigh on hundred years (I don't mind)
If that means we'll be together I don't mind (I have no mind)
The best things last a life time (I have no mind)
When you age I will not change (I have no mind)
I think I'll be around forever if you don't mind

I have no mind, why don't (I have no mind) (robot)
I have no mind, why don't (I have no mind) (robot)
I have no mind, why don't (I have no mind) (robot)
I have no mind, why don't (I have no mind)
