We're standing in the rain
And sipping cold champagne
The night is full of angels of sin
The demons of pleasure and pain

You whisper in my ear
I'm holding back the tears
Your words are burning the way to my heart
That's been held hostage for years

The wild look in your eyes
Will light my fire inside
This is the night that we cannot deny
We'll always be partners in crime

I kiss your lips so sweet
Mmm... but do you feel the heat?
Is it so wrong to be hungry for love?
To follow the passion so deep?

The wild look in your eyes
Will light my fire inside
This is the night that we cannot deny
We'll always be partners in crime

The wild look in your eyes
Will light my fire inside
This is the night that we cannot deny
We'll always be partners in crime

Now it's too late to turn back the time
We just have to go with the flow
I will be yours and you will be mine
And that's how the story goes

The wild look in your eyes
Will light my fire inside
This is the night that we cannot deny
We'll always be partners in crime

The wild look in your eyes
Will light my fire inside
This is the night that we cannot deny
We'll always be partners in crime

Partners in crime
Partners in crime
