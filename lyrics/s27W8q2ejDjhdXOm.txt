Empty pack of cigarettes by the bed
you woke up and looked at me and you said
"keaton is it morning yet?"
"no, we have a couple hours left;
god knows what'll happen then."

There may be questions in your head
as a new day is dawning
like what things for us lie ahead
but woman I will see you in the morning
and woman I will see you in the morning

And I know every mark on your hand
perhaps you'd like me more if I was still in a band
but you know the crowds unsettle me
these days I'd play for free
baby, please don't look at me
like that

There may be questions in your head
as a new day is dawning
like what things for us lie ahead
and woman I will see you in the morning
oh woman I will see you in the morning
oh woman I will see you in the morning
morning
