Ask now, I'm in love for the first time ever
The universe becomes my mom and my dad
A hand in a glove on a joint adventure
Moving toward our own Goldilocks planet
'Cause when everyone latched like autotune
Into the grid that they all just assumed
Was and was not a map of the universe
They just misplaced the pure wave that is you

I found it in you
I found it in you
I found it in you
I found it in you

Everybody wants the same chimera
Everyone hungry but honey get off the feeds
Salt of the sea and the salt of Sierras
I preach to birds and then bees preach back to me
Now in hindsight the alienation
And all the painful dreams I failed to extinguish
Were the foot lights down dark aisles I've taken
Now they've led me to you and I'm singing

I found it in you
I found it in you
I found it in you
I found it in you
I found

And when we met there were alien hosannas
Thrown from the heavens like Prince and Nirvana
Like braided brooks tied tides woven oceans
Like the trees interleaved with explosions
Of birdsong as they're singing to me
Down to earth in the land of the free
In the new time that you've given to me

I found it in you
I found it in you
I found it in you
I found it in you
I found it in you
I found
I found
I found
I found
I found
I found
I found
I found
I found

I (I) have (have) such a (such a) rad (rad) time with you
Any (any) thing we (thing we) do it's whatever
That's why I love you
