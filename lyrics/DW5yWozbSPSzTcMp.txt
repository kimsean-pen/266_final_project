And now I'll hang my skin, this skin.
Transparent words of sin
My love, so sweet.
Your name looks good distorted like that.
Scrape off the skin
Revealing crud.

An hour before dawn
I'm walking through the rain
And scratching on her window screen
I've come to cut cupid's heart out
I've come to take your breath away.
I've come to cut cupid's heart out
I've come to take your breath away.

Sundripped devil, sundripped devil
Scratched out my eyes, scratched out my eyes. (x3)

Break the door down.
Knock the door down.
Angel I can't let you in.

I can't let you in.
