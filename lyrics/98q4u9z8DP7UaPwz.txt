Life in L.A.
Well, what can I say?
It's a treasure to find
So many ways to unwind

You could be so lonely
Life in L.A. is so lonely
Is so lonely
That way

Life in L.A.
Come on out if you're gay
Make your babies and money
Move in together
Take out that loan
Honey, it's now or never

The weather is your boyfriend
On a Saturday
Stay in bed

You can be so lonely
Life in L.A. is so lonely
Is so lonely
That way

My girl in my car
But we're not getting too far
Yes, I'm taking her home
Halfway to Fresno at dawn

Every peck on my cheek
When I look at her face
Every time we make plans
I think leather and lace

Life in L.A.
Like a day in my brain

And did you know you could be so lonely?
Life in L.A. is so lonely
Is so lonely that way

Take me home
