I've never really cared about you
I've never really cared

I want somebody else
I want somebody else to be with you
I want somebody else
I want somebody else to follow through

I'm wide awake, lying in the dark
I'm wide awake, knowing I never miss you
Should've said something at the start 'cause June
I never really cared about you

This whole thing we've been through, I never really cared about you
This drifting we drink too, I never really cared
This feeling hits, I never really cared about
I never really cared

I long somebody else
I long someday else who wants to
When I'm cowardly shy in your safety belt
Nobody else can make me feel less true 'cause June
I never really cared about you

This whole thing we've been through, I never really cared about you
This drifting we drink too, I never really cared
This feeling hits, I never really cared about
I never really cared

When I'm cowardly shy
When I'm cowardly shy
When you long for the untrue
Everybody gives up sooner or later, soon or later

I'm wide awake, lying in the dark
I'm wide awake, knowing I never miss you
I Should've said something at the start 'cause June
I never really cared about you
