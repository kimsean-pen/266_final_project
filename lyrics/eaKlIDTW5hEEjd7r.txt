(I don't know where you go
I don't know where you go
I don't know where you go
I don't know where you go
I don't know where you go)
I should've thrown these feelings when together
Too many times, this time around
This time that is our time, this time around
This time!
This time that is our time, this time around
This time!
Uuu, turn around 'cause it feels so good

Things on my mind, all kinds of things on my mind
On my mind, on my mind
All they're saying it's??
It's why I am in my best time, best time
My life, my life with who
Things on my mind, all kinds of things in my mind
On my mind, on my mind
All they're saying it's??
It's why I am in my best time, best time
My life, my life with who
(I don't know where you go
I don't know where you go
I don't know where you go
I don't know where you go
I don't know where you go)
