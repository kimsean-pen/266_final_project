Well I got us on a hiway, I got us in a car
I got us going faster than we've ever gone before
I got us on a hiway, I got us in a car
I got us going faster than we've ever gone before

And I know it ain't gonna last
And I know it ain't gonna last
When I see your eyes arive
They explode like two bugs on glass

Far above the ocean, deep under the sea
There's a river runnin' dry, because of you and me
Far above the ocean, deep under the sea
There's a river runnin' dry, because of you and me

And I know, it ain't gonna last
And I know, it ain't gonna last
When I see your eyes arive,
They explode like two bugs on glass

She's a goddess on a hiway, a goddess in a car
A goddess going faster than she's ever gone before
She's a goddess on a hiway, a goddess in a car
A goddess going faster than she's ever gone before

And I know, it ain't gonna last
And I know, it ain't gonna last
When I see your eyes arive,
They explode like two bugs on glass

And I know, it ain't gonna last
And I know, it ain't gonna last
And I know, it ain't gonna last
And I know, it ain't gonna last
It ain't gonna last
It ain't gonna last
It ain't gonna last
It ain't gonna last
