If you're lookin' to find a love that will stand 'til the end of time
Baby relax your mind when love is here, yeah yeah
I'll do everything I swear
I'll take the pain and the hurt, you won't know it's there
Once will be nothin', put that on everything, put that on everything

I will pull a star out of the sky for you, yes I would
To the edge of the earth I'll go to see you, yes it's true
If you're anywhere and I'm not there
Just think one part of love and I'll appear baby

If you're lookin' to find a love that will stand 'til the end of time
Baby relax your mind when love is here, yeah
I'll do everything I swear
I'll take the pain and hurt, you won't know it's there
Once will be nothing, put that on everything, put that on everything

Before I dream I always think of you every night
I promise to God that I'm tellin' you the truth
I wish you can see of what your presence means to me
You will love me so much more each day

I'll walk with you through the desert heat
I'll climb the mountain's highest peak
I'll swim forever in the deepest sea
Just for you the song I sing, for all the love and joy you bring
You'll try to do the impossible thing, put that on everything

If you're lookin' to find a love that will stand 'til the end of time
Baby relax your mind when love is here, yeah yeah
I'll do everything I swear
I'll take the pain and the hurt, you won't know it's there
Once won't be nothin', put that on everything, put that on everything

I'll walk with you through the desert heat
I'll climb the mountain's highest peak
I'll swim forever in the deepest sea
Just for you the song I sing, for all the love and joy you bring
You'll try to do the impossible thing, put that on everything

If you're lookin' to find a love that will stand 'til the end of time
Baby relax you're mind when love is here, yeah yeah
I'll do everything I swear
I'll take the pain and the hurt, you won't know it's there
Once will be nothin', put that on everything, put that on everything

If you're lookin' to find a love that will stand 'til the end of time
