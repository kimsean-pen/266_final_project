Sometimes life surprises
'Cause you'd never expect it to be that
Dangerous disguises
That you never expect to see

Some things never change
Nothing's gonna change that
Some things you cant explain
Like why we're all embracing conventional wisdom in a world that's just so unconventional

Made you turn around
But you never expected to see that
That's what makes that sound
That you never expect to hear

Some things never change
Some things wanna change that
Some things you cant explain
Like why we're all embracing conventional wisdom in a world thats just so unconventional

They don't know they're wrong
But you know that they never can see that
That's what makes them strong
That they know that we'll never see
