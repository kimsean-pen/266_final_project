My heart beats in my head and it's thunderous
Those caught in the rat race plunder us
They know what's best for us
They know what's best for us

Gotta keep up, gotta get ahead
Gotta go and get a job and work 'til I'm dead
They know what's best for us
They know what's best for us

And I'm thinking that they must have missed the point
Hold on, we just hold on for an exit
And I'm thinking that they must have missed the point
Hold on, we just hold on for an exit

out to defeat, out to defeat everyone
out to deceive, out to deceive anyone
They know what's best for us
They know what's best for us

Who holds the master key givin to authority (WHAT?)
I don't know, it's a foul monstrosity
They know what's best for us
They know what's best for us

And I'm thinking that they must have missed the point
Hold on, we just hold on for an exit
And I'm thinking that they must have missed the point
Hold on, we just hold on for an exit

You see the purpose of the rat race defeats me
When we're gone what's left behind?
But there seems to be no end or reason
Yet we still carry on

You see the purpose of the rat race defeats me
When we're gone what's left behind?
But there seems to be no END

When you finally reach the front of the pack
There's nothing there, just and endless barren track
It goes on and on
It goes on and on

You know what?
Let's get disqualified!
Let's get disqualified!
And I'm thinking that they must have missed the point
Hold on, we just hold on for an exit
And I'm thinking that they must have missed the point
Hold on, we just hold on for an exit
