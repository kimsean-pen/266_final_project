Copy, paste, and like
I curate my own life
This is a picture
It is not my own

I am a ghost
I am everything
Wander from land to land
Searching for spoils

I'll take it all
All mine
Everything and all at once
All mine
I have now become the source

Look at me
I'm an exquisite corpse
Does this qualify as cultured?
Or just overexposed?

I am
All style
Everything and every look
All mine
Erudite and a la mode

Not concerned
With lack of context
Void of reference

Culture is turned off

Shifting at a whim
Following every random path
Blind to see
Deaf to hear
That everything we do is just an echo of the past

A generation collaged
Built from the ruins
Formulations
Based on
The safest answers to our questions
We know
We'll never lose face we don't take sides
We know
"Nobody's gonna love me like me"
