I got ten toes down
I must be floating
My emotions like in and out
Now I ain't got no feel

They talk about, talk a lot about us in a bad light
My heart is an angel, twisted and I'm tangled
My have me unstable
Love me from every angle
Tell me that you can when you're able
Shut me down when I'm fatal

I want you and I need you and I got you
And I'm gonna have you if I say so
I want you and I need you and I got you
And I'm gonna have you if I say so
I want you and I need you and I got you
And I'm gonna have you if I say so
I want you and I need you and I got you
And I'm gonna have you if I say so

I got ten toes down
I'm going in a little loud
You need my bod like a Mophie
Give you hours just to hold me

They talk about, talk a lot about us in a bad light
My heart is an angel, twisted and tangled
My have me unstable
Love me from every angle
Tell me that you can when you're able
Shut me down when I'm fatal

I want you and I need you and I got you
And I'm gonna have you if I say so
I want you and I need you and I got you
And I'm gonna have you if I say so
I want you and I need you and I got you
And I'm gonna have you if I say so
I want you and I need you and I got you
And I'm gonna have you if I say so

I want you and I need you and I got you
And I'm gonna have you if I say so
