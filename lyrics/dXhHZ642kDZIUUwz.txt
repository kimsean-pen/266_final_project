Though, to be the one
I can think about it sometimes
I did it all, I did no harm
I'm caught in the middle
Always find a way to compromise
But never different in this place
You call mine

Mix it up, in my head
When you did, and didn't want to show
Light it up, blow it out
Start again, predicament

Tell me you're the one, tell me you're the one
That I could not do without
Tell me you're the one, tell me you're the one
That I should still love
Tell me you're the one, tell me you're the one
That would never do me wrong
Tell me you're the one, tell me you're the one
But you're not the one
Not the one

Stain, won't go away
Hoping that it might all just wash over
Shame the words
Will not erase
There's no more excuses
Never thought you'd be the one to lie
But I can see the ghost behind your eyes

Though, to be the one
I can think about it sometimes
I did it all, I did no harm
Mix it up, in my head
When you did, and didn't want to show
Light it up, blow it out
Start again, predicament
It's a predicament
It's a predicament
It's a predicament
It's a predicament

Tell me you're the one, tell me you're the one
That I could not do without
Tell me you're the one, tell me you're the one
That I should still love
Tell me you're the one, tell me you're the one
That would never do me wrong
Tell me you're the one, tell me you're the one
But you're not the one
Not the one

Tell me you're the one, tell me you're the one
(baby)
Not the one
Not the one
