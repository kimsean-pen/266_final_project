The mysterious Doctor Sonol
Over the asylum now presides
And his alias is Doctor Caligari
The fairground's a dark place to hide
In the cabinet lies Cesare
Who has slept these 25 years
Cesare knows all secrets
Ask him to look into your future

How long shall I live?
Until Dawn
How long shall I live?
Until Dawn

In the cabinet of Doctor Caligari
Lies Cesare with his black leaded eyes
The somnambulist awaits the Doctor's commands
And obeys as another man dies
In Doctor Caligari's cabinet
Cesare knows all secrets
In Doctor Caligari's cabinet
Cesare knows all secrets

Over the rooftops of Holstenwall
Ceasare carries off a girl named Jane
The ensuing downfall of the Doctor comes
When they find that he himself is insane
In the cabinet

Until Dawn
Over the rooftops of Holstenwall
Cesare carries off a girl named Jane
The ensuing downfall of the Doctor comes
When they find that he himself is insane
In the cabinet

How long shall I live?
Until Dawn
How long shall I live?
Until Dawn

Until Dawn
