Alcohol on my hands, I got plans to ditch myself and get outside
Dancing women throwing plates, decapitating their laughing dates
Swirling chickens caught in flight, out of focus and much too bright
Coming down, shiny teeth, game show suckers trying to breathe

But I got a drug and I got the bug
And I got something better than love
How you like me now? Pretty good
Going on, feeling strong

I quit my job blowing leaves, telephone bills up my sleeves
Choking like a one man dustball, freedom rock slimeball talking in code
We went down, lit up the shack, grabbed me a beer out of the sack
Everybody bent over twice, painting the walls, throwing some dice

Leaping up into the air getting juiced up beyond belief
And they were singin' like this

Winos throwing frisbees at the sun
Burnt my soul between the bun
Now I'm wounded, now I'm drunk
Now I'm runnin' like a flaming pig
Oh yeah

Scraping off the attitude
Old man eating all my food
Don't be kind, don't be rude
Just shake your boots and let it all get loose
Oh yeah, my goodness

Fluffy clouds, lovely rainbows
I'm sad, a soft and snuggly place
Fluffy clouds, I'm sad and unhappy... yppahnu dna das

Winos throwing frisbees at the sun
Burnt my soul between the bun
Now I'm wounded, now I'm drunk
Now I'm runnin' like a flaming pig
Oh yeah

Scraping off the attitude
Old man eating all my food
Don't be kind, don't be rude
Just shake your boots and let it all get loose
Oh yeah, my goodness

Oh yeah, I like it like that
Oh that is cold
Somebody put a flamethrower on that
Uh-huh, oh my goodness
Take me down to the depot
Somebody put me down on the bus
Oh yeah, I like it like that
Somebody burn me a plate of sassafrass
Oh yeah...
