To the way, I feel inside
And it's all, because you lied
And it's all, because you lied
And it's all, because you lied
And it's all, because you lied

To the way, I feel inside
And it's all, because you lied

To the way, I feel inside
And it's all, because you lied
And it's all, because you lied
And it's all, because you lied
And it's all, because you lied

To the way, I feel inside
And it's all, because you lied
To the way, I feel inside
And it's all, because you lied

We could be friends
Away from my heart
Away from my heart
We could be friends

To the way, I feel inside
And it's all, because you lied
And it's all, because you lied
And it's all, because you lied
And it's all, because you lied

To the way, I feel inside
And it's all, because you lied
