I think of the one that I've become
Left blind from the brightness of your halo
No one shines like you do
My filthy mouth and broken words
This small disease that leaves me crawling
Crawling to you
Crawl on the ground for comfort
Stay close to the dark to keep from falling
From falling

Sold my life to bring the rain
Maybe to wash me clean
Sold my soul to stop the pain
Hoping you'd set me free
I have feared, I have saved
You know that you can lay it all on me
You can lay it all on me

I took every chance to latch my tongue
You wore the scabs just like an angel
There's something about you
Horrible things that I have done
Seems this disease is slowly spreading
Start running, what would you do?
I crawl on the ground for comfort
Staying out of my mind to keep from dying
From dying

Sold my life to bring the rain
Maybe to wash me clean
Sold my soul to stop the pain
Hoping you'd set me free
I have feared, I have saved
You know that you can lay it all on me
You know that you can lay it all on me

Could you forget then what I say
And how I died inside my head
We're starting over, not pretending that the past is dead
All the pain you feel you own
And the times I've seen it known
Don't keep it inside
Let it out and lay it all on me

Sold my life to bring the rain
Maybe to wash me clean
Sold my soul to stop the pain
Hoping you'd set me free
I have feared all the pain
You know that you can lay it all on me
You can lay it all on me
