Me and my best friends, cruising down West End Street
Hiding from cops and driving circles around the block all week
Now, all of my friends died
Out on West End Street
They say we're born to die young, but we're just tryin' to live in peace

So maybe heaven is a ghetto with no bad blocks
Shangri-La dealers at the bus stops
And maybe God is just a cop that we can fast talk

So if you're guilty and you know it, put your hands up
'Cause karma's just a different word for bad luck
And what if death is just another pair of handcuffs?

Then we'd better run
Then we'd better run

All of our friends went crazy on LSD
Sailing their cars through the big bright city streets
And everyone who knows our name
Says that we ain't ever gonna change
They say we're born to die young, but we're tryin' to find a better way
They say we're born to die young, but we're tryin' to find a better way

Maybe heaven is a ghetto with no bad blocks
Shangri-La dealers at the bus stops
And maybe God is just a cop that we can fast talk

So if you're guilty and you know it, put your hands up
'Cause karma's just a different word for bad luck
And what if death is just another pair of handcuffs?

Then we'd better run
Then we'd better run

(What up?)
(Hey, what's up man?)
(I'm just sittin' at [?])
([?] gonna be thirty two years old Tomorrow)
(And I feel)
(Half completely alive, then half completely dead)

Hope and we pray
Day after day
They say we're born to die young, but we're gonna find a better way
Hope and we pray
Day after day
They say we're born to die young, but we're gonna find a better way
