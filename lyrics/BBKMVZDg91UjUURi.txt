We have one chance, one chance to get everything right
We have one chance, one chance and if we're lucky we might
My friends, my habits, my family They mean so much to me
I just don't think that it's right
I've seen so many ships sail in
Just to head back out again and go off sinking

I'm just a box in a cage, I'm just a box in a cage
I'm just a box, just a box in a cage
I'm just a box, just a box in a cage
I'm just a box, just a box in a cage
I'm just a box in a cage

Didn't mean to laugh, didn't know I had
Didn't know the better part of what you said
Cause in your head you are not home
Didn't get the joke, didn't mean to poke another
Just to save myself from someone, something, something or another
Well I walk home

I'm just a box in a cage, I'm just a box in a cage
I'm just a box, just a box in a cage
I'm just a box in a cage
I'm just a box, just a box in a cage
I'm just a box, just a box in a cage
I'm just a box in a cage

We have one chance, one chance to get everything right
My friends, my habits, my family They mean so much to me
I just don't think that it's right
I've seen so many ships sail in
Just to head back out again and go off sinking
