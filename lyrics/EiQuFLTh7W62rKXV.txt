I got bad allergies in the spring time
And sometimes I can't remember names
I'm sorry ahead of time for the summer
And the next time I meet your friends

I know it ain't simple, I know you try
I'm an itchy colour, keeping you warm at night
'Cause I should probably make a call to you
'Cause if you fall in love with me
You should probably know that I got bad allergies
And I hope that doesn't bother you

I got bad allergies when it's cold outside
And sometimes I get a runny nose
I'm sorry ahead of time for the weather
Praying that alcohol makes you feel better

I know it ain't simple, I know you try
I'm an itchy colour, keeping you warm at night
'Cause I should probably make a call to you
'Cause if you fall in love with me
You should probably know that I got bad allergies
And I hope that doesn't bother you
Allergies, yeah

'Cause I should probably make a call to you
'Cause if you fall in love with me
You should probably know that I got bad allergies
And I hope that doesn't bother you
I got bad allergies, allergies
