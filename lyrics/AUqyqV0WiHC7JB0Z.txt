I could fly away
Leave it all behind
I could take a train
But I would rather fly

I could escape
Through the window of my mind
But I'll never leave you behind
I've seen the place where the broken people hide
I wanna know love before I die

Open the window
Open the window

I could steal a plain
The skies, the moon, the rain
I will make a change
I'd give anything

I could escape through the window of my mind
I'll never leave you behind
I've seen the place where the broken people hide
I wanna know love before I die

I'm waiting, I'm waiting
For something, for nothing
I'm ready, I'm ready now

Open the window
Open the window
Open the window

I could escape through the window of my mind
But I'll never leave you behind
I've seen the place where the broken people hide
I wanna know love before I die

Open the window
Open the window
Open the window
