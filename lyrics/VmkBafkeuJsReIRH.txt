This moment will too pass us by
It's this notion inside all of us to prioritize
Through our selfish eyes to be the bull behind the rampage

The reason for all the riot
We'll feed our flame before wasting time on everyone else's
With more problems and less pride
We'll feed our flame before wasting time on everyone else's

The gallows were not supposed to look like this
Oh God, we live in misery, lying here in desperation

We need you here more than anything right now
Right now

If everything's relative, then why the emptiness in our souls?
If everything's relative, then why the emptiness in our souls?

Trying to untie the knot we thought we were untying our entire lives
We're busied up and burnt out
Everyone together, we will strengthen ourselves

Everyone together, we will strengthen ourselves
Everyone together, we will strengthen ourselves
We will
Because now we know
You won't ever fly fast enough to make time stand still
You won't ever fly fast enough to make time stand still
Stop, listen, and learn
Stop, listen, and learn
You won't ever fly fast enough to make time stand still
Stop, listen, and learn
You won't ever fly fast enough to make time stand still
Stop, listen, and learn
You won't ever fly fast enough to make time stand still
Stop, listen, and learn
You won't ever fly fast enough to make time stand still
Stop, listen, and learn
