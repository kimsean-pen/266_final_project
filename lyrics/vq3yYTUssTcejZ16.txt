In the cold
In the cold winter
Under the full moon like a midnight sun
In the cold winter

Underneath the stars
Fall asleep with my hand on your heart
I won't let it skip a beat

In the cold
In the cold winter

Hey, love
I won't hurt you
The night will come and go
I won't hurt you
You'll never dream alone

Dreams
Dreams in a vivid slumber
We're connected when I hold my breath
You're the only one who knows how to wake me

And underneath the stars
Fall asleep with your hand on my heart
You won't let it skip a beat

In the cold
In the cold, cold winter

Hey, love
I won't hurt you
Nights will come and go
I won't hurt you
You'll never dream alone
I won't hurt you
Nights will come and go
I won't hurt you
You'll never dream alone
