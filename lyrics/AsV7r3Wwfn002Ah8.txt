In your ocean I'm ankle deep
I feel the waves crashing on my feet
It's like I know where I need to be, but
I can't figure out, I can't figure out
Just how much air I will need to breathe
When your tide crashes over me
There's only one way to figure out
But will you let me drown
Will you let me drown

Hey now, this is my desire
Consume me like a fire
'Cause I just want
Something beautiful to touch me
I know that I'm marrying
'Cause I am down on my knees
And waiting for
Something beautiful

Ooo, Oooh, Oooh,
Ooo, Oooh, Oooh,
Ooo, Oooh, Oooh,
Something beautiful

And the water is rising quick
And for years I was scared of it
We can't be sure when it will subside
So I won't leave your side
No I can't leave your side

Hey now, this is my desire
Consume me like a fire
'Cause I just want
Something beautiful to touch me
I know that I'm in reach
'Cause I am down on my knees
And waiting for
Something beautiful

Ooo, Oooh, Oooh,
Ooo, Oooh, Oooh,
Ooo, Oooh, Oooh,
Something beautiful

Ooo, Oooh, Oooh,
Ooo, Oooh, Oooh,
Ooo, Oooh, Oooh,
Something beautiful

In a day dream, I couldn't live like this
I wouldn't stop until I found something beautiful
When I wake up, knowing all I have
Is still not what I need (something beautiful)

Hey now, this is my desire
Consume me like a fire
'Cause I just want
Something beautiful to touch me
I know that I'm in reach
'Cause I am down on my knees
And waiting for
Something beautiful

Ooo, Oooh, Oooh,
Ooo, Oooh, Oooh,
Ooo, Oooh, Oooh,
Something beautiful

Ooo, Oooh, Oooh,
Ooo, Oooh, Oooh,
Ooo, Oooh, Oooh,
Something beautiful
