Home, it's becoming a killing field
There's a crosshair locked on my heart
With no recourse, and there's no one behind the wheel
Hellfire you're wiping me out
Killed by

Drones!
Killed by
Drones!
Killed by

You rule with lies and deceit
And the world is on your side
You've got the CIA babe
And all you've done is brutalize

Drones!

War, war just moved up a gear
I don't think I can handle the truth
I'm just a pawn, and we're all expendable
Incidentally electronically erased
By your

Drones!
Killed by
Drones!
Killed by

You kill by remote control
And the world is on your side
You've got reapers and hawks babe
And now I am radicalized

Drones!
Killed by

You rule with lies and deceit
And the world is on your side
You've got the CIA babe
And all you've done is brutalize
You kill by remote control
And the world is on your side
You've got reapers and hawks babe
And now I am radicalized

Here come the drones!
Here come the drones!
Here come the drones!
