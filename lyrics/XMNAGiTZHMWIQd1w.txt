Wide eyes help you stand out and the fact that you bare all skin.
silhouettes keep me thinking about the habits you are in.
watch us blanket all things and solidify all claims.
hopes dreams we're here to make ourselves better.
time to build our colony.
there's no stopping it now conquest is at hand.
and the thirst for more and the need for more go on.
never satisfied never dormant we go on.
see us conquer all the humans that are left.
this is our new home and we're still building
