Falling free
Me and you
Happening so graciously
Together in natural harmony

Feel so free
Quite happily
Seems just like the day of birth
Our first awakening to this Earth

Dancing through the streets side by side
Head thrown back, arms open wide (Open wide)

Going home
Almost gone
Merging with a grain of sand
Try hard to catch us, if you can

Dancing through the streets side by side
Head thrown back, arms open wide (Open wide)
