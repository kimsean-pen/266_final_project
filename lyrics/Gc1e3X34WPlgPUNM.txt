You and I gotta think for a while
Look to the sky, gotta decide if we're gonna see tomorrow

You and I gotta look to the sky
Are we gonna die wondering why life ain't nothing but sorrow?

'Cos it's gonna be a while
'Til I get to see you smile
And you gotta let me know
Oh maybe you won't

You and I gotta think for a while
Look to the sky, gotta decide if we're gonna see tomorrow

You and I gotta look to the sky
Are we gonna die wondering why life ain't nothing but sorrow?

'Cos it's gonna be a while
'Til I get to see you smile
And you gotta let me know
Oh baby, don't go

Never met a girl like you before
I don't think I ever will again
Why don't you smile?
Why don't you smile?

Never thought I'd see you walkin' out that door
I don't think I ever will again
Why don't you sing?
Why can't you sing?
Why can't you sing?

La-la-la-la-la-la (x3)

You and I gotta think for a while
Look to the sky, gotta decide if we're gonna see tomorrow

You and I gotta think for a while
Look to the sky, gotta decide if we're gonna see tomorrow

You and I gotta think for a while
Look to the sky, gotta decide if we're gonna see tomorrow

You and I gotta think for a while
Look to the sky, gotta decide if we're gonna see tomorrow

'Cos it's gonna be a while
'Til I get to see you smile
And you gotta let me know
Oh baby

La-la-la-la-la-la (x3)

La-la-la-la-la-la (x3)

Woh-oh, woh-oh
