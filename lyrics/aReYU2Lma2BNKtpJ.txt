A new bound soul in human skin
That struggles to survive
But learn to trust the wolf within
And fight to stay alive
(In the shadows, born in the night
Hunted by my foes, I fight the might)

There's a wolf (there's a wolf)
In my heart (in my heart)
And it's fighting to survive
I've learned to live (learned to live)
In the dark (in the dark)
For I was born with a wolf in my heart
A wolf in my heart

Stalking my prey
In the dead of night
I hold my breath
As I prepare to strike
My blood rushing a sudden thrill
A violent cry
As I'm move in for the kill
(Because I've learnt to hunt
I've learnt to strike
And I kill
To survive)

There's a wolf (there's a wolf)
In my heart (in my heart)
And it's fighting to survive
I've learned to live (learned to live)
In the dark (in the dark)
For I was born

I gathered my pack at the brink of day
My brothers and sisters
They are there straight away
Hundreds of face that fight for their kin
The vengeance and new dawn
For the wolf, within
(Unfettered and primal
For we will not be tamed
Nor we will linger in the dark)

(Now here I...)
ROAAAARRR!

Warriors dead on, hear my call
Swing your fist and make them go
Vengeance will be harsh today
An eastern wolf that make them
YEILD!

There's a wolf (there's a wolf)
In my heart (in my heart)
And it's fighting to survive
I've learnt to live (learnt to live)
In the dark (in the dark)
For I was born
With a wolf (with a wolf)
In my heart (in my heart)
And it's fighting to survive (fighting to survive)
I've learnt to live (learnt to live)
In the dark (in the dark)
For I was born with a wolf in my heart
A wolf in my heart
