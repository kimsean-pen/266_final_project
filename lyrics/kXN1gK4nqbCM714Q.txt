As the seconds turn into days
We will never be the same

I told you once and I won't say it again
You never meant a thing to me, a means to an end
If we can't change the past then why should we care?
I don't give a fuck if you're here or you're there
Your God damn beliefs have made you go blind
Your ego, your fame they have poisoned your mind
so take, take, take all your memories
Cause I dont want 'em I dont need 'em
So stay, stay, stay the hell away from me
The truth is I'm moving on
So take take take all your memories
Cause I dont want 'em and I don't need them
Stay, stay, stay, the hell away from me
So get the fuck out, fuck out
You'll take this to your fucking grave
Fuck off, Fuck off
I thought you'd never make it out alive
You self righteous, sacrilegious, fucking cunt
Your unintelligent, irrelevant ramblings are falling upon deaf ears
How can you be the voice of a generation
When the only voice you listen to is in your own fucking head?
So take, take, take all your memories
Cause I don't want 'em I don't need 'em
So stay, stay, stay the hell away from me
The truth is I'm moving on
So take take take all your memories
Cause I don't want 'em I don't need 'em
Stay stay, stay, the hell away from me
I'm moving on
Hell yeah, so we came here to stay
And none of you can fucking take this away
Fuck yeah, here's what I have to say
Goodbye and so long, it's the start of a new day
As the seconds turn into days
We stand together
We will never be the same
We stand together
As the seconds turn into days
We stand together
We will never be the same
We stand together
So take, take, take all your memories
Cause I don't want 'em I don't need 'em
So stay, stay, stay the hell away from me
The truth is I'm moving on
As the seconds turn into days
We stand together
We will never be the same
We stand together
Hell yeah, so we came here to stay
And none of you can fucking take this away
Fuck yeah, here's what I have to say
Goodbye and so long, it's the start of a new day
