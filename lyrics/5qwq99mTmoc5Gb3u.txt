Can I have some money?
I'm gonna go to the store
Can I have some money?
I can't tell you what it's for
Can I have some money?
You know it's you that I adore
Can I have some money?
Don't ask me what it's for

Since we've been together you've been good to me
You only hit me when you wanna be pleased

Can I have the car keys?
I'm gonna go for a ride
Can I have the car, please?
I'm going out for a while
Can I have the car now?
I wanna drive all around
Can I have the car, dear?
I'm going to leave this town

I won't be asking your permission to leave
I won't be asking not to have this baby please
And I won't be asking don't point some bust at me
And I won't be asking I had to see you bleed

Visualize
That's right
Forever we
One, two, three

Shoot
Shoot
Shoot
Shoot

Can I have my lipstick?
That was such a surprise
Can I have my lipstick?
I'm going out for a ride
I'm not a little girl
And you sure are not my dad
You don't even know what you almost had
