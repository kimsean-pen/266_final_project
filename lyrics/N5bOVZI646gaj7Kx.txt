What is this feeling called love?
What is this crazy thing I can't explain anyhow?
What is this feeling called love?
What is this crazy scene I can't work out anyhow?
Maybe I should try it now
Or maybe I should be shy of it now
'Cause there's nothing you know that can explain it
And there's nothing you know that's worth the pain of it
What is this feeling called love?
What is this thing I can't work out no how?
What is this feeling called love?
What is this thing I don't understand no how?
Gimme love
