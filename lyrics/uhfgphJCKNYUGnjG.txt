Am I afraid of all the things that I can change?
What's to blame when all my weaknesses remain?
We're all the same
Don't let me sink
Before I get to find the words that I've forgotten
Don't let me blink
I want to savour every moment
Tell me if you ever wake up thinking
If you ever wondered how it feels
Knowing it could end and there will come a time
When it's too late to say goodbye
Say goodbye
Can't lay awake
Can't live in fear of what's ahead
So now I'll take every chance until the end
Until the end
Don't let me sink!
Before I get to find the words that I've forgotten!
Don't let me blink!
I want to savour every moment
Tell me if you ever wake up thinking
If you ever wondered how it feels
Knowing it could end and there will come a time
When it's too late to say goodbye
Tell me if you ever wake up thinking
If you ever wondered how it feels
Knowing it could end and there will come a time
When it's too late to say goodbye
Uagh!
So let's just do it!
Let's break it upfront, this might be your last chance!
So do it before it's too late!
Push yourself to the limit!
Drop your doubts, take control of your life!
Don't let me sink
Before I get to find the words that I've forgotten
Don't let me blink
I want to savour every moment
Tell me if you ever wake up thinking
If you ever wondered how it feels
Knowing it could end and there will come a time
When it's too late to say goodbye
Tell me if you ever wake up thinking
If you ever wondered how it feels
Knowing it could end and there will come a time
When it's too late to say goodbye
Tell me if you ever wake up thinking
If you ever wondered how it feels (When it's to late to say goodbye)
Knowing it could end and there will come a time
When it's too late to say goodbye
