You blow up the feed
You blow up the core
A lot of lunge are breathing here
...
You cut off the stream
You shut down the thought
But still the lungs are breathing here
...
Keep it kicking in the chest
We're not heading for a cardiac arrest
Like blood we run as one
...
We're crushing the crown
We dig deeper down
To keep the lungs still breathing here
...
We are the blood
We are the charge
We are the lungs still breathing here
...
Keep it kicking in the chest
We're not heading for a cardiac arrest
Like blood we run as one
...
All we ever want is to be loved
All we ever want is to be loved through unconditional wall
Like blood we run as one
We run as one.
