Get up, stand up
Stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up
Don't give up the fight

Get up, stand up
Stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up
Don't give up the fight

You, preacher man, don't tell me
Heaven is under the earth
You, a duppy and you don't know
What life is really worth

It's not all that glitter is gold
And half the story has never been told
So now we see the light
We gonna stand up for your rights, come on

Get up, stand up
Stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up
Don't give up the fight

Get up, stand up
Stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up
Don't give up the fight

'Cause you know most people think
A great God will come from the skies
Take away everything
And left everybody dry

But if you know what life is worth
Then you would look for yours on earth
And now you see the light
We gonna stand up for your rights

Get up, stand up
Stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up
Don't give up the fight

Get up, stand up
Stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up
Don't give up the fight

We're sick and tired of this game of technology
Humbly asking Jesus for his mercy
We know and we know and understand
Almighty Jah is a living man

You fool some people sometimes
But you can't fool all the people all the time
And now we see the light
We gonna stand up for our rights
