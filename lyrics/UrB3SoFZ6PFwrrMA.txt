Hungry for a meaning, this all seems unclear
I come to the conclusion we're all clueless here
The more I try and simplify I realize it passes by
I find myself enamored with an explanation that doesn't exist, no

Oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh What's the point in counting when it never ends?
Face yourself at night, it's time to make amends
The TV's on, it helps me sleep
The force of habit killing me
The kiss goodnight, a stale routine
The spark is gone, what's wrong with me?

Oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh Language and perspective shape the way we live
Some things are hard to take and even harder to give
Lost circling a moment deep inside my head
I won't get this moment back, I'll move instead

This place just ain't the same without you
Out with the old, in with the new
I think you know this pressure
Welcome to a depression that I'll learn was never true

The more I try and simplify I realize it passes by
I find myself enamored with an answer that does not exist

The more I try and simplify I realize it passes by I find myself enamored with an answer that does not exist

The more I try and simplify I realize it passes by
I find myself enamored with an answer that does not exist
