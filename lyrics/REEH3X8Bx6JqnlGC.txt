I met you first, I heard your voice
On the telephone
And then again this empty street
Where you walked alone
And when you came out of the dark
I was waiting there
But since I could take you now if
You can take me anywhere
Don't be scared

Some people say there's a golden light
You're the golden light
And if I chase after you
Doesn't mean that it's true
Some people say there's a golden light
If I'm the golden light
If you chase after me
Doesn't mean you can see

I've been tryin' to recall
But I can't hear it at all
The things we said that day
And my memory's dark
And might fallow it on
Disturbing things you say like

It's been so long, so long
Since I fell apart
Fell in love

Some people say there's a golden light
You're the golden light
And if I chase after you
Doesn't mean that it's true
Some people say there's a golden light
If I'm the golden light
If you chase after me
Doesn't mean you can see

I follow, I follow you
I follow,
I follow, I follow you
I follow

If you chase after me
Doesn't mean you can see
Some people say there's a golden light
You're the golden light
And if I chase after you
Doesn't mean that it's true
Golden light
You're the golden light
Some people say there's a golden light
You're the golden light
You're the golden light
Some people say there's a golden light
You're the golden light
You're the golden light
And if I chase after you
Doesn't mean that it's true
