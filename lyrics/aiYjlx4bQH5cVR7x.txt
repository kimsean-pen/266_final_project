Ok
Just sixteen, a pick-up truck
Out of money, out of luck
I've got no where to call of my own

Hit the gas, and here I go
I'm running free yeah
C'mon, I'm running free
I'm running free yeah

I'm running free
Spent the night in an L.A. jail
And listened to the sirens wail
They ain't got a thing on me

Running wild, running free, yeah
I'm running free yeah
I'm running free
I'm running free yeah

I'm running free

I'm running free yeah
I'm running free
I'm running free yeah
I'm running free, oh yeah

Pulled here at the Bottle Top

Whiskey, dancing, disco hop
All the boys are after me
That's the way it's gonna be
I'm running free yeah

I'm running free
I'm running free yeah
I'm running free, oh yeah
I'm running free yeah
I'm running free yeah
I'm running free yeah
I'm running free yeah
I'm running free yeah
I'm running free yeah
I'm running free yeah
I'm running free yeah
I'm running free yeah
