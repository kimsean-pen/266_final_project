Game over, game over, you win.
Game over, I win.
Game over, you win.
Game over.

The Sleigh bells are a-ringing, the children they are singing,
The memories are fleeting, a little game of- {Paper, Scissors, Rock!}

Game over, game over, you win.
Game over, I win.
Game over, you win.
Game over.

The wedding Bells are ringing, the shotgun is a-singing,
Now your fingers steady, a little game of- {Paper, Scissors, Rock!}

A lion tamer yelling, your first piano lesson,
A 4--leaf contraceptive, we play a game of- {Paper, Scissors, Rock!}

A sweaty palm reading, a lucky shot of whiskey,
Now come and rub my belly, a little game of- {Paper, Scissors, Rock!}

O's and X's!
Hollywood Squares!
X's and O's!
Bloody Tic-Tac-Toe.

Paper.
Scissors.
Rock.
Paper.
Scissors.
Rock.
Rock.
We will rock you!

Going nowhere!
Hollywood Squares!

Not in your song,
I'm not your singer.
Not in your poem,
I'm not your stanza.
I'm not a color in your rainbow,
But now which team,
Are you rooting for?

We're Hollywood Squares!
We're going nowhere!
Hollywood Squares!

I'm an 'X'
You are an 'O'
You are an 'O'
You are an 'O'

Going nowhere!
Hollywood Squares!
Going nowhere!
Hollywood Squares!

This is the end...
