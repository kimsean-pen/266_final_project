I could have all the money,
All the fancy treasures in the world
25 acres just to hold my diamonds and my pearls

But all of that's a fantasy
Nothing like I wanna be
Baby, you and me, that's real
Something like a masterpiece
Would be up on galleries
You and I, that's real

If I had everything, it wouldn't mean a thing
Cause nothing feels like, nothing feels like you
No matter what they say can't take my love away
Cause nothing feels like, nothing feels like you

Baby even when we're miles apart
You'll always stay inside my heart
Let me tell you no one else will do
'Cause baby nothing feels like you

Boys will be boys
I've got plenty knocking at my door
But none of them compare
Baby, you're the one I'm waiting for

Cause I'm living in a fantasy
Every time you're here with me
Kiss me if it's real
Baby you were meant to keep
You bring out the best in me
Now I know it's real

If I had everything, it wouldn't mean a thing
Cause nothing feels like, nothing feels like you
No matter what they say can't take my love away
Cause nothing feels like, nothing feels like you

Baby even when we're miles apart
You'll always stay inside my heart
Let me tell you no one else will do
'Cause baby nothing feels like you

No, nothing like ya
No, nothing like
No nothing like ya
No nothing like

If I had everything, it wouldn't mean a thing
Cause nothing feels like, nothing feels like you
No matter what they say, can't take my love away
Cause nothing feels like, nothing feels like you

Baby even when we're miles apart
You'll always stay inside my heart
Let me tell you no one else will do
'Cause baby nothing feels like you
No nothing like
(You)
No nothing like
(You)
