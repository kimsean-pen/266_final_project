I know that we're gonna repeat history
Unless we sort this out
I know that we've gotta find something new
Something new

Now my crew is six thousand million strong
But we're not learning from
A history of conflict and violence
For ownership and the power to silence

I know that we've gotta find something new (woah, woah)
I know that we've gotta find something new (woah, woah)

Retracing all our steps we
Sent out the set back search party
To locate the barriers that locks us down
Your phenakistoscope is spinning
Flashbacks to your beginnings
The repetition that you found, you found

Now my crew is six thousand million strong
But we're not learning from
A history of conflict and violence
For ownership and the power to silence

I know that we've gotta find something new (woah, woah)
I know that we've gotta find something new (woah, woah)

I know that we're gonna repeat history
Unless we sort this out
I know that we've gotta find something new
Something new

All hands on deck
We've gotta scrub these fuckers out
All hands on deck

I know that we've gotta find something new (woah, woah)
I know that we've gotta find something new (woah, woah)
I know that we've gotta find something new (woah, woah)
I know that we've gotta find something new (woah, woah)

I know that we're gonna repeat history
Unless we sort this out
I know that we've gotta find something new
Something new
Something new
Something new
Something new
