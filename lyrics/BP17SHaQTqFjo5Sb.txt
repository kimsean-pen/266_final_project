(Big wheels keep turning
They turn forever and ever)

I've been thinkin' it over
So many times they say you've got it made
They never understand the answer lies within your soul
'Cause no one knows which side the coin will fall

Big wheels turnin'
Baby, I know (Or not at all)
Big wheels turnin'
Baby, I know (Or not at all)
Big wheels turnin', turnin'

Save it for a rainy day
For when the cold wind blows, to see how they run
I thought they'd know
I tried my best, all I could do
But somehow, it was not enough for you

Big wheels turnin'
Baby, I know (Or not at all)
Big wheels turnin' (No, no, no)
Baby, I know (No, no, no)
Big wheels turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin'

I remember the dead of night
A lonely light that shines upon the window
I see it all so clear, the tenderness, the silent tears
Out here in the pouring rain
Through cold, dark waiting days I see you standing there
I see the big wheels turnin', never ending, on and on they go

Oh, I think I'm goin' home
I think I'm gonna have to start again
It's rather sad, because I've looked around
Can't seem to find whatever's always rollin' through my mind

Big wheels turnin'
Baby, I know (Through my mind)
Big wheels turnin'
Baby, I know (Oh, it's goin' through my mind)
Big wheels turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin'

I remember the dead of night
A lonely light that shines upon the window
Oh, I see it all so clear, the tenderness, the silent tears
Out here in the pouring rain
Through cold, dark waiting days I see you standing there
Oh, I see the big wheels turnin', never ending, on and on they go

(Big wheels)
