Miss Otis Regrets(She's unable to lunch today)
Madam, Miss Otis Regrets(She's unable to lunch today)
She's sorry to be delayed
But last evening down in lover's lane
she strayed
Madam, Miss Otis Regrets(She's unable to lunch today)
When she woke up and found,
that her dream of love was gone
Madam, she ran to the man who had led her so far astray
And from under her velvet grown, she drew a gun and shot her lover down
Madam, Otis Regrets(She's unable to lunch today)
...
When the mob came and got her and dragged her from the jail
Madam, they strung her upon the old willow across the way
And the moment before she died
She lifted up her lovely head and cried
Madam, Miss Otis Regrets(She's unable to lunch today)
