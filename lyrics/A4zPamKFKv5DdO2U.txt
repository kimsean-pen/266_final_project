Lost inside the system, locked away without a key
No one will ever miss a menace to society
A gross lack of potential, bad decisions made in spite
A touchy hair-pin trigger and such a wasted life

Trying to break the mold of a broken family
Fight against your failure and living on his knees
Guilty of a crime of nonconformity
A hanging judge and jury handing down the penalty

A lethal injection
Now they watch the body jerk
Exterminate the problem
Except it didn't work

No vital sign of life, they declared it wasn't there
Coroner never checked, because he didn't fucking care
Passing off the body, they all believed he died
Starting up the hearse, set out for a final drive

Like whistling passed a graveyard when walking by at night
It's a fatal illusion to think that evil ever dies

In a darkened mortuary, reeking of formaldehyde
Aroused from deadly slumber, something opened up his eyes
Spilling all their blood was a promise that he'd keep
Hate so strong revived him from a deep narcotic sleep

Clawing away the casket lid until his fingers bleed
He grabbed a knife and set out on a vivisection spree
A butcher hell bent, massacring each one with his blade
From the first one to the last, he dispatched them to the grave

It's a fatal illusion!
It's a fatal illusion!
Evil never dies!
It never dies!
