Go!
That's right!
Go, go, go
Number One, step it up
Spit the fire, we're back get up!
Count me in and turn it out
We're killing it, go burn it out
Never change, never break

I'm the real, you're the fake
Set it up, go underground
You feelin' it, this future sound?

Non-stop

Devastating everything
On Top
Never coming down
I've got my hands in everything
Non stop
I'm never coming down
We're just living for today

Keep our light on in the haze
Yeah forever we will stay

We are the ones still swinging
We are a beacon in the dark
A lighthouse risen from the heart
We've been here from the start
We are the ones still swinging

I'm dangerous, passionate
Watch your back
They're stabbing it

Hold on and hold tight
I slash your faces every night
We don't belong
Never will, never care

We always kill
Suit me up
And I will attack
Cause PRoach is the new black
Non-stop
Devastating everything
On Top

Never coming down
I've got my hands in everything
Non stop
I'm never coming down

We're just living for today

Keep our light on in the haze
Yeah forever we will stay
We are the ones still swinging
We are a beacon in the dark

A lighthouse risen from the heart
We've been here from the start
We are the ones still swinging
We're the ones still swinging (ones still swinging)
We're the ones still swinging (ones still swinging)
We're the ones still swinging (ones still swinging)
We're the ones still swinging (ones still swinging)
We're the ones still swinging (ones still swinging)
Non-stop
Devastating everything
On Top
I'm never coming down
I've got my hands in everything
Non stop
I'm never coming down
We're just living for today
Keep our light on in the haze
Yeah forever we will stay
We are the ones still swinging
We are a beacon in the dark
A lighthouse risen from the heart
We've been here from the start
We are the ones still swinging
