Lulu's doing haircuts but I don't think she can see
David's found a song to match the pace of his heartbeat
Why do I do this? Why do I do this at all?
Edward's on the big white telephone to God
Charlie coming on to every person he can touch
Why do this happens every time I dream in Technicolor and live in black and white?

This is not a party it's a hurricane
This is not a party it's a hurricane
And no one really cares so let's pretend we're all okay

Roxie made the call although her bf wants to go
James rolled on the floor and I've lost all self control
Why must this happen?
Why must this be?
I dream of space and time and wake up in 2D

This is not a party it's a hurricane
This is not a party it's a hurricane
And no one really cares so let's pretend we're doing great
This is not a party it's a hurricane

And you're complicated
You're complicated
You're complicated
Why so complicated
Well go sleep don't worry about me
I'm just fishing for the moon and artificial sea

This is not a party it's a hurricane
This is not a party it's a hurricane
And I don't really care and I'm never gonna change
You said we'd never work you said we weren't the same
But I don't really care and I never want to change
This is not a party it's a hurricane
