I know that you've come
To end my shame
And dig up my empty scars
Just to cut them again
Have you ever been sown shut?

I'll lay my hands down
To comfort your empty soul
It never forgets
It lies in your skin beneath your back bone

I tried to hide
I don't want to be afraid
Of letting go, of someone like you
Another life another story
How will I know?

This time I can't speak
I'll scratch on my itchy wounds
It never forgives
A bed of your broken nails to lay on

I tried to hide
I don't want to be afraid
Of letting go, of someone like you
Another life another story
How will I know?

How will I know?

I don't want to be afraid
Of someone like you
I don't want to be afraid of letting go
I don't want to be afraid Of someone like you
I don't want to be afraid of letting go
