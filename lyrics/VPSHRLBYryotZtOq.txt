Tuesday morning now
I gotta have somewhere to go
I call up Tommy now
I call him on the telephone
Won't you wake up and come with me now?
I'm going to the pawn and loan
I'm walkin' down thirty-three
I'm walkin' down thirty-o

What am I supposed to think?
I drop a nickel in a sink
I love people like a brother now
But I'm not gonna be their mother now
What if someone walked up to me and
Like an apple cut right through me?
I'm not just gonna stand there grinnin'
'Cause I'm not the one who's sinnin'
Screwdriver

Ooo-hoo, ooo-hoo

Now that you have heard my story now
I've got a little ending to it now
Whenever you go out alone
Take a little dog a bone
And think about your little sister
And then you got to drive it home
Screwdriver

I got a little feeling goin' now
I got a little feeling goin' now
I got a little feeling goin' now
I got a little feeling goin' now
I got a little feeling goin' now
I got a little feeling goin' now
I got a little feeling goin' now
I got a little feeling goin' now
I got a little feeling goin' now
I got a little feeling goin' now
I got a little feeling goin' now
Now, now, now
