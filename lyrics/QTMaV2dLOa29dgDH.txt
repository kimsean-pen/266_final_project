Stops for a blink
Letting the mask fall to ground
And what close to be
Looking this way
Offers us answers
Facing ourselves

When looking at you
Your court staring back
You're glowing of truth
Reminding each other
The lack of themselves
Is nobodies loss

Please let us hide
I'm missing my pride and you
Call for the notion
This show is over
But the big one goes on
Next time my back will be covered
And you
Will stay astray

The winding of me
Is far from success
Instructions for fall
As you lose your hook
And I spit it out
It still leaves a mark

Just a reminder
So many reserved
Am I still in the game
Here look this way
See my charisma
Remember my name
I'm asking me about myself
And I'm fine
So if there's no hesitation
Will you lead me to the edge
You stay astray
When I see your way
You sway
