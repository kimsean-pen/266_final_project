Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Sheets are in a knot
The heart is like rock, hey
Pictures flashing by inside my head
I'm hanging by a thread
But I'd do it all again

I keep running away running away running away from you
But I can't stand breaking the chains
Breaking the chains breaking the chains
Oh cause I know the second you go
Bring it on back bring it on back bring it on back to me

And you know I want your chokehold
Wantcha to bring it on back bring it on back bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me

All without your touch i suffocate
I could asphyxiate
But I kinda like the pain, yeah
Baby I can smell you on my clothes
I try to stay composed
But I feel the fever grow whoa-o oh!

I keep running away running away running away from you
But I can't stand breaking the chains
Breaking the chains breaking the chains
Oh cause I know the second you go
Wantcha to bring it on back bring it on back bring it on back to me

And you know I want your chokehold
Wantcha to bring it on back bring it on back bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me

Oh oh oh
Hey hey
Oh oh I want your chokehold
Oh oh hey hey
Now I'm bring you baby back to me

Cause I know the second you go
And you know I want your chokehold
Gotta bring it on back bring it on back bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
Oh oh you gotta bring it right back
