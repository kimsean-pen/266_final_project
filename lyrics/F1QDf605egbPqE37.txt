Seven days underpaid gotta give it up
Got no time for this life that I'm livin' up
Shackled down, kicked around,
Now slave to the grind

Need some time for myself
I'll give you anything
That you want me to
But I don't have the time
So I'll get up with you
If you don't understand

Then you've got to believe

There's too much of you
But there's not enough of me
There's not enough of me
Same old song
World moves on while I'm still in bed

Meet tomorrow today just to get ahead
Jump the gun on the run
I'm the only one
Who thinks I'm fallin' behind?
I'll give you anything
That you want me to
But I don't have the time
So I'll get up with you
If you don't understand
Man you've got to believe
There is too much of you
But there's not enough of me
There's not enough of me

I'll give you anything
That you want me to
But I don't have the time
So I'll get up with you
If you don't understand
Man you've got to believe
There's too much of you
There's too much of me
I'll give you anything
That you want me to
But I don't have the time
So I'll get up with you
If you don't understand
Man you've got to believe
There's too much of you
But there's not enough of me
There's not enough of me
