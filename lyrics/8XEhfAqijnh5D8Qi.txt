I'm sitting on the roof of my house
With a shotgun and a six pack of beer
The newscaster says the enemy is among us
As bombs explode on the 30 bus
Kill your middle class indecision
Now is not the time
For liberal thought

So I go hunting for witches
I go hunting for witches
Head's are going to roll
I go hunting for...

1990's, optimistic as a teen
But now it's terror, airplanes crash into towers
The Daily Mail says the enemy is among us
Taking our women and taking our jobs
All reasonable thought is being drowned out
By the non-stop baying, baying, baying for blood

So I go hunting for witches
I go hunting for witches
Head's are going to roll
I go hunting for...

I was an ordinary man with ordinary desire
I watched TV, it informed me
I was an ordinary man with ordinary desire
There must be accountability
Disparate and misinformed
Fear will keep us all in place
