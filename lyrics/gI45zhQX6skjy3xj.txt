I kept waiting on a reason
In a call that never came
No I never saw it coming
Somethin' in you must have changed

All the words unspoken
Promises broken
I cried for so long
Wasted too much time
Should've seen the signs
Now I know just what went wrong

I guess I wanted you more
And looking back now I'm sure
I wanted you more
I guess I wanted you more

All the nights we spent just talking
Of the things we wanted out of life
(out of life)
Making plans and dreams together
I wish I'd seen I was just too blind

My heart was open
Exposed and hoping for you
To lay it on the line
But in the end it seemed
There was no room for me
Still I tried to change your mind

I guess I wanted you more
And looking back now I'm sure
I wanted you more
I guess I wanted you more

Oh... I don't need you
I don't need you anymore

I guess I wanted you more
And looking back now I'm sure
I wanted you more
I guess I wanted you more

I don't need you
I don't need you anymore
