My heart was full of pebbles
I threw them all at you
Just like we used to do when
We were in primary school
I guess that not much changes
I still write your last name with hearts

We grew up there together
You used to smoke a lot
I used to love the smell of
Your favorite cigarettes
I knew that shit would kill me
I just want you to tell me

'Cause now the monster wheels on her bus
They're gonna hit us, baby
We need to rush and get off of this highway
I know you're into patient
But we haven't got the extra time
And now the way I feel with the cars
We're running out of danger
We need to rush, you shouldn't need a reason
I know you're into waiting
But we haven't got the extra time

So tell me, are you hers or are you mine?
Tell me, are you hers or are you mine?
Tell me, are you hers or are you mine?
Are you mine?

I know it's complicated
I know that there's a choice
You always were my favorite
Out of all the boys
I guess that doesn't matter
I bet she lets you have it hard

'Cause now the monster wheels on her bus
They're gonna hit us, baby
We need to rush and get off of this highway
I know you're into patient
But we haven't got the extra time
And now the way I feel with the cars
We're running out of danger
We need to rush, you shouldn't need a reason
I know you're into waiting
But we haven't got the extra time

Just tell me, are you hers or are you mine?
Tell me, are you hers or are you mine?
Tell me, are you hers or are you mine?
Are you mine?
