OH!
Consumed,
I feel the rage growing inside me,
A fear i cannot contain,
At war with an enemy
That does not rest who will never relent.
This city, these lifeless catacombs,
Our tombs they have become.
Buried alive at birth
Never to return.
To return
Chained to the masses,
Trapped and trained by vicious minds,
I let them tear away everything inside,
Strip away my humanity,
Fracture my identity,
Sacrifice my integrity,
Just bodies through the teeth of the combine,
Just bodies through the teeth of the combine, yeah!
At war with an enemy that does not rest who will never relent,
At war with an enemy that those not rest who'll never...
Sleepwalk our lives away,
In search for shallow graves,
Sleepwalk our lives away.
Lost souls,
Lost!
(Just bodies through the teeth of the combine)
Just bodies through the teeth.
Consumed,
I feel the rage growing inside me,
I will not contain.
I have come to question every truth i know.
Not one more step
In the name of progress,
In the name of blind ambition,
Not one more step
In the name of progress
In the name of blinded vision.
How the fuck am i supposed to feel when everything i know
Lies broken at my feet.
