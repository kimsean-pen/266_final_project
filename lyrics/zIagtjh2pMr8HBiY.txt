Shelia,
Shelia,
You'll be my wife and share my life,
You'll be my wife, you'll share my life.
We will grow old,
We will grow old.
And when we die we'll bury ourselves,
And when we die we'll bury ourselves.
'Cause no one wants to die alone
'Cause no one wants to die alone
'Cause no one wants to die alone
'Cause no one wants to die alone
'Cause no one wants to die alone

Shelia
Shelia
We'll die alone together,
Die alone together,
Die alone together,
Die alone together.
