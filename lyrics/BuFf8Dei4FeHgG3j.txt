I'm incurable but durable it's easy to see
Lack of restraint is a complaint of those around me
I know that others postpone
Gratification well I lack that affectation
Let's get it right, there's no end in sight and I
Can't stop, can't stop it, can't stop
Can't stop it's shocking, but I just can't stop it!
Uncontrollable, I'm inconsolable
May pleasure center is the shelter for a reptile
I hate when I gotta tolerate
Frustration, see I lack the motivation
Let's set this straight, I never wait and I
Can't stop, can't stop it, can't stop
Can't stop shocking, but I just can't stop it!
