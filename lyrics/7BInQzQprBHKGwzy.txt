One step ahead of you
Stay in motion, keep an open mind
Love is a race won by two
Your emotion, my solitude
If I stop, I could lose my head
So I'm losing you instead
Either way I'm confused
You slow me down, what can I do?
There's one particular way I have to choose

One step ahead of you
Always someone makes it hard to move
She says, "Boy I want you to stay"
But I save it all for another day
If I stop, I could lose my head
But I'm ready for romance
Either way I'm confused
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
I can only stay one step ahead of you

Da
Da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, dum
Da
Da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, dum

Stop, I confess sometimes
I don't know where I'm going
Part of me stays with you
I'm slowing down, what can I do
It's hard to stay one step ahead of you, uh-huh

One step ahead of you
Time is running out, catching up with you
One step ahead of you
When I hold you close, can I really lose?
One step ahead
Only one step ahead
She's one step ahead of you
