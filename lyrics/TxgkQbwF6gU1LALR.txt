Baby
They kept telling me that love was blind
How was I supposed to see the signs?
You were standing right before my eyes
And I didn't realise
It's crazy
I have never felt like this before
Lock you up inside forevermore
Don't you know you're guilty of a crime
Now you must do the time

I hear
I hear sirens in the dark
It's too late
Right here
Shot me through the heart
Can't escape (can't escape)
I hear
I hear sirens in the dark

It's too late

Right here

Shot me through the heart

Can't escape

Save me
I've been trapped inside the dungeons of your mind
Searching for an exit I can't find

If only you had seen it in my eyes
I didn't realise
Why don't you take me

It's the only way to bring me back ashore
I told you I can't take it anymore

Don't you know you're guily of a crime
Now you must do the time

I hear
I hear sirens in the dark

It's too late
Right here
Shot me through the heart
Can't escape (can't escape)

I hear
I hear sirens in the dark
It's too late

Right here
Shot me through the heart
Can't escape

I've been arrested but I know my rights
I won't protest it, I won't fight
Anything you see will be held against me
While I pray
Never set me free
I stand corrected, I've been up all night
We were connected, you were right
And everything you said I've had held against me
While I pray
Never set me free
(can't escape) And it's alright
(can't escape) Oh no I won't fight
(can't escape) You kept me up all night
(can't escape) And I know my rights
(can't escape)
