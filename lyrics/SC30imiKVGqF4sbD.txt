If my house flowed down in the river
If all of these walls tumble down in the storm
If this war took all of my money
All of my pride but I'd never be poor, ooh

As long as we got each other
There's nothing in the world that can steal my joy
Yeah, as long as we got each other
We can overcome the madness of the world, yeah

'Cause people don't make the world go round like they used to
But I know if I got one thing, baby I know I got you
Yeah, you keep me sheltered from the 6 o'clock blues
And if I know one things going to be alright
Then I know that it's me and you, oh, oh

So they say we're running out of time
Running out of water, running out of light
We all got so many problems and just not enough answers
And if we keep on asking they gon' tell us what we like

Oh, but as long as we got each other
Oh, there's nothing in the world that can steal my joy
As long as we got each other
We can overcome the madness of the world

Oh, they can sell me a story and tell me we're in danger
But our love will never die

'Cause people don't make the world go round like they used to
But I know if I got one thing, baby I know I got you
You keep me sheltered from the 6 o'clock blues
Yeah, you keep me sheltered from the 6 o'clock

Yeah, you keep me sheltered, sheltered, sheltered, sheltered
Baby, promise if I know one thing it's going to be alright
I know that I got my baby

Like the birds that live in the sky
We never have to worry 'cause somehow we'll get by
Let's come together, we can make it alright
[Incomprehensible] just like you and I

Oh, people don't make the world go round like they used to
But I know if I got one thing, baby I know I got you
You keep me sheltered from the 6 o'clock blues
Yeah, and if I know one thing it's going to be alright
Then I know that it's me and my beautiful baby
