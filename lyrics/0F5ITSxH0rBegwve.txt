It's over, it's over, it's over

Summer came and passed away
Hardly seemed to last a day, but it's over
And what can I do?
Music playin' in the air
Silence on a darkened stair 'cause it's over
And what can I do?

It's over, it's over, all over, it's all over now
And the way you looked don't even mean I'm down (It's over)
When you kick out the sea and the sun says goodbye
There is nothing much to speak of
Feelin' down, down (It's all over)
Feelin' down, down, down

Hey, baby, it's all over
Rolled out to sea

Lookin' over sunny days (Searchin', searchin')
Searchin' for the righteous wave 'cause it's over
(All gone, what can I do?)
Lookin' from this distant shore (Distant shore)
You ain't sailin' by no more 'cause it's over (It is over)
And what can I do?

It's over, it's over, all over, it's all over now
And the way you looked don't even mean I'm down
It's over, over (It's over)
When you kick out the sea and the sun says goodbye
There is nothing much to speak of
Feelin' down, down (It's over)
Feelin' down, down, down

Ah, it's over, it's over, it's over,
It's all over
And what can I do?
Ah, it's over, it's over, it's all over

Oh, it's over, it's over
Don't shed a tear for me, it's over
Don't shed a tear although it's over
