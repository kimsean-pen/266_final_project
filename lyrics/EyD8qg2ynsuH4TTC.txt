Are you feeling all right?
It's easy, we've been there before
But it feels like the flight
of the Von Trapps, does that mean it's war?
Oh no! From my head to my toes
I'm in love with you
Do you think it shows?

We're meant to be friends
That's what it says in the script
Is it really the end
if sometimes I stray just a bit?
Oh no! It should be poetry not prose
I'm in love with you
Do you think it shows?

And everyone knows when they look at us
Of course they do, it must be obvious
I've never told you now I suppose
that you're the only one who doesn't know

You were different when
we met in an ordinary way
I didn't intend to interrupt
your own shadow play
Oh no! I won't upset the status quo
I'm in love with you
Do you think it shows?

And everyone knows when they look at us
Of course they do, it must be obvious
You've never asked me and I'm surprised
'cause you're the only one who hasn't tried

Everyone knows when they look at us
Of course they do, it must be obvious
I've never asked you now I suppose
that you're the only one who doesn't know

Oh, when they look at us
It must be obvious
