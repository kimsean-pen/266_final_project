I want to lay my head down
Come close, come closer
What's that uncomfortable sound
Of your key in the door
I hear you walking out
Walking out again
Why didn't you stay a while
To say goodbye, my friend

I want to lay my head down
Come closer, come closer
I thought you'd turn me
But you were turning around
I think I'm losing you
Losing you again
Why didn't you stay a while
To say goodbye, my friend
My friend

Winter shadow cools you
White before your eyes
Summer shadow soothes
Nothing on your mind
Winter shadow cools you
White before your eyes
Summer shadow suits you
Tonight

I want to lay my head down
Come closer, come closer
Trying not to remember
Our most precious of times
Remember winters cold
And summers by my side
Please tell me I do leave
A void of any kind

Say goobye now

Winter shadow cools you
White before your eyes
Summer shadow soothes
Nothing on your mind
Winter shadow cools you
White before your eyes
Summer shadow suits you
Tonight

Winter shadow cools you
White before your eyes
Summer shadow soothes
Nothing on your mind
Winter shadow cools you
White before your eyes
Summer shadow suits you
Tonight
