Bop-Bop Bop-Bop Bop-Bop Yeah
Bop-Bop Bop-Bop Bop-Bop Yeah

You forgot when we were strange
Yeah somewhere we got caught
Now every little bird is tame
Their wings are clipped and gulled
Fear puts your heart on ice
For some other rainy day
You only know that your alive
When I melt the ice away

My life, my dreams my everything
Are all yourrrrrrs, baby
I'm willing to complete this act of faith
'cause living only happens when you wait

If you go
If you stay
Sometimes better breaking, baby
In the sun
Before its gone

If you love

If you feel
If you wonder
how this heaven could be real
Then let it burn

Some might say ain't no sun
without the rain, like I know
I knew . Yeah (breathy)
Some might say, nothing given, nothing gained
Yes that's true . how about you baby

My life, my dreams my everything
Are all yourrrrrrs, baby
I'm willing to complete this act of faith
'cause living only happens when you wait

(Chorus)

(Intro)

'Cause I'd like, like
To be somebody who
You take a chance on
I would take a chance on you
Everyday
Like, like to be somebody
who you take a chance on
I would take a chance on you
Everyday

I got myself a son
I take my love and run
I got you babe

Oh, yeah
'Cause I need somebody's love
And half is not enough
To make me stay
I've got you babe

(Chorus)

If you go, if you stay
