I Motivate to forget so I can endure your world
Keep telling myself it's ok cause you say you find me pretty enough

You stripped away something I'll never get back someday
I'm stuck in doubt looking for the door that leads me out

But I'm reduced to a Little child, scared to run away
I'm reduced to a Little child who you've stripped away
Something I'll never get back someday

You hit and rage as I bleed and still you know
I'm made to feel obscene left vulnerable from a past
You've heard but never seen
You're so scared that I'll

Refuse to lay down tonight and tolerate your world
Stand up for my self and fight
On your knees you'll find me pretty enough
I finally see the light tonight and have been pathetic enough
You will feel a turn in tides tonight and all from this little child

All from a little Child who's finally turned away
All from a little child who finally turned away
Drift away
Somewhere and never come back someday
