You wonder why I never come right out, and I'm always on my own
It's not the words, its not the way you talk, it's what you do, when we're alone

Waiting in the back, taking your time
Trying this girl, messing with her mind
When you, could be mine
I'm not in the mood to take a chance
I'm gonna hold back, gonna relax
Until I know you're mine

So push me to the limit
I know you wanna push me to the limit
I know you wanna see how far I'll go
Baby, do you really wanna know?

When you call me up don't act surprised when I say, I'm not alone
Forgive me now, but you took too long, so now I'm out, you're on your own

Waiting in the back, taking your time
Trying this girl, messing with her mind
When you, could be mine
I'm not in the mood to take a chance
I'm gonna hold back, gonna relax
Until I know you're mine

So push me to the limit
I know you wanna push me to the limit
I know you wanna see how far I'll go
Baby, do you really wanna know?

What's the limit of this love?
What's the reason I can't get enough?
You're holding back just to make me stay
I'm on the move and I can't wait
Can't wait
Can't wait
Can't wait
Oh, can't wait
Can't wait
Can't wait
Can't wait

Gonna give you all my loving
Gonna give you all my love
Gonna give you all my loving
Gonna give you all my love
(Is that the limit)

Push me to the limit
I know you wanna push me to the limit
I know you wanna see how far I'll go
Baby, do you really wanna know?
Push me to the limit
I know you wanna push me to the limit
I know you wanna see how far I'll go
Baby, do you really wanna know?
