I'm running out of patience,
but then you say, it's over baby,
so go on, we both need you to say this to us,
you are, the only one for me.

Every night you stay with her.
I pretend it doesn't hurt
cause the hardest part of this is wondering when all this is.
It's like it's getting worse
she'll always have had you first.
You know the hardest part of this is wanting the two of us to begin.

Every single night I wait for you,
every single day you say it's through,
you promised me the night at 2 am that it's happening.
You're gonna tell her what she needs to hear.
You gotta be the one to make it clear
you promised me that night at 2 am that it's happening.
That it's happening
That it's happening
That it's happening

I'm so anxious that I'm shaken,
we're so close to being together,
boy I, have almost giving up on this before,
but it's worth it, if it is forever.

Every night you stay with her.
I pretend it doesn't hurt
cause the hardest part of this is wondering when all this is.
It's like it's getting worse; she'll always have had you first.
You know the hardest part of this is wanting the two of us to begin.

Every single night I wait for you,
every single day you say it's through,
you promised me the night at 2 am that it's happening.
You're gonna tell her what she needs to hear.
You gotta be the one to make it clear
you promised me that night at 2 am that it's happening.
That it's happening
That it's happening
That it's happening

Like winter turns to summer,
like night turns into day,
been missing you like the dessert needs the rain,
the hardest part of this is wanting, the two of us to begin.

Every single night I wait for you,
every single day you say it's through,
you promised me the night at 2 am that it's happening.
You're gonna tell her what she needs to hear.
You gotta be the one to make it clear
you promised me that night at 2 am that it's happening.
That it's happening
That it's happening
That it's happening

You gonna make it happen baby.
