I've been a bad woman, but I'm still your woman
I'm just a bad woman, I know
I understand if you leave, I understand if you leave me
I'll understand if you leave me, just go

Just don't go before I show you
What's behind all of my sorrow
What's inside all of the bullets I throw, oh-ohh
Don't go before I get to say I'm sorry I caused you sorrow
Tonight I really want you to know

I'm a bad woman
But I'm still your woman
I'm a bad woman, but I'm still your woman
I'm just a bad woman, I know

It's a sad story, but it's still our story
Such a sad story, I know
You can say you don't love me, but don't walk away from me
We need each other more than we know

Just don't go before I show you
What's behind all of my sorrow
What's inside all of the bullets I throw, oh-ohh
Don't go before I get to say I'm sorry I caused you sorrow
Tonight I really want you to know

I'm a bad woman
But I'm still your woman
I'm a bad woman, but I'm still your woman
I'm just a bad woman, I know

You used to love, you used to love
Even the bad, the crazy
Don't walk away, don't give me up
Don't you know

I'm a bad woman
(I know I hurt you)
But I'm still your woman
(I'll try to change)
But I'm a bad woman
(I know I hurt you)
But I'm still your woman
(I'll try to change)
But I'm a bad woman, but I'm still your woman
I'm just a bad woman, I know
I'm a bad woman
