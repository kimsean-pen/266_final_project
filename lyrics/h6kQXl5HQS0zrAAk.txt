The freakiest show I know is the show of my own
Living my life in and out the twilight zone

Bust my britches
Bless my soul
I'm a freak of nature
Walking totem pole
Look and see I think you'll agree
Nobody weird like me

Intercourse with a porpoise is a dream for me
Hell bent on inventing a new species

Bust my britches
Bless my soul
I'm a freak of nature
Walking totem pole
Look and see I think you'll agree
Nobody weird like me

Riding down the path on the back of a giraffe
Me and the giraffe laughed cause I passed some gas

Bust my britches
Bless my soul
I'm a freak of nature
Walking totem pole
Look and see I think you'll agree
Nobody weird like me

Enchanted as a rabbit
That my life is a dream
Well everything is never
Just as it seems

The freakiest show I know is the show of my own
Living my life in and out the twilight zone

Hey, yeah, you find free!
