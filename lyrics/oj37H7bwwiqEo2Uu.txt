Don't let it get to you, you said
Well, I did
Take a rectangle, untangle your head
Intrepid

Would you bet your life on me, darling, if I did?
Well, the way I spent my winter
I wonder, how could we commit?

When the long road noise is loud and you can't hear the song go
I'm out here with no real belief and no hand for me to hold
Up in the early morning for no reason again
Relistening to your message and I held it in my head

Through broke signal like what type of world we wanna live in?
Do we curl inwards or live long together in forgiveness?
You said: Do we bend our lives to it, darling?
Then we did

If we learn to love ourselves better, maybe
We could commit?
