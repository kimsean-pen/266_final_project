You woke up to hate your life again
Feeling it's all been said and seen today
Woke up to fake your smile again
You're not the one; you're not the one

You feel bittersweet when others win
You'd rather see them fall than gain a thing
You know you're too afraid to fail
You're not the one; you're not the one

Slowly, slowly, more away' cause'

Maybe the diamonds are not for everyone
Maybe the lie you live is really all they want
You stay silent watching all dreams around you fading
Slowly, slowly, slowly more away

I can't believe a thing you say
Can you' The words don't come out easily
I can't believe it's all right to cry for what you never lost now
You're not the one

Slowly, slowly, more away cause

Maybe the diamonds are not for everyone
Maybe the lie you live is really all they want
You stay silent watching all dreams around you fading
Slowly, slowly, more away from you,
from you

Slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly more away

Maybe the diamonds are not for everyone
Maybe the lie you live is all they really want
You stay silent watching all dreams around you fading
Slowly, slowly, slowly more away

Maybe the diamonds are not for everyone
Maybe the lie you live is really all they want
You stay silent watching all dreams around you fading
Slowly, slowly more away from you
