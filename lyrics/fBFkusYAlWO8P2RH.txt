Folks, I'm goin' down to St. James Infirmary
See my baby there;
She's stretched out on a long, white table
So sweet, so cold, so fair

Let it go, let it go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She can search this whole wide world over
But she'll never find another sweet man like me

When I die, bury me in my straight-leg britches
Put on a box-back coat and a Stetson hat
Put a twenty-dollar gold piece on my watch chain
So you can let all the boys know I died standing pat

An' give me six crap shooting pall bearers
Let a chorus girl sing me a song
Put a red hot jazz band at the top of my head
So we can raise Hallelujah as we go along

Folks, now that you have heard my story
Say, boy, hand me another shot of that booze;
If anyone should ask you
You just tell 'em I've got those St. James Infirmary blues
