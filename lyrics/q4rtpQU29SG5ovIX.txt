Shake my tree, where's the apple for me?
Tickle my feet with the enemy
No point laughing if you don't know why
I fold my love just to hear her smile

The world is up if you're tough enough
The world is up if you're tough enough

Girl in the queue got an eye on you
Think you're in and she's looking for sin
Yes, you're not wrong, she wants to know what's in your pocket
Singing that song, dig it all night long

The world is up if you're tough enough
The world is up if you're tough enough
The world is up if you're tough enough
The world is... if you're tough enough
Come on, show what you love now
Come on, show what you love now
Come on, show what you love now
Come on, show what you love now

Shake my tree, where's the apple for me?
Tickle my feet with the enemy
No point laughing if you don't know why
I fold my love just to hear her smile

The world is up if you're tough enough
The world is up if you're tough enough
The world is up if you're tough enough
The world is... if you're tough enough
The world is up if you're tough enough
The world is up if you're tough enough
The world is up if you're tough enough
The world is... if you're tough enough
Come on, show what you love now
Come on, show what you love now
Come on, show what you love now
Come on, show what you love now
