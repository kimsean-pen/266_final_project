The dark night, ooh ooh
It caught me, ooh ooh
Reading my palm, this thing that I will know
Beating in my test, the fool that you will know

In my hand
In my hand
In my hand
The fool that you will know

These wings I spread ooh ooh
It lead my face towards ooh
What isn't for the search that I respect
Amongst the village where the war is ever left

In my hand
In my hand
In my hand
The fool that you will know
