Time is leaving me forever
I just leave my past
Sorrow took me on a journey
So I'm stepping out
I can't stand this dirty horror
I felt frightened too long
Nothing can stop me from escaping
Into this giant hole

So watch me now I'm diving under
Cos the tide is high
Watch me now
This stream taking me by
I really can't say what I really won't do
If I can't have you
So watch me now I'm diving under

Cos I couldn't fly

I get up now
Get my hope back
Won't back down again
No more sorrow
No more crying
I'm taking back my high
Oh I can't stand this dirty horror
I felt frightened too long

Nothing can stop me from escaping
Into this giant hole

So watch me now I'm diving under
Cos the tide is high
Watch me now
This stream taking me by
Oh I really can't say what I really won't do

If I can't have you
So watch me now I'm diving under
Cos I couldn't fly

Watch me now I'm diving under
Cos the tide is high
Watch me now
This stream taking me by
Oh I really can't say what I really won't do
If I can't have you
Watch me now I'm diving under
Cos I couldn't fly
Oh cos I couldn't fly
Oh cos I couldn't fly
