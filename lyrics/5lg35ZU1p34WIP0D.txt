Jerry was a race car driver
He drove so goddamn fast
He never did win no checkered flags
But he never did come in last
Jerry was a race car driver
He'd say "El Sob number one"
With a Bocephus sticker on his 442
He'd light 'em up just for fun

Ahhhh
Ahhhh

Captain Pierce was a fireman
Richmond engine number three
I'll be a wealthy man when I get a dime
For all the things that man taught to me
Now, Captain Pierce was a strong man
Strong as any man alive
It stuck in his craw
That they made him retire at the age of sixty-five

Ahhhh
Ahhhh

Go!

Hee hee hee! Dog will hunt!

Ahhhh
Ahhhh
Jerry was a race car driver
Twenty-two years old
One too many cold beers one night
Wrapped himself around a telephone pole, go!
