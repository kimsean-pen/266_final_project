The lady is dying
She bends back like a wave
As her spirit is climbing
Through the hospital wall and away
Then I wanted to hold you
As you made your escape
But now I should have told you
When your eyes were alive and away
Always in life we all must make this bloodstain
And so I go it alone
And the pressure is great
I hold onto my own
Oh please oh don't go away
And I wanted to know you
Before you started to fade
But I gave everything to
A lie and a farce and a fake
Always in life we all must make this bloodstain
And so I go it alone
And the pressure is great
I hold onto my own
Oh please oh don't go away
I'd like to see you when all of these angry days blow away
