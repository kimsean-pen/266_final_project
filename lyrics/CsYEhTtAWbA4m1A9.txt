High
Higher than the sun
You shoot me from a gun
I need you to elevate me here
At corner of your lips
As the orbit of your hips
Eclipse
You elevate my soul

I've got no self control
Been living like a mole now
Going down
Excavation
I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly
So high

Elevation

A star
Lit up like a cigar
Strung out like a guitar
Maybe you can educate my mind

Explain all these controls
Can't sing but I've got soul
The goal
Is elevation
A mole
Digging in a hole
Digging up my soul now

Going down
Excavation
I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly
So high

Elevation

Love
Lift me up out of these blues
Won't you tell me something true?
I believe in you

A mole
Digging in a hole
Digging up my soul now
Going down
Excavation
Higher now
In the sky
You make me feel like I can fly
So high
Elevation

Elevation
Elevation
Elevatio
Elevation
