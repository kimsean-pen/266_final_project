in my garden
Black, black roses in my garden

To keep and care it you got to water it
To keep and care it you got to water it
I've been travelin' all over this world
I've never seen no other black rose in no other garden
So you see my garden is so special

Black, black roses in my garden
Black, black roses in my garden
Black, black roses in my garden
Black, black roses in my garden

To keep and care it you got to water it
Got to keep the earth so cool
'Cause something special in my garden

Black, black roses in my garden
Black, black roses in my garden
Black, black roses in my garden
Black, black roses in my garden

Sure you got to water it, water it
You got to do the best you can do
'Cause no other garden is so special like this
Black roses is in my garden

Black, black roses in my garden
Black, black roses in my garden
Black roses, I've got to water it

Something special, special in my garden
Black, black roses in my garden
Sure, sure, I've got to stay
And take good care of the roses
Go to see, go to see that's so special to me
My garden, my garden is so special
Black, black roses blooming in my garden
