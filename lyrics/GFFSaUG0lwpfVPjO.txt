They split my world into pieces, I ain't heard from my nieces
I've been feelin' defeated, like I'm the worst in the boyband
I ain't sleep in some weekends, tryna headline both weekends
Leave my niggas, y'all sheepin', I keep the world in my hands
I know accounts should be deleted
I know some niggas should stop hittin' my phone
Whenever they needin' money or favors done
'Cause I'm still worried 'bout when Ashlan finna put the razor down
So I don't really give a fuck about a story they done spun
And I ain't done (No, no), yeah (Tell something)
And I ain't done, you heard me? I ain't done
(Yeah, I'm screaming, ohh, oh-ohh, oh-oh)
I really miss the old days before the cosigns
I really miss them cold days before the road signs
I really miss when I ain't know which way I was supposed to head
And I was pressed because my shawty gave me cold signs
I was writin' poems 'bout her, dawg, in study hall
And she was mad 'cause I never wanna show her off (Scared)
And every time she took her bra off my dick would get soft
I thought I had a problem, kept my head inside a pillow, screamin'

I don't wanna waste no more time
I'm ready to go
I live my life on standby
I can leave you alone

'Cause we're born with a dollar sign attached to our temple
Life is a dish served cold most times
And all my life, I've taken handfuls
Force-fed by the hand that feeds us
But not all hands created equal
I stand by, waiting for something good to come
In due time, the skies will split for the sun to smile

My mother called me today
She said she thought she felt my energy a country away
I apologized for not callin' enough due to weight
But couldn't tell you if I kept it in my head to decay
I asked her, "Why this world love echoin' hate?"
She said, "Don't let those who don't know you start dictatin' your fate"
I think the hardest part of love could be rebuildin' the breaks
Conditioned to omit them until our foundation will shake, it's no debate
The road to peace is filled with snakes, you gotta keep your cool
And recognize the wolves that wanna try and leave you wool
Don't let 'em treat you like a window, you know you're a jewel
The world is cruel and not as simple as they teach in schools
Sometimes you gotta step away and check your own intentions
And analyze if what they do can compromise your vision
If people trust you, they don't need to question your decisions
You never needed them if they make you another villain

(Pressure) "They tried to take the bike, and they took my friend's bike
And then my friend was gonna get it back
But then he didn't get it back and then we had to go to the police station
And then, um, then some (Pressure) random stranger brought back his bike
We just, you know, and we didn't tell our mums so we got in trouble
(Pressure makes me–) because they found out like a day later—"
(Do you want to start the game again?)

Pressure makes me lash back, wish I could get past that
I can't take a step back, makes me wish you'd pass that
Pressure makes me lash back, wish I could get past that
I can't take a step back, makes me wish you'd pass that

Sippin' on my pain, smokin' on my pain
Ingestin' my pain, I just wanna play
Sippin' on my pain, smokin' on my pain
