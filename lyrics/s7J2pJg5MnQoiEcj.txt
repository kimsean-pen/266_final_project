We've got to get better said, it's all in your head
We could live through these letters or forget it all together
See the months they don't matter it's the days I can't take
When the hours move to minutes and I'm seconds away

Just ask the question come untie the knot
Say you won't care (x2)
Retrace the steps as if we forgot
Say you won't care (x2)
Try to avoid it but there's not a doubt
And there's one thing I can do nothing about

When all that we need is just a reaction
It's too much to ask for when there's no attraction (anymore)
If chasing our dreams was just a distraction
I'll want to remember when I know that I can't go back

Just ask the question come untie the knot
Say you won't care (x2)
Retrace the steps as if we forgot
Say you won't care (x2)
Try to avoid it (try to avoid it) but there's not a doubt
And there's one thing and i can do nothing
there's one thing and I can do nothing
there's one thing and I can do nothing about

(Musical Break)

Just ask the question (just ask the question) come untie the knot
Say you won't care (care) (x2)
Retrace the steps (retrace the steps) as if we forgot
Say you won't care (care) (x2)
Try to avoid it (try to avoid it) but there's not a doubt
And there's one thing and I can do nothing
there's one thing and I can do nothing
there's one thing and I can do nothing about
