I can't make it on time
I can't make it on time
I keep on tryin' and tryin'
I can't make it on time

I can't hurry and you can't wait
It doesn't matter 'cause we're already late
I can't get off the telephone
It always rings when I'm alone

You gotta wait wait
'Cause you don't need no one
Wait wait
'Cause you know that I'm the one
You gotta wait
Hey, hey, hey

Babe, you gotta wait wait
'Cause you don't need no one
Wait wait
'Cause you know that I'm the one
You gotta wait
You gotta wait

I can't make it on time
I can't make it on time
I keep on tryin' and tryin'
I can't make it on time

You gotta wait wait
'Cause you don't need no one
Wait wait
'Cause you know that I'm the one
You gotta wait
Hey, hey, hey

You gotta wait wait
'Cause you don't need no one
Wait wait
'Cause you know that I'm the one
You gotta wait
You gotta wait

I can't make it on time
I can't make it on time
I keep on tryin' and tryin'
I can't make it on time

I can't hurry and you can't wait
It doesn't matter 'cause we're already late
I can't get off the telephone
It always rings when I'm alone

I can't make it on time
I can't make it on time
I can't make it on time
I can't make it on time
