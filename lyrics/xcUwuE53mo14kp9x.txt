If you ever get close to a human
And human behaviour
Be ready, be ready to get confused
And me and my here after

There's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
To human behaviour
But yet so, yet so irresistible
And me and my fear cannot
And there is no map uncertain
They're terribly, terribly, terribly moody
Of human behaviour

Then all of a sudden turn happy
And they and my here after
But, oh, to get involved in the exchange
Of human emotions
Is ever so, ever so satisfying
And they and my here
And there is no map uncertain

Human behaviour, human behaviour

Human behaviour, human behaviour
There's no map
And a compass
Wouldn't help at all

Uncertain
Human behaviour, human, human
Human behaviour, human behaviour
There's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
Human, human, human
