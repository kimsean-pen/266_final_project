There was a time long ago
But it seemed like yesterday
When all I wanted was you
And now you make the segue
As you turn your face away
And I know your words aren't true

And I don't want your lies
And I don't think that I'm gonna let you inside
You can take off your disguise
'Cause I can see the truth that's hidden
behind your eyes

And all those words that you don't say
Just mean less and less each day
You can't make me shed a tear
I think about tomorrow
Another day of sorrow
But I don't think that I'll be here!

And I don't want your lies
And I don't think that I'm gonna let you inside
You can take off your disguise
'Cause I can see the truth that's hidden
Behind your eyes
