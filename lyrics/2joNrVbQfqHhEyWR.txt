When I know I'm all alone
I say your name slowly
And I know that I'm alone
But I carry you

Does it feel good like the memory
When you try some history?
It's a dream to come around
The rule doesn't bend
Because the taste doesn't taste the same again

It's easy feeling righteous when removed
All you'll get is what you want to hear
It hurts because it should
How else am I to make it clear?

I could never be the one that you want
Don't ask
Well, here's to living in the moment
'Cause it passed

Maybe a lie is what I need sometimes
You told the most, the best of anyone
You said to keep me in your pocket
So I carried you

You better choose your words carefully
Because I'm not your anything
Going to stay here in my place
And you'll stay in yours
Because you're only good as what you're good for

I pace around the room to spend the time
Waiting while the burning pictures fade
One thing to make your mind
And another to say its name

I could never be the one that you want
Don't ask
Well, here's to living in the moment
'Cause it passed
It passed

Doo doo doo-doo-doo, doo doo doo-doo
Doo doo doo-doo-doo, doo doo doo-doo

I'm still carrying a little hope

That maybe things could be different now

Is that so wrong? Is that so wrong?

Is that so wrong?

Would I see you tonight
At a place we'd go?

I want to make things right
Before time runs out

Roll down the windows
Let the cold air come in, yeah
Slap my face just to feel
Just to feel you somehow again, yeah

I could never be the one that you want
Don't ask
Well, here's to living in the moment
'Cause it passed

I could never be the one that you want
Don't ask
Yeah, here's to living in the moment
Because it passed, it passed

'Cause it passed, passed

It passed
