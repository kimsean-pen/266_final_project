Cry baby, cry baby, cry baby

Honey, welcome back home
I know she told you, honey I know she told you that she loved you
Much more than I did but I know that she left you
And you swear that you just don't know why
But you know, honey I'll always,
I'll always be around if you ever want me
Come on and cry, cry baby, cry baby, cry baby

Oh honey, welcome back home
Don't you know
Honey ain't nobody ever gonna love you the way I try to do
Who'll take all your pain, and your heartache, too
And if you need me you know that I'll always be around

If you ever want me

Come on and cry, cry baby, cry baby, cry baby
Oh Daddy, like you always sayin' to do
And when you walk around the world, babe
You said you'd try to look for the end of the road
You might find out later that the road'll end in Detroit
Honey, the road'll even end in Kathmandu
You can go all around the world
Tryin' to find something to do with your life, baby
When you only gotta do one thing well
You only gotta do one thing well to make it in this world, babe

You got a woman waitin' for you there
All you ever gotta do is be a good man one time to one woman
And that'll be the end of the road, babe
I know you got more tears to share, babe
So come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Let's cry, cry baby, cry baby, cry
And if you ever feel a little lonely, dear
I want you to come on, come on to your mama now
And if you ever want a little love of a woman
Come on and baby, baby, baby, babe, babe, baby now
Cry baby, yeah
