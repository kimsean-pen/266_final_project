Here we go, Everybody!
Oh, yeah!
Come on!

You get the limo out front (ooh)
Hottest styles, every shoe, every color
Yeah, when you're famous it can be kinda fun
It's really you but no one ever discovers
In some ways you're just like all your friends

But on stage you're a star
You get the best of both worlds

Chillin' out, take it slow
Then you rock out the show
You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together and you know
That it's the best of both worlds
The best of both worlds (Yeah!)
You go the movie premiers
(Is that Orlando Bloom?)
Hear your songs on the radio

Livin' two lives is a little weird (Yeah)
But school's cool 'cause nobody knows
Yeah, you get to be a small town girl
But big time when you play your guitar

You get the best of both worlds
Chillin' out, take it slow
Then you rock out the show
You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together and you know
That it's the best of both
You know the best of both worlds

Pictures and autographs
You get your face in all the magazines
The best parts that
You get to be whoever you wanna be
Best!
Best!

Yeah, the best of both!
Best!
Best!

You got the best of both!
Best!
Best!

Come on, the best of both
Who would have thought that a girl like me
Would double as a superstar...
Wooo!
You get the best of both worlds
Chillin' out, take it slow

Then you rock out the show
You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together and you know that it's the best
You get the best of both worlds
Without the shades and the hair
You can go anywhere
You get the best of both girls
Mix it all together
Oh, yeah
It's so much better 'cause you know you've got the best of both worlds
