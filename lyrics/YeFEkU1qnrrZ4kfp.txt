Cruisin'

Baby, let's cruise away from here
Don't be confused, the way is clear
And if you want it, you got it forever
This is not a one night stand, baby

Let the music take your mind
Just release, and you will find
You're gonna fly away, glad you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together

The music is played for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

Baby, tonight belongs to us
Everything's right, do what you must
And inch by inch we get closer and closer
To every little part of each other, oh baby yes

Let the music take your mind
Just release, and you will find
You're gonna fly away, glad you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together

The music is played for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

Cruise with me, baby
Cruise with me, baby
Cruisin' (Oooh, oooh, oh)

So good to cruise with you, baby
So good to cruise with you, baby
You and me
Yeah, you and me, baby

Baby, let's cruise
Let's flow, let's glide
Ooh, let's open up and go inside

And if you want it, you got it forever
I can just stay there inside you
And love you baby, oh

Let the music take your mind
Just release, and you will find
You're gonna fly away, glad you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together

The music is played for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

Oh, baby, we gonna fly away
Plan to go my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together

The music is played for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

You're gonna fly away
And you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together

The music is played for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

You're gonna fly away
And you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together

The music is played for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together
