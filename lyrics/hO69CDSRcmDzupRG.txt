Sad moon, seraphim in tears dreaming
In the calm bows at their fingers
It was the blessed day of your first kiss
My reverie loving to torture me
The blessed day of your first kiss
My reverie
This perfume of sadness
Even without regret
This perfume of sadness
Even without setback

My eye riveted by the evening light in your hair
Then you appeared ghostly
And I thought I'd seen a hat of light to pass by
You were a spoiled child
Your careless hand is dropping
These bouquets of white snow
Of perfumed stars
These bouquets of white snow
Of perfumed stars

Bouquets of white snow
These bouquets of white snow
Of perfumed stars
