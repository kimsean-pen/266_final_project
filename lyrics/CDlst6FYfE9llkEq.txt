Running like a fire
Burning in the wind
You say you'll take me higher
Higher than I've been
It was a feeling
I never wanna leave in

But I couldn't turn into you awake
Holding on you anyway
I'm trying stop the heartache
Tryin' to stay awake
It was a feeling (feeling)
I never wanna leave in

I don't want your love
If you can breathe without it
I don't want your love
If you don't dream about it
Don't wanna be the one
No, I won't be the one
If you don't want me to

I don't know the way
The way that you feel about me
I don't wanna stay
If you can be free without me
Don't wanna give it all
Don't wanna give it all
If you can't give it back

I never was a dreamer, never wanted to pretend
When the night comes I still feel you
In my dreams you never end
And I want you to be with me
And I want you to be free
And I want you to remember
That I don't want you to fall for

I don't want your love
If you can breathe without it
I don't want your love
If you don't dream about it
Don't wanna be the one
No, I won't be the one
Don't want you to go (I don't know, I don't...)
If you can't fight it
If you can't give it all
Just try it

I don't want your love
If you can breathe without it
I don't want your love
If you don't dream about it
Don't wanna give it all
Don't wanna give it all
Don't wanna give it all
If you can't give it back

I don't want your love
I don't want your love
If you can breath without it
I don't want your love
I don't want your love
If you don't dream about it
Don't wanna give it all
Don't wanna give it all
Don't wanna give it all
If you cant give it back

I don't know, I don't know, no
Oh god, It's falling down
I don't know, I don't know, no
Oh god, It's falling down
I don't know, I don't know, no
Oh god, It's falling down
I don't know, I don't know
