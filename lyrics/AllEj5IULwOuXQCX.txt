let me be the drug
that you use to fall in love
that heroin that keeps you warm enough
let me sink to your skin
like water in a wound
stitch me up when you are dark
i want to be the water in your lungs
let's you know you were drowning
the last sip of gin you can't drink
let me hide in your neck
with every regret
to practice swallow before you go to bed
and why do i still compare everyone that I love
to the way i loved you?
i can still hear you sing
but you'll never sing for me
my eyes will continue to sink
i wasn't built to exist
these ghost limbs were never taught to swim
you'll always be like a nightmare to me
and i'm always waiting for sleep
