We found out (Yes we did)
We found out (Now we know)
We found out
We found out, that grandma plays the numbers
We found out (yes we did)
We found out (she couldn't keep it hid)
We found out
Now we know grandma plays the numbers
Think about 'em everyday
Dream about 'em every night
Gets up early in the mornin'
See the numbers come down just right
We found out (yes we know)
We found out (bless her soul)
We found out
Now we know that grandma plays the numbers
We found out (yes we know)
We found out (bless her soul)
We found out
Now we know grandma plays the numbers
We found out (yes oh yes)
We found out (we found out)
We found out
Now we know, that grandma plays the numbers
She's at the fruitstand everyday
Buys bananas by the bunch
She looked at all the pricetags
That's why she gets her hunch
We found out (yes we know)
We found out (bless her soul)
We found out
Now we know, grandma plays the numbers
