View from a bridge, can't take anymore
View from a bridge, can't take anymore

I guess it all began about a year ago
Like a cheap love magazine
You know the kind you read about and have to laugh
At the pages in between

Now I can't believe that fool inside is me
'Cause I just can't face the world I've grown to see

View from a bridge, can't take anymore
View from a bridge, can't take anymore

I saw you kissing her, I saw you making her
In the soft sheets in between
But when you turned around, I saw your eyes were fire
And you crashed out all my dreams

And like a fool I just stood there and let it go
I should have fought right back and let my feelings show

View from a bridge, can't take anymore
View from a bridge, can't take anymore

You sure as hell knew how to make a fool out of me
Well you cut me down for the things you want and now it's killing me
Ohhh

(I'll lay it on the line now)
(You're running out of time now)

But then a voice said jump and I just let go
And I'm floating out in space
But then I feel your arms and I turn around
To a ghost without a face

And I just don't know what's fact or fantasy
'Cause when I look below the bridge I see it's me

View from a bridge, can't take anymore
View from a bridge, can't take anymore
View from a bridge, can't take anymore
View from a bridge, can't take anymore
View from a bridge, can't take anymore
View from a bridge, can't take anymore
View from a bridge, can't take anymore
