They held me down so long
Got me closed in like an animal
Take it all, Leaving nothing for the cannibals

I was born on the outside (where you from?)
94th and 1st down on the south side
See I was there back when the form was great
Before these stupid motherfuckers gave me something to hate
Back when people used to fight for shit
Before the Trojan form of protest was this type of shit
Yeah, so don't you act like you don't know me or my homies
We the ones who's comin' back for what you owe-

They held me down so long
Got me closed in like an animal
Take it all, please leave nothing for the cannibals
Can't take this from me
(Never gonna break, never gonna break, never gonna-)
Feel the enemy
(Never gonna break, break)
I'm coming at you like an animal
(I never wanted this, so many gone)
I'm coming at you like an animal
(But they're gonna take, take, take, they're gonna take, take)
I'm coming at you like an animal

Hunt me down from the chase and take me by the neck
Lock me up in a cage and this is what you get
Another hundred in rage and we never forget
So meet me out on the pavement (what the fuck did you expect?)
We coming back for what is rightfully ours
We fought the streets and flippin' cop cars
Knock me flat on my back, I'm looking up at the stars
Still ain't afraid to catch a charge

They held me down so long
Got me closed in like an animal
Take it all, please leave nothing for the cannibals
Can't take this from me
(Never gonna break, never gonna break, never gonna-)
Feel the enemy
(Never gonna break, break)
I'm coming at you like an animal

Coming for you like an animal
(I'ma take that yeah I'ma take that)
(Cause we deserve it yeah we deserve it)

I'mma take that
I'mma take that

They held me down so long
Got me closed in like an animal
Take it all, please leave nothing for the cannibals
Can't take this from me
(Never gonna break, never gonna break, never gonna-)
Feel the enemy
(Never gonna break, break)
I'm coming at you like an animal
(I never wanted this, so many gone)
I'm coming at you like an animal
(But they're gonna take, take, take, they're gonna take, take)
I'm coming at you like an animal
(I'ma take that yeah I'ma take that)
I'm coming at you like an animal
(Cause we deserve that yeah we deserve that)
I'm coming at you like an animal
