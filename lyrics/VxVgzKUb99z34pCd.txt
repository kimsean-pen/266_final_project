Shut my eyes
Feel the color of you
So get to this elation
So high, so fast

Shut my eyes
Feel the color of you
Succumb to this illusion
So strong, so deep

'Cause everyday is all there is
In my some kind of bliss
'Cause everyday is all there is
In my some kind of bliss

Study my reflection
And let the colors fall
Slip into stillness
And be above it all

Ah, good to be here
Time to be alone
I've found a space where I belong
Not succumb to fear

'Cause everyday is all there is
In my some kind of bliss
'Cause everyday is all there is
In my some kind of bliss
Ooo

'Cause everyday is all there is
In my some kind of bliss
'Cause everyday is all there is
In my some kind of bliss

'Cause everyday is all there is
In my some kind of bliss
'Cause everyday is all there is
In my some kind of bliss

'Cause everyday is all there is
In my some kind of bliss
'Cause everyday is all there is
In my some kind of bliss

'Cause everyday
Everyday, aah
Everyday
