Falling
I see you on the way down
I'll meet you on the rebound
Somewhere in between

Calling
Out across the airwaves
Faces that you can't say
Are calling out for me

And oh me oh my
Say so long baby bye bye
Pour me one for the road
It's a long journey baby
Where its gunna take me
Just depends on the weight of my load
Oh no
Depends on the weight of my load

So long
See you in the next one
'Cause everyone been and gone
There's no one here but me

And oh me oh my
Say so long baby bye bye
Pour me one for the road
It's a long journey baby
Where it's gunna take me just
Depends on the weight of my load
Oh no
Depends on the weight of my load

And oh me oh my
Say so long baby bye bye
Pour me one for the road
It's a long journey baby
Where it's gunna take me just
Depends on the weight of my load
Oh no
Depends on the weight of my load
Depends on the weight of my load

Dry land
Sinking in the quicksand
Stranded on the wrong beach
Come and rescue me
