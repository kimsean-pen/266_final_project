Out of the darkness, the voices are calling
Riding the wings of a song
The fury is screaming and Heaven is falling
I feel it coming on strong

The lightning, strikes cracking the night
It feels like never before
Thunder and spark in the heart of the dark
I hear a rising force

Searching my soul, now I find something else
I take my life in my hands
Through the gates of Heaven to the altars of Hell
The power is at my command

The lightning strikes, cracking the night
I'm not the same anymore
Thunder and spark in the heart of the dark
I feel a rising force

Burned by the glory of a sacred fire
The rising force starts to shine
A burning inferno, it soars ever higher
Leaving the demons behind

The lightning strikes, cracking the night
It feels like never before
Thunder and spark in the heart of the dark
I feel a rising force

The lightning strikes, cracking the night
I'm not the same anymore
Thunder and spark in the heart of the dark
I feel a rising force
