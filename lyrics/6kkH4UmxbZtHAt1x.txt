Recollect me, darling, raise me to your lips
Two undernourished egos, four rotating hips
Hold on to me tightly, I'm a sliding scale
Can't endure, then you can inhale
Clearly out of body experience interferes
And dreams of flying, I fit nearly
Surrounds me though I get lonely, slowly

Inertia keeps
Moving up slowly
Inertia creeps
Moving up slowly
Inertia keeps
Moving up slowly
Moving up slowly
Moving up slowly
Inertia creeps
Moving up slowly
She comes
Moving up slowly
She comes
Moving up slowly
Inertia creeps
Moving up slowly
She comes
Moving up slowly
She comes
Moving up slowly

In my home, no chrome as clear as
See me now with my nearest dearest
Been there when I'm over careering
Room shifting is endearing
Between us is our kitchen
Would you found my irritant's itching
Been here before
Been here forever

Moving up slowly
Inertia keeps
Moving up slowly
Inertia creeps
Moving up slowly
Inertia keeps
Moving up slowly
She comes
Moving up slowly
Moving up slowly
She comes
Moving up slowly
Inertia creeps
Moving up slowly

She comes

There be no sound in my eidertown
Awake, I lie in a morning's blue
Room is still my antenna in you
Nylon burns the bedspread with two
Gravity's zero see me stall
I bounce off walls, lose my footing and fall
It can be sweet though incomplete though
And the frames will freeze
See me on all four's

It's been a long time

She comes
She comes

I want to x you
She comes

Inertia keeps
Moving up slowly
Inertia creeps
Moving up slowly
Inertia keeps
Moving up slowly
Inertia creeps
Moving up slowly
Moving up slowly
Inertia keeps
Moving up slowly
Inertia creeps
Moving up slowly
Moving up slowly
Inertia keeps
Moving up slowly
Inertia creeps
Moving up slowly
Inertia keeps
Moving up slowly

Say she comes
Say she comes

Caught your radio waves
I caught your radio waves
Say she comes
Say she comes

Inertia keeps
Moving up slowly
(Say she comes)
Inertia creeps
Moving up slowly
(Say she comes)
Inertia keeps
Moving up slowly
(Say she comes)
(Say she comes)
(Say she comes)
