Down below a faded glow
Vibrant key without a tone
Realise in here it's cold
I can only let it snow

Words were said so long ago
Left a mark, an open sore
You go fast, I'm burnin' slow
Hate to say I knew you'd go

So much going on
And I wish to hold on
So much going on
And I cannot let go

Past the trees that hide our love
Hurry now it's time to go
Make this moment matter more
Show me like you did before

Revolting in a broken home
Holding on to what we own
Worlds collide and cause a storm
Still I wish I could hold on

Words were said so long ago
Face defeat and take the blow
So na√Øve now I know more
Won't forget the things before

So much going on
And I wish to hold on
So much going on
And I cannot let go
...cannot let go...
