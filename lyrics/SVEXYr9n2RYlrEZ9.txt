Remember, Now, Be Here Now
As it's not like it was before.
The past, was, Be Here Now
As it's not like it was before - it was

Why try to live a life,
that isn't real,
no how
A mind, that wants to wander,
'round a corner,
is an un-wise mind

Now, Is, Be Here Now
and it's not what it was before,
Remember, Now, Be Here Now
as it's not like it was before - it was
