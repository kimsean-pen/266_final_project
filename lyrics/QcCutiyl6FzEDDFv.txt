I came along for the ride.
You're wicked with the clutch.
Happened so fast and
It hurt so much.
You're a car crash
And i can't look away.
I should've known by now.
I'm still not afraid.
I'll do it to myself though
It's what I never what I say.
You're a car crash
And i can't look away.
All I see is
Shattered glass and
Red lights passing
My life flashing.
Heading for the same disaster.
Faster and
Faster and
Faster.
I couldn't stop at the red light.
Stop at the red light.
I couldn't stop at the red light.
You're a car crash
And I can't look away.

The red light.
Stop at the red light.
I couldn't stop at the red light.
You're just like a car crash
And i can't look away.
From the headlights
The red lights.
Stop at the red light.
I couldn't stop at the red light.
You're just like a car crash
And i can't look away.
