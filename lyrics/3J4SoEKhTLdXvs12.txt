So tired sleeping through the day
Bloodshot eyes and sweat from my body
And I picked my head up yesterday
Found the reason of hope left inside of me

But I still believe in immortal love
And I know there's someone above

Shine down, don't take it away from me, no
And I know, you know how, yeah
And shine down, just give me a chance to feel it
It's taken forever to get me off the ground

Haunted silence overwhelming me
Deny takes its toll on my sanity
And I know I've been away too long
All these years I've been hiding
I'm feeling I'm coming strong

But I still believe in immortal love
And I know there's someone that's up above
Show me a path to find my way
And give me a reason to pray

Well, shine down, don't take it away from me, no
And I know, you know how, yeah
Shine down, just give me a chance to feel it
It's taken forever to get me off the ground

Shine down, don't take it away from me, no
And I know you know how, yeah
And shine down, just give me a chance to feel it
It's taken forever to get me off the ground, yeah

And shine down, don't take it away from me, no
And I know you know how, yeah
And shine down, just give me a chance to feel it
It's taken forever to get me off the ground

Shine down, shine down, oh, shine down
Oh baby, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shine down, oh, shine down, oh, shine down
Oh baby shine down
