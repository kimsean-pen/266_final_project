Well I swear to god
We've been down this road before
The guilt's no good and it only shames us more
And the truths that we all tried to hide
Are so much clearer when it's not our lives
We don't, face the blame
Won't you (Get on your knees)
Believe (Have faith)
In this lie with us all

Now my body's on the floor
And I am calling
Well I'm calling out to you
Can you hear me now?

It's not rebellion when you're selling out to another fashion salesman
Our promising lives are full of empty promises
Temptation's falling and calling you home again
Well I'm sorry
If we've let you down

Won't you (Get on your knees)
Believe (Have faith)
In this lie with us all

Now my body's on the floor
And I am calling
Well I'm calling out to you
Oh can you hear me now? (Can you hear me now?)

Now my body's on the floor
And I am calling
Well I'm calling out to you
Oh can you feel me now?

What's wrong?
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

What's wrong?
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

What's wrong?
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

What's wrong?
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

Now my body's on the floor
And I am calling
Well I'm calling out to you (Can you hear me now?)

Now my body's on the floor
And I am calling
Now my body's on the floor
And I am calling
Now my body's on the floor
And I am calling
Well I'm calling out to you
