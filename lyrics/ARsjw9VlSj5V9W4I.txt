She don't know who I amâ€”
I told her I'm her friend
I'm feeling so left out
Please don't buy into doubt
I can't find in-between
That's what you taught to me
Just take it all and leave me

He got cold feet again
He's stuck inside his head
That dog won't bark again
No leash can comprehend
That terrible rainbow
Got off from your sorrow
Your teardrop doesn't show

Hold on
I'd like to
Get through it
This time
I might
Undo it
I'd just like to
Rewind

Sell every inch
of yourself
to the spaceman
try to buy me back (I can't find in-between/That's what you taught to me)
I'm not for sale anymore (Just take it all and leave me)

Hold on
I'd like to
Get through it
