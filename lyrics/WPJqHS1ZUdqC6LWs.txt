You're selfish like me
It's why we get along famously
We're English as well
So we're a, we're a
We're a little bit ashamed of ourselves

It's okay to be needy
Just not voraciously greedy
Let's make sure that we don't let it show

You get yours and I'll get mine
We'll justify our actions some other time

You're anxious in dreams
'Cause you've come apart at the seams
Revealing inside
What it was, what it was
What it was that you were trying to hide

I don't know how to be friendly
When you're consumed with envy
It never stops controlling how I feel

You get yours and I'll get mine and I'll get mine
We'll justify our actions some other time, some other time

You get yours and I'll get mine and I'll get mine
We'll justify our actions some other time

Tell me you love me and this time mean it
(Come on, baby)
Tell me you love me and this time
(Tell me, tell me that you love me and this time, this time mean it)

It's okay to be needy
Just not voraciously greedy
Let's make sure that we don't let it show, don't let it show

You get yours and I'll get mine
I'll get mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, I'll get mine
We'll justify our actions some other time, some other time

You get yours and I'll get mine, I'll get mine
We'll justify our actions some other time, some other time
Some other time, some other time

You get yours, I'll get mine
You get yours and I'll get mine
