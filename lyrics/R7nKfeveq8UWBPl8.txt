There's no greater sight than in your underwear removing mine
And I've never felt this good
There's not a news flash that could deflate my mood
Oh its clothes on your floor
I recognize this decor
I've been before

And I can't I can't keep keeping up with these curveballs
And the more I try the more my backs against the wall
And I can't I can't keep keeping up with these curveballs
Curveballs

Who and why how?
I tend to focus on the past and not the now
I'll be over this soon
But some images heal like super glue
Six hands in one day
Could he not afford the rent
This won't end

And I can't I can't keep keeping up with these curveballs
And the more I try the more my backs against the wall
And I can't I can't keep keeping up with these curveballs
Curveballs

What you expect me to say when the paintings I paint start to leap out their frames
Sweetheart what you want me to say

And I can't I can't keep keeping up with these curveballs
And the more I try the more my backs against the wall
And I can't I can't keep keeping up with these curveballs
Curveballs
