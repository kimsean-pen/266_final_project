Holding it close, this time
tell me I've heard I'm fine
you'll never know what you do to me
all that we have won't grow
falling is hard, I know
you make it so easy, believe me

And it's on my mind and I'd like to talk things through
and you're on my mind though I know I'll never do

Holding my tongue, it's real
tell me the truth, I'll heal
taking it slow before you go

And it's on my mind and I'd like to talk things through
and you're on my mind though I know I'll never do (on my mind)
and it's on my mind and I'd like to talk things through
and you're on my mind though I know I'll never do for you

You're all that I want and more
I'd say but I know your sound
I wish I could be someone you need
you need...

And it's on my mind and I'd like to talk things through
and you're on my mind though I know I'll never do (on my mind)
and it's on my mind and I'd like to talk things through
and you're on my mind though I know I'll never do for you
do for you
