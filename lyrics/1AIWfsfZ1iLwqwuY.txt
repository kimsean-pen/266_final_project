Hold me tight, this is a lonely night
And I've hurt you, baby, 'cause you're my light
Make me strong just like you make me weak
And your hands reach out for me even in your sleep

I'll soon be gone now
Forever not yours
It won't be long now
Forever not yours

Memories, they keep coming through
The good ones hurt more than the bad ones do
The days were hot and the nights were deep
And I miss you, baby, I miss you, baby

I'll soon be gone now
Forever not yours
It won't be long now
Forever not yours

I'll soon be gone now
It won't be long now
Forever not, forever not yours

I'll soon be gone now
Forever not yours
It won't be long now
Forever not yours

I'll soon be gone now
Forever not yours
It won't be long now
Forever not yours

I'll soon be gone now
Forever not yours
It won't be long now
Forever not yours
