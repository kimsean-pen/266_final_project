No more waiting on them
As you rise inside new rooms
Its official, you've gone
You can live for no-one else
Man the guilt must be huge
Theres no gain in failure
You succeded at being mine
Yeah, old friend, see ya there
I will be proud from a far
I can't paint a picture
In a moment, of memories there's not many left
I am extrodited, uninvited

It's just another Saturday

Take a step to freedom
You and her loathing this cruel world
Take a breath of shelter, then exhale
Trust and allegance
Liberate yourself from hell

It's just another Saturday

It's just another Saturday
