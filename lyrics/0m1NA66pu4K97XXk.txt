If we can't be lovers
I don't think we can be friends
You say you need a strong relation
But I say it all depends
You gotta know me
Have a feeling for my needs
But we're two of a kind
and with different beliefs
So you're stressin', pressin',
I need your blessin'
There's no way that
I'm excessin'
Givin' me a vision that I only fear
Yes, I gotta be out of here

Don't you know
Don't you know
Everytime you go
That your one-man-show
Leaves me alone
Don't you care
Don't you care
I don't think it's fair
'Cause we still got things to share
Everytime you're goin'

Gotta get away baby
Gotta get away
Gotta get away baby
Gotta get away yeah

It's about time
to leave, I've had enough
Lovin' like this
ain't easy but tough
It makes me wonder
What's the meaning of our lives
When feelings like this
cannot be given a try
But your dream of illusion,
just delusion
Now I've come to
the conclusion
The only way for me
to keep goin' on strong
Is goin' all alone

Chorus
