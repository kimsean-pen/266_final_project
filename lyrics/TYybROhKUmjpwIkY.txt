They're picking up the prisoners
And putting 'em in a pen
And all she wants to do is dance, dance
Rebels been rebels since I don't know when
And all she wants to do is dance
Molotov cocktail the local drink
And all she wants to do is dance, dance
Crazy people walking round with blood in their eyes
And all she wants to do is dance, dance
Wild-eyed pistol wavers
Who ain't afraid to die
And all she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance and make romance
She can't feel the heat coming off the street
She wants to party
She wants to get down
All she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance

Well, the government bugged the men's room in the local disco lounge
And all she wants to do is dance, dance
To keep the boys from selling
All the weapons they could scrounge
And all she wants to do is dance
But that don't keep the boys from making a buck or two
And all she wants to do is dance, dance
They still can sell the army all the drugs that they can do
And all she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance
And make romance

Well we barely made the airport for the last plane out
As we taxied down the runway I could hear the people shout
They said "Don't come back here Yankee"
But if I ever do
I'll bring more money
'Cause all she wants to do is dance and make romance
Never mind the heat coming off the street
She wants to party
She wants to get down
All she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance
All she wants to do is dance
And make romance
All she wants to do is dance
