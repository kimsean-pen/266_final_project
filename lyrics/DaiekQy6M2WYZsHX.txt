All the girls pose the same for pictures
All the boys have the same girl's hair.
And I am bored because I feel much older,
Look at me as if I got a reason to stare.
But you talk so loud, that it calms me down.
You're crying, "let's make a toast."

She says she's leavin on a Sunday,
That leaves me one more night.
Can I take you home?
I know it's wrong, but I know your type.

She says she's leavin on a Sunday,
I don't care I need to know where to turn.
I tried it once it never caught on,
I was the only one who got burned.

I've read every word you've said,
From a poster of a cat.
Four books look across your sofa,
I thought your coffee table was more clever than that.
It gets worse once we get to her room she stops and she sings "do do do do do do do do"
I claim "New Religion" is my song,
She doesn't get it,
It's all before she's born.

And you lock your door,
Like I've been here before.
I feel like I've seen a ghost.

She says she's leavin on a Sunday,
That leaves me one more night.
Can I take you home?
I know it's wrong, but I know your type.

She says she's leavin on a Sunday,
I don't care I need to know where to turn.
I tried it once it never caught on,
I was the only one who got burned.
I was the only one who got burned.

Suddenly between sheets and eyelids, I am reminded why I don't do this.
I fall in love far too quickly,
I never want her to forget me.
When you're gone,
Will you call?
Will you write?

She says she's leavin on a Sunday,
That leaves me one more night.
Can I take you home?
I know it's wrong, but I know your type.

She says she's leavin on a Sunday,
That leaves me one more night.
Can I take you home?
I know it's wrong, but I know your type.

She says she's leavin on a Sunday,
I don't care I need to know where to turn.
I tried it once it never caught on,
I was the only one who got burned.
I was the only one who got burned.
I was the only one who got burned.
I was the only one who got burned.
