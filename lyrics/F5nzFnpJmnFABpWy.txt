You have no patience and I have wondered why
Your emotions have stepped away
You are the ghost where she was standing
But I remember

The most we've done in planning
Is trying not to die
This world we birthed is failing
I know this is all a dream

You wished I waited, you thought it was all a lie
I prayed and faded away
If I gave host to all my fears
I'd hate to remember

The most we've done in planning
Is trying not to die
This world we birthed is failing
I know this is all a dream
You know the gift he's handing
The love pours from his eyes
This world we birthed is planning
I know this is all a dream
