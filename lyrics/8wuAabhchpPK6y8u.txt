How could I miss you if I never met you?
If that road turns another way
And never looked back?

There's a feeling overwhelming, like I couldn't belong
Without this point of contact
Everything would be wrong
Stop-motion on the ceiling
Skip frames and I'm forgetting the in-between

When the world is spinning and I am standing still
When the world comes apart and I'm standing still
You flicker

If I never knew what I've lost
(You flicker)
And I turn around, and you're gone
(You flicker)

A moment lost is not so easily found
If our grounds turned another way and never looked back

There's a feeling overwhelming, this is where I belong
This melody inseparable, from singing this song
I'm floating on the feeling
Skip beats and I'm forgetting the in-between

When the world is spinning and I am standing still
When the world comes apart and I'm standing still
You flicker

If I never knew what I've lost
(You flicker)
And I turn around, and you're gone
(You flicker)

If you turn left and I turn right
Would the curves of the Earth bring our paths back to cross again?

Would I trust fate to bring back the tide?
Or would I dive head first to feel you on my skin?

(You flicker)

If I never knew what I've lost
(You flicker)
And I turn around, and you're gone
(You flicker)

When the world is spinning and I am standing still
(You flicker)
When the world comes apart and I'm standing still
(You flicker)
