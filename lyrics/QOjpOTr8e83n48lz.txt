Enola Gay
You should have stayed at home yesterday
Ah ah words can't describe
The feeling and the way you lied

These games you play
They're going to end in more than tears some day
Ah ah Enola Gay
It shouldn't ever have to end this way

It's eight fifteen
And that's the time that it's always been
We got your message on the radio
Conditions normal and you're coming home

Enola Gay
Is mother proud of little boy today
Ah ah this kiss you give
It's never ever going to fade away

Enola Gay
It shouldn't ever have to end this way
Ah ah Enola Gay
It shouldn't fade in our dreams away

It's eight fifteen
And that's the time that it's always been
We got your message on the radio
Conditions normal and you're coming home

Enola Gay
Is mother proud of little boy today
Ah ah this kiss you give
It's never ever going to fade away
