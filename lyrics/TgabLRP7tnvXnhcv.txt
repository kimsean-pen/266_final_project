Hey, child
I will always be there for you

Child
For you
Don't cry
Don't feel

Don't feel
I will always be there for you
For you

Somewhere out there
I will always be there for you

Baby
Baby
I'll be there
I'll be there
Promise I'll be there
You are
It's your crew
I'll be there
I'll be there
Promise I'll be
I promise
I'll be there
