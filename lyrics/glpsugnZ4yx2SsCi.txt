I'm in your blood and like a poison in your veins
In small amounts I'm killing you slowly
You cannot face me when I'm staring straight at you
You cannot hide 'cause I will haunt you

We're falling down into a grave
When all the trust has gone away
Now take this life and pull the
pull the trigger
Stop my pain

It's crashing down
The sound of thunder
The lightning strikes and makes me blind
You drag me down and pull me under
Until you see me drown

Just like a drug I slow you down and make you numb
I got you high
I laid you so low
You're paralyzed with all my strength
I'm hurting you
You sleep me awake
It's like a bad dream

We're falling down into a grave
When all the trust has gone away
Now take this life and pull the
pull the trigger
Stop my pain

It's crashing down
The sound of thunder
The lightning strikes and makes me blind
You drag me down and pull me under
And spread around like a deadly infection

Drag me down and pull me under
Drag me down until you see me drown
