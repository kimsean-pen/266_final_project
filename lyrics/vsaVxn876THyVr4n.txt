Pick a card, any card, deal 'em in, hit it
Play the game, play it hard and push the limit
Bet it all, ante up, lost in the shuffle
Never cheat lady luck, love is a gamble

I know the odds are against you
Ace up the sleeve make you boo-hoo
So what? I got nothin' to prove
I'll give it another try, makin' my own rules tonight

Baby, let's go-oh-oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh-oh
Go-oh-oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh-oh
Go-oh-oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh-oh
Go-oh-oh, ooh-woah, oh, go fish
Go fish
Go fish

Crazy eights, light it up, I'll give you one shot
Dance with the queen of clubs and win the jackpot
I don't need solitaire because I found you
And now that I have you here, you know we can't lose

I know the odds are against you
Ace up the sleeve make you boo-hoo
That Tammie Brown kinda cuckoo
'Cause, honey, I'm the crazy type, makin' my own rules tonight

Baby, let's go-oh-oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh-oh
Go-oh-oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh-oh
Go-oh-oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh-oh
Go-oh-oh, ooh-woah, oh, go fish
Go fish
Go fish

Go fish
MM, mm
Go fish
Go fish, go fish
Go fish, go fish
This is not the end
Pick a card and try again
This is not the end
Pick a card and try again
Go fish, go fish
MM, mm, mm, mmhm
Baby
Uh
Go fish, go fish
MM, baby
