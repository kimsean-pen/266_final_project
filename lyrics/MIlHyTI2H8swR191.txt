I'm walking a wire,
it feels like a thousand
ways I could fall
To want is to buy,

but to live is to die
and you can't take it all
When everything is said and done,
I won't have one thing left

What happened to everything
that I've ever known
'Cause all they gave me was this ticket to Heaven
But that ticket to Heaven,

said to lie in the bed that you make
Now I'm restless and I'm running from everything
I'm running from everything
I'm afraid it's a little too late

And soft voices lie,

innocence dies,
now ain't that a shame?
And all of your dreams,
and all your money
they don't mean a thing
When everything is said and done,
you won't have one thing left
What happened to everything I've ever known?
All they gave me was this ticket to Heaven
But that ticket to Heaven,
said to lie in the bed that you make
Now I'm restless and I'm running from everything
I'm running from everything
I'm afraid it's a little too late
It's a little too late
All he gave me was this ticket to Heaven
But that ticket to Heaven,
said to lie in the bed that you make
Now I'm restless and I'm running from everything
I'm running from everything
I'm afraid it's a little too late
All he gave me was this ticket to Heaven
But that ticket to Heaven,
said to lie in the bed that you make
Now I'm restless and I'm running from everything
I'm running from everything
I'm afraid it's a little too late
It's a little too late
