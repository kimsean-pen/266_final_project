Big dreams,
Big dreams,
Rolls on his own but he's got big dreams
I've seen all the shit he's seen,
Never had a dad he's only 15,
Mid teens, Big dreams,
Could have played for all the big teams,
Could've been a star in all the big leagues,
Young brother will you please believe,

Oh no!
You spoke to me
Things weren't going how they supposed to be
I know there's supposed to be
I've been keeping your word so close to me

Oh no!
You spoke to me
Things weren't going how they supposed to be
I know there's supposed to be
I've been chilling back living so comfortably

We've been stuck sitting frozen in your old way,
He could never quit he had to go the whole way,
You've got to put in work to be the one and only,
I had to tell myself I was the one and only,
It's been 7 days the same clothes,
And I think it's taking its toll,
I don't wanna have to [?] with no [?]
I'll never loose my grip and control,

Oh no!
You'spoke to me
Things weren't going how they supposed to be
But I know there's supposed to be
I've been keeping your word so close to me

Oh no!
You spoke to me
Things weren't going how they supposed to be
I know there's supposed to be
I've been chilling back living so comfortably,

I've been trying to tell you that I think you should try it,
I've been dying to tell you that I think you should try it,

Cause you know,
You know, you know that it's something different,
Cause you know,
You know, you know that it's something different,

Oh no!
You spoke to me
Things weren't going how they supposed to be
I know there's supposed to be
I've been keeping your word so close to me

Oh no!
You spoke to me
Things weren't going how they supposed to be
I know there's supposed to be
I've been chilling back living so comfortably
