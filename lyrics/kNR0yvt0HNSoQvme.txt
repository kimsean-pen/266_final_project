I, I come here to be what you want
So you get mad, so you get mad
And I, I come here to be what you need
So you can fly, so you can fly
Coming in need
In a world you wrote
All takes a head of its own
Headed in role, heading in black
Along it won't be clean till it's time'
Cause I, I come here to be what you want
So you get mad, so you get mad
And I, I come here to be what you need
So you can fly, so you can fly
Coming in need
In a world you wrote
Hunger won't be quelled till it's tamed
Caught up in me, caught up in mine
Caught up and read between the lines'
Cause I, I come here to be what you want
So you get mad, so you get mad
And I, I come here to be what you need
So you can fly, so you can fly
You're caught up in me, you're caught up in mine
Caught up and read between the lines'
Cause I, I come here to be what you want
So you get mad, so you get mad
And I, I come here to be what you need
So you can fly, so you can fly
