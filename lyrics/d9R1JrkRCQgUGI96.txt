I've been here before been too quick to fall
Gave my heart to another one, bye bye
Now I talk to God in the dead of night
So many questions leaving him, tongue tie
I've got so many questions running through my mind

Cause all I really know
Is I wanna go with the angels glow
With this one true love that lasts forever
I, I wanna know what the angels know
Cause it doesn't mean a thing if it don't have ever
It's just a beautiful, beautiful lie
Just a beautiful, beautiful lie
Just a beautiful, beautiful lie

It's a tiring game that I have to play
I got so much heartache I gotta leave behind
Never tell the truth, am I gonna lose?
This is who I am, don't you let me down this time

Cause all I really know
Is I wanna go with the angels glow
With this one true love that lasts forever
I, I wanna know what the angels know
Cause it doesn't mean a thing if it don't have ever
It's just a beautiful, beautiful lie
Just a beautiful, beautiful lie
Just a beautiful, beautiful lie

All the years and all the lifes they become our all admires, all our
We need true love
Every minute, every hour
We just need to feel, to need, to hold
We need true love
It's just a beautiful, beautiful lie
Just a beautiful, beautiful lie
Just a beautiful

Cause all I really know
Is I wanna go with the angels glow
With this one true love that lasts forever
I wanna know what the angels know
Cause it doesn't mean a thing if it don't have ever
It's just a beautiful, beautiful lie
Just a beautiful, beautiful lie
Just a beautiful, beautiful lie

Every minute every hour
We just need to feel, to need, to hold
We need true love
