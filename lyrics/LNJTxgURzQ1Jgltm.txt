Another page written in this chapter,
and I can see the ending's clear.
So much for these feelings for you.
There's nothing left for me to hold on to.
Shot down in flames.
Dust and smoke is all that remains.
Things aren't the same.
I think that you're the one to blame
for all that I have gone through for you.
Now it's going to stop.
