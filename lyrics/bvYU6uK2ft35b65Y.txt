If I was a lonely boy
In the midst of how everybody lived
Before I was this way
I don't recognize myself
C' est presque deux ans

Water me darling
Take what you need before it runs out
Don't check in to see if it's producing again
'Til you're back to collect

I would change my hair
I'd grow taller
I'd live everywhere that I love
I'd stand strong
My feet will drag on
And my odor will linger
It is something they will long for
I will make a home that is my own
If I move around, I know it won't be for a while

Hole on the ground
Well-meaning supply
Take what you need before it runs out
Don't check in to see if it's producing

Take what you need and go
Don't look back and see
If the well is producing
Any more water
Take what you need and go
I don't have it in me
To give everyone everything
Take what you need and go
Don't look back and see
The well is all dried up
No more water to give
