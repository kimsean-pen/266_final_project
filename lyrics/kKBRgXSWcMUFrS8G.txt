I'm not programmed to give you that information

Sleep in the skies
stars in the sea
these are dreams of mine
I fall at your feet

Summer nights in space
make me complete
beams and beams of light
a love beyond belief

I fell in love
I fell in love
I fell in love
I fell in love
in an ordinary world

Oh oh oh oh oh

Fly through the skies
feeling your heat
beams and beams of light
a love beyond belief

And I won't ever wake up from this dream

Say we'll always be together
say this love will last forever

Say we'll always be together
say this love will last forever

I fell in love
I fell in love
I fell in love
I fell in love
in an ordinary world

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh...

I fell in love
I fell in love
I fell in love
I fell in love...
