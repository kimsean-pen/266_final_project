There is a map of the world
it lies upon my weary face
Each line representing a mile I have traveled from place to place
The colors are fading, the edges are tattered
It's grown a little worn with age

There is a map of the world
it lies upon my weary face
That I cannot erase
I cannot erase
oooooh
I cannot erase

The current of life pulled me under
and I was swept away
Expending the distance between us
every second of every day
I thought I had given all I could offer
while trying to keep the dogs at bay
But the current of life pulled me under
and I was swept away

Beneath the tidal wave
Beneath the tidal wave
ohhh
Beneath the tidal wave
Beneath the tidal wave
I will be erased

There is a map of the world
it lies upon my weary face
There is a map of the world
it lies upon my weary face
