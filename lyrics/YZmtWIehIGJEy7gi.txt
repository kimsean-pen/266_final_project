Take that look of worry
I'm an ordinary man
They don't tell me nothin'
So I find out all I can

There's a fire that's been burnin'
Right outside my door

I can't see but I feel it
And it helps to keep me warm
So I, I don't mind
No I, I don't mind

Seems so long I've been waitin'
Still don't know what for
There's no point escaping

I don't worry anymore
I can't come out to find you
I don't like to go outside
They can't turn off my feelings
Like they're turnin' off the light

But I, I don't mind

No I, I don't mind
Oh I, I don't mind
No I, I don't mind
So take, take me home

('Cos I don't remember)
Take, take me home
('Cos I don't remember)
Take, take me home

(Oh Lord)
'Cos I've been a prisoner all my life
And I can say to you
(Ohh ohh) Take that look of worry

Mine's an (Ohh ohh) ordinary life

(Ohh ohh) Working when it's daylight
And (Ohh ohh) sleeping when it's night
(Ohh ohh) I've got no far horizons
I don't (Ohh ohh) wish upon a star
(Ohh ohh) They don't think that I listen
Oh but (Ohh ohh) I know who they are
And I, I don't mind
No I, I don't mind
Oh I, I don't mind
No I, I don't mind
So take, take me home
('Cos I don't remember)
Take, take me home
('Cos I don't remember)
Take, take me home
('Cos I don't remember)
Take, take me home
(Oh Lord)
Well I've been a prisoner all my life
And I can say to you
But I don't remember
(Take, take me home)
'Cos I don't remember
(Take, take me home)
'Cos I don't remember
(Take, take me home)
'Cos I don't remember
(Take, take me home)
'Cos I don't remember
(Take, take me home)
'Cos I don't remember
(Take, take me home)
'Cos I don't remember
(Take, take me home)
'Cos I don't remember
(Take, take me home)
'Cos I don't remember
(Take, take me home)
