I don't want to hear
Another word from you now
I'd rather be wrong
Life is mostly what
You don't see anyway
So just look away
But our shadows
Never leave us alone
Down the bad roads
They will follow us
Faithfully home

You launched the assualt
With the first cannonball
My soldiers were sleeping
I know that you thought
It would never come down,
Down to the wire
It's friendly fire

In your room filled with the things
That you've never done
Does anyone really care
Your shadow
Just wont leave you alone
'cos he knows well
He knows what you've done

You launched the assualt

With the first cannonball
My soldiers were sleeping
I know that you thought
It could never come down,
Down to the wire
It's friendly fire

Waves don't wonder
When you're drowning
Under the sea
So don't look for me
Find her keep her lose her
Deserts you in the end
You were my friend
Like your shadow
No one knows you as well
As I do

You launched the assualt
With the first cannonball
My soldiers were sleeping
I know that you thought
It would never come down,
Down to the ground
'cos I was so tired
Then I'll get down
Down to the wire
It's friendly fire
