I know what you want
The magpies have come
If you know me so well
Then tell me which hand I use

Make them go
Make it go

Saw her there in a restaurant
Poppy don't go
I know your mother is a good one
But Poppy don't go
I'll take you home

Show me the things I've been missing
Show me the ways I forgot to be speaking
Show me the ways to get back to the garden
Show me the ways to get around the get around
Show me the ways to button up buttons
That have forgotten they're buttons
Well, we can't have that forgetting that

Girls, girls, what have we done
What have we done to ourselves, yes

Driving on the vine
Over clothes lines
But, officer, I saw the sign

Thought I'd been through this in nineteen nineteen
Counting the tears of ten thousand men
And gathered them all but my feet are slipping
There's something we left on the windowsill
There's something we left, yes

We'll see how brave you are
We'll see how fast you'll be running
We'll see how brave you are
Yes, Anastasia
And all your dollies have friends

Thought she deserved no less than she'd give
Well, happy birthday, her blood's on my hands
It's kind of a shame 'cause I did like that dress
It's funny the things that you find in the rain
The things that you find, yes
In the mall and in the date mines
In the knot still in her hair
On the bus I'm on my way down, on my way down
All the girls seem to be there

We'll see how brave you are, oh yes
We'll see how fast you'll be running
We'll see how brave you are
We'll see

We'll see how brave you are, oh yes
We'll see how fast you'll be running
We'll see how brave you are
Yes, Anastasia

Come along now, little darling
Come along now with me
Come along now, little darling
We'll see how brave you are
