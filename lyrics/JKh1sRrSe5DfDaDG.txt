It's just the strangest thing
I've seen your face somewhere
An early evening dream
A past-life love affair

Do you know me at all?
Do you know me at all?

In all my revelry
I thought I felt us there
A feather in my hand
A flower in your hair

Do you know me at all?
Do you know me at all?
Do you know me at all?
Do you know me at all?
