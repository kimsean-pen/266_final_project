Figure in the distance
I want you there's no resistance
Embrace me tenderly

Faceless like a shadow
Sense you when I'm alone
Embrace me tenderly

My heart's desire a burning fire
So intimate alone
A sudden kiss your pale lips
It's over now I need you

Like an apparition
Hold me with no conditions
Embrace me tenderly
