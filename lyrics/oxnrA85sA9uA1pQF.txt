Oh my my my
I'm feeling high
My moneys gone
I'm all alone
to much toooooo say
The world keeps turnin'
Oh what a day
What a day what a day

Peace and blessings manifest with every lesson learn
If your knowledge were your wealth then it would be well earned

If we were made in his image then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in god but the fear is just the same

Oh on and on and on and on (my cypher keeps moving like a rollin stone)
Whew on and on and on and on (all night till the break of dawn)
I go on and on and on and on (my cypher keeps moving like a rollin stone)
Ohh on and on and on and on (godamnit imma sing my song)

I was born under water with 3 dollars and 6 dimes
Yeah you may laugh 'cause you did not do your math

Like 1. 2.3.
Damn, yall feel that? Oh...
The world keeps turning
Oh what a day what a day what a day

The man that knows something knows that he knows nothing at all
Does it seem colder in your summer time and hotter in your fall

If we were made in his image then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in god but the fear is just the same

Oh on and on and on and on (my cypher keeps moving like a rollin stone)
On and on and on and on (all night till the break of dawn)
I go on and on and on and on (my cypher keeps moving like a rollin stone)
Ohh on and on and on and on (mad props to the guy ja bone)

I am feeling kinda hungry 'cause my high is coming down
Don't feed me yours 'cause your food does not endure
I think i need a cup of tea, the world keeps burnin'
Oh what a day, what a day what a day
Your rush into destruction 'cause you don't have nothin' left
The mothership can't save you so your ass is gonna' get left
If we were made in his image then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in god but the fear is just the same
Oh on and on and on and on (my cypher keeps moving like a rollin stone)
On and on and on and on (u cant fuk with me so jus leave me alone)
Ooh ooh wee on and on and on and on (my cypher keeps moving like a rollin stone)
On and on and on and on (. and on n on)
