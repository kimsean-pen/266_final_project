White bird in the morning
On the edge of the sun
Gold is the evening
When the daylight is done
I know that it's hard to face it
I know that it's not the same

Wildfire in the morning
With a ghost by my side
Wings made of ash now
So it's strange to confide
I know that it's hard to face it
I know that it's not the same

Is there something that I missed
Beneath the white bird
While the humming birds gathered
Gathered in the dusk
Is there something that I missed
Beneath the white bird
Am I hanging on a thread?

Stains glow in the midnight
As the fires dissipate
Maybe you were right
A fire will create
I know that it's hard to face it
I know that it's not the same

Is there something that I missed
Beneath the white bird
While the humming birds gathered
Gathered in the dusk
Is there something that I missed
Beneath the white bird
Am I hanging on a thread?
Just to buy me love
