Hey, tore away the veil of weakness
The enemy now lies beneath us
I think we're safe

Hey, won't be held down any longer
No disgrace and no dishonor
Keep us chained

There's nothing we should have to fear
It's alright
We've come to life

We'll never shed another tear
I'ts alright
We've come to life

Hey, the bulletproof are so resilient
To every fool with an opinion
They never break

Oh... by the way
We scream to find a reason
Never doubt or stop believing
And escape

There's nothing we should have to fear
It's alright
We've come to life

We'll never shed another tear
It's alright
We've come to life

(solo)

Now wicked toungues can speak
And rewrite history
But you can't keep the truth contained
And like this song was sung
Just realize we're one
And don't forget we're here to stay

There's nothing we should have to fear
It's alright
We've come to life

We'll never shed another tear
I'ts alright
We've come to life
