Ayy, let me hear that ho, Jeff
Yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah, what, yeah
Ooh, yeah, what, yeah, ooh, yeah
Started, started, ooh, started
(Uno, I killed it)

Started up on the block as a young boy
All of my diamonds they jumpin' for joy
I'ma play 'round with the stick, no joy
Baby eat me like a Almond Joy
If you write me the check, then it better not void
UnoTheAct, AKA Troy
I'm in the back of the Maybach with forties galore
Little boy better go back and get shell and the sword
The way the light hit, all my diamonds shine green and red
That's your bitch, well how I hop in her bed?
They not on no light, it's dead (Ooh)
I'm in the kitchen, I'm cookin' the stir-fry, I feel like Pharrell
My bitch is a vegan, she only eat kale
Fuck up the beat, I'm pissin' all on it, R. Kelly
My main bitch like Rocko, we ain't goin' steady
I'm sippin' the Act, it's somethin' like auntie
I'm sippin' too much, I get a bit aggy
That Draco spit fire, it turn into a dragon
Forgetting my name, they callin' me handsome
I came in the game, pickin' out addies
Gon' peel off the top of your brain like it's gravity
Makin' your body fall just like the apple
Ooh, it is Yung Shyne, you dig?
I'm talkin' ho after ho in the dick
I'm talkin' hole after hole in the head
My favorite color purple, I feel like Prince
I need a turban, I flooded again
The bullets inserted, she lookin' for prints
That ain't me, it ain't no trace, you dig?

Yeah, we out of here, nigga
Man I left the prints where I shot your stupid ass
Bitch, dig?
Nigga, he fuckin' with me, then he dead
Uhh, I'm a lion in the den
You turned your back on me then you're dead, uh
All of the things that I did, uh
I am so light, use a head, yeah
Sprinkle the cheese on your head
Money sit on my whole body, it's spread
When I die all of my seed will inherit, ooh
Diamonds jawbreakers like Ed
Need a jawbreaker like Ed, Edd, and Eddy
I get the kicks, I feel like Eddie
Told 'em, "I'll kick the cup when I'm ready"
