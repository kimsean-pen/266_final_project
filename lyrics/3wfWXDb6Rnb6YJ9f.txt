If I was poetic
Beaten regularly
Just to feed your habits
Beaten regularly

I get carried away
The day is gone
I want you to stay with me
Just stay with me
Get carried away
The day is gone
I want you to stay with me
Just stay with me

Imagine life with livid
Beaten regularly
Bodies shapes our planet
Beaten regularly

I get carried away
The day has gone
I want you to stay with me
Just stay with me
Get carried away
The day it's gone
I want you to stay with me
Just stay with me

I tell her fact the grass is greener on the other side
Is she burning deeper on the inside
Fire fueled with lies, lies, lies, lies, lies
Fire fueled with lies, lies, lies, lies, lies
I tell her fact the grass is greener on the other side
Is she burning deeper on the inside
Fire fuelled with lies, lies, lies, lies, lies
Fire fueled with lies, lies, lies, lies, lies

Get carried away
The day is gone
I want you to stay with me
Just stay with me
Get carried away
The day is gone
I want you to stay with me
Just stay with me
