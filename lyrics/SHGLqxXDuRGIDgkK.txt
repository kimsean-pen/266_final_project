In my beginning...
There was nothing...
So empty...
In the space between.

And you came in...
Turned the lights on...
And created...
What it's came to be.

Before i... pluck your wings,
Cover me, please.
Spread your wings... cover me and...

Promise this...
If i die before i wake.
Oh, promise this...
Take a time to say your grace.
On your knees you pray for me.
Promise this...
Be the last to kiss my lips.

Alouette uette uette
Alouette uette uette
Alouette uette uette
Déployer... l'aile.
Alouette uette uette
Alouette uette uette
Alouette uette uette
Plumerai... l'aile.

Though i'm walking...
Through the shadows...
You are with me...
And you comfort me.

Lay me down now...
Time for sleeping...
But before that ...
Would you restore me.

Before i... pluck your wings,
Cover me, please.
Spread your wings... cover me and...

Promise this...
If i die before i wake.
Oh, promise this...
Take a time to say your grace.
On your knees you pray for me.
Promise this...
Be the last to kiss my lips.

By a thread we're hanging on.
In the hope you don't let go
If you ever leave me.
No, i wanna go with you.

Promise this...
If i die before i wake.
Oh, promise this...
Take a time to say your grace.
On your knees you pray for me.
Promise this...
Be the last to kiss my lips.

Alouette uette uette
Alouette uette uette
Alouette uette uette
Déployer... l'aile.
Alouette uette uette
Alouette uette uette
Alouette uette uette
Plumerai... l'aile.

Alouette déployer... l'aile.
Alouette déployer... l'aile.
