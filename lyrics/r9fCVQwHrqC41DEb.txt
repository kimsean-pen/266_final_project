One day you will crack it, the enemy inside
The pig always slipping away
Winning seems so probable until you lose
The only real conclusion is the one you choose

Love is like a bullet in the heart
Stroke by stroke forever a beat apart
Love is like a bullet in the heart
Come and go, arrive when I depart

Someday you will find it, a way to say goodbye
A way to put the memories aside
It's only getting better once you cross the line
Every trace of happiness erased in time

Love is like a bullet in the heart
Stroke by stroke forever a beat apart
Love is like a bullet in the heart
Come and go, arrive when I depart

Love is like a bullet in the heart
Stroke by stroke forever a beat apart
Love is like a bullet in the heart
Come and go, arrive when I depart
