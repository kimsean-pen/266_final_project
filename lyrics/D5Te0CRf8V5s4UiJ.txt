Wake up my friend
Today life will show the answers
It's time for you to face the risk
Dark clouds will go away

They know your fears
Cause your mind can't hide connections
And disturb the harmony
For you to let it fade

Let it out, let it go
Grab the chances
You've been waiting for so long
Let it out, take control
Find your way towards
The places you belong

Wake up my friend
You're in charge of your connections
It's time for you to face the day
Dark clouds have gone away

All the past you had no harm
Or maybe never seem to care
The minute you wake up

Let it out, let it go
Grab the chances
You've been waiting for so long
Let it out, take control
Find your way towards
The places you belong

I'll wait 'till the storm of emotions
Changes it's tides
Afraid that the strong clouds of sorrow
Will haze my side and blind my eyes

Let it out, let it go
Grab the chances
You've been waiting for so long
Let it out, take control
Find your way towards
The places you belong

Let it out, let it go
Grab the chances
You've been waiting for so long
Let it out, take control
Find your way towards
The places you belong

Just wait the chances you've been waiting for so long
Please wait and find your Way towards the places you belong
