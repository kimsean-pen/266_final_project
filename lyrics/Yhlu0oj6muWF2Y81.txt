At times I've seen you from the oriel
At times I've seen you from the flagstones

At times I've seen you from the balustrade
At times I've seen you from the flagstones
Another flaw, another knothole
You can cajole
And can cajole...

At times I've seen you from the oriel
At times I've seen you from the flagstones
Another flaw, another knothole
You may cajole
You may cajole...

At times I've seen you from the balustrade
At times I've seen you from the flagstones
At times I've seen you from the balustrade
