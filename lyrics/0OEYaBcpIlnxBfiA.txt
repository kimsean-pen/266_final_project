I didn't knew the place to start
But with you all the time I feel alive
Then I fall into the white of your eyes
You're all I need!

Girl, I drive you out at sea
I didn't know how I feel
To enrude them
To enrude them (?)

There's a light somewhere awaiting
The way it spurrs another day
When you feel the day is breaking
And you now that I feel good

Girl, I drive you out at sea
I didn't know how I feel
To enrude them
To enrude them (?)
