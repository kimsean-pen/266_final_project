Kisses from you in the flames of December's Boudoir
They fill me like melons, touch me with chivalry
Truly I know, truly I know who you are
December will bear our affair

Running on streets of delight and Decembery ice
They'll see me, I'm ageless, loving you timelessly
Love colored soul, love colored soul kissing spice
Yes, my love, I take my coffee in the morning and all your love
A spoonful or so make us grow

Mama was clever, mama was clever
Said, my mama was clever, mama was clever
Said, my mama was, I said, my mama was
I said, my mama was and my
And my daddy loved her forever, forever

Kisses from you I'll remember
Kisses from you in the flames of December
Kisses from you, true they are
Kisses from you in the flames of December's Boudoir

Oh, mainstream marzipan sweet
Baking out in December heat
