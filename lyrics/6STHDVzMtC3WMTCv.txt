The minute before we play
I'm pacing, waiting anxiously
I can't wait to hit the stage
And say "hello" to jersey

And when the last note rings
And I've sung all i have to sing
Every minute I will count
Till the next show in the next town

What can I say
That can explain
All this time
I'm loving life
There's not a day
That I can't say
All this time
I'm living out my...

The feeling of screaming out
The words of the things I think about
Hearing them coming back
From the crowds mouth is perfect
And when the curtains close
I'll realize how fast time could go
Thanks for everything
You know how much this means

What can I say
That can explain
All this time
I'm loving life
There's not a day
That I can't say
All this time
I'm living out my dream

What this is to me
Is more than words could mean
I guess dreams do come true
This song itself is living proof
What this means to me
Is more than it may seem
I guess dreams do come true
This song itself is living proof
What this is to me
Is more than words could mean
I guess dreams do come true
This song itself is living proof

What can I say
That can explain
All this time
I'm loving life
There's not a day
That I can't say
All this time
I'm singing out
A song about
A dream that has come true
