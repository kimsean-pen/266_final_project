You can take the kids on Tuesday and
Every other weekend
I'll be fine with holiday arrangements on my own
Everyone's been calling me that never
Seemed to have my number before now
Honestly I'm doing fine these days

Better off as friends
Than distant lovers anyways we're
Better off as friends

Sorry that I kept my mouth shut
Now I wanna tell you how I feel
Sometimes in the morning I can almost see your eyes
I was scared you'd break my heart or
Never really love me in the end
I would trade it all if I could only say goodbye

Better off as friends
Than distant lovers anyways we're
Better off as friends
Than distant lovers
