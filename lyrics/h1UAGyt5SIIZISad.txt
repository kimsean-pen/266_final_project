I watched the smoke
As it grew darker and blew up through the roof
I watched the fed
And saw them panic as the fire grew
I saw Virginia
Get rid of Langley and its secrets too
I held your hand
And sat there knowing that we'd make it through
I saw this man
Dispose of hunger and soap operas too
I saw this field
That grew perfection, full of things you do
I saw this box
Get rid of heartache and cure cancer too
When I awoke
I sat there hoping this is what we'll do
If we can, we will leave a letter and this song for you
And we'll write once a day and float it through the sea to you
We'll regret all those things we thought of but didn't ever do
If we can, we will leave a letter and this song for you
And we'll write once a day and float it through the sea to you
We'll regret all those things we thought of but didn't ever do
When the sky seems to clear, who will then be left but a few?
Me and you
