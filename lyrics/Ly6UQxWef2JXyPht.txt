When you try to figure out
Why do we fall?
When you try to realise
How deep is our hole?

Don't forget
We live while we fly
Don't ignore
We live while we fly

Let us fly
Let us fly

When our love is so reckless
Don't let roots entrap you
When our love is immense
Choose a

Don't forget
We live while we fly
Don't ignore
We live while we fly

Let us fly
Let us fly
Let us fly
It's not our last flight
It's not our last flight
It's not our last flight
It's not our last flight
Let us fly
Let us fly
Let us fly
