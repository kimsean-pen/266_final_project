I'm holding on
To something I don't want
To hold on to
I'm reaching out
For something I can't touch
Although I know I want to

Taking in the scenery
You're the ghost in my machinery
When I was good as gold
I was good as gold
Closing off the avenues
To places that I never knew
And know I'll never know
Now I'll never go

I listen
And I hear you speak
Am I missing something?

I want to jump into the river
Feel it on my skin
But the river is rocks
And I'm already lost
And I know where I've been
Oh I know where I've been

I feel I'm caught
In a beautiful
Dream
And I'm cold
And my heart has told me
It's a dark seam

Running through the middle of
A life that's full of real love
And everything is mine
Everything is mine

I listen
And I hear you speak
Am I missing something?
I want to jump into the river
And feel it on my skin
But the river is rocks
And I'm already lost
And I know where I've been

Oh
I listen
And I hear you speak
Am I missing something?
I want to jump into the river
And feel it on my skin
But the river is rocks
And I'm already lost
And I know where I've been
Oh I know where I've been
Yes I know where I've been
