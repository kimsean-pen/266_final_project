Our friend seems to be awakening
I-Where-Where is this
Where am I?
Do not be alarmed, my friend.
(I can't make out this part)
Well thank god there's life on this island
I find it hard to believe
Few people do
(cries i cant make out this part either)
A race?
Yes
Well, then it is indeed a very great pleasure
and honor to welcome you
You're the celebrated hunter
Yes, yes, you know me?
By reputation only
