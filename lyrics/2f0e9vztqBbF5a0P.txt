3 in the morning and I'm still kinda weak again
I smoke a cigarette and play another waiting game, for you
Today is dawning and I grab my keys, I'm in the car
I know I'll find you and I know you're not very far
I'm coming for you

I'll be waiting in the back streets
Dreaming 'bout your old days
You and I
Always said I'm coming
Always said I'm coming
I'll be waiting in the back streets
Dreaming 'bout your old days
You and I
Always said I'm coming
Always said I'm coming

I know you'll roll another
I know you need the drug
I know you wanted to
I hear you pull up, baby
If you wanna be with me
I'll be waking up with you
Boy you know
I'll be on my way
Boy you know, I'll be

I'll be waiting in the back streets
Dreaming 'bout your old days
You and I
Always said I'm coming
Always said I'm coming
I'll be waiting in the back streets
Dreaming 'bout your old days
You and I
Always said I'm coming
Always said I'm coming
