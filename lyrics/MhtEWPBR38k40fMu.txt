If you want to die
Or if you want to chill
Even if you want to get high
Whatever happens - take a pill
The first I take against depression
The second is pure energy
The green one for my self-agression
Than the red one - extasy
Extasy, extasy -sy, -sy, -sy

All the left is right
All the black is white
All the fast walk slow
All the loose is tight
All the heat is snow
All the high was low
All the grief is fun
All in all, the rain is sun

Skills in pills
If the jake gets really strong
The pink one goes with boobs and blow
So I keep fucking all night long
Orange is for... I don't know
Grey one for my perfect sleep
Yellow for my need for puke
The blue one keeps my bones steep

Drink 'em too, just to be sure
All the left is right
All the black is white
All the fast walk slow
All the loose is tight
All the heat is snow
All the high was low
All the grief is fun

All in all, the rain is sun
Skills in pills
Skills in pills
Skills in pills

Skills in pills
All the left is right
All the black is white
All the fast walk slow
All the loose is tight
All the heat is snow
All the high was low
All the grief is fun

All in all, the rain is sun
The white one for my... whatever pain
In the end I start to cry
So I take the first again
I have a last one
And I hope to die
