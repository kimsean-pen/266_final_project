You should've known I love you
But I'll never say it too much
Maybe you did turn to get me
Maybe I'll never know what I done

Now I'm lost in the distance
You look at me like a stranger
'Cause how it looks right now to me
Is you are scared of the danger

I could've shown you America
All the bright lights of the universe
We could have reached the highest heights
A different place, a different life
Remember that night underneath the stars
For a minute I thought the world was ours
All you had to do was show me love

Yeah it's true you know, we're not perfect
There's a fire inside of me
It means I'll fight for the things that are worth it
If it makes me feel complete
'Cause I'm hitting rocks, and I'm taking shots
I'm prepared to lose everything I've got

Now I'm lost in the distance
You look at me like a stranger
'Cause how it looks right now to me
Nothing can save us

I could've shown you America
All the bright lights of the universe
We could've reached the highest heights
A different place, a different life
Remember that night underneath the stars
For a minute I thought the world was ours
All you had to do was show me love

Show me love, love (show me love)
Show me love, love
Show me love, love (show me, show me love)
Show me love, love
Show me love, love
Show me love, love, yeah!

I could've shown you America
All the bright lights of the universe (Universe)
We could've reached the highest heights
A different place, a different life
Remember that night underneath the stars
For a minute I thought the world was ours
All you had to do was show me love
All you had to do was show me love
