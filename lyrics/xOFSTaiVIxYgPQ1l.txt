Do you want to go
to the Plage with me?
I'm going down-down-down there;
four in the morning,
most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
Calm down-down-down
my love is calling.

It's half-past the moonlight.
Nobody would see us go.
(And I wonder)
If maybe you will look into my eyes
and you will see just what you done to me.

Time is short.
You know you live one life.
It was love at first sight.

And being by your side is the only thing on my mind
So...

And I will love your heart with mine.

Come over here with your heart
Come over here with your heart
And I will love your heart with mine.
