Look at me now
I've got no religion
Look at me now
I'm so vacant
Look at me now
I was a virgin
Look at me now
Grew up to be a whore
And I want it
I believe it

I'm a million different things
And not one you know

Hey, and our mommies are lost now
Hey, daddy's someone else
Hey, and we love the abuse
Because it makes us feel
Like we are needed
Now, but I know
I wanna disappear
Disappear
I wanna disappear
Disappear baby

I wanna die young
And sell my soul
Use up all your drugs

And make me come
Yesterday man, I was a nihilist
Now today I'm
Just too fucking bored
And I want it
I believe it
And I want it
By the time I'm old enough
I won't know anything at all

Hey and our mommies are lost now
Hey, daddy's someone else

Hey, and we love the abuse
Because it makes us feel
Like we are needed
Now, but I know
I wanna disappear
Disappear
I wanna disappear baby
Disappear

Hey and our mommies are lost now
Hey, daddy's someone else
Hey, and we love the abuse
Because it makes us feel
Like we are needed
Now, but I know
I wanna disappear
