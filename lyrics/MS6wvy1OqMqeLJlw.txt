...If you touch me, well i just think i'll scream
Cuz it's been so long, since someone challenged me.
And made me think... about the way things are...
Made me think about the way they could be.
I believe it- why? oh my...
Ooh my lord... ooh my lord... i don't even know why... but...

Oh! this feeling it is wonderful! don't you ever turn it off!
Oh! this feeling it is wonderful! don't you ever turn it off!

Feelings... why? oh my: human needs. heartbeats.
I can see it... all. by the way you smile.
I'm smiling too! i see myself in you.
I am with it! ooh man i am wired!
Ooh my lord! ooh my lord- yeah... now i really know why!

Oh! this feeling it is wonderful! don't you ever turn it off!
Oh! this feeling it is wonderful! don't you ever turn it off
