Cherish,
Cherish

So tired of broken-hearts
And losin' at this game before I start
This dance I'll take a chance in telling you

I want more than just romance
You are my destiny
I can't let go baby, can't you see?

Cupid, please take your aim at me

Cherish the thought
Of always having you here by my side
Oh baby, I cherish the joy

You keep bringing it into my life
I'm always singing it
Cherish the strength
You got the power to make me feel good

Oh baby, I perish the thought
Of ever leaving, I never would
I was never satisfied
With casual encounters, I can't hide

My need for two hearts that bleed
With burning love that's the way it's got to be
Romeo and Juliet

They never felt this way I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view

I cherish the thought
Of always having you here by my side

Oh baby, I cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
I'm always singing it
Cherish the strength

You got the power to make me feel good
Oh baby, I perish the thought
Of ever leaving, I never would

Who
You
Can't get away, I won't let you

Who
You
I could never forget to
Cherish is the word

I used to remind me of your love

Keep giving it, keep giving it to me

Boy, keep giving me all, all of your joy
Give me faith, I will always cherish you

Romeo and Juliet
They never felt this way, I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view

I cherish the thought

Of always having you here by my side
Oh baby, I cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
I'm always singing it
Cherish the strength
You got the power to make me feel good
Oh baby, I perish the thought
Of ever leaving, I never would

Cherish
Give me faith, give me joy
My boy, I will always cherish you
Cherish your strength

Keep giving it, keep giving it to me
Boy, keep giving me all, all of your joy

Cherish the love
Give me faith, give me joy
My boy, I will always cherish you
