Think we can see Mercury
Following the light
Driving to the restaurant
While my lipstick dries
Yeah, we've got next to nothing
But nothing feels so right
As stumbling through the dark with you
Comets in the sky
Baby, wherever we go
Breathe a little bit closer
Drive up, right into the storm
And fade into the night
We just know how
Holding me with tightness
A beautiful alliance
Windows roll down
Yeah, we got the timing
Right down to a science
Right down, yeah, right down to it
Right down to, right down to it
Right down
Right down to a science
Sink beneath the surface while
Reaching for the stars
The world is out of focus like
All the passing cars
Breathing in the temperature
Filtered through your scarf
It's bigger than molecular
It's everything we are
Baby, wherever we go
Breathe a little bit closer
Drive up, right into the storm
And fade into the night
We just know how
Holding me with tightness
A beautiful alliance
Windows roll down
Yeah, we got the timing
Right down to a science
Right down, yeah right down to it
Right down to, right down to it
Right down
Right down to a science
Something 'bout the way we ride
I think we might be in our prime
We're brighter than a socialite in the dark
Something 'bout the way we ride
I think we might be in our prime
We're brighter than a socialite in the dark
We just know how
Holding me with tightness
A beautiful alliance
Windows roll down
Yeah, we've got the timing
Right down to a science
Right down to a science
