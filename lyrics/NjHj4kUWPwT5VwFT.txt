Slow motion thunderstorm
Having the story unfold
In time to understand
I wanna hold her hand

Doing just what I'm told
Back to five years old
You're lost and gone gone gone
We will live far too long
We will live for so long
We waited far too long

Cool-tempered and ice age
We had so much to say
When you finally
Find a new family

Please stay stay stay with me
We won't keep them back
When we think we lack
Need some time to understand
The idea of long-lost hands
When your story unfolds

Come play a game with us
We have no-one to trust
Imagine lost at sea
Imagine using me

I'm yours to rock in place
I'd like to be at ease
The final puzzle piece
This little thing called love
The missing thing called love
A little thing called love
