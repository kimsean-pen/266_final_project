I'm dead but I'm living
I play a part I've been given
Still kicked outta heaven
I'm into nothing new
Every day is a battle
I made a deal with the Devil
And now I'm deep into trouble

So tired I was
Trying to find a better way
But every day's the same
I'm trying to break the numbness
And it's driving me insane
You could be my savior
You could be just what I need
So I lay down and
Pray for something better

Go ahead and leave me paralyzed
There's nothing left to sacrifice
In hell I'm shooting paradise
I'm ready so I'll close my eyes
This is my paradise
This is my paradise

It's gonna hurt but I'm ready
It's clear where I'm heading
Don't call paramedics
I'm into nothing new
I'll be gone in a minute
I'm not afraid to admit it
I'm so wrong but I love it

So tired I was
Trying to find a better way
But every day's the same
I'm trying to break the numbness
And it's driving me insane
You could be my savior
You could be just what I need
So I lay down and
Pray for something better

Go ahead and leave me paralyzed
There's nothing left to sacrifice
In hell I'm shooting paradise
I'm ready so I'll close my eyes
This is my paradise
This is my paradise

I made a deal with the Devil
Every day is a battle
Every day is a battle
This is my paradise
I made a deal with the Devil
Every day is a battle
Every day is a battle
This is my paradise
This is my paradise
This is my paradise
This is my paradise
