Don't walk too proud, don't talk too loud
And make it up as you go
And take whatever you're given
And leave what you think you know at the door

And she said
"You could be my kind of man
Will you do the best you can?"

And I could use a little time
I need to straighten on my mind
And I'm gonna break on, break on through
And I close my eyes and think of you

And you said
"You could be my kind of man
And will you do the best you can?"

Find a thing that you love
Find a thing you understand
Find a thing that you love
Find a thing you understand

You could be my
You could be my
You could be my kind of man
You could be my
You could be my
You might be my kind of man

Find a thing that you love
Find a thing you understand
Find a thing that you love
Find a thing you understand
