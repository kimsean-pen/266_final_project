We cannot wait until the grass has grown
To realise all our birds have flown
Old traditions can be broken down
Playing the only game in town
Tell me what, tell me what makes a valuable person?
Everyone, everyone is a unique version

We get lost, we get lost in the human crowd
We get lost, we get lost

We get lost in the crowd
Where everything's, yeah, everything's allowed
So let us stay, stay
Let us stay, stay

Our daily routine is bittersweet
As we feel more and more incomplete
Old traditions can be broken down
Losing the only game in town
Tell me why, tell me why, why don't we ignore the ban
Everyone, everyone has it on their own hands

We get lost, we get lost in the human crowd
We get lost, we get lost

We get lost in the crowd
Where everything's, yeah, everything's allowed
So let us stay, stay
Let us stay, stay

On escalators, we're standing on the right
Against the crowds, we changed the sides
We blindly understand each other
And like the story to go further

We get lost in the crowd
Where everything's, yeah, everything's allowed
So let us stay, stay
Let us stay, stay
So let us stay, stay
Let us stay, stay
So let us stay, stay
Let us stay, stay
