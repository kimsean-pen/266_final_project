Have you come here to save me?
Have you come here to waste my time again?
Ask me too many questions
Ask me too many questions I can't stand
They come out of nowhere
Put my head through a window instead of talking
Have you come here to save me?
Have you come here to waste my time again?

You'll never learn
You'll never learn how much I want to burn
I want to burn
That's the way I like it
I like it
I like all of you

Ever since I've been able
Ever since there've been weeds growing in my mind
Like a scene for the weekend
I descend into weakness [?]
I'd stop the clock
But there's some things I can't control
[?], parcel it against the wall
Against the wall

'Cause you'll never learn
You'll never learn
You'll never learn how much I want to burn
I want to burn
And you'll never know
You'll never know how much I want to go
I want to go

I stare right into the gun
Thinking of ways to remind myself
That [?]
I stare right into the gun
Thinking of ways to remind myself
That [?]

That's the way I like it
I like it
I like all of you
And that's the way I like it
I like it
I like all of you
