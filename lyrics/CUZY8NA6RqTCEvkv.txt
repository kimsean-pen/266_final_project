Line the room
Find a drink and drain the glass as fast as you can think to
The cheap perfume
In a room of people watching it intoxicates you
They start to play
Then they start to play

It shakes the floor
It stings your ears, but this is what we trade our hearing for
The crowd stands still
No one's moving, they'd just rather stand and wait until
Someone starts to move
Someone starts to move

Shake, shake, shake
It's all what you make of it, take what you will
You know, know, know your only mistake
Is if you stand still
So shake, shake, shake
It's all what you make of it, break it until
You know, know, know your only mistake
Is if you stand still
It's only up to you
It's only up to you

Forget yourself
This room is hot, but we can make it hotter with your help
I'll dance with you
We'll dance together until everybody's moving too
Everybody moves
When everybody moves

It's only up to you
It's only up to you
