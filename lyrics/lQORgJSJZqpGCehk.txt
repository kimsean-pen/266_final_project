When i first saw you
You had on blue jeans
Your eyes couldn't hide
Anything
I saw you
Breathing, oh
Saw you staring out in space

When i next saw you
You were at the party
Thought you was a queen
Oh, so flirty
I came against them

Didn't say excuse
Knew what i was doing
We looked very fine
As we were leaving
As we were making
What we were making

Saint John
You were a cool jerk
Oh, i want you
Like a kangaroo
