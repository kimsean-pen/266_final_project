Show me how to live right
Are you broken from a past life
Need a little bit of insight
Just to get me through the high tide

I've got glass stuck in my feet
From the words that drown these capital streets
Just show me how to live right
Cause I'm blinded by the bright light

Wait for me, to fall through these sheets
Like they were cracks in the pavement

Can you tell me, how you're feeling,
cause I've never felt so unappealing
Let the lights down,
fall into sleeping, cause my head is stuck in the ceiling
No, we don't know, we don't know, we don't know what we're chasing
So many beautiful places to find myself some space in

So go find yourself the light of day
To make your body feel okay
Cause I know now we're drifting away
It leaves my mind in a fragile state

And maybe one day you'll know how it feels
To lose your mind in a hospital hall
Drugged out and hyperaware

Can you tell me, how you're feeling,
cause I've never felt so unappealing
Let the lights down,
fall into sleeping, cause my head is stuck in the ceiling
No, we don't know, we don't know, we don't know what we're chasing
So many beautiful places to find myself some space in

Cause our lives are a stone just skipping through time
There's no use is searching for what you just can't find
Until the end of it all, until that final call to your family
Then we all go home to our families

We don't know, we don't know

Can you tell me, how you're feeling,
cause I've never felt so unappealing
Let the lights down,
fall into sleeping, cause my head is stuck in the ceiling
No, we don't know, we don't know
Cause our lives are a stone just skipping through time
We don't know, we don't know
There's no use is searching for what you just can't find
We don't know, we don't know
So many beautiful places
To find myself some space in
