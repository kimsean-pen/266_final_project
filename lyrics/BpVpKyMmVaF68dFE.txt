I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage gets done

Baby, baby, baby, baby, tell me why
You gotta make me, make me, make me, make me, make me cry
Oh Lord, if I told you once, I told you a thousand times
You can't knock me off my feet when I'm already on my knees

'Cause I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage gets done

Baby, baby, baby, baby, tell me how
You think you're gonna live without my love now
I don't know why you gotta keep comin' around
Creepin' up my street, but boy, you can't bother me

Now I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage gets done

You ain't gonna get to me tonight
I'll lay right here 'til it all rolls through
I ain't gonna raise my body 'til there ain't no sign
'Til there ain't no sign, 'til there ain't no sign of you

'Cause I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage is

I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage is

Now I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage gets done
Oh, don't knock on my door
I'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage gets done
