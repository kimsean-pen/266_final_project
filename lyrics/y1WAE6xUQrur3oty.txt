You call it "checking out"
What are you checking in me?
Right, sell it, what's wrong?
To review it religiously

Go backwards into the
???
You call it "checking out"
What are you checking in me?

Walking at the picture
Bridled by the circle
Start at the end of it
Dog in a mirror
And you see
You see

Walking at the picture
Bridled by the circle
Start at the end of it
Dog in a mirror
And you see
You see
You see
The dog
You see
In it
You see

Ask no one to the dog
Doesn't present what he sees
But to the vision, it's
Reflecting backwards to me

Walking at the picture
Bridled by the circle
Start at the end of it
Dog in a mirror
And you see
You see

Walking at the picture
Bridled by the circle
Start at the end of it
Dog in a mirror
And you see
You see

But you look dead inside
The dog behind the glass
Slinking about
It turned around
And looked right back
The hound it was
Quite hurt, in fact

Looking and watching
I think I saw it
Dog in a mirror

She said "I am
I am not one
But in a sense
???
The man, the boy
The girl, the dog"
And as she spoke
They saw two dogs

Looking and watching
I think I saw it
Dog in a mirror

She said "I am
I am not one
But in a sense
???
The man, the boy
The girl, the dog"
And as she spoke
They saw two dogs

Looking and watching
I think I saw a
Dog in a mirror
