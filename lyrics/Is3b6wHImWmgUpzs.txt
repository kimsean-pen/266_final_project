Ooh
I'm standing in the corner
Thinking all I want to, what I'm about to do
Should I go home?
Still sober
Should I buy me
Another glass of whine and forget about time?
Though my jeans are too tight
Don't feel like dancing
Though this light is too bright
Don't feel like shining
Tough this room is too small
I rather stand against the wall
And hope, that no one sees me
When everybody's dancing
I don't want to
When everybody's toying
I don't want to
When everybody's laughing
I don't want to
Everybody, but me
When everybody's drinking
I don't want to
When everybody's using
I don't need more
when everybody's floating
I don't want to
Everybody, but me
I get the creeps
From all the people in here
I cannot breathe
It's too crowded in here
Don't look at me
I don't wanna be seen
Touched; heared; bothered
By the fellas
Who got a look in their eye
They wanna take me home
Without knowing my name
They wanna put me on
But do they not know
Is that I'm not like the others
When everybody's dancing
I don't want to
When everybody's toying
I don't want to
When everybody's laughing
I don't want to
Everybody, but me
When everybody's drinking
I don't want to
When everybody's using
I don't need more
when everybody's floating
I don't want to
Everybody, but me

When everybody's dancing
I don't want to
When everybody's toying
I don't want to
When everybody's laughing
I don't want to
Everybody, but me
When everybody's drinking
I don't want to
When everybody's using
I don't need more
when everybody's floating
I don't want to
Everybody, but me
When everybody's dancing
I don't want to
When everybody's toying
I don't want to
When everybody's laughing
I don't need more
Everybody, but me
When everybody's drinking
I don't want to
When everybody's using
I don't want to
when everybody's floating
I don't want to
Everybody, but me
