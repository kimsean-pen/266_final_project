Something must've gone wrong in my brain
Got your chemicals all in my veins
Feeling all the highs, feeling all the pain

Let go on the wheel, it's the bullet lane
Now I'm seeing red, not thinking straight
Blurring all the lines, you intoxicate me

Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need
Yeah, you're all I need

It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll Never Be the Same

It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll Never, ever, ever Be the Same

II'll Never Be the Same
I'll Never Be the Same
I'll Never Be the Same

Sneaking in L.A. when the lights are low
Off of one touch, I could overdose
You said, "Stop playing it safe, girl"
"I wanna see you lose control"

Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need
Yeah, you're all I need

It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll Never Be the Same

It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll Never, ever, ever Be the Same

I'll Never Be the Same
I'll Never Be the Same
I'll Never Be the Same

You're in my blood
You're in my veins
You're in my head (I blame)
You're in my blood
You're in my veins
You're in my head (I'm sayin')

I'm saying it's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame (You're to blame)
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll Never Be the Same

It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll Never, ever, ever Be the Same
