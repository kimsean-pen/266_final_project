Some things you do just to see how bad they'll make you feel
Sometimes you try to freeze time 'til the slots are a blur of spinning wheels
But I am just a broken machine
And I do things that I don't really mean

Long black night
Morning frost
I'm still here
But all is lost

Speed up to the precipice and then slam on the brakes
Some people crash two or three times and then learn from their mistakes
We are the ones who don't slow down at all
And there's nobody there to catch us when we fall

Long black night
Morning frost
I'm still here
But all is lost

Feel the storm every night
Hope it passes by
Hallucinate a shady grove where Judas went to die
Unfurl the black velvet altar cloth
Draw a white chalk Baphomet
Mistreat your Altar Boys long enough and this is what you get
Sad and angry... can't learn how to behave
Still won't know how in the darkness of the grave

Long black night
Morning frost
I'm still here
But all is lost
