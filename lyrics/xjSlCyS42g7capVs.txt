We were burning in a '94 Corolla
Three hours deep into South Dakota
I was workin' on a lukewarm Coca-Cola
In the dog days of July

And my dad was a Superman stick shift driver
Stay-at-home Lois Lane beside him
Kissing to the rhythm of the billboard signs
As they went blurring by

Even when he would stop to pull over
He never took his hand off of her shoulder

You can see for miles
You can reach the dials
Sit back and smile from the front seat
You can chase the sun
You can feel the hum of the axles underneath your feet
When you're sitting shotgun
You're sittin' pretty and free
But you learn to love from the backseat

So blink one day and I'm rolling along
With a part time job
And blue pom-poms
Like every day's a knock off Mellencamp song
With his hand right on my knee

And we made the age-old prom night promise
Put the corsage right where I want it
And we found a road with nobody on it
And we didn't stop to think

And I didn't care when he killed the motor
Shut off the lights and we climbed over

You can see for miles
You can reach the dials
Sit back and smile from the front seat
You can chase the sun
You can feel the hum of the axles underneath your feet
When you're sitting shotgun
You're sittin' pretty and free
But you learn to love from the back seat

Up here I see it clear through the rear-view
It's good to take the back seat
When you get to

You can see for miles
You can reach the dials
Sit back and smile from the front seat
You can chase the sun
You can feel the hum of the axles underneath your feet
When you're sitting shotgun
You're sittin' pretty and free

But you learn to love

You can see for miles
You can reach the dials
Sit back and smile from the front seat
You can chase the sun
You can feel the hum of the axles underneath your feet
When you're sitting shotgun
You're sittin' pretty and free
But you learn to love from the back seat
We were burning in a '94 Corolla
Three hours deep into South Dakota
I was working on a lukewarm Coca-Cola
