All the blood lying on the floor
Sense the crowd expecting something more
Opened up, proudly on display
What we tried so hard to hide away

Blinding light illuminates the scene
Trying to fill the spaces in between

Arms entwined in a final pose
Narrative drawing to a close
Still remain the things we couldn't kill
In your eyes I can see it still

How we choose the framing of the scene
Hate begins to spill across the screen
Blinding light illuminates the scene
Trying to fill the spaces in between
