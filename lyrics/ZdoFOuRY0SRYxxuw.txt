Didn't really want to say goodbye
I was torn between love and pride
You kissed the child in me
Went and brought about a lady
Lovin' times always seem to change
I guess I'm part to blame
We lost our eye to eye
Day and night I only cry
Well your pushing got the best of me
A time I'd thought I'd never leave
Lift the hands that had a hold on me
Now it's time to breathe

'Cause you meant the world to me
But I had other needs
To be the girl of someone's eye
And not a type that you could love and hide
'Cause you had to take control
So I just had to go
I'm sorry how it had to be
But you meant the world to me

The love always blinded me
So disguised I couldn't see
Your eyes seemed so sincere
I didn't notice any trouble there
But you went and turned your love on me
Only wanted me lock and key
Didn't understand my thoughts and ways
Pretty soon you said I'd changed

'Cause you meant the world to me
But I had other needs
To be the girl of someone's eye
And not a type that you could love and hide
'Cause you had to take control
So I just had to go
I'm sorry how it had to be
But you meant the world to me

You meant the world to me
You meant the world
People tell you stand by your man
If it's love through thick and thin
But you wouldn't go and let it be
So now it's time for me yeah

'Cause you meant the world to me
But I had other needs
To be the girl of someone's eye
And not a type that you could love and hide
'Cause you had to take control
So I just had to go
I'm sorry how it had to be
But you meant the world to me
