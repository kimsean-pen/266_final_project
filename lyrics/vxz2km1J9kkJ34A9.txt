I've been watching you as of lately
Walking around like you're something to talk about
Like you bought into your own hype
It used to be just you and me baby
Running around like we had it all figured out
There's nothing left beyond those lies

Liiii-ie you're living such a liiii-ie!

I wanna hold you but you're untouchable
You're too caught up in your ego
I wanna love you but you're making it impossible
Wanna believe you, but you're so far gone
Did you forget where you came from?
I wanna love you but you're making it impossible

When did you decided to get shady
I wanna know the moment you changed to someone new
I hate that you become that type
Hoping all the moments of maybe
Thinking about it, there's nothing to figure out
I see you gave in without a fight!

Liiii-ie you're living such a liiii-ie!

I wanna hold you but you're untouchable
You're too caught up in your ego
I wanna love you but you're making it impossible
Wanna believe you, but you're so far gone
Did you forget where you came from?
I wanna love you but you're making it impossible

I wanna hold you but you're untouchable
You're too caught up in your ego
I wanna love you but you're making it impossible
Wanna believe you, but you're so far gone
Did you forget where you came from?
I wanna love you but you're making it impossible

I wanna hold you but you're untouchable
You're too caught up in your ego
I wanna love you but you're making it impossible
Wanna believe you, but you're so far gone
Did you forget where you came from?
I wanna love you but you're making it impossible
