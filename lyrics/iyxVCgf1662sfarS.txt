Yeah
Skirt skirt
When they see me pullin' up
All they do is show me love
Cuz they know I'm comin' through in a
Foreign foreign
Only say that I'm the man
When I make a hundred grand
Cuz you know I'm comin' through in a
Foreign foreign
Ohh
Ohh
ust doin' what I do
Yeah yeah
You know it's nothin' new
Yeah yeah
Just stayin' with the truth
Yeah yeah
So now you think it's cool
Yeah yeah
Cuz when we got no love I never saw your face and now I see that
Now people believe you try to fill my space I can't believe that
All these new friends I think I'm losin' track
But nothin's real it's only just an act
When they see me pullin' up
All they do is show me love
Cuz they know I'm comin' through in a
Foreign foreign
Only say that I'm the man
When I make a hundred grand
Cuz you know I'm comin' through in a
Foreign foreign
Ohh
Ohh
Skirt!
Ok well last week everybody at me
People that I never knew
Before are tryna dap me
Na na bitch, don't dap me
Don't you try to gas me
Never fuckin' with me when I'm whippin' in a Camry
Ok well I should stick to my own advice
Fuck around and stay broke
Wanna be with me with me all night cuz I got this cash and they don't
Don't you hit my phone
No
Tryna be a no no
Could be in my Rari, but I'm staying here at home no way
I don't go nowhere
I don't know no one
Cuz the partyin' and bullshit soundin' like no fun
Ok cuz everytime they see me
They just really wanna meet me
And these dudes ain't wanna be me
I ain't bout it
Cop the whip a year ago
The mileage is a thousand
I can't be alone no more
It's always super crowded
You'd say it'd be easy being me
But I doubt it, yeah I doubt it
When they see me pullin' up
All they do is show me love
Cuz they know I'm comin' through in a
Foreign foreign
Only say that I'm the man
When I make a hundred grand
Cuz you know I'm comin' through in a
Foreign foreign
Ohh
Ohh
