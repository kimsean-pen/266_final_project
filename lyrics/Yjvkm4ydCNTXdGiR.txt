You've got your Hell's teeth smiling at you
It keeps your brain safe, as it all eats at your face
And don't worry, we'll blur it out
And no one ever will know

This is my beautiful show
And everything is shot in slow motion
This is my beautiful show
And everything is shot in slow motion
(Slow motion)

Pump in the laughter of dead-audience applause
And teenage rape candidates, I think we got ourselves a real hit
Don't we wish that we could feel something more than hate and morbid panic?
Morbid panic
Hate and morbid panic

This is my beautiful show
And everything is shot in slow motion
This is my beautiful show
And everything is shot in slow motion

And I'm the host with Vaseline, I hide behind bulletproof glass
And I can feel your tits with my brand new camera, equipped with a flash
Fast-food-nude, I hate you all, but somehow you find me
Incredibly charming
Incredibly charming
Incredibly charming

Slow motion (Incredibly charming)
Slow motion (Incredibly charming)

This is my beautiful show
And everything is shot in slow motion
