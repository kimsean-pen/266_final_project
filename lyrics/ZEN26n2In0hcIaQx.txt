During the great war, armies ever heading east
Insurrection was avenged with merciless cruelty
Mass executions in the promised land
Black clad soldiers, reigned with an iron hand

Legion of the damned

Behind the front lines, oppression with blind hate
Senseless efforts to decapitate the partisan snake
Ever being pushed backward by the red armies overrun
The coming end, of the bloody tyranny, could not be made undone

Legion of the damned

Ruins of the reich
No absolution for the horrors you have done
Prepare a final flight
Enter service in a foreign legion
No more questions asked
While being moved to faraway fronts
Executing the oppressed
Fighting another war that cannot be won

Bereaved of all ideals
Terror is the tool of their trade
Serving their new masters
Remain forever without roots and without name

Oppressive tactics
Once learned in a war of extermination
Remorseless mercenaries
Use their skills for a colonial grave
Hunting rebels again
Lost soldiers of a damned battalion
In another guide
The death's head's remnants kill again

Bereaved of all ideals
Terror is the tool of their trade
Serving their new masters
Remain forever without roots and without name

Legion of the damned
