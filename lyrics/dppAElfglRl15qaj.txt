My life trapped in between
A whisper and a scream
A suicide machine of my own making
You let it kill my brain
Like needles in my veins
Consumed in your own grace
There's no escaping

My fix is the misery
Won't stop till the end of me
I can't feel anything

Killing my one breath at a time
Cutting you out my pair of lives
So go on and lay me down to rest
You make it painless, painless

I can't, I can't, I can't
I can't feel any pain
I can't, I can't, I can't
I drift into the gray
I've come out half awake
My soul is yours to take
A wish forever
I feel you under my skin
And lifes twisting within
Temptation always wins, it's never over

My fix is the misery
Won't stop till the end of me
I can't feel anything

Killing my one breath at a time
Cutting you out my pair of lives
So go on and lay me down to rest
You make it painless, painless

Do you know what it's like to be hollow inside my life, my grave?
Do you love me enough to finish me off?
Don't leave me here this way

(Killing me one breath at a time)
(Cutting you with my pair of lives)

So go on and lay me down to rest
You make it painless
Killing me one breath at a time
Cutting you with my pair of lives
So go on and lay me down to rest
You make it painless, painless

I can't, I can't, I can't
I can't feel any pain
I can't, I can't, I can't
I can't feel any pain
I can't, I can't, I can't
I can't feel any pain
I can't, I can't, I can't
