And I think you're from another world
And I, I couldn't love another girl
'Cause you, you make me feel like I'm intoxicated

In a room full of frozen faces
And a moment of fractured time
We eclipse in a conversation as the words, they pass us by
With you, we could be the only ones here

'Cause I think you're from another world
And I, I couldn't love another girl
'Cause you, you make me feel
Like I'm intoxicated, toxicated

To the sky, flying high, take me to the moon
Day or night, we don't have to say a word
'Cause you make me feel
Like I'm intoxicated, toxicated

Your eyes like a shot of whiskey
Warms me up like a summer night
Can you tell that I need you with me?
Let me drink you down tonight

No, I don't just want any pretty face
Wanna wake up next to yours each day
Baby, won't you be my saving grace tonight, tonight?
With you, we could be the only ones here

'Cause I think you're from another world
And I, I couldn't love another girl
'Cause you, you make me feel
Like I'm intoxicated, toxicated

To the sky, flying high, take me to the moon
Day or night, we don't have to say a word
'Cause you make me feel
Like I'm intoxicated, toxicated
...
Feel like I black out, pass out every time that we touch
And if it hurts in the morning then it must be love
I want your heart, baby, straight no chaser
I wanna feel it in my head when I wake up, when I wake up

And I think you're from another world
And I, I couldn't love another girl
'Cause you, you make me feel
Like I'm intoxicated, toxicated

To the sky, flying high, take me to the moon
Day or night, we don't have to say a word
'Cause you make me feel
Like I'm intoxicated, toxicated

To the sky, flying high, take me to the moon
Day or night, we don't have to say a word
'Cause you make me feel
Like I'm intoxicated, toxicated

And I think you're from another world
And I, I couldn't love another girl
'Cause you, you make me feel
Like I'm intoxicated
