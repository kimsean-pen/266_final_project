Boy we've had a real good time and
I wish you the best on your way, eh eh
I didn't mean to hurt you
I never thought we'd fall out of place, eh eh, hay hay

I have something that I love long-long
But my friends keep ah-telling me that something's wrong
Then I met someone
and eh, there's nothing else I can say

(Eh, Eh) There's nothing else I can say
(Eh, Eh) I wish he never looked at me that way
(Eh, Eh) There's nothing else I can say
(Eh, Eh)

Not that I don't care about you
Just that things got so complica- eh eh
I met somebody cute and funny
Got each other and that's funny, eh eh

I have something that I love long-long
But my friends keep ah-telling me that something's wrong
Then I met someone
and eh, There's nothing else I can say

(Eh, Eh) There's nothing else I can say
(Eh, Eh) I wish he never looked at me that way
(Eh, Eh) There's nothing else I can say
(Eh, Eh)

(Eh, Eh)
I have something that I love long-long
But my friends keep ah-telling me that something's wrong
Then I met someone
and eh, There's nothing else I can say
(Eh, Eh)

(Eh, Eh) There's nothing else I can say
(Eh, Eh) Wish he never looked at me that way
(Eh, Eh) There's nothing else I can say
(Eh, Eh) Wish he never looked at me that way
(Eh, Eh) There's nothing else I can say

Cherry-Cherry boom-boom
All I can say is Eh, Eh
