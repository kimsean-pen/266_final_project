My riding partner used to work for a living
He take the backseat of all that he was given
He let you rise and take the fall
He was my favorite friend of all

My old muchacho
Love to dress for each occasion
Without that rocket shell taking me in the right direction
Those crooked eyes that knew it all
Was my favorite friend of all
He was my favorite friend of all
He's wearing jean on jean
Cut him some slack, Fox
Pressed to the corner of the scene
Just here to take stock
He'll take the chain
He'll take the ball
He was my favorite friend of all
He was my favorite friend of all
He was my favorite friend of all
