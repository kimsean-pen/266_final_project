"If visible identification is not possible,
The pathologist may be able to take
Fingerprints from the body until decay sets in...
Things become more complicated"

Intenacious, intersecting
Reaving fats from corporal griskin
Culled... for sodden gelatine brayed
Skeletal groats triturated, desinently
Exsiccated, sere glutenate brewed
For frivolous solvent abuse...

Derogate coarse remains
For glue to dry
Despoiled marrow razed

...a truculent shambles so severe...

Extravated bone - as adhesive incarnate
A pellucid quietus - nocuosly I create

Corporal glue, breathe in the fumes
Mucilage vapours, toxic fumes to savour

(lead: glue stiffing by w.g. steer)

Comminuted remains
As gum to dry
A lissom gel so glazed

...a truculent shambolic affair...

The exsanguine esprit - shorted as snuff
Rheumic oils forever - bonded together as gum

Human glue, choke on the fumes
Noxious vapours, slaughterous labour...
