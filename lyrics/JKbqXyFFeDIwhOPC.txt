Have you found
Your way around the down and out?
I know it must seem long so long
I'm still trying to keep this time from running out
Head down always moving on and on and on
I never heard this warning
Another early morning
Takes me wakes me into
If you can manage me
I'll try to manage you
But lately that's all I ever do
I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared I pass the boats and the kingdome
I'm not scared
I'll never tell you the secrets i'm holding
I know these things must bore you
But i can't find another way
I'll never tell you the secrets i'm holding
I love this leash that holds me when i try to run away
I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared I pass the boats and the kingdome
I'm not scared
I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared I pass the boats and the kingdome
I'm not scared
I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared I pass the boats and the kingdome
I'm not scared
I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared I pass the boats and the kingdome
I'm not scared
I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared I pass the boats and the kingdome
I'm not scared
I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared I pass the boats and the kingdome
I'm not scared
I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared I pass the boats and the kingdome
I'm not scared
I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared I pass the boats and the kingdome
I'm not scared
I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared I pass the boats and the kingdome
I'm not scared
