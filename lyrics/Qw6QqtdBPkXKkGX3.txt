I. I woke up
The God of fire woke me up
At the edge of burning ground
I'm, I'm damned
To put out the fire
My hand is a trap for that fire

It won't surprise me in my dream
My dream wakes me up, instantly
Without a word my hand is a trap
Trap for that fire

For that fire!

I, I drown it with water
I kill it on the spot
It won't have time to run far
It won't get away from me

It won't surprise me in my dream
My dream wakes me up, instantly
Without a word my hand is a trap
Trap for that fire

It won't surprise me in my dream
My dream wakes me up, instantly
Without a word my hand is a trap
Trap for that fire

Ooh, a trap, a trap
For that fire!

My hand is a trap
A trap, a trap
For that fire

(For that fire!)

A trap, a trap, a trap
For that fire

(My hand is a.)

Trap, a trap, a trap
For that fire
