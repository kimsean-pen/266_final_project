I'm
Losing ground
Well you know how this world can beat you down
And I'm
Made of clay
I fear I'm the only one who thinks this way
I'm always falling down the same hill
bamboo puncturing the skin
and nothing comes bleeding out of me
just like a waterfall I'm drowning in.
Two feet below the surface I can still make out your wavy face
and if I could just reach you maybe I could leave this place.

I do not want this
I do not want this
I do not want this I do not want this
Don't you tell me how I feel

Don't you tell me how I feel
Don't you tell me how I feel
You don't know just how I feel

And I
Stay inside my bed
I have lived so many lives all in my head
And don't
Tell me that you care
There really isn't anything now
Is there?
You would know, wouldn't you?
You extend your hand to those who suffer,
to those who know what it really feels like,
to those who've had a taste, like that means something.
And oh so sick I am.
And maybe I don't have a choice,
and maybe that is all I have,
and maybe this is a cry for help.
I do not want this
I do not want this
I do not want this
I do not want this
Don't you tell me how I feel

Don't you tell me how I feel
Don't you tell me how I feel
You don't know just how I feel

I wanna know everything
I wanna be everywhere
I wanna fuck everyone in the world
I wanna do something that matters

I wanna know everything
I wanna be everywhere
I wanna fuck everyone in the world
I wanna do something
That matters

I wanna know everything
I wanna be everywhere
I wanna fuck everyone in the world
I wanna do something... that matters

I want to know everything.
I want to be everywhere.
I want to fuck everyone in the world
I want to do something that matters

I want to know everything.
I want to be everywhere.
I want to fuck everyone in the world
I want to do something that matters
