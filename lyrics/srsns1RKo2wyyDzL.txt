And it's warm like a soft kiss
Well you're someone that I'm gonna miss
Because all of the loving in the world
Well I wouldnt mind loving that girl
No I wouldnt mind loving that girl

Cause reckless is fun when you're not the one that gets hurt x2

Put all my thoughts into the jar
and hide them away somewhere so far
And I thought the things I thought I knew
And you could fit right in there too x2

Cause reckless is fun when you're not the one that gets hurt x2
Cause when your hearts in your mouth
Your guts on the ground
And you've got nothing left from the chest down
And something is nothing cause what you had
was so much, so much better than that

Cause reckless is fun when you're not the one that gets hurt
And reckless is fun when you're not the one that gets hurt
And when your hearts in your mouth
your guts on the ground
And you've got nothing left from the chest down
and something is nothing cause what you had
was so much, so much better than that
