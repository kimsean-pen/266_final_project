There goes the sun

Just trying to find your way anywhere
But you've come to find you're alone
It's getting dark and you've lost your way
I haven't let you go as long as you know that

I'm losing what's left of my dignity
But I'll fight till the end for her heart
I'll never give up for what's possibly
For better or worse this love must be cursed

You just try to keep your head down
But you come to find that trust has come and gone
Everyone out there is listening
But you don't care at all and you're probably glad to know

I'm losing what's left of my dignity
But I'll fight till the end for her heart
I'll never give up for what's possibly
For better or worse this love must be cursed

You already let it pass through your lips
You can't take it back now
(It's already out)
You already let it pass through your lips
Can't take it back
(It's already out)

You already let it pass through your lips
You can't take it back now
(It's already out)
You already let it pass through your lips
You can't take it back now

I'm losing what's left of my dignity
But I'll fight till the end for her heart
I'll never give up for what's possibly
For better or worse this love must be cursed

I'm holding on to her
(This love must be cursed)
I'm holding on to her
(This love must be cursed)
I'm holding on

I'm afraid to say she never made it home
Couldn't keep her head on
She was so close
I'm afraid to say she never made it home

I'm afraid to say she never made it home
I'm afraid to say she never made it home
I'm afraid to say she never made it home
(Couldn't keep her head on)
Afraid to say she never made it home
