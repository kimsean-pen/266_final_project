Time was drifting, this rock had got to roll
So, I hit the road and made my getaway
Restless feeling, really got a hold
I started searching for a better way

And I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
But, I couldn't see the light, no, I couldn't see the light
I kept on looking for a way to take me through the night
Couldn't get it right, couldn't get it right

Philly Fever, made me feel alright
But, I must admit it got the best of me
Gettin' down so deep I could've drowned
Now, I can't get back the way I used to be

And I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
But, I couldn't see the light, no, I couldn't see the light
I kept on looking for a way to take me through the night
Couldn't get it right, couldn't get it right

New York City took me with the tide
And, I nearly died from hospitality
Left me stranded, took away my pride
Just another no account fatality

And I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
But, I couldn't see the light, no, I couldn't see the light
I kept on looking for a way to take me through the night
Couldn't get it right, couldn't get it right

I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
But, I couldn't see the light, no, I couldn't see the light
I kept on looking for a way to take me through the night
Couldn't get it right, couldn't get it right

I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
But, I couldn't see the light, no, I couldn't see the light
I kept on looking for a way to take me through the night
Couldn't get it right, couldn't get it right

I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
But, I couldn't see the light, no, I couldn't see the light
I kept on looking for a way to take me through the night
Couldn't get it right, couldn't get it right
