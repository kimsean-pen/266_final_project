Never cry on your own, never cry
But when you cry
Just try and find some perfect stranger with the tissue shoulders on

'Cos I know the score and it's hard when it's her your crying for

Never go on your own, never go
But when you go
Just try to find someone or other with the GPS turned on

'Cos I've been here before and it's hard when it's her your crying for

So take her and lay her in the ground
I'll be here waiting so patiently not making a song

Don't want to lie alone

I'll find another with a shoestring loveheart thong
