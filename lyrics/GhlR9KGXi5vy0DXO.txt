I could go and ask her first.
You could try, but it won't work.
I don't want my cover blown.
I should do this on my own.

And the night has gone
And I'm walking home
But I still don't;
I still don't know,
And the night has gone,
And I'm walking home.
But I still don't.
I still don't know.

If only,
One of us
Had the guts tonight.

It's so hard to find the silent type.
Someone shy who won't spread the hype.
Your so cold; your in this crowd.
I am on my way now,

And the night has gone,
And I'm walking home.
But I still don't;
I still don't know,
And the night has gone,
And I'm walking home.
But I still don't.
I still don't know.

If only,
One of us
Had the guts tonight.
What if,
One of us
Had the guts tonight?
