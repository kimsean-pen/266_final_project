When the sun goes to bed
That's the time you raise your head
That's your lot in life, Lalena
Can't blame ya, Lalena

Arty tart, la de da
Can your heart get much sadder?
That's your lot in life, Lalena
Can't blame ya, oh Lalena

Run your hands through your hair
Paint your face with despair
That's your lot in life, Lalena
Can't blame ya, oh Lalena

Run your hands through your hair
Paint your face, paint your face up with despair
That's your lot in life, Lalena
I can't blame ya, oh Lalena

When the sun goes to bed
That's the time you raise your head
That's your lot in life, Lalena
I can't blame ya, Lalena

Arty tart, oh so la de da
Can your part ever get, ever get much sadder?
That's your lot in life, Lalena
I can't blame ya, oh Lalena

Oh Lalena
No no no, Lalena
I can't blame ya, I can't blame ya, Lalena
Oh Lalena
So la de da
Lalena
