It was just my mistake thinking you cared
It was just my mistake thinking you'd be there
That you'd be by my side and that you wouldn't lie
My mistake

It was just my false hope thinking we'd last, yeah
It was just my false hope, forgot all your past
All those girls you denied
Smashed up hearts hung out to dry

I know it's wrong, hanging on too long
I know it's wrong, hanging on too long
But I need to move on, hanging on too long

I was a fool for you right from the start, yeah
I was a fool for you hoping for a spark
For some kind of sign that you would be mine

I know it's wrong, I do, hanging on too long
And I know it's wrong, hanging on too long

My heart was clutching to one fair right
My head was pumping, it could put up a fight

I know it's wrong, hanging on too long
And I know it's wrong, hanging on too long
And I need to move on, I'm hanging on too long

I know it's wrong, hanging on too long
And I know it's wrong, hanging on too long
