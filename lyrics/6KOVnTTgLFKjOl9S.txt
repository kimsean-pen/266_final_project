As the night arrives the day concedes her crown,
In the dying light the shadows grow.
When the world is dark and still without a sound,
That which was hidden is shown.

Tears of sorrow flood the land.
All that has been shall be again.
The dead will rise and the living must depart.
What if all you've seen are lies
When the veil is from your eyes
And you face the infinite with fear in your heart?

The wind blows cold as the days begin to wane,
The lord of the dead assumes his throne,
When men have gone and only ghosts remain
That which was secret is known.

Tears of sorrow flood the land.
All that has been shall be again,
And the moon shines over the sea as the mother of man.
Somewhere seven ships collide,
Seven sailors lose their lives,
But their voyage continues on the other side.

Asherah, saw below,
Queen of heaven, she who knows.
