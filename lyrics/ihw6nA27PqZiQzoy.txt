One, two, three...

I remember the frozen sun
Take me back, take me back, take me
What a gift for the chosen one
Heart attack, no way back
Oh, the madness gone
I've got nowhere left that I can run
I could sleep for days
Maybe when I find just such a mysterious place

So tell me something
Show me the world that I'm touching
Before you take me whole
I said just one thing
All that I could say before I'm gone

So tell me something
Show me the future
Where the different side can make it better now
I take this with me
I get to know
I get to know

Everything that I've got was lost
What a world, what a world, what a
One hit and I'm taking off
Find that girl, find that girl

Oh, call me and say
'I just get excited by the change'
Come on the thirtieth day
Picture falling faster and with nothing left to say

So tell me something
Show me the world I'm touching
Before you take me whole
I said just one thing
All that I could said before I gone

So tell me something
Show me the future
Where the different side can make it better now
I take this with me
I get to know
I get to know

If I'd imagine it all
Did nothing happen at all?
I was chosen to fall
Through time inside my mind

And I'm never gonna let you go
No matter how they're trying to find me
I'm just a man
On the truck

I've been expecting something

So tell me something
Show me the world
I'm searching for you take me home
I said just one thing
All that I could said before I gone

Three, two, one...
