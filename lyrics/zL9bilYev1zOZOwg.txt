Save yourself a lot of agony
Go on, do what you do best
Shake your head
And walk away from me
Go on, do what you do best

And when I said that you were something else
I didn't mean it as a compliment
So what, go on

You run away too easily
And always take it out on me
So what, go on

If you bend too far
It's gonna hurt a bit
Go on, do what you do best
You won't just break my heart
You're gonna murder it
Go on, do what you do best

And when I said that you were something else
I didn't mean it as a compliment
So what, go on

You run away too easily
And always take it out on me
So what, go on

Okay, you've gone and set it off
And everything you do is soaking in
Slowly soaking in

I bet you think you're better off
I never should have let you get too close to this
What was i supposed to think?

And when I said that you were something else
I didn't mean it as a compliment
So what, go on

You run away too easily
And always take it out on me
So what, go on
So what, go on
