Outside the window they're singing
Inside the doorway there's me
Endlessly thinking and working
In my room

Outside the window they're singing
Inside the doorway there's me
Endlessly thinking and working
In my room

I can't share the joy they're sharing
Can't share the wine that they drink
I stand by the window just watching
From my room

Outside the window they're laughing
Inside the doorway I weep
Constantly thinking and working
In my room

In my room
