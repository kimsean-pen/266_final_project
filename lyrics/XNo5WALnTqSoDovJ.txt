I never felt nothing in the world like this before (noo)
Now I'm missing you and I'm wishing you would come back through my door (yeah)
Oooooo
Why did you have to go? (go)
You could have let me know (know)
So now I'm all alone (ooo)

Girl you could have stayed but you wouldn't give me a chance (no)
With you not around it's a little bit more than I can stand (yeah)
Oooooo
And all my tears they (they)
Keep running down my face (face)
Why did you turn away?

So why does your pride make you run and hide?
Are you that afraid of me?
But I know it's a lie
What you keep inside
This is not how you want it to be

So baby I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life

Baby I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do
I'll wait for you

Been a long time since you called me
(How could you forget about me)
You gotta be feeling crazy (crazy)
Oooooo

How can you walk away (way)
Everything stays the same (same)
I just can't do it baby (no)

What will it take to make you come back (home)
Girl I told you what it is and it just ain't like that (no)
Noooo

Why can't you look at me (me)
You're still in love with me (me)
Don't leave me crying.

Baby why can't we just
Just start over again
Get it back to the way it was...
If you give me a chance
I can love you right
But you're telling me it won't be enough

So baby I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life

Baby I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do
I'll wait for you

So why does your pride make you run & hide
Are you that afraid of me?
But I know it's a lie
What you're keeping inside
That is not how you want it to be

Baby I will wait for you (for you)
Oooooo
Baby I will wait for you
If it's the last thing I do

Baby I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life

Baby I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do
I'll wait for you

I'll Be Waiting...
