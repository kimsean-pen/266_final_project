Save yourself now
You've got a mind all of your own
So break these walls down
We've all been waiting for the show

Gotta stay alive
Gotta stay alive

You're running in circles
To find the way out
You're not gonna find it
Until you've let it all burn down
If only you'd tried to make it right
You're not gonna make it
Not gonna make it alive

Where's your pride now?
It's all been said and done before
Erase your self-doubt
Why don't you get up off the floor

You're running in circles
To find the way out
You're not gonna find it
Until you've let it all burn down
If only you'd tried to make it right
You're not gonna make it
Not gonna make it alive

Gotta stay alive
You've got to stay
And survive

You're running in circles
To find the way out
You're not gonna find it
Until you've let it all burn down
If only you'd tried to make it right
You're not gonna make it
Not gonna make it alive
