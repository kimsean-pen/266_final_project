Know it sounds funny but I just can't stand the pain
Girl, I'm leavin' you tomorrow
Seems to me, girl, you know I've done all I can
You see, I begged, stole, and I borrowed

Yeah, ooh

That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning

Why in the world would anybody put chains on me?
Yeah
I've paid my dues to make it
Everybody wants me to be what they want me to be
I'm not happy when I try to fake it
No, ooh

That's why I'm easy, yeah
I'm easy like Sunday morning, yeah
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning

I wanna be high, so high
I wanna be free to know the things I do are right
I wanna be free, just me, whoa, babe, ah
Oooh

That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning, yeah
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning, whoa
'Cause I'm easy, whoo
Easy like Sunday morning, yeah
'Cause I'm easy, yeah
I'm easy like Sunday morning, whoa
