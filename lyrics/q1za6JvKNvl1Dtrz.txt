As if, as if
As if, as if

As if, as if, as if it matters
Innit, innit 'what happens, happens'?
As if as if's were enough

Is it, is it a fit of angst we see
Is it a bit the fear of failure
It is as if we gave up

It's like, it's like we lack nothing
Kind, kind and so mind numbing
It's kind of like losing touch

And I can't find me inside
I hide in an empty smile
And I have left me behind
In words that aren't mine

The scene, the scene - the screen's endless
In style in style... check out my new stress
I've seen this stream â€“ did I ditto that?
Like I really care!

Pretend pretend life's a bluescreen
upload dreams in your B-movie
its kinda like life - but not

And I can't find me inside
I hide in an empty smile
And I have left me behind
In words that aren't mine
