Her bones will ache
Her mouth will shake
And as the passion dies
Her magic heart will break
She'll fly to France
Cause theres no chance
No hope for Cinderella
Come September

Everything wrong
Gonna be alright
Come September

Her violet sky
Will need to cry
Cause if it doesn't rain
Then everything will die
She needs to heal
She needs to feel
Something more than tender
Come September

Everything wrong
Gonna be alright
Come September

The souls that burn
Will twist and turn
and find you in the dark
No matter where you run
She's made her mark
But lost her spark
And what she's pushing for
She can't remember

Everything wrong
Gonna be alright
Come September

Her eyes surrender, her cry a
crying shame
Coming undone is she ever gonna
feel the same

She will run
She's gonna drink the sun
Shining just for you
Instead of everyone
And so it goes
She'll stand alone
And try not to remember
Come September

Everything wrong
Gonna be alright
Come September
