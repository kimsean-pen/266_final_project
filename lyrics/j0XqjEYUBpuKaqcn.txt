An angel told that Jah is here in our prayers each day
Regardless of our faith
And even though so many of his children stray
Our good deeds are never wasted
And so believe it, are not just special in your own way
And your existence is a must
Within the heart of Jah everyone has their space
Even the dogs have a purpose

Oh looks are deceiving you
Now don't you underrate yourselves, no
Oh looks are deceiving you
Now don't you underrate yourselves

Then I said "Angel, the world is such an ugly state
How will we make it out?
Man and woman seem to suddenly have lost their way
Our little hearts are full of hatred
Now we tap it that we're way in over our heads
And we're in dire need of help
'Cause there's no way that we can right all these wrongs by yourselves
The end's a lonely path"

Man, looks are deceiving you
Now don't you underrate yourselves
Oh looks are deceiving you
Now don't you underrate yourselves, no
Oh looks are deceiving mankind
So feel good about yourself
Oh looks are deceiving mankind
Always be proud of yourself

Then I said " Angel, the people are consumed by sin
And we no longer love His lights
A generation has all but forgotten 'bout him
Rebels without a cause"
The Angel told me the judgement we face is writ
Only if we choose to believe it
Jah love us all too much to ever let us burn in hell
They had to keep that one a secret

Oh looks are deceiving you
Now don't you underrate yourselves, no
Oh looks are deceiving mankind
Feel good about
Oh looks are deceiving you
Now don't you underrate yourself, no
Oh looks are deceiving you
Always be proud of yourself
'Cause looks are deceiving you
Don't you underrate yourselves, no
Oh looks are deceiving you
Please feel good about yourself, yeah
Oh looks are deceiving you
Now don't you underrate yourself, no
Oh looks are deceiving mankind
Don't you underrate
Don't you give up on yourself
Please don't you give up on yourselves, no
Now don't you give up on yourself
Oh don't you give up on
Oh
