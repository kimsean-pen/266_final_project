I gotta run to keep from hidin'
I'm bound to keep on ridin'
And I got one more silver dollar
And I ain't gonna let 'em catch me, no
I ain't gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider

Well, these ain't my clothes I'm wearin'
And this old road goes on forever
And I got one more silver dollar
And I ain't gonna let 'em catch me, no
I ain't gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider

Well, I've gone by the point of carin'
Some old bed, I'll soon be sharin'
And I got one more silver dollar
And I ain't gonna let 'em catch me, no
I ain't gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider

I ain't gonna let 'em catch me, no
I ain't gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider
I ain't gonna let 'em catch me, no
I ain't gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider

I ain't gonna let 'em catch me, no
I ain't gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider
I ain't gonna let 'em catch me, no
I ain't gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider
