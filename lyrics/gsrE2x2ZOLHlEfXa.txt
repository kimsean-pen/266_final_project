Somebody tell me
What has this man got
He makes me feel
What I don't wanna feel

Somebody tell me
What has this man got
He makes me give
What I don't wanna give

On solid ground
I feel myself sinkin' fast
I grab a hold
But I don't think it's gonna last

I'm slowly losin' my ground
Slowly sinkin' down
Trapped by this thing they call love
Oh baby

(Hooked on this thing called love)
(Hooked on this thing called love)

Somebody tell me
What has this man got
He makes me cry
Lord, I don't wanna cry

Somebody tell me
What has this man got
He makes me lie
When I don't wanna lie

He calls me up
And I tell 'em to say that I'm not in
Then I cry all night
If he doesn't call again

I'm slowly losin' my ground
Slowly sinkin' down
Trapped by this thing they call love
Oh baby

- Interlude -

I'm slowly losin' my ground
Slowly sinkin' down
Trapped by this thing they call love
Oh baby

I'm trapped
(Hooked on this thing called love)
I can't help myself

I'm hooked on you baby
(Hooked on this thing called love)
I just can't help it

I can never be happy
(Hooked on this thing called love)
When there's no one else

Oh baby, I love you...
