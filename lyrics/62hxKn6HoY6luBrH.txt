See passed out layers of the past
A bundle of scars
Discard the shape at last

Trauma bonded
All doors open on a high speed crash
For whom
What we should have been?

Do we heal?
Do we heal?
Do we heal?

Can't turn around brawler
Gotta watch my step
Faller get along

A dream
To seal
Do we heal
Do we heal?
Do we?
Heal

Heal
Fear used to be near here
Heal

Say it again

Fear used to be near here
But won't anymore

I have no fear
I have no fear
