They say love keeps on growing
But that's something I've felt I've always known
Cause it wouldn't matter where you're going
Cause where you are is where I wanna go

I know why the heart gets lonely
Every time you give your love away
And if you think that you are only
A shadow in the wind
Rolling 'round but when you go
and let somebody in they might fade away

Tell me why the road keeps turning
When everything you want is straight ahead
And every thing I thought worth learning
Is forgotten when I see your face instead

I know why the heart gets lonely
Every time you give your love away
And if you think that you are only
A shadow in the wind
Rolling 'round but when you go
and let somebody in they might fade away

All you say is so overrated
Holding on to yesterday
Along the way, it can get too complicated to stay

I know why the heart gets lonely
Every time you give your love away
And if you think that you are only
A shadow in the wind
You better think again

I know why the heart gets lonely
Every time you give your love away
And if you think that you are only
Feathers in the wind
Blowing around but when
You let somebody in they might fade away

Fade away
