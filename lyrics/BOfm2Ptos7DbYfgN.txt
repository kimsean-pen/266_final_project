The flowers swing in the empty
A strange wind crosses the room
My body shaked by a shiver smells another bloom
A shadow of ghost is dancing
Staring from my window
You're facing me to clear my dreams
To climb the walls of sorrow

We'll move in the old bed
We'll move in pain
In millions of whispers and waves
We'll share the air

Now thousands of spectres are dancing
Another breeze has come
I put my faith inside their hands to dance with them all night long
Another wake, the light that shines plays tricks that sing in my head
Carrying away the innocence of time that makes no sense

We'll move in the old bed
We'll move in pain
In millions of whispers and waves
We'll share the air

Now their shades have disappeared
And tears roll down in fears

I call their names
The sky is red
My hands are red
Like blood...
