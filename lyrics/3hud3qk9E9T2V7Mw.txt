Oh, drop your laundry and slam the door
I want your love, so give me more
I'm a beggar but I don't want a dime, ahh

Oh baby, baby, it's fuck time
You know I really want to make you mine
Oh baby, baby, it's fuck time
There's nothing left to say, yeah

Take a look into my eyes
I wanna hold you 'til you're paralyzed

Oh, Amanda Jones, your holy grace
I want to choke you 'til you're blue in the face
Have dirty thoughts and a dirty mind, ahh

Oh baby, baby, it's fuck time
You know I really want to make you mine
Oh baby, baby, it's fuck time
There's nothing left to say, yeah

Take a look into my eyes
I wanna hold you 'til you're paralyzed
Take a look into my eyes
I wanna hold you 'til you're paralyzed
Take a look into my eyes
I wanna hold you 'til you're paralyzed
