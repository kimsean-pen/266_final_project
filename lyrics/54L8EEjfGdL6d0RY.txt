Last night I slept with a strange man.
He was older than me, he had thick busy hands.
We crawled inside his bed, and we took off our clothes.
We said nothing to each other.
We said nothing to each other.
We said nothing to each other.
We said nothing to each other.

This house is our house too.
This house is our house too.
This is our house too. (x 11)
This is our house.
