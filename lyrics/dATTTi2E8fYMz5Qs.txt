In God's house
I do wait
For my love on our wedding day
Dewy eyes and lashes long
For my love
Then I'm feeling something's wrong

What's this I see
My baby's hand on the wheel
What's this I see
Fire
Fire

Through this veil
They can't see
The fog of death
Unveil me
Where's my boy
Why would he lie
And leave me here
In this Church to cry

What's this I see
My baby died on the beach
What's this I see
Fire
Fire
Fire
Fire
