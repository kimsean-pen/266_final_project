Lookin' at the world
There's not a star and it's intimidatin'
And I'm standing here
Yeah I'm standing here and I'm just waiting
Waiting til the time is right
Is what we're sayin'
I don't know how it will go
I don't think I wanna know
You're my only friend
You're my only friend

Oooh Ooooh
Have you ever thought of walking away
Oooh Ooooh
'Cause I've been thinking about it every day
Ooooh ooooh
I could leave and know there's nothing to end
Oooh oooh

You're my only friend

Don't wanna talk about it
I feel like throwin' up just thinkin' bout it
Don't wanna talk about it
Livin' like a dream but it isn't what I was expectin'
Heard them yesterday and watch them feelin' disconnected
Waitin 'til the time is right
When I see Him
I just know I have to go
Just writin' to let you know

When you're only friend
You're my only friend

Oooh Ooooh
Have you ever thought of walking away
Oooh Ooooh
'Cause I've been thinking about it every day
Ooooh ooooh
I could leave and know there's nothing to end
Oooh oooh
You're my only friend
