Hello to the good times
When did you leave me behind
I didn't have enough time
For this stuff, on my mind

Now when you're trying to rewind
You're caught up in a never-ending circle
we play it again
And again and again
Just give me more
Just the same, just the same
We play it again
Caught up in a never-ending circle
Play it again

You're friends with the madness
Gotta give it some more loving
Cause you can hear what the answers
You won't let it begin

Now when you're trying to rewind
You're caught up in a never-ending circle
We play it again
And again and again
Just give me more
Just the same, just the same
We play it again
Caught up in a never-ending circle
Play it again
I play it again

I play it again
I play it again and again and again
We play it again

Again and again
I just play it again and again
I play it again and again
I play it again and again

I play it again and again
I play it again and again
And again and again
And again and again
And again and again
And again and again
And again and again
And again and again
And again and again
And again and again
And again and again
And again and again
And again and again
I play it again and again
And again and again
And again
