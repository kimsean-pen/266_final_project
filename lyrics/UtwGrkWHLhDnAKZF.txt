So pleased if you're getting your way,
If you're coming unstuck then daddy's gonna step in and pay,
Look best in your party dress,
And you're gonna impress all the players
When they know you're not getting your way,
Daddy will pay,

So proud when you get up and dance,
Move centre on stage,
Make sure that everybody can see,
Exposures maximum
Subconsciously,
When you know that you are sitting on top of the tree,
Getting your way.

Getting, getting, getting, getting
Getting, getting, getting, getting your way

You feel warm,
You feel safe,
You're number one,
When daddy pays,
You're satisfied,
When you feel you're getting your way.

Leave school,
Reality check,
And you've gotta find work now daddy is refusing to pay,
Just like all the terrible kids,
Not returning your calls,
'cos jealousy is something that sticks for an age,
Now daddy won't pay.

Getting, getting, getting, getting
Getting, getting, getting, getting your way

You feel warm,
You feel safe,
You're number one,
When daddy pays,
You're satisfied,
When you feel you're getting your way.

You feel warm,
You feel safe,
You're number one,
When daddy pays,
You feel warm,
You feel safe,
You're number one,
When daddy pays,
You're satisfied,
When you feel you're getting your way.
