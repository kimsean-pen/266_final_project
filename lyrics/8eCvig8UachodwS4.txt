I don't wanna live a lie but I gotta be with you

Give me a moment to realise it
Lying beside you seems so unreal
Still can't believe it, I've tried to fight it
I was afraid to feel what I feel

In this cold, cold life
I need a torch, a guiding light
And you that guy, you're the one
Could you be mine? Mine for all times
Would you be mine? Mine for all times

I will live a double life, just to be with you
It ain't clear and it ain't right, but it's what I gotta do
I will live a double life, secret and taboo
I don't wanna live a lie but I gotta be with you

I will live a double life, just to be with you
It ain't clear and it ain't right, but it's what I gotta do
I will live a double life, secret and taboo
I don't wanna live a lie but I gotta be with you (I gotta be with you)

In this cold, cold life
I need a torch, a guiding light
And you that guy, you're the one
Could you be mine? Mine for all times

I will live a double life, just to be with you
It ain't clear and it ain't right, but it's what I gotta do
I will live a double life, secret and taboo
I don't wanna live a lie but I gotta be with you

I will live a double life, just to be with you
It ain't clear and it ain't right, but it's what I gotta do
I will live a double life, secret and taboo
I don't wanna live a lie but I gotta be with you

You want, gotta be with you
I gotta be with you... I gotta be with you
You want, gotta be with you
I gotta be with you... I gotta be with you

I will live a double life, just to be with you
It ain't clear and it ain't right, but it's what I gotta do
I will live a double life, secret and taboo
I don't wanna live a lie but I gotta be with you

I will live a double life, just to be with you
It ain't clear and it ain't right, but it's what I gotta do
I will live a double life, secret and taboo
I don't wanna live a lie but I gotta be with you (be with you)
