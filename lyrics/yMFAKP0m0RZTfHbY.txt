I care about all the things you read
I stare waiting for something to change
And I want to pretend
That I won in the end

Feels right to be right
Feels right, it's all fine
Feels right to be right
Feels right, it's all fine

You and me can make it forever
'Cuz I can call you up
And you can say my name
'Cuz I've been talking about you
To everyone so they know we're fine
You and me can make it forever
'Cuz I can call you up
And you can say my name
'Cuz I've been talking about you
To everyone so they know we're fine
I care about all the things you read
I stare waiting for something to change
And I want to pretend
That I won in the end

Feels right to be right
Feels right, it's all fine
Feels right to be right
Feels right, it's all fine
Feels right to be right
Feels right, it's all fine
Feels right to be right
Feels right, it's all fine

You and me can make it forever
'Cuz I can call you up
And you can say my name
'Cuz I've been talking about you
To everyone so they know we're fine
You and me can make it forever
'Cuz I can call you up
And you can say my name
'Cuz I've been talking about you
To everyone so they know we're fine
You and me can make it forever
'Cuz I can call you up
And you can say my name
'Cuz I've been talking about you
To everyone so they know we're fine
