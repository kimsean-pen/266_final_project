Weight is coming off
Soaring high
Pleading you to stay
Come Alive

Say you mean it, seal it up
Say you wanna try
Say you haven't had enough
Say you wanna

Once you get the feeling
It wants you back for more
Says it's gonna heal again
You won't make the call
One step back, you're leaving it
But now it's moving on
Why won't you believe in it
Until it's gone

Fading out the light
Softly saying
Get it out my mind
Anyway

Say you mean it, seal it up
Say you wanna try,
Say you haven't had enough
Say you wanna

Once you get the feeling
It wants you back for more
It says it's gonna heal again
You won't make the call
One step back, you're leaving it
Now it's moving on
Why won't you believe in it
Until it's gone

Once you get the feel of it
It wants you back for more
Now it get's ethereal
Feet ain't on the floor
One step, like you needed it
Jumping at the wall
Why won't you believe in it
Until it's gone

You gave to me
All I know
I will stay here
I will not go

You gave to me
All I know
I will stay here
I will not go

Running out
You can make it through it
Running out
you can make it all

Once you get the feeling
It wants you back for more
It says it's gonna heal again
You won't make the call
One step back, you're leaving it
Now it's moving on
Why won't you believe in it
Until it's gone

Once you get the feel of it
It wants you back for more
Now it get's ethereal
Feet ain't on the floor
One step, like you needed it
Jumping at the wall
Why won't you believe in it
Until it's gone
