Now as I near defeat
I've got to let this be
I couldn't see that light you said you saw in me
Like a child so young, unaware of what's going on
Unable to grasp where I belong
These times I spent asking, "Where did I go wrong?"

Here I stand, helpless again. Caught up in words I wished I said. I gave up, you're giving in
I'll never get back what I once had then

I gave up. I'm giving in

I'll resent all of the things
That drag me down
Will next time be more lucid?
More lucid than now?
Please help me out somehow
Don't drag me down

Please help me out somehow
More lucid than now
All they gave me, was a second hand (second hand)
Writing letters of things I can't comprehend

Here I stand
Helpless again
