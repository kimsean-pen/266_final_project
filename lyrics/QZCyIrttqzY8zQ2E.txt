Untangled, finally
Put it all out on the table
Understand me, do you understand?
Untangled, finally
Put it all out on the table
Understand me, do you understand?

Waiting at my doorway
You do, you do believe it's time
Trouble, oh won't you knock on?
Any door but mine

The blue blouse that I wore
Hardly fits anymore
Understand you, I don't understand
The heat that we both felt
Faded out like a cigarette
Understand it, I don't understand

Waiting at my doorway
You do, you do believe it's time
Trouble, oh won't you knock on?
Any door but mine

Understand me, do you understand?
Understand me, do you understand?
Understand me, do you understand?
(Understand me, do you understand?)
Understand me, do you understand?
(Understand me, do you understand?)
Understand me, do you understand?
(Understand me, do you understand?)
Understand me, do you understand?
(Understand me, do you understand?)
Understand me, do you understand?
(Understand me, do you understand?)
Understand me, do you understand?
(Understand me, do you understand?)

(Understand me, do you?)
(Understand me, do you?)
(Understand me, do you?)
Understand me, do you understand?
