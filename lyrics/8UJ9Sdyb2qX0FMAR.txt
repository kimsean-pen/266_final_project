Óir thug sé ordú dá aingil i do thaobh:
Tú a chosaint i do shlite go léir
Iompróidh siad thú lena lámha
Sula mbuailfeá do chos in aghaidh cloiche
Satlóidh tú ar an leon is ar an nathair
Gheobhaidh tú de chosa sa leon óg is sa dragan

Young woman with a drink in her hand
She like to listen to rock and roll
She moves with the music
'Cause it never gets old
It's the only thing
That never gets old

Young man in a quiet place
Got a hawk on his arm
He loves that bird
Never does no harm
It's the only thing
That never can do no harm
Must be the only thing
That never can do no harm

Sun setting on the avenue
Everyone walks by
They live their life under cover
Being blind
Being blind
Being blind
