River's strong you can't swim inside it
We could string some lights up the hill beside it
Tonight the moon's so bright
You could drive with your headlights out
'Cause a little bit of summer's what the whole year's all about

You look fine, fine, fine
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line
Get higher and higher
Say, say, say
Ain't it been some kind of day
You and me been catching on
Like a wildfire

Don't get up just to get another
You can drink from mine
We can't leave each other
We can dance with the dead
You can rest your head
On my shoulder if you want to
Get older with me
'Cause a little bit of summer makes a lot of history

And you look fine, fine, fine
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line
Get higher and higher
Say, say, say
Ain't it been some kind of day
You and me been catchin' on
Like a wildfire

I got a rock from the river in my medicine bag
Magpie feather in his medicine bag

Say, say, say
Ain't it been some kind of day
You and me been catchin' on
Like a wildfire
