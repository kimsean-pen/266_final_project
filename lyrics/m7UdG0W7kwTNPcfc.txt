(I'm an angel with a shotgun, shotgun, shotgun.
An angel with a shotgun, shotgun, shotgun.)

Get out your guns, battle's begun.
Are you a saint or a sinner?
If love's a fight then I shall die
With my heart on a trigger.

They say before you start a war
You better know what you're fighting for.
Well, baby, you are all that I adore.
If love is what you need, a soldier I will be.

I'm an angel with a shotgun
Fighting 'til the war's won
I don't care if heaven won't take me back.
I'll throw away my faith, babe, just to keep you safe.
Don't you know you're everything I have?
And I wanna live, not just survive tonight.

Sometimes to win, you've got to sin.
Don't mean I'm not a believer.
And major Tom will sing along.
Yeah, they still say I'm a dreamer.

They say before you start a war
You better know what you're fighting for.
Well, baby, you are all that I adore.
If love is what you need, a soldier I will be.

I'm an angel with a shotgun
Fighting 'til the war's won
I don't care if heaven won't take me back.
I'll throw away my faith, babe, just to keep you safe.
Don't you know you're everything I have?
And I wanna live, not just survive tonight.

Oh, oh whoa whoa oh whoa x3

I'm an angel with a shotgun.
Fighting 'til the war's won.
I don't care if heaven won't take me back.

I'm an angel with a shotgun
Fighting 'til the war's won
I don't care if heaven won't take me back.
I'll throw away my faith, babe, just to keep you safe.
Don't you know you're everything I have?
(I'm an angel with a shotgun)
And I want to live, not just survive
(Live, not just survive)
And I'm gonna hide, hide, hide my wings tonight.
They say before you start a war
You better know what you're fighting for.
Well, baby, you are all that I adore.
If love is what you need, a soldier I will be.
