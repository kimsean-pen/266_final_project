I said if I'm in luck I just might get picked up
I said I'm fishin' trick and you can call it what you want then
I said I'm wigglin' my fanny (Ha ha Oh Man Get down)
I want you dancing I'm a doin' it doin' it (Get down)
This is my night out

So all you lady haters don't be cruel to me
Don't you crush my velvet don't you ruffle my feathers neither
I said I'm crazy I'm Wild
I said I'm nasty
Say you will for a little while
Say you will
Say you will

I said if I'm in luck I just might get picked up
