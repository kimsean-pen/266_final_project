Junk of the heart is junk of my mind
So hard to leave you all alone
We get so drunk that we can hardly see
What used to that, but you aren't me baby

See I notice nothing makes you shatter, no no
You're a lover of the wild and a joker of the heart
But are you mine?

I wanna make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive
Let me make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive at night
I wanna make you happy
If you're a good girl tonight.

You seem to be sunk, life is no race
When I'm not happy I'm in disgrace
So I spend time guessing on you, oh
You're a lover of the wild and a joker of the heart

But are you mine?

I wanna make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive
Let me make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive at night
I wanna make you happy
If you're a good girl tonight.

Still I notice nothing makes you shatter, no no
You're a lover of the wild and a joker of the heart.
And are you mine?

I wanna make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive
Let me make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive at night
I wanna make you happy
If you're a good girl tonight.
