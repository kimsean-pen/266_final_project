Hear the cries of discontent
Visions of indifference
People's voices now lament
Leaders stand in disarray
Very few know what to say
Using laws of yesterday

Open your eyes and ears
Their lies are fantasies
Question how this can be...
They hide so you don't see
It's right under your feet
The ones who do believe –
Notorious

Fathers turn in shallow graves
Forgotten actions of the brave
Gonna all end up as slaves
Arrogant pride in glory days
Olde England yesterdays
Open gates as death invades

Open your eyes and ears
Their lies are fantasies
Question how this can be...
They hide so you don't see
It's right under your feet
The ones who do believe –
Notorious

Gather round and listen well
Edgar has a tale to tell
All your children going to hell
It started as for pity's sake
Like the story of the snake
Dystopia not integrate

Open your eyes and ears
Their lies are fantasies
Question how this can be...
They hide so you don't see
It's right under your feet
The ones who do believe –
Notorious
