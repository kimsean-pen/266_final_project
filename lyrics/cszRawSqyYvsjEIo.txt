Cold and emotionless
An unwanted traveller
Destroyer of homes and planets
No force on earth can stop it
Fear of death's never felt so alive

The end of the world is coming, end of the world
Ancient wrath has risen to its throne
The end of the world is coming, end of the world
Searing flames and killers made of stone

Brightness of a million fires
Shines upon the doomsday choirs
A spectacle beyond all dreams
Deafens the cries and screams
Feast your eyes on the cursed gift from God

The end of the world is coming, end of the world
Ancient wrath has risen to its throne
The end of the world is coming, end of the world
Searing flames and killers made of stone

End of green, end of blue
Watch us die, sister Moon
We are to be extinct by this doom
Welcome to damnation

Helpless and bound to die
No point to run and hide
Engulfed by the dark dominion
Souls vaporize into oblivion
A woeful fate for this island in space

The end of the world is coming, end of the world
Ancient wrath has risen to its throne
The end of the world is coming, end of the world
Searing flames and killers made of stone

End of the world
