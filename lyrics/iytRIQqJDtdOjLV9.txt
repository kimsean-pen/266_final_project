First time we met
Face became etched
In my mind

You were the sun
I was the one who worshiped you
My hands were your guns
Your eyes were my muse

And I knew you could never love me
I had so much sorrow inside
You could never reach
But can I still keep a place in your heart

You broke my heart
You promised me the moon and stars
I fell for your dreams, I fell for your lies
There was no other way, you know I tried

And I knew you could never love me
I had so much sorrow inside
You could never reach
But can I still keep a place in your heart

There is something I want you to know
I think you know exactly what it is
I didn't want to save you, I didn't want to save you
I set our house on fire to watch it burn
But I couldn't just leave you

And I knew you could never love me
I had so much sorrow inside
You could never reach

But I'll ask you this
Will you still miss me?
I still miss you
Will you love me?
Yes, I love you

Planes fill the sky
We'll both die tonight, we'll both die tonight
Hands from the sky swat us away like flies
As we follow the lights
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Planes fill the sky
We'll both die tonight, we'll both die tonight
Hands from the sky swat us away like flies
As we follow the lights
We'll both die tonight, we'll both die tonight
We'll both die tonight, we'll both die tonight
We'll both die tonight as we follow the lights
Follow the lights
This union, a battle fought and lost
This union was not about the cause
This union was never about love
