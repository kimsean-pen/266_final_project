Just like a baby,
Sometimes I cry.
Just like a baby,
I can feel it when
You lie to me.
Just like a baby
I'll try if I can
Just like a baby,
Just like a baby
Inside a little big man
Everything is new.
Just like a baby,
Come to find out
I'm a whole lot like
You, too
Just like a baby
See the thing it's growin',
Just like a baby
Blowin '.
