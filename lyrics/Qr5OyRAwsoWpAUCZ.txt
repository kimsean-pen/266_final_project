Oh ya
I'll never stop

I don't know,
Do you believe me,
After all that's said and done
All the lies,
How I regret them baby now.
I am the loser,
And you're shining like the sun,
Tell me why can't I still be the one?

All right

I will never stop
Until you're mine
I can wait forever till the end of time
Cuz my heart is in your hands
Don't you understand?
I'll never stop

I'll never stop

How could I ever?
When my heart is in your hands?
And I know,
Baby there is not turning back
They say that I'm crazy
And I kind of understand
How I wish for this nightmare to end

Oh yes

I will never stop
Until you're mine
I can wait forever till the end of time
Cuz my heart is in your hands
Don't you understand?
I'll never stop.

Yeah, hey.

I'll never stop.

Ooooo
Ooooo
Ooooo

Do you believe me
When my heart is in your hands
Don't you understand?

I'll never stop {I will never stop}
Till the end of time {I will wait forever}
My heart is in your hands {My heart is in your hands}

I'll never stop
Until you're mine
I can wait forever till the end of time
Cuz my heart is in your hands
Don't you understand?
I'll never stop
I'll never stop
