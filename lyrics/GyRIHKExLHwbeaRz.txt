Oh, from within the mountain heart
You never see the day again

On a winters night I heard a sound so cruel
And by the moon I saw that it was you
Dancing on the wind you fled from all you knew
So run amok my child

Won't you hear me when I say
The song it seemed to play
From within the mountain heart
You never see the day again

When the autumn came the trees all seemed to die
But by the moon I saw they were alive
Dancing on the wind the snow fall told a lie
A little piece of mind

You might say that I was wrong
But I swear I heard the song
From within the mountain heart
You never see the day again

Oh, from within the mountain heart
You never see the day again
Never again
From within the mountain heart
You never see the day again
Oh, from within the mountain heart

When i see the morning sun
I no longer need to run
I know the song will come
From within the mountain heart

Dancing on the wind
You fled from all you knew
And by the moon I saw that it was you
So run amok my child
Run amok my child
You might say that I was wrong
But I swear I heard the song
Won't you hear me when i say
That the song it seemed to play
I no longer need to run
Cause when I see the morning sun
Yes I know the song will come
From within
From within the mountain heart
A little piece of mind
Snowfall told a lie
A little piece of mind
Snowfall told a lie
Never see the day again

Oh, from within the mountain heart
