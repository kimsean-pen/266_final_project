You can preach it, and you can teach it
Do you believe it
(But do you believe it)
You can preach it, and you can teach it
Do you believe it (Ooh, yeah)
You can preach it, and you can teach it
Do you believe it
(Do you believe it)
You can preach it, and you can teach it
Do you believe it (Oh, ooh)

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa-oh
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa-oh

I got my back up to the edge of the room
You left me nowhere to hide
Your words of venom spitting salt in my wounds
'Cause I'm paralyzed

Feet in the clouds, my head on the ground
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
I'm begging you please
Just take me down to the river to drown

You can preach it, and you can teach it
But do you believe it
(Take me down to the river to drown)
'Cause you can preach it, and you can teach it
But do you believe it

It's getting clearer to me every day
You leave a wake of destruction
All this talk
Is still gonna leave me with nothing

Feet in the clouds, my head on the ground
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
I'm begging you please
Just take me down to the river to drown

You can preach it, and you can teach it
But do you believe it
(Take me down to the river to drown)
'Cause you can preach it, and you can teach it
But do you believe it
(Just take me down to the river to drown)
You can preach it, and you can teach it
But do you believe it
(Just take me down to the river to drown)
'Cause you can preach it, and you can teach it
But do you believe it
(Just take me down to the river)

You never think about the crazy things you always say
I wonder if you even notice that you stand in my way
Won't feel when you feel it out
Just take me down to the river to drown

You can preach it, and you can teach it
But do you believe it
(Take me down to the river to drown)
'Cause you can preach it, and you can teach it
But do you believe it
(Just take me down to the river to drown)
You can preach it, and you can teach it
But do you believe it
(Take me down to the river to drown)
'Cause you can preach it, and you can teach it
But do you believe it
(Take me down to the river to drown)

You can preach it, and you can teach it
But do you believe it
(Take me down to the river to drown)
'Cause you can preach it, and you can teach it
But do you believe it
(Hey! Take me down to the river to drown)
You can preach it, and you can teach it
But do you believe it
(Oh, take me down to the river to drown)
'Cause you can preach it, and you can teach it
But do you believe it
(Oh, just take me down to the river)

Down to the river, down to the river
Down to the river, down to the river
Down to the river, down to the river
Down to the river

Down to the river, down to the river
Down to the river, down to the river
Down to the river, down to the river
Down to the river
