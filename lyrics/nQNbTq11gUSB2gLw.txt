Last night I heard this politician
Talking 'bout his brand new mission
Liked his plans but they came undone
When it got around to God and guns

I don't know how he grew up
But it sure wasn't down at the huntin' club
'Cause if it was he'd understand
Just a little bit more about the working man

God and guns keep us strong
That's what this country was founded on
Well we might as well give up and run
If we let 'em take our God and guns

Out here in my neck of the woods
Where God is great and guns are good
You really can't know that much about 'em
If you think we're better off without 'em

Oh there was a time we ain't forgot
You could rest all night with your doors unlocked
But there ain't nobody safe no more so
You say your prayers and you
THANK THE LORD
For the peace-maker in the dresser drawer

God and guns keep us strong
That's what this country was founded on
Well we might as well give up and run
If we let 'em take our God and guns
Yeah we might as well give up and run
If we let em take our God and guns
YEAH!
GOD AND GUNS!

Don't let 'em take
Don't you let 'em take
Don't let 'em take our God and guns

God and guns keep us strong
That's what this country, Lord, was founded on
Well we might as well give up and run
If we let 'em take our God and guns
