Girl I wanna be your one and only
I wanna be more than just a homie
I hope that you wanna get to know me
Baby hit me up if you get lonely
Girl I wanna be your one and only
I wanna be more than just a homie
I hope that you wanna get to know me
Baby hit me up if you get lonely

Show me what you want 'cause I know I want you
I know I'm not confused, my feelings here are true
I hope you think of me the way I think of you
On gloomy days like these, wishing you were next to me
When I'm feeling puzzled, girl, you put me back together
And if never is forever, then let's always be together
If something just ain't right it will be because you left

So let's make this life our best, I'll take care of all the rest

Girl I wanna be your one and only
I wanna be more than just a homie
I hope that you wanna get to know me
Baby hit me up if you get lonely
Girl I wanna be your one and only
I wanna be more than just a homie

I hope that you wanna get to know me
Baby hit me up if you get lonely

I hope you know you're my desire
I hope you know you're the one
I hope you know that I think about you when I see the sun
I hope you know you're my desire
I hope you know you're the one
I hope you know that think about you when I see the sun
I hope you know you're my desire
I hope you know you're the one
I hope you know that think about you when I see the sun

I hope you know you're my desire
I hope you know you're the one
I hope you know that think about you when I see the sun

Girl I wanna be your one and only
I wanna be more than just a homie
I hope that you wanna get to know me
Baby hit me up if you get lonely
Girl I wanna be your one and only
I wanna be more than just a homie
I hope that you wanna get to know me
Baby hit me up if you get lonely
