The human blood is far too thin
The life in it much too fragile
DNA code twisted into form
An ancient dream will now be reborn

Demonic! Science!
A high price for a passion so intense
Demonic! Science!
This world no longer makes any sense

Save the best - strip away the rest
Every weakness, every bleakness will be erased
New flesh for a new world!
Men in white clothes performing the ultimate test

This is the era - this is the time
A new dawn arrives...
