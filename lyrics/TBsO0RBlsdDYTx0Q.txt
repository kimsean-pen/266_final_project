Light the match
Set my body ablaze
There's no more good to find
When you find yourself in a cloudy haze
Pressure pushes its way inside
No room to move nowhere to hide

Divide the strength within myself
The way of life has pushed me to a living hell
Endless misery, lack of sympathy
I don't trust the voice inside of me

I always put myself out there
But it always ends the same
If words are words
Then I'm the only one to blame

Backbreaker
Sever all the ties sever all the lies
Backbreaker
Reach inside and see if I'm living

Light the match
Set my body ablaze
There's no more good to find
When you find yourself in a cloudy haze
Every good intention turns to dust
Where do your loyalties lie
When there's no one to trust

Backbreaker
Sever all the ties sever all the lies
Backbreaker
Reach inside and see if I'm living
Backbreaker
Sever all the ties sever all the lies
Backbreaker
Every fear consuming

Oh

The world is watching
Their eyes are piercing me now
I feel the pressure
This will be my end
