Black boots on the streets
Can you hear them?
As the sky turns red once more
Breathe in now
Hollow Is their soul
And they'll follow
How their hateful seed it grows
Breathe out now

How we hold each other tight
As we slip into the night

Darkness in their fingers
As they linger
From the front page to their flags
Marching in now
Oh must we go
Is our cause
Is the cost of blood so low?
Breathe out now

How we hold each other tight
As we slip into the night
But I can't speak
I can't breathe
I can't sleep
No, I can't think at all
I can't be what you need
No, I can't think at all
At all
At all
At all
No, I can't sleep at all

Can't speak
Can't breathe
Can't sleep
No can't think at all
Can't be what you need
Can't speak

How we hold each other tight
As we slip into the night
But I can't speak
I can't breathe
I can't sleep
No, I can't think at all
I can't be what you need
No, I can't think at all
At all
At all
At all
No, I can't sleep at all
