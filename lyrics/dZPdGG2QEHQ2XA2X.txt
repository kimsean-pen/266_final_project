This is just an ordinary day
Wipe the insecurities away
I can see that the darkness will erode
Looking out the corner of my eye
I can see that the sunshine will explode
Far across the desert in the sky

Beautiful girl
Won't you be my inspiration?
Beautiful girl
Don't you throw your love around

What in the world, what in the world
Could ever come between us?
Beautiful girl, beautiful girl
I'll never let you down, won't let you down

This is the beginning of your day
Life is more intricate than it seems
Always be yourself along the way
Living through the spirit of your dreams

Beautiful girl
Won't you be my inspiration?
Beautiful girl
Don't you throw your love around

What in the world, what in the world
Could ever come between us?
Beautiful girl, beautiful girl
I'll never let you down, won't let you down, down

Won't let you down, down
Down, down
Won't let you down, down

Beautiful girl
Won't you be my inspiration?
Beautiful girl
Don't you throw your love around

What in the world, what in the world
Could ever come between us?
Beautiful girl, beautiful girl
I'll never let you down, won't let you down, down
