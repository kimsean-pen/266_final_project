Warsaw Rise!

Do you remember when
When the Nazis forced their rule on Poland
1939 and the allies turned away

From the underground
Rose a hope of freedom as a whisper
City in despair, but they never lost their faith

Women, men and children fight
They were dying side by side
And the blood they shed upon the streets
Was a sacrifice willingly paid

Warsaw, city at war
Voices from underground, whispers of freedom
1944, help that never came
Calling Warsaw, city at war
Voices from underground, whispers of freedom
Rise up and hear the call
History calling to you
Warszawo, walcz!

Spirit, soul and heart
In accordance with the old traditions
1944, still the Allies turn away
Fighting street to street
In a time of hope and desperation
Did it on their own and they never lost their faith

Women, men and children fight
They were dying side by side
And the blood they shed upon the streets
Was a sacrifice willingly paid

Warsaw, city at war
Voices from underground, whispers of freedom
1944, help that never came
Calling Warsaw, city at war
Voices from underground, whispers of freedom
Rise up and hear the call
History calling to you
Warszawo, walcz!

All the streetlights in the city
Broken many years ago
Break the curfew
Hide in sewers Warsaw, it's time to rise now

All the streetlights in the city
Broken many years ago
Break the curfew
Hide in sewers Warsaw, it's time to rise now

Warsaw, city at war
Voices from underground, whispers of freedom
1944, help that never came
Calling Warsaw, city at war
Voices from underground, whispers of freedom
Rise up and hear the call
History calling to you
Warszawo, walcz!
