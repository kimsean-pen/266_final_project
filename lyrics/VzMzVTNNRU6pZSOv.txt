silence grows and you're all i know
eyes are closed, ill see your smile, your love
thinking
this is what
it could be
knowing
it is all
it would be

in the night
when you see
what i see
in the night when you feel
what i mean
you're my knight
and my dream
and my only sight
oh you
oh you
stay true

playing with
the thought
of some birds
flying where we'd owe your love (?)
placing it in my whole world
lets pretend
i am all
you know

in the night
when you see
what i see
in the night when you feel
what i mean
you're my knight
and my dream
and my only sight
oh you
oh you
stay true

in the night
when you see
what i see
in the night when you feel
what i mean
you're my knight
my dream
and my only sight
oh you
oh you
stay true
oh you
oh you
stay true

ohh...
