Light all the torches, wake up the king
The smoke you've ignored is a flame you can't contain
We circle the walls and claw at the dirt
We growl from our guts and howl until it hurts

I told her "come with me and I can take you from this place now
Somewhere these roads don't go, a place that we can start again"
I grabbed her hand and pulled her close
She looked at me and said "hey I don't even know your name"

But I'm ready to explode
Like a tiger in a circus
Cracking whips are all I know
I'm searching for a sense of purpose

We are the wolves at the gate
Our numbers growing everyday
But you can't fight us all, no
You can't fight
We are the wolves at the wall
We break in like a waterfall
But you can't fight us all, no
You can't fight

The water is breaching the walls of the dam
Trampling dreams in a rush to higher land

Are you ready to explode?
Like a tiger in a circus?
This cage is all I've ever known
But now you've given me a purpose

We are the wolves at the gate
Our numbers growing everyday
But you can't fight us all, no
You can't fight
We are the wolves at the wall
We break in like a waterfall
But you can't fight us all, no
And we are not going away

Roaming in numbers and chasing the scent
Circling in for the kill
And you are the winter, the long discontent
We won't stop 'til we've had our fill

Roaming in numbers and chasing the scent
Circling in for the kill
And you are the winter, the long discontent
We won't stop 'til we've had our fill
We are the wolves
We are the wolves
We are the wolves
