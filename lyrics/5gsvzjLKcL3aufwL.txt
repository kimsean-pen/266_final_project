Hold on to me now
You're not invincible
If you let your guard down
I'm not gonna let fall

Hold on to me now
I'm not invincible
Drowning in self doubt
Can you pull my demons out?

Oh, it's all on the table
Oh, nothing to hide

Hold on to me now
You're not invincible
I'll carry you somehow
The weight of you makes me strong

Hold on to me now
I'm not invincible
They're dragging me under
But I'm breathing you in and out

Oh, it's all on the table
Oh, nothing to hide
Oh, guardian angel
Oh, help me keep you alive

You're not invincible
If you let your guard down
I'm not gonna let you fall

Hold on to me now
You're not invincible
I'll carry you somehow
The weight of you makes me strong
