I just want to be
Out of this box already
Somewhere I can breathe.

But can - i really leave?
Everything that's dear to me
To find what might not be?

I
Know there must be more.
Walking down this darkened hall
Holes pitting the floor.

Have
I chosen the right door?
Now that I've decided can
I even make the walk?

Am I able
Everything I need?
Misgivings and worries.

Am I able
Everything I need?
Misgivings and worries.

Am I able
Everything I need?
Misgivings and worries.

Am I able
Everything I need?
Misgivings and worries.

Am I able
Everything I need?
Misgivings and worries.

Am I able
Everything I need?
Misgivings and worries.

I just want to be
Out of this box already
Somewhere I can breathe.

But can - i really leave?
Everything that's dear to me
To find what might not be?
