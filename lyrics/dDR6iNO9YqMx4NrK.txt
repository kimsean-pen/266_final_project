You stole everything you got from me
My soul
My Heart and I just gave you the key
Let go of me before I start to believe

Love hurts, Love hurts, Love hurts

So close to the end of my rope
Swallowing so many words I'm about to choke
It's like you're living out some twisted fantasy
Where you're the king of the world ruling over me

I stay up all night
You call
We fight
Red eyes til daylight but we're still okay right?
We've got our issues
God knows I do
But when it comes to you
God knows what I've been through

You stole everything you got from me
My soul
My Heart and I just gave you the key
Let go of me before I start to believe

Love hurts, Love hurts, Love hurts

Stone cold
Like a knife to the throat
Falling on so many swords that I'm full of holes
It's like my heart's carved out
Split right in two
Already lost myself and now I'm losing you

I stay up all night
You call
We fight
Red eyes til daylight but I'm still to blame right?
I'm still to blame right?

You stole everything you got from me
My soul
My Heart and I just gave you the key
Let go of me before I start to believe

Love hurts, Love hurts, Love hurts
Love hurts, Love hurts, Love hurts

You stole everything you got from me
My soul
My Heart and I just gave you the key
Let go of me before I start to believe

Love hurts, Love hurts, Love hurts

So close to the end of my rope
Swallowing so many words I'm about to choke
It's like you're living out some twisted fantasy
Where you're the king of the world ruling over me

You stole everything you got from me
My soul
My Heart and I just gave you the key
Let go of me before I start to believe

Love hurts, Love hurts, Love hurts
Yeah, Love hurts, Love hurts
Yeah, Love hurts, Love hurts
