Yes I've been hung around
My eyes like a satellite
Since you've been gone
Yes I've been left to hang
But I'm coming too
Don't worry too long
It'll be headed back to you

I've been hung around now for so long
And it's fine if I'm in the way of other days
Call it a surprise if I can't see out the back of my head
Let it die, let it die

I got up from the get go
Can't shake it off
I knew from the start
Yes I knew
That there ain't no more
I'd gone back to
Since I've been hung around

I've been hung around now for so long
And it's fine if I'm in the way of other days
Call it a surprise if I can't see out the back of my head
Let it die, let it die

Since you've been hung around
You ain't gonna get back down
If you had potential
It's underneath the ground
So now look around
What have we found?
This is all a daydream
And the candle light just drowned
