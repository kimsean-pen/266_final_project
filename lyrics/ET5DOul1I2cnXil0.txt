One above
Heaven under
One for thirst
One for hunger

I am the dark
You are the thunder
I am the doubt
You are the wonder

Since time began
You've been the long time man
And mama ain't it grand
That I get to be the fool again
I get to be the fool again

I close my eyes and I see you dancing
Do you see me when you close yours too
'Cause every kiss that I don't give
Is another life that I don't live
And mama it's so much sweeter when I do, hey

Love
Is light ignited
And everyone
Is invited

But if you don't ever try
How can you give it one more try
If you don't ever ever try
How can you give it one more try
Give it one more try

I close my eyes and I see you dancing
Do you see me when you close yours too
'Cause every kiss that we don't give is another life that we don't live
And mama it's so much sweeter when we do
Rats
