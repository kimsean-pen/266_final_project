I can't hide nothing anymore
She comes through the windows and up from the floor
And I'm breathing only second-hand air
Second-hand vibrations rattle in my head
When I can't take the pain of being on my own

I'm a snake in the woodpile
I'm an unravelled flag
I'm a burned downed house
I'm the thing you'll never get back
But swear to God you could
I'm a dying star in your junkyard heart
And I'm some kid puking outside of some bar
Or maybe I'm just crazy
Well, that's alright with me
You and me and the stars sinking in Mercury
Oh, sinking in Mercury

I'm a snake in the woodpile
I'm an unravelled flag
I'm a burned downed house
I'm the thing you'll never get back
But swear to God you could
I'm a dying star in your junkyard heart
And I'm some kid puking outside of some bar
Or maybe I'm just crazy
Well, that's alright with me
You and me and the stars sinking in Mercury
Oh, I'm sinking in Mercury
Yeah

Oh, sinking in Mercury
Oh, sinking in Mercury
