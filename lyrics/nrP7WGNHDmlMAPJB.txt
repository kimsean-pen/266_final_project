I'll keep you safe.
try hard to concentrate.
hold out your hand,
can you feel the weight of it?
the whole world at your fingertips-

Don't be, don't be afraid.
our mistakes, they were bound to be made.
but i promise you i'll keep you safe.

You'll be an architect,
so pull up your sleeves
and build a new silhouette
in the skylines up ahead.

Don't be, don't be afraid.
our mistakes, they were bound to be made.
but i promise you i'll keep you safe.
i'll keep you safe.

Your darkness will be rewritten
into a work of fiction, you'll see.
as you pull on every ribbon
you'll find every secret it keeps.

Your darkness will be rewritten
into a work of fiction, you'll see.
as you pull on every ribbon
you'll find every secret it keeps.

The sound of the branches
breaking under your feet,
the smell of the falling
and burning of leaves,
the bitterness of winter
or the sweetness of spring,
you are an artist
but your heart is your masterpiece.

And I'll keep it safe.

Dismiss the invisible
by giving it shape,
like a clockmaker fixes time
by keeping the gears in line.

Don't be, no don't be afraid.
God knows, our mistakes will be made.
but i promise you i'll keep you safe.

As you build up your collection
of pearls that you pulled from the deep,
a landscape more beautiful
than anything that i've ever seen.

The sound of the branches
breaking under your feet,
the smell of the falling
and burning of leaves,
the bitterness of winter
or the sweetness of spring,
you are an artist,
but your heart is your masterpiece.

And I'll keep it safe.
