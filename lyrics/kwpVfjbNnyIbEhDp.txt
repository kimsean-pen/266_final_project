Fearless ones
Wash away the years
Fearless ones
Wash away the pain, the tears
Can't unload the lows
In the shadow of a dying light
Can't unload the lows
In the fear of a dying light

Dread through centuries shrines
A cold descent of our minds
In abject misery
Aligning stars fall
Dread through centuries shrines
A coldness spreading through time
In abject misery
Enduring scars form

Healing sun
Shelter from release
Grieving none
Crushing waves of long deceit
Can't unload the lows
In the shadow of a dying light
Can't unload the lows
In the fear of a dying light

Dread through centuries shrines
A slow descent of our lives
In abject misery
Aligning stars fall
Dread through centuries shrines
A coldness spreading through time
In abject misery
Enduring scars form
Enduring scars form

Dread through centuries shrines
A cold descent of our lives
In abject misery
Aligning stars fall
Dread through centuries shrines
A coldness spreading through time
In abject misery
Enduring scars form

In abject misery
Enduring scars form
In abject misery
Enduring scars form
