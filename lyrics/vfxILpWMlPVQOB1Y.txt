It's time to find a clearing
To wrestle in the dark
The maze among the lights
See the nodes that emerge in the face

It's tie to quit the race
To carry nothing forward
For we owe it to ourselves
To bury yesterday, leave it quaking in the earth

If we don't know what we're speaking
And we are not who we've been
There's a chance we're only waking
From a dream of the god in our breast

How will we be in that waking?
How will we be in the womb?
We may all begin aquatic
But we leave only dust from our bones

You won't find me where I fall
You won't find me where I fall
We may all begin aquatic
But we leave through the fire for our homes
