This nice spot that I found
Connected to the ground
I'm staying here all night
Staring at the open sky
Till my eyes... Bleed!
Then my soul starts to fly
Far from the chaos of this life
All these calls seem unheard
For the lost cause of this world!

This forest where I hide
Away from the city lights
It's where I meet my peers
Those who are no longer here
Till my heart... Bleeds!
For so long, I've been out there
Being strong in despair
But tonight, I'll get lost
Till my bones turn to dust!

Hard to be heard
No one is listening
You can't be seen
If the sun refuses to shine

Why should I be?
If this life has no meaning
I'm travelling far away out there
Through the sky deep in my head
I escape!

Feelings get hurt
And no care is given
Such a lonely star
In darkness confined

Look up at the sky
And no care is given
Such a lonely star
In darkness confined

For so long, I've been out there
Being strong in despair
But tonight, I'll get lost
Till my bones turn to dust
...Tonight
