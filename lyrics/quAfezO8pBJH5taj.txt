Chain smoke loose cigarettes
Drink everything to try to forget
Wild child that belongs to the night
Wondering if anythings ever alright
Release your heart to anyone who would buy
But always feel cold and dark inside
And you feel lost and alone
Down on your way into a rabbit hole

'Cause I'm two feet in, and you're one foot out

Larry Clark's the one who loves me
He has a whole part of my heart
And when life feels so ugly
He lights me up when I'm feeling dark

Larry Clark's the one who loves me
He has a whole part of my heart
And when life feels so ugly
He lights me up when I'm feeling dark
I'm feeling dark

'Cause I'm two feet in, and you're one foot out

Larry Clark's the one who loves me
He has a whole part of my heart
And when life feels so ugly
He lights me up when I'm feeling dark

Larry Clark's the one who loves me
He has a whole part of my heart
And when life feels so ugly
He lights me up when I'm feeling dark
I'm feeling dark
When I'm feeling dark
I'm feeling dark
