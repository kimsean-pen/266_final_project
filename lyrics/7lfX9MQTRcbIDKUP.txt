Hey brother get up check the wings
Do what I do it's what I feel
Up to the sun, It won' t be long
And now it's time for you to run
Amen it's time to dance
Hey sister come on kick the world
The world is yours, up to you girl
It was so fun you feel so strong
And now it's time for you to burn
Amen it's time to dance
