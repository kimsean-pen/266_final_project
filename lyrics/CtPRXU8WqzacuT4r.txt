Pretty girl, got that look in her eyes
She might be trouble, but trouble's what you need sometimes
She can't hold back and she won't let go
Like a sinking ship that's keeping me afloat

Well, someone told me "watch out"
And another told me "run"
But I've always been a bullseye looking for a gun

But she is my hurricane
And I am her ocean
And we could make the biggest waves
Cause she makes me move; she moves me
Cause she makes me move; she moves me

A reckless heart and a dangerous mind
That combination, a beautiful disaster every time
And she makes me mad, but she, she makes me stronger
I guess that love's not always a sweet, sweet song

Well, someone told me "watch out"
And another told me "run"
But I've always been a bullseye looking for a loaded gun

But she is my hurricane
And I am her ocean
And we could make the biggest waves
Cause she makes me move; she moves me
Cause she makes me move; she moves me, yes

Na-na-na na-na
Na-na-na na-na
Na-na-na na-na na-na
Na-na-na na-na
Na-na-na na-na
Na-na-na na-na na-na

Well, someone told me "watch out"
And another told me "run"
And I don't know if this is what I need
But God, it's all I want
But she is my hurricane
And I, I am her ocean
And we could make the biggest waves
Cause she makes me move; she moves me
Cause she makes me move; she moves me
Cause she makes me move; she moves me
