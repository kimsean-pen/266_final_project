Little boys don't cry, little boys aren't shy
Little boys are tough, they do stuff that little girls don't try
Little boys don't dance, little boys wear pants,
Little boys are bold, you've been told you don't hold little boys hands
Dad said I don't believe in magic, but I do believe in you
And son if you believe in daddy, then take a look, at this book, and believe it's true
There's somewhere o-o-over the rainbow
And if you change the way you look, then maybe you can go
Oh the streets are paved with bricks of gold
And if you ever see, come pray with me
Cause somewhere o-o-over the rainbow
There's a man who's powerful, and he wants you to know
When the rain goes, after the pain goes
You'll be dancing with halos, somewhere over the rainbow

O-o-o-over the rainbow, rainbow
O-o-o-over the rainbow

Little boys stand tall, little boys play ball
Little boys stick, they're not weak, they don't like pink at all
Little boys don't sing, little boys are kings,
Litte boys fly kites, they ride bikes, they don't like little girl things
Dad said I know my baby's special
And you'll grow to be a man
And I know the world may dance with devils
But be strong, you'll be blown to this holy land
You'll be somewhere o-o-over the rainbow
And if you change the way you look, then maybe you can go
Oh the streets are paved with bricks of gold
And if you ever see, come pray with me
Cause somewhere o-o-over the rainbow
There's a man who's powerful, and he wants you to know
When the rain goes, after the pain goes
You'll be dancing with halos, somewhere over the rainbow

O-o-o-over the rainbow, rainbow
O-o-o-over the rainbow
O-o-o-over the rainbow, rainbow
O-o-o-over the rainbow
