What thought are running through your young head
Honey don't you wish I was dead I know you do
You're gunna learn cos I'm your main source
I ain't no measured mile I can make you run my course

You better act sweet don't 'cha treat me like dirt
You're 'bout to get it darlin' for all that you're worth
If I have to scream 'till my voice gets hoarse
I'll take no back talk lord! you'll run my course

And in the night I'll make you suffer
All your days are gunna rain
When you think You've felt the misery
I'll make you lonley just the same

You better act sweet don't 'cha treat me like dirt
You're 'bout to get it darlin' for all that you're worth
If I have to scream 'till my voice gets hoarse
I'll take no back talk lord! you'll run my course
