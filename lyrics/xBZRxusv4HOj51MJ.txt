What did we forget on those dark streets?
Are we powerless against our youth escaping?
Your tape still plays: "This Changes Everything." We're still scared but we're also patient.
I am still a wreck.
We connect in separate places.
Tonight I feel just fine.
I feel like a 2.
5 and I would never trade this time for anything else.
So cut our hair, we'll leave it behind for someone else to find.
