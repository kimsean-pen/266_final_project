A plague shall fall on the weak
As he arises from it's pit
To relieve this world from the filth
Once made by a god, now laid to rest
Finally the time has arrived
To bestow great death upon sheep
The vile stench from the underground
Shall be on your final breath
Oh what a tragic sight
To see all your faith come crashing down
Beheaded
Your prophet will lie before his feet
In torment, your soul will be forevermore
Oh the panic in your eyes
As lightning strikes before you
Forced down to kneel before him
Oh the famine
Of god's word
Will drain you in vain
You'll gasp for mercy
Oh what a tragic sight
To see all your faith come crashing down
Beheaded
Your prophet will lie before his feet
In fire, you'll surrender all to me
Now gaze
Upon the elite
As we stand before you
Paralyzed by god's deceit
Exposed to the heat
Denial has left you in shame
Humanity's divinity shattered for eternity
Defiled and led into the flame
To burn side by side to your brother befouled
Infernal incineration
You choke on the stench as you start to commence
No virgins await in the pit where you'll dwell
Forever!
