A beautiful awakening has happened in my soul
A beautiful awakening that only I could know

Try to imagine a sound that you've never heard
A color that youve never seen
Try to describe
A taste youve not tasted
And maybe youll know what I mean

A beautiful awakening has happened in my soul
A beautiful awakening that only I could know

Can you imagine if you spent your whole life
With a heart beating out of time
Then one day your wild heart found its rhythm
Dont you think youd lose your mind

A beautiful awakening has happened in my soul
A beautiful awakening that only I could know

What if you woke up one day and your eyes could see
Ugly things as beautiful, ay
Would you believe it if you fell in love with a
Stranger would you be doubtful?

A beautiful awakening has happened in my soul
A beautiful awakening that only I could know

when I looked at you
My heart already knew
You had come to breathe life into my dormant soul
I was terrified
I'm not afraid anymore
Cause I know that you
Embrace my heart and I feel alive

Yeah yeah, ohh

A beautiful awakening has happened in my soul
A beautiful awakening that only I could know
A beautiful awakening has happened in my soul
And I know that you know
A beautiful awakening
