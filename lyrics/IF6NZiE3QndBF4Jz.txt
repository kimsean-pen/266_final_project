Caught in the side swipes, attention roulette
We already paid our debt
Label the outline particularly well
We managed to keep our place

Itching your skin 'til it's swollen and red
We never remember the price
Holding your heels just to balance the weight
Like only a liar can shake

And you shove it away
Right through my hands, despite my place
Until you woke from the trance
Echo my fears, they brought you here
So we can fade out

Sentencing might be a glorious day
We're skipping the excess steps
Avoiding arrangements, bury the change
I'll never be honest again

Oh at least you act so well
You're still guilty in your home
Sirens speak over your veil
I'll release all you've felt

And you shove it away
Right through my hands, despite my place
Until you woke from the trance
Echo my fears, they brought you here
So we can fade out

It's weighing me down
It's crushing me down
It's wearing me out

Itching your skin 'til it's swollen and red
We never remember the price
The artery will overflow
The stench like nobody should know

Holding your heels just to balance the weight
Like only a liar can shake
Taken by the garden snake
A sound like nobody should fake
