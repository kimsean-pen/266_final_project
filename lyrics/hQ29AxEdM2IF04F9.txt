I waited for the light to come
to change my life, to change my life
But I am blind, my faith is gone
I'm finding out the good book was wrong

And I must face
that I won't be saved

We're destined to all die alone
I buried my cross with a rose
I won't kneel at your altar now that I know
It's a table for a magic show

I'm getting up from off my knees
the guilt is gone and I can finally breathe
But there is not a plan for me
You're making my tired ears bleed

And you can pray
But I won't be saved

We're destined to all die alone
I buried my cross with a rose
I won't kneel at your altar now that I know
It's a table for a magic show
