Your words can't hurt me now

I reminisce all the nights growing up that I spent all alone
Except the presence of a stomach ache
Feeling sick to the bone with the thought of the words they would say
When will these days fucking go away?
Being pushed all around to the ground I grow up
Feeling nothing but a hole inside
Because of you being heartless, I grow up being friendless
And hopeless in a world that second guesses
You fucking bully, you fucking prick
You fucking coward, you fucking dick

You left me down and out again
I had to pick up the pieces
To mend this broken heart of mine
I had to rewind and start again
You left me down and out again
I had to pick up the pieces
To mend this broken heart of mine
I had to rewind and start again

I didn't have the length nor the strength, I stood out from the crowd
And fucking vultures circling all around
I was 12 years old and at a point
I remember thinking this is not the way I want my life to be told
I have faced my demons
I built me up when you were dragging me down
And at the lowest point, I saw the shatters of a self-esteem
Belonging to my broken dream
Fuck you

You left me down and out again
I had to pick up the pieces
To mend this broken heart of mine
I had to rewind and start again
You left me down and out again
I had to pick up the pieces
To mend this broken heart of mine
I had to rewind and start again

Because of you being heartless, I grow up being friendless
And hopeless in a world that second guesses
I was 12 years old and feeling lifeless
Your words can't hurt me now
