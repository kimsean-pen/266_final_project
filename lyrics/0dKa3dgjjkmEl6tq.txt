I seek reformation! I plead leniency!
This kingdom of heaven and his majesty.
These words now tremble in spite of our trust,
these courses are changing and with them our cause.
Join my desecration Mammon Belial!
Our broken accord our chosen denial
Raise aloft our voices, our graven dissent,
I beg you my father retreat and repent!

Supernal veils of heaven swell;
caustic is this craven goal,
what have we forged,
what have we wrought,
to replace this love with his wrath.
My brothers in arms, I forge this creed!
my blasphemy, our eulogy!
We are the sons of fire!
We are the daughters of light!
