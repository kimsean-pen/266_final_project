You draw me in
Every time I think I'm free, you win
Just like a sin
When I know it's wrong but still begin

Yes, I know that I invite it
I try to fight but like a fire I'm ignited
You force the dawn from my life, you're so inspired
I heard the signs but now everything is quiet

It's you
I can't run, I can't run to you
It's true
I gave up, I gave up on you

So when I'm scared, so close to crying
Her pains are vicious but it must be that I like it
Her world's divided but it still looks like a party
When I'm alone that's not when I find I'm crying

You draw me in
Every time I think I'm free, you win
Just like a sin
When I know it's wrong but still begin

It's you
I can't run, I can't run to you
It's true
I gave up, I gave up on you

You draw me in
Every time I think I'm free, you win
Just like a sin
When I know it's wrong but still begin

We control the dance floor
We control the dance floor
We control the dance floor
Dance floor, dance floor
