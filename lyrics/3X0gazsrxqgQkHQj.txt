Message came from outer space
Future of the human race
Help is not gonna hide it's face
Let it go, she'd your skin
Children will never sleep again
I wanna be your passenger
Take me as your prisoner
I want to be an alien
Take me please, oh alien
I wanna be an alien
Take me please oh alien
Your instruments can't stop our ships
Soon you'll be up in it
Rest will all be blown to bits

Let it go, have your day
Space will take your kids away
I wanna be your passenger
Take me as your prisoner
I want to be an alien
Take me please, oh alien

I wanna be an alien

Take me please oh alien
You must taste our violent fuzz
Your wars are of no use to us
You cannot fix what never was
Let it go, have your day
The media is on it's way

I wanna be your passenger
Take me as your prisoner
I want to be an alien
Take me please, oh alien
I wanna be your alien
Take me please oh alien
