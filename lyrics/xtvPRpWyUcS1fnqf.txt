Always waitin' for someone
to make me happy, pick me up
i realize that someone is me
what you call life, that ain't livin'
bless the child that's got his own
it's my season, now i stand alone
just thought that i would let you know
some things you just can't control
should i wear my hair in a ponytail?
should i dress myself up in chanel?
do i measure me by what you think?
absolutely not, absolutely not
if i go to work in a mini-skirt
am i givin' you the right to flirt?
i won't compromise my point of view
absolutely not, absolutely not
Told myself i won't complain
but some things have got to change
not gon' be a victim of
all your social push and shove
right or wrong, you judge the same
my picture never fit your frame
what you thought, you'll never know
you can't see me with your mind closed
Repeat Now i see, life means more to me
more than fancy clothes
more than you'll ever know
all the ugly words that i heard you say
made me stronger everyday
now i live my life for me
Repeat 3x
Oh, ooh
woah, oh, ooh
all my ladies say
oh, ooh
woah, oh, ooh
absolutely not, absolutely not
all my ladies say
oh, ooh
woah, oh, ooh
all my ladies say
absolutely not, absolutely not
