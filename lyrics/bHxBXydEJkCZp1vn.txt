Starts with a phone call
I asked if you'd been crying
And you denied it
But I could tell just from your breathing
That's how it all starts
That's how it all starts
As for the mending
I think we shouldn't even bother
Let's make it simple
Let's make it easy on each other
I should have known
right from the start
that we were made for ending
I should have known
right from the start
that we were made for ending
(made for ending)
We talked it over
We talked until we couldn't speak
Let's make it simple
We don't need the time to think it over
Let's make it easy on each other
Let's make it simple
I think we shouldn't even bother
I should have known
Right from the start
that we were made for ending
I should have known
right from the start
that we were made for ending
(made for ending)
Let's cut it off
No use in making up
Let's stop pretending
I should have known
right from the start
that we were made for ending
(made for ending)
We gave it our best
But it brought out our worst
So when the world starts crumbling
And walls start tumbling down
Maybe we'll both be better
both be better off
I should have known
that this was made for ending
Made for ending
I should have known
right from the start
that we were made for ending
(oh)
Let's cut it off
No use in making up
Let's stop pretending
I should have known
right from the start
that we were made for ending
