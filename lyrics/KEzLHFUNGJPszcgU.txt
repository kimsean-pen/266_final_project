Stumble through a hallway
Staying up for three days
Sitting in a walkway
Parking in driveways, you can't
Focus is a virtue
You know what you're allured to
Every day is progress
Every day feels just the same

She looked around
How did I get here?
Twenty years goes by so fast
How did I get here?

Doesn't even like cake
Lamenting on a birthday
Two bed in a parlay
Dreaming when her eyes aren't shut
Looking in the mirror
Smiling at her fear
Nothing really matters
These eyes have so much to see

She looked around
How did I get here?
Twenty years goes by so fast
How did I get here?
The home I know
How do I get there?
Twenty years
That's what it takes
I know I'll be there

Stumbled through a hallway
Staying up for three days
Sitting in a walkway
And parking driveways you can
Focus is a virtue
You know what you're allured to
Every day is progress
Every day feels just the same

She looked around
How did I get here?
Twenty years goes by so fast
How did I get here?
The home I know
How do I get there?
Twenty years
That's what it takes
I know I'll be there.
