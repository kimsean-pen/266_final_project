Life's been blinding me
From what I thought I'd see
Is there clarity in this insanity? (yeah)
What's she want from me? (yeah)

Roads in front of me
Taking me astray
Are you leaving me?
Or are you leading the way?
Can you hear what I'm saying?

I need to know
I need to know
I need to know
I need to know

Feel like I'm trying to breathe under water
Trying to climb but I keep falling farther
Will you take my hand?

Feels so far away
I want to see your face
Are you even there?
Can you show me?
Can you make me believe?

I need to know
I need to know
I need to know
I need to know
I need to know
