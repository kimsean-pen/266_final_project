Set fire
To an icon
Set fire
To the lie

Set fire
Bid farewell
I'll be a martyr to myself

Where do I go
If every turn there's a vulture waiting
To pick at my bones
And bury me alive?

My lungs are whitewashed
A million thoughts on the tip of my tongue
I can't keep hiding

My guts in tight knots
Abandon who I've become
Or fight for what's inside me?

Set fire
To an icon
Set fire
To the lie

Set fire
Bid farewell
I'll be a martyr to myself

Where do I go
If every turn there's a vulture waiting
To pick at my bones
And bury me alive?

It's me against the world

I feel their claws sinking in
As the life spirals out from my inner self
Let the earth where I carved my name
Burn

Burn
Set fire
To an icon
Set fire

To the lie
Set fire
Bid farewell
I'll be a martyr to myself

Where do I go
If every turn there's a vulture waiting
To pick at my bones
And bury me alive?

Yeah, it's me against the world
It's me against the world
