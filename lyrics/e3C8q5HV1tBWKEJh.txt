I heard it comes with a feeling
(Let it go, we party on time)
A white robe of endorphins
(Let it go, we party on time)

It's louder than your whole life
It's bigger than your whole life

And everything I held is now untouchable
(Let it go, we party on time)
And everything I crave now unattainable
(Let it go, we party on time)

It's like the Buddha always told us
"what you don't need you never fuss over"
Should I have sold the Lamborghini?
So damn fast I didn't see the wall

So you get the cake (is it over?)
Hold the door (is it over?)
Pick a fight (is it over?)
No, nevermind (is it over?)
Find the vein (is it over?)
Lock the door (is it over?)
Pour champagne (is it over?)

Cause all we got is time
To relive our blunders
And receive our numbers
Then it fades again, fades again

If everything I held is now untouchable
(Let it go, we party on time)
And everything I crave now unattainable
(Let it go, we party on time)

I'm gonna miss you guys so much that I
Wish I could take you all with me tonight
It's like what Jesus always said
You're never done until you're fucking dead

So you get the cake (is it over?)
Hold the door (is it over?)
Pick a fight (is it over?)
No, nevermind (is it over?)
Find the vein (is it over?)
Lock the door (is it over?)
Pour champagne (is it over?)

Cause all we got is time
To relive our blunders
And receive our numbers
Then it fades again, fades again
