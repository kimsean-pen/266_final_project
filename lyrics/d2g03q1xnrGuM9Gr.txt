Close your eyes and count to ten
Better days will come again
We're wild roses in the dark
I can hear your beating heart

We live for the night
We live for the day
When all lights have faded
We're building an army of us
So trust we're driven by lust
When all lights have faded
We're building an army of us
(Do we dream too much?)
We're building an army of us

Do we dream too much?
When it doesn't seem enough
Do we dream too much?
We're building an army of us

What we built is meant to last
One step forward, no step back
We're not broken, we're just bent
Close your eyes and count to ten

We live for the night
We live for the day
When all lights have faded
We're building an army of us
So trust we're driven by lust
When all lights have faded
We're building an army of us

Do we dream too much?
When it doesn't seem enough
Do we dream too much?
We're building an army of us

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Army of us
Ooh, ooh
This love, this love is bigger
This love, this love is bigger
This love, this love is bigger

Do we dream too much?
When it doesn't seem enough
Do we dream too much?
We're building an army of us
Ooh, ooh (this love, this love is bigger)
Ooh, ooh
We're building an army of us
Ooh, ooh (this love, this love is bigger)
We're building an army of us
