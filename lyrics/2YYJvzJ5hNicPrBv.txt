Joe: Jones Beach 1988
Come on (Come on)

Do you remember, or should I rewind
To that summer when you caught my eye
I played it cool
The weather was hot
You had the beauty and the beach on lock

Donnie: With your flip flops, half-shirt, short shorts, mini skirt
Walkin' on the beach, so pretty
You wasn't lookin' for a man
When you saw me in the sand
But you fell for the boy from the city

Jordan: I was like, "hey, girl, can I get your number"
I remember what you told me too
"Don't call after ten"
But you know that I did
'Cause I couldn't stop thinkin' 'bout you

All: I think about you in the summertime
(Oh oh)
And all the good times we had, baby
Been a few years and I can't deny
(Oh oh)
The thought of you still makes me crazy
I think about you in the summertime
(Oh oh)
Jordan: I'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind
You're my, my summertime

Joey: Do you remember
I'll never forget
Touchin' your body all soakin' wet
The water was cool
The feelin' was hot
Kissin' on you while the ocean rocked

Donnie: In your strapless sundress
Kickin' back, no stress
As long as was were together
'Cause we were feelin' young love
And we couldn't get enough
Baby, I could reminisce forever

Jordan: And now I'm like
Hey, girl, don't you know I miss it
And I wonder if you miss it too
Never thought it would end 'til it did
Now, I'm here and I can't stop thinkin' 'bout you

All: I think about you in the summertime
(Oh oh)
And all the good times we had, baby
Been a few years and I can't deny
(Oh oh)
The thought of you still makes me crazy
I think about you in the summertime
(Oh oh)
I'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind
You're my, my summertime

Donnie: Break it down

Jordan: Summer ended
Winter started
It got colder when we parted ways
(Donnie: I like this part)
Jordan: As the seasons change
(Donnie: Bring it forward, bring it back
Jordan: Winter melted
Spring I felt it
Summertime will never be the same
(Without you. My summertime)
My summertime

All: I think about you in the summertime (I think about you)
(Oh oh)
And all the good times we had, baby (we had baby)
Been a few years and I can't deny (I can't deny)
(Oh oh)
The thought of you still makes me crazy (makes me crazy)
I think about you in the summertime
(Oh oh)
Jordan: I'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind (on my mind)
My summertime

All: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh yeah
