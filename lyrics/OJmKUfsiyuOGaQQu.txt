Pictures in my pocket
Are faded from the washer
I can barely just make out your face

Food you saved for later
In my refrigerator
It's been too long since later never came

I know, one day eventually
Yeah, I know, one day I have to let it all go
But I keep it just in case
Yeah, I keep it just in case

In case, you don't find what you're looking for
In case, you're missing what you had before
In case, you change your mind, I'll be waiting here
In case, you just want to come home

Strong enough to leave you
Weak enough to need you
Cared enough to let you walk away

I took that dirty jacket
From the trash right where you left it
'Cause I couldn't stand to see it go to waste

I know, one day eventually
Yeah, I know, one day I have to let it all go
But I keep it just in case
Yeah, I keep it just in case

In case, you don't find what you're looking for
In case, you're missing what you had before
In case, you change your mind, I'll be waiting here
In case, you just want to come home

In case you're looking in the mirror, one day
And miss my arms
How they wrapped around your waist
I say that you can love me again
Even if it isn't the case

Oh, you don't find what you're looking for
Oh, you're missing my love

You don't find what you're looking for
In case, you're missing what you had before
In case, you change your mind, I'll be waiting here
In case, you just want to come home
In case, yeah
