Holding onto hope is useless
The more I wait, the more my mind slips away
With every gateway drug and codependency
Leaving short gaps in history

Will we ever come back down?
Will we ever come back?
One foot out of the grave
And it feels so safe, but we're still stuck in our ways
Will they trace it all back to a break in the fate line?
Is this everything?
I'm missing everything

I wish I could, but it's so hard to
Articulate obscure correlations
While the sounds keep crashing down
Like a symphony in perfect harmony

Will we ever come back down?
Will we ever come back?
We've been smoked out all summer long
Will we ever come back down?

One foot out of the grave
And it feels so safe, but we're still stuck in our ways
Will they trace it all back to a break in the fate line?
Is this everything?
Are we all out of time?
Are we just killing time?

One foot out of the grave
And it feels so safe, but we're still stuck in our ways
Will they trace it all back to a break in the fate line?
Is this everything?
Missed everything

One foot out of the grave
And it feels so safe, but we're still stuck in our ways
Will they trace it all back to a break in the fate line?
Is this everything?
Are we all out of time?
So are we all out of time?
