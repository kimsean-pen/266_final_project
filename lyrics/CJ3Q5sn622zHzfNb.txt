They tell you that he is the only fruit
Thy orange is the only juice
Your passion might just induce
The raging sexual monster loose
Desire is the devil's juice
And your essence is what starves to you
Be careful that you don't overuse
That brain that's been sold back to you

Sex is just to reproduce
Too much fun is the devil's juice
Be careful that you don't overuse
That brain that's been sold back to you
Y-You
You, you

Raging, burning, they set your soul on fire
Let it burn a while
Are you satisfied?
Raging, burning, they set your soul on fire
Let it burn a while
Are you satisfied?

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Are you, are you satisfied?
Yeah

They tell you that there are two paths to choose
If one succeeds, then one must lose
We follow suits, follow the excuse
That makes us zombies walking loose
Looks like we're in the devil's noose
She's out to steal and to seduce
History repeats its constructive truth
While you sit back, what can you do?

Sex is just to reproduce
Too much fun is the devil's juice
Be careful that you don't overuse
That brain that's been sold back to you
Y-You
You, you

Raging, burning, they set your soul on fire
Let it burn a while
Are you satisfied?
Raging, burning, they set your soul on fire
Let it burn a while
Are you satisfied?

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Are you, are you satisfied?
(Satisfied, yeah)
Are you satisfied?
Playing with you
(Satisfied, yeah)

Raging, burning, they set your soul on fire
Let it burn a while
Are you satisfied?
Raging, burning, they set your soul on fire
Let it burn a while
Are you satisfied?

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Are you satisfied?
