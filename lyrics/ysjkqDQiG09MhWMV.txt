this blue dot of sickly light
that is daytime in your embarassed town
burns a hole in the fading yellow ribbon
on your fading wine colored Cavaliere

the mine has fallen down on you
as you dug a well of death
milk and sugar water
in brief sympathy with them

when we see the hate in your eyes
it doesn't make us better men
the mine has crushed your brother
as he ruined our rotting sky
a white blast of black hot powder
as you lapse into a real boy

the mind has fallen down on you
as you dug a well of death
tears of sugar water flow
in briefest sympathy with them

should you be ashamed for more than that?
than that your daddy raped you silly
leaning my head on the refrigerator
crying for the stupid world we share

walla walla walla walla walla walla walla hey
