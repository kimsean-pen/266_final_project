Shoot shoot shoot
You have what I need
Put me in a rocket and send me into the sky
Further than the planes fly (planes fly)
Shoot shoot shoot
You hold me (hold me)

When we're being ourselves
I forget who we know
We're more than just for show
And we hide from the party
Shiver with cold
I shiver 'cause I'm so, so thrown

Shoot shoot shoot
You have what I need
Put me in a rocket and send me into the sky
Further than the planes fly (planes fly)
Shoot shoot shoot
You hold me (hold me)

But when my fingers creep forward
To touch you for the first time
I don't care who knows
I reassess my friendships
I'll let the fake ones go
So it's just us when we're, we're, we're alone

Shoot shoot shoot
I'm so bored of all the talking
Put me in a rocket and send me into the sky
Further than the planes fly (planes fly)
Shoot shoot shoot
You hold me (hold me)
All hold me
Shoot shoot shoot
You have what I need
Put me in a rocket and send me into the sky
Further than the planes fly (planes fly)
Shoot shoot shoot
You hold me (hold me)
All hold me (hold me)
