Bloody eyes, new warning signs
New meaning to the ride or die
And now I know that we aren't going home
Bathed in ash, baptized in rubble
Raised out of unnatural trouble
If I can't stay here, where do I go?

Wrap the chains around their throats
Pull the trigger and sink the boats
If they make it to the shore
Don't hesitate just kill 'em all
Burn them all like sickened cattle
And leave nothing for the jackals
