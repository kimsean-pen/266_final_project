I don't hate you or want you
Enough to wake you
There's a crack in the window
Return off the key in ignition

So if you freeze tomorrow
Come back lucky
We saw that your eyes were closing

There's a crack in the window
Return off the key in ignition
But I don't hate you or want you
Or celebrate you

So if you freeze tomorrow
Come back lucky
We saw that your eyes were closing

So if you freeze tomorrow
Come back lucky
We saw that your eyes were closing

But I don't hate you or want you
Enough to wake you

So if you freeze tomorrow
Come back lucky
We saw that your eyes were closing

So if you freeze tomorrow
Come back lucky
We saw that your eyes were closing

We saw that your eyes were closing
We saw that your eyes were closing
We saw that your eyes were closing
We saw that your eyes were closing

So if you freeze tomorrow
Come back lucky
