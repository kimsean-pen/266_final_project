will the same mistakes haunt you like they used to do?
or are you afraid that your body won't let you choose?
you are your father's son, and the same disease that holds you held him once!
and i know if you push this hard it will still take hold.
you cannot accept the things you can't control.
and i know your mind is young but your body's old.
and you can't forgive youself (though no one else could blame you for this).
but hold on! hold on! hold on!

and already i can't remember if the heart was ever aware
that the body it kept alive was wearing out, was shutting down.
and tonight, when it realized, you gave up, it cried out,
"only now i realize i always knew."
