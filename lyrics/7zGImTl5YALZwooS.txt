You've got a habit of breaking things
Bursting bubbles and hearts on strings
You've got a habit of breaking things
Looking for trouble with your list of flings

You've got a habit of using people
You get what you want no matter what the cost
You've got a habit of using people
You seem in control but inside you're lost

You play your games with no rules and no sense of respect
You live your life like a joke and a self-centered jerk
You cheat and lie causing pain with no thought or regret
To change your mind then you drink

You've got a habit of breaking things
Shattering smiles and darts through dreams
You've got a habit of breaking things
Messing with minds with your plots and schemes

You play your games with no rules and no sense of respect
You live your life like a joke and a self-centered jerk
You cheat and lie, causing pain with no thought or regret
To change your mind then you drink

When it all comes crashin' down
Don't you come to me and cry
I'll be gone and moving on
Far away from all your lies

When it all comes crashin' down
Don't you come to me and cry
I'll be gone and moving on
Far away from all your lies

You live your life like a joke and a self-centered jerk
You cheat and lie, causing pain with no thought or regret
To change your mind then you drink
