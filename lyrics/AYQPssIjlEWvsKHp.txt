I'm gonna make you bend and break (it sent you to me without wings)
Say a prayer, but let the good times roll
In case God doesn't show (let the good times roll, let the good times roll)
And I want these words to make things right
But it's the wrongs that makes the words come to life

Who does he think he is (if that's the worst you got better put your fingers back
to the keys)
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories

Even though they weren't so great
He tastes like you only sweeter
One night yeah and one more time
Thanks for the memories

Thanks for the memories
See, He tastes like you only sweeter
ooooooooh
Been looking forward to the future

But my eyesight is going bad
And this crystal ball
It's always cloudy except for (except for)

When you look into the past (look into the past)
One night stand
One night stands out!
One night, and one more time

Thanks for the memories
Even though they weren't so great
He tastes like you only sweeter
One night, yeah one more time

Thanks for the memories
Thanks for the memories
See, He tastes like you only sweeter
They say I only think in the form of

Crunching numbers in hotel rooms
Collecting page six lovers
Get me out of my mind

Gets you out of those clothes
I'm a line away from
Getting you into the mood (wa-ooooohhh)
One night, One more time

Thanks for the memories
Even though they werent so great
He tastes like you only sweeter
One night, Yeah One more time

Thanks for the memories
Thanks for the memories
See, He taste like you only sweeter
One more night and one more time
thanks for the memories
even though they werent so great
he tastes like you only sweeter
One night, One more time
Thanks for the memories
Thanks for the memories
See, he tastes like you only sweeter
