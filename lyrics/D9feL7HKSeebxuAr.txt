It's unknown what I am for the buyer
Have they cloned the American dream?
Stand in line for a higher desire
It's a crack in this mortal machine

I'm enhanced, a syntethical fire
I'm a product of chaos and entropy
As the dust's kicking in, I get tired

Failed destiny facing liars
Let me know I'm the one, I am
Reborn in a cosmic fire
Will I die or return from my demise?

Is it already over?
Am I falling apart?
Out of the dark and into a fading white star
Is it already over?
I'm descended from dreams
Unnatural light, bright in my eyes
And that's why they call me transhuman

I've postponed the transformed revolution
It's a blueprint with silicon seams
Step by step, I revoke the illusion
Of the force that's not meant to be seen

My revenge stands for words to inspire
Will humanity see what I need?
My adrenaline feeds my desire
To become an immortal machine

Failed destiny facing liars
Let me know I'm the one, I am
Reborn in a cosmic fire
Will I die or return from my demise?

Is it already over?
Am I falling apart?
Out of the dark and into a fading white star
Is it already over?
I'm descended from dreams
Unnatural light, bright in my eyes
And that's why they call me transhuman

Is it already over?
Am I falling apart?
Out of the dark and into a fading white star
Is it already over?
I'm descended from dreams
Unnatural light, bright in my eyes
And that's why they call me transhuman
