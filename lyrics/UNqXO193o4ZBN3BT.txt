The misguided rise now
Untainted and pure
Stand in ignorance
And fall in neglect

In inherent sorrow
Rip open your heart for me
The undeserving
Grieve for all

From rise to fall
We preach our dream
Dishonour

With the coldest shoulder
The balance is broken
So with disdain you may burn me forever
In anti-human desperation
This is the horror that binds us all

Buried beneath with our martyrs
Buried beneath with our scapegoats

The earth falls to it's knees

The misguided rise now
Untainted and pure
Stand in ignorance

Our devotion
Our redemption
Are our own
My eyes are open
