It's 1 A.M and I'm home alone
Thinking I should pick up the phone
Give a ring babe, I hope you're there
It's been a long day, we need some time
Just one on one with you tonight
'Cause all day you've been in my head

So tell me what to say, do you wanna play?
Baby, name the place
We could stay, never go away
Waste away the day
From the noon to the midnight moon
We'll set the mood
I can't even move, I love what you do 'cause

Girl, that feels amazing, girl, that feels amazing
Girl, that feels amazing, every time
Girl, that feels amazing, girl, that feels amazing
Girl, that feels amazing, every time

I don't wanna say too much
But no one does it better than us
'Cause girl, that feels amazing, girl, that feels amazing
Girl, that feels amazing, every time

From the first time we laid eyes
Ooo baby, I was hypnotised
Playing fate over chemicals
But this is real baby, no tricks
Some times it's just the right thing
Light the fuse and you'll set it off
Oh, set it off

So tell me what to say, do you wanna play?
Baby, name the place
We could stay, never go away
Waste away the day
From the noon to the midnight moon
We'll set the mood
I can't even move, I love what you do 'cause

Girl, that feels amazing, girl, that feels amazing
Girl, that feels amazing, every time
Girl, that feels amazing, girl, that feels amazing
Girl, that feels amazing, every time

I don't wanna say too much
But no one does it better than us
'Cause girl, that feels amazing, girl, that feels amazing
Girl, that feels amazing, every time

I don't wanna say too much
But no one does it better than us
'Cause girl, that feels amazing, girl, that feels amazing
Girl, that feels amazing, every time
