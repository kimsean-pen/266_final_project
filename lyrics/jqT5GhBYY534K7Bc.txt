Get it now
Tell me how to get it now
To hold it in or let it out
Tell me to go, or stay

Headed now
Show me where we're headed now
If only I'd have read the signs
I wouldn't be here going to waste

I really don't know
Oh, lost it a little
Don't go, must be a riddle
Don't you know
Oh, lost in your riddles
Lost in your riddles

Where we will go, we'll be lost in the middle
Where we will go, I'll be lost in your riddles

Better now
Tell me is it better now
To keep you right here by my side
Or have you like smoke, to fade

Settle down
If only I could settle down
I know that I'd have read the lines
And wouldn't be here going to waste

But I really don't know
Oh, lost it a little
Don't go, must be a riddle
Don't you know
Oh, I'm lost in your riddles
Lost in your riddles
But I really want to know
Oh, lost it a little
Don't go, must be a riddle
Don't you know
Oh, I'm lost in your riddles
Lost in your riddles

Where we will go, we'll be lost in the middle
Where we will go, I'll be lost in your riddles
Where we will go, we'll be lost in the middle
Where we will go, I'll be lost in your riddles

Where we will go, we'll be lost in the middle
Where we will go, I'll be lost in your riddles
Where we will go, we'll be lost in the middle
Where we will go, I'll be lost in your riddles
