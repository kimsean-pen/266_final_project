People dying for no reason at all
Age is no difference or if you're large or small
Families been torn apart
Doesn't have to be this way
Some people just have no heart
It's happening every day
Pure massacre
Pure massacre
Pure massacre
Pure massacre

Machine guns pumping
Hearts thumping
Death is all around yeah
People crying for freedom
No one hears the sound oh

Pure massacre,
Pure massacre
Pure massacre,
Pure massacre alright

There's people crying,
There's people dying,
But someone's taken it all, yeah

Machine guns pumping,
Hearts thumping,
Death is all around,
People crying for freedom,
No one hears the sound

Pure massacre,
Pure massacre,
Pure massacre,
Pure massacre,
Pure massacre,
Pure massacre,
It's gonna be,
A pure massacre
Yeah
