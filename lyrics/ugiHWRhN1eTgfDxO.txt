Baby, when I think about the day that we first met
(The day that we first met)
Wasn't lookin' for what I found, but I found you
And I'm bound to find happiness in bein' around you

I'm glad when I'm makin' love to you
I'm glad for the way you make me feel
I love it 'cause you seem to blow my mind everytime

I'm glad when you walk you hold my hand
I'm happy that you know how to be a man
I'm glad that you came into my life, I'm so glad

I dig the way that you get down
(You get down thugged out)
And you still know how to hold me
(And you still know how to hold me)

Perfect blend, masculine
(Can't get enough now)
I think I'm in love, damn, finally

I'm glad when I'm makin' love to you
I'm glad for the way you make me feel
I love it 'cause you seem to blow my mind everytime

I'm glad when you walk you hold my hand
I'm happy that you know how to be a man
I'm glad that you came into my life, I'm so glad

I'm glad that you turned out to be that certain someone special
Who makes this life worth living
I'm glad you're here just lovin' me
So say that you won't leave
'Cause since the day you came, I've been glad

I'm glad when I'm makin' love to you
I'm glad for the way you make me feel
I love it 'cause you seem to blow my mind everytime

I'm glad when you walk you hold my hand
I'm happy that you know how to be a man
I'm glad that you came into my life, I'm so glad
