Close your eyes, beg for the light
that never be allowed to you
it doesn't belong to your God anymore
it crosses my path now you're mine
I'm the master of the whole evil

I'll emanate suffering for your life
your glory had a price
all those who come to me
they'll have to pay it

Eternal defecation
putrefication before death
try the autopsy while you live
your blood stinks like rotten flesh
you had your chance nad lost it
