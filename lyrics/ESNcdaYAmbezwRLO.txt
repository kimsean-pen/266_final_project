Ooh ohh ohh
Yeah yeah yeah
Hey

If loving you is easy,
playing by the rules,
but you said love taste so much better when its cruel
to you everything was just a game,
yeah you played me good,
But i want you, i want you, i want you,
So much more than i should,
Yes i do.

I've got my hands up so take your aim,
Yeah i'm ready,
There's nothing that we can't go through,
Oh it hit me like a steal freight train,
When you left me,
And nothing ever hurt like you,
Nothing ever hurt like you.

I was naive and wide eyed,
but you made me see,
that you dont get to taste the honey,
without the sting of a bee,
no you dont.

Yes you stung me good,
oh yeah you dug in deep,
but ill take, ill take it, ill take it
Till im down on my knees.

I've got my hands up so take your aim,
Yeah i'm ready,
There's nothing that we can't go through,
Walk a thousend miles on broken glass,
It wont stop me,
from making my way back to you,
It's not real till you feel the pain,
And nothing ever hurt like you,
Nothing ever hurt like you.

Oh everything was just a game,
yeah you played me good,
But i want you, i want you, i want you,
I want you, i want you.

I've got my hands up so take your aim,
Yeah i'm ready,
There's nothing that we can't go through,
Walk a thousend miles on broken glass,
It wont stop me,
from making my way back to you,
It's not real till you feel the pain,
And nothing ever hurt like you,
Nothing ever hurt like you.

Nothing in the whole wide world
Nothing ever, nothing ever, nothing ever
Nothing ever hurt like you, like you
Like you, like you, hurt like you
Will ever, will never hurt like you, you, you, you
Nothing ever hurt like you.
