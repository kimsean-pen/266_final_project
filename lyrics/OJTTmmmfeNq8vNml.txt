Once I had my heros,
Once I had my dreams.
But all of that has changed now,
The truth begins again.
The truth is not that comfortable, no.
Mother taught us patience,
The virtues of restraint.
Father taught us boundries,
Of knowledge we must goal.
I'm trying to protect my unity.

That's when I reach for my revolver.
That's when it all gets blown away.
That's when I reach for my revolver.
The spirit passes by this way.

A friend of mine once told me,
His one and only aim.
To build a giant castle,
And in it sign his name.
Sign it with complete community.

That's when I reach for my revolver.
That's when it all gets blown away.
That's when I reach for my revolver.
Her spirit passes by this way.

Now that the sky is empty,
And that is nothing new.
Instead they look upon us when they tell me,
That we're nothing.

That's when I reach for my revolver.
That's when it all gets blown away.
That's when I reach for my revolver.
A spirit passes by this way.

That's when I reach for my revolver.
That's when it all gets blown away.
That's when I reach for my revolver.
The spirit passes by this way.
