Climb into my corner
My self inflicted coma
Stand up, lay down
Repeat in the same order
Fall straight through the floor
And next time just swing me over
Another mirror damaged
Corrected and distorted
I'm underwhelmed, I'm interested
I wonder why I'm over it
Walk it off, the kettle's black
The dotted line, the house is glass

The house is glass
The house is glass
The house is glass
The house is glass

It's an illusion, this admiration
Of mutilation, my isolation
It's an illusion, this admiration
Of mutilation
My isolation
My isolation
My isolation
It's an illusion

Slide on down the staircase
That picture perfect moment
Receiver projected, act like if you own it
Smile for the camera
Repeat and do it over
Smile for the camera
Repeat and do it over
Joke's on you, the needle prick
Cut me down, I need a break
Walk it off, the kettles black
The dotted line, this house is glass

The house is glass
The house is glass
The house is glass
The house is glass

It's an illusion, this admiration
A mutilation, my isolation
It's an illusion, this admiration
Of mutilation
My isolation
My isolation
My isolation
It's an illusion

Brick by brick
Make it last
A dotted line
The house is glass

It's an illusion, my isolation
My isolation, my isolation
It's an illusion, it's an illusion
My isolation
My isolation
My isolation
