The bartender says, "Kid, one day you'll get famous,
Which is lucky, 'cause honey I hate to say it,
You ain't much of a waitress, even on a day shift,
Clumsy as you are, it's like we're paying you to break dishes."

Now the records, break light plates,
Rocking stages state to state.
Getting bigger like every day,
And they say the game's changing.
Doomtree stay sharp, razor blade up.
But, 'member when we didn't have a dime to stop on,
All night trying to write a decent pop song,
Dot net 'cause somebody already had the dot com,
Get in, let's go, go 'head, come on.
Boys in the basement, beats through a bass amp,
Papers on the _______ we're all on the radar now,
I guess, digging in and gaining ground,
No matter where we go, I do believe we're all related now.

There's no love like crew,
And that's true, 'cause to me,
My friends and my family,
My clan is Doomtree.
(My people, my partners, my plan is Doomtree).

It's been a long walk and it's a steep hill.
No time for small talk, no place for weak wills.
You mind your business and you try to stay real.
Half Dorothy Parker, half April O'Neal.
_______ over light on the horizon.
Real slow strobe, night, day, and night again.
No time now to wonder 'bout what might have been,
Eyes on the prize, no matter what the critics think.
What's got nine lives, lands on it's feet?
The Doomtree franchise, rep wings and teeth.
If the hinges creak, then break the door down.
All I need is a beat, a break of four count.

There's no love like crew,
And that's true, 'cause to me,
My friends and my family,
My clan is Doomtree.
(My people, my partners, my plan is Doomtree).

Maybe ain't a lot, but it's an honest wage,
And what we've got is what we've made.
