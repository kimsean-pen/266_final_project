Won't you shadow dance for me?
Play it off and tell me how it feels

Won't you shadow dance for me?
Play it off and tell me how it feels

Let's try something different, brand new
Oh that, right there, don't move
I wish I could tip you for all of your time
Yeah, yeah

Girl when you
Teasing me, pleasing me, guaranteed
You know that I love it when you (I love the way)
Dance for me, flashing me, all for free
That's the way I like it baby

It's what you do
Me and you should rendezvous
Somewhere we can meet in private
Your debut, time to shoot
Now's your cue, so

Won't you shadow dance for me?
Play it off and tell me how it feels
Won't you shadow dance for me?
Play it off and tell me how it feels
(For me)

If I could freeze the hands of time
I would stay right here with you
Right by my side, that'd be nice

The night is young, your taste is sweet
Lay with me until we find
Just what we need, what we need

If I could freeze the hands of time
I would stay right here with you
Right by my side, that'd be nice

The night is young, your taste is sweet
Lay with me until we find
Just what we need, what we need

Tell me that you love me, babe
Tell me that you love me, girl
Tell me if you love me, baby
Do you really love me, baby?
Do you really love it, girl?
