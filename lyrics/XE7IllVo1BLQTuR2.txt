You can run and you can begin'
In a place where you don't fit in
Love will find a way ...yeah

When you're down, you can start again
Turn around everything you're in
Love will find a place yeah

If you got one heart you are followin'
One dream that keeps you wandering
Love lights your way through the night
One wish that keeps you tryin'
What's your silver lining
Loves lights your way through the night

You can fall a thousand times
You can feel like you've lost your mind
Love will find a way oh yeah yeah
And a minute it can change your life
And a moment it can make it right
Love will find a place yeah

If you got one heart you are followin'
One dream keeps you wandering
Love lights your way through the night
One wish keeps you tryin'
What's your silver linin'
Loves lights your way through the night

Everybody needs something to hold on to
Everybody needs something to hold on to

If you got one heart you are followin'
One dream keeps you wandering
Love lights your way through the night
One wish keeps you tryin'
What's your silver linin'
Love lights your way through the night

One wish keeps you tryin'
Find your silver linin'
Loves lights your way through the night

Love will find a way
Love will find a way in your heart
