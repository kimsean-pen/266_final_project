Pick up the phone
It's noone you know
They dialed the wrong number, they said
But you won't let them go again

You caught me at a real bad time
You caught me at a real bad time

Text all my friends
From my silhouette
I'm probably stoned
And all alone
Just chilling on my royal throne

I'm sorry if I don't text back
I texted every single number I had
And I know you
Can surf this too

Melt on the couch
Drip to the ground
I know I swore I'd start to move
But that requires something to do

And I can think of nothing else
Than me sitting on this here couch

My phone's gonna die
I shouldn't reply
The charger's way across the room
I don't think it'll reach here dude

You caught me at a real bad time
You caught me at a real bad time
And I know you
Can surf this too

Is it that hard to handle
It getting dark at 5 O'clock
There's something about these covers
They do more than enough
And these christmas lights that line my room
They make me feel so special
And if it weren't for them
All green and red
This wouldn't be so gentle
