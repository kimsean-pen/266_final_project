Swear my head was spinning
Right from the beginning
Never thought I'd fall this hard
Perfectly pretending
We don't have an ending
If we never start at all

Fooling yourself
They say you gotta let me, gotta let me go
I'm losing myself
So I gotta let you, gotta let you know

All the diamonds and pearls
Wouldn't know what you're worth
'Cause you're one in a million
Always putting you first
Feel the heat of my love
Oh, get out of the kitchen now
Baby, when will you learn?
Are you really concerned with competition?
Give me more than just words
I mean, haven't you heard?
That you're one in a million now

Holding my breath every time we're alone
Holding my breath every time you get home
I don't really worry though, in a hurry, no
I don't really worry though, no
Maybe we should let it go?
Need to let it go
I don't really worry though, no

History's repeating
Call you on the weekend
Telling you to take your time
I may be naive and hopelessly believing
I could ever make you mine

Fooling yourself
They say you gotta let me, gotta let me go
I'm losing myself
So I gotta let you, gotta let you know

I always know what to say
But never straight to your face
'Cause you're one in a million
I tangle up in a phase
Then I stutter away
Like a bad politician now
Like we're moving in place
Baby, playing it safe
Won't make no difference, yeah
I mean, one of these days
You gotta do what it takes
'Cause you're one in a million now

Holding my breath every time we're alone
I don't really worry though
Holding my breath every time you get
I don't really
I don't really worry though
I don't really
