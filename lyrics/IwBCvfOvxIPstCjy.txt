Away, away, we drift away.

I feel it all lately, I wonder if I'm what you need.
When I hold you in I feel as if there's less of me.

We lay there silent and exchange stares
But still say nothing like it's not there.
If I left now, would I miss you when it's too late.
If I left now would you hate me today.

Stop me from moving.
Keep me from the fears that know me best.
You know what the truth is.
You can have whatever soul is left.

While we drift away, away, we drift away.
While we drift away, away, we drift away.

You know how to pull me in when you feel alone.
I'm a sucker for a warm bed, yeah it feels like home
But I still feel empty, my feet still get cold.
Anything that makes me whole.

We lay there silent and exchange stares
But still say nothing like it's not there.
If I left now, would I miss you when it's too late.
If I left now would you hate me today.

Stop me from moving.
Keep me from the fears that know me best.
You know what the truth is.
You can have whatever soul is left.

Stop me from moving.
Keep me from the fears that know me best.
You know what the truth is.
You can have whatever soul is left.

But I'll lay here in bed with my heart in my hand
Till you're just as tired as me.
When I come to my senses, and you're feeling restless.
This will all repeat
But it's okay, you know I'll stay.
Yeah it's okay, we'll drift away.

Away, away, we drift away.

Stop me from moving.
Keep me from the fears that know me best.
You know what the truth is.
You can have whatever soul is left.

Stop me from moving.
Keep me from the fears that know me best.
You know what the truth is.
You can have whatever soul is left.

But it's okay, you know I'll stay.
Yeah it's okay, we'll drift away.
