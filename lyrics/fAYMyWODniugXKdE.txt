I buried the judgment
I covered my tracks
Soon to be forgotten
There's a new life ahead

It was my hope that was fading
I was caught in a trap
It's the burden of failure
I carried on my back

Let's get this straight
A lot has changed in the last year
Thought I had everything together
But watched it all disappear
I put my faith in the wrong things
When I woke up, it was gone, I gave up on me

Didn't even recognize myself
Self worth is not found in someone else
Chase what you want, never give up
Salt the wound, all ties are cut

Now I see
I was broken to be made a better me
Had to learn to let it go and let it be
Sometimes we're too blind to see

The hardest lessons that we learn
Are the ones where knowledge must be earned
It's what makes us human
It's what gets us through it

Weighed down by the pressures of saving face
This is a dark world, I'll be your witness

Witness

Now I see
I was broken to be made a better me
Had to learn to let it go and let it be
Sometimes we're too blind to see

Learn to let it go and let it be
Learn to let it go and let it be
Learn to let it go and let it be
Learn to let it go
