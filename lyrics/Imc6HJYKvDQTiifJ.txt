I've thought about Chicago for a long time
The subtle kiss that the morning brings
I can wander in a daze and shake my mind

Scratched into a notebook before my eyes
Am I apart from the life I dreamed?
Odd how I can make a change at any time

From Seattle to Kyoto, Rome, a Tel Aviv cafe
Under suffering skies

I've thought about Chicago
About a new life
I've thought about the lake and the fog, and
Staying up most nights
I've thought about Chicago
Seems about right

Breathing in the pressure
Clean and fine
A second guess of the life I lead
I say fuck it, make 'em wait, let's waste some time

All I wanted was for one damn song to make it feel that way
Feel like there was nothing I could keep inside
From Seattle to Kyoto, Rome, a Tel Aviv cafe
Under suffering skies

I've thought about Chicago for a long time
Seven ships in the morning breeze
I can wander in a daze and shake my mind

From Seattle to Kyoto, Rome, a Tel Aviv cafe
Under suffering skies
Under suffering skies
