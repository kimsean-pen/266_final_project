Attitude is my addiction
I live life with no regret
Unlike you, it's my conviction
That sets me apart from the rest

I live for competition
Your cynicism only
Makes me stronger
I am the culmination
Setting the standard
That all will follow

I live it every day
Don't know another way

Within my eyes there's
Devastation and fury
You can't understand
In my fight
Win by attrition I bring it
With all that I fucking am
All that I fucking am

You never dealt with such rejection
Licking your wounds that won't fucking heal
You've never seen so much aggression
I am the scream to your fucking silence

I live it every day
Don't know another way

Attitude is my addiction
I live life with no regret
Unlike you, it's my affliction
That creates the template
Of all that I am
All that I fucking am

You know and I know
No matter what you say
You'll be beaten today
Like every other day

Something about you
Keeps you from letting go
Of lame obsessions
Built up inside you

Forget the guesswork
You're starting at the source
Gazing into my eyes
You'll see there's no remorse
'Cause this is my war
All day and every day
It's all about the confliction

Bring on the competition
Your pessimism only
makes me stronger
I am the culmination
The fucking standard
That all will follow

I live it everyday
Don't know another way.
