Tell me where it all went wrong
Maybe I can make it better
Tell me where it all went wrong
Don't you know that you really upset her
When you act like a man who is cross with every woman he's never had
If it's true looks could kill and you will be the first to make me mad
Then you'll have to go
Maybe you'll have to go

Is this the kind of fate you could contemplate
A breakdown at my very sight
I promise hidden words of tenderness in every single line that I write
Still you act like a man who is cross with every woman he's never had
If it's true looks could kill and you will be the first to make me mad
Then you'll have to go
Maybe you'll have to go

Tell me where it all went wrong x4

Don't you know that you really upset her
When you act like a man who is cross with every woman he's never had
If it's true looks could kill and you will be the first to make me mad
Then you'll have to go
Maybe you'll have to go

Is it true looks could kill?
Is it true looks could kill?
Is it true looks could kill?
Yeah it's true looks could kill
