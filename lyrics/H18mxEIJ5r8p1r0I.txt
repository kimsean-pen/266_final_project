Beauty, once wild and free
Now silent and domesticated
Mothers separated
Possessions confiscated
Shackled, marked, and branded
Slave owners need to spot their thrall
Chastised, abused, manipulated
But the blossom will not fall

Unethical, industrialisation of the uterus
Utilised, maximum effectivity desired
Unethical, uterus industrialised

Usurpation of motherhood
Aggressive birth trauma
Ushered from the comfort of the womb
Into the world
Rough handled by strangers
Detached from the umbilical cord
Connection lost
Usurpation of motherhood
A cocktail of amniotic fluids is
Pouring down the operational table

Deprived of lust and sexual desire
Reduced to fertile breeding machines
Inseminated with the fruit of the privileged
To carry on their genes
A sick and twisted game
Where the profit margin is enormous
We're breeding humans
Capitalism in high performance
Detached from the umbilical cord
Connection lost
Usurpation of motherhood
By patriarchal loopholes
Curated by unconcerned
And apathetic assholes
Assholes
In regulations that protect
Business interest, not people
The female body used as a vessel
Half of the births end lethal

Blind eye of the law
No time to pity the nameless Jane Doe

Usurping motherhood

Unethical, industrialisation of the uterus
Utilised, maximum effectivity desired
Unethical, uterus industrialised
Usurpation of motherhood
Another uterus industrialised
