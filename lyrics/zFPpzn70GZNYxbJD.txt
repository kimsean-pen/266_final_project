Revisit a life we both left behind
We don't know the harm move to the ever moving
All blazing, we go over and over and over and over again
If I wait too long I'll lose you from my sight maybe tonight
I could stop dreaming and start believing
In forever and ever and ever and ever again

Reunion, reunion, reunion, reunion
Never not ever, never not ever again

When there's burning inside
Do you give it up, how long should I wait?
There's no need to hide when there's only you in here
There's an end to us
With someone else in sight, you shine a light
And there goes that feeling, don't let me see her
Never not ever, never not ever again

Did I see you? See me in a new light
Did I see you? See me in a new light
Did I see you? See me in a new light (never not ever, never not ever again)
Did I see you? See me in a new light (never not ever, never not ever again)
Did I see you? See me never not ever, never not ever again
