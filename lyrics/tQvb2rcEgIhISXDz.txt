She's a rhino
She's a whino
She's a tight rope
We'll be fine though
Singing Woah
What do they know
She's a libra
and a needer
and mona lisa
Would wanna be her
Singing woah
What do they know
and she said that together we can take on the world
and she told me that i'd never find another girl
like her
she's in licra
But I dont like her
Shes a tiger
but not as violent
Singing Woah
What to they know
She's a weirdo
and a leader
She's a big girl
and she's cheerful
Singing Woah
What do they know
and she said that together we can take on the world
and she told me that i'd never find another girl
like her
and she said that together we can do anthing
and she told me that she loves a boy who knows how to sing
So I learnt how to sing
She's a rhino
She's a whino
She's a tight-rope
We'll be fine though
and she said that together we can take on the world
and she told me that i'd never find another girl
like her
and she said that together we can do anything
and she told me that she loves a boy who knows how to sing
So I learnt how to sing
