Help me
I've lost myself within
My body imprisons my soul

Left me in the cold
Starving for life
Waiting for hope
Left behind with nothing to cope

Abandoned by those I kept near & close
Realities becomes my
broken home

There's nothing left,
Relieve all those I layed to rest,
Repent for all my selfish ways

Suffer in Pain
for all my days
Hold my breathe &
pray for death

As I sit here rotting
waiting for this
life to end,
I embrace the darkness
as it absorbs into me

I've lost it all,
Sorry for myself
I've grown so numb

Sick of all of this
Just leave me here
to rot alone

No remorse
No excuse
No more pain
