Today
I want to slip back to the dream I had
When you had urged me to look out
Upon the window of my life
Today
The choices have all clashed upon my head
Is it wrong to leave your charges
And go charging round the bend?
Mansions, there are
mansions in the sun
There's no hiding
Defying the night
Come out into the light
Today
Today
My thoughts were like a tent put up in heaven
Build a shelter for your mind
Invite a stranger to come in and share the wine
Mansions, there are
mansions in the sun
There's no hiding
Defying the night
Come out into the light
Today
Today
They want to tear my body from my mind
The rust will show
I am an iron bridge that's giving into time
Today
The wind blows west the heather and the broom becalms
The spirit of a fighting man and lays him
Where his wild spirit belongs
Victims will be justified
The lame will be leaping
This army's for peace
Come out into the light
Today
Victims will be justified
The lame are believing
This army's for peace
Come out into the light
Today
