Oh no, look what you've done
That's me, the victim of our hit'n'run
Picked up and let down
You were never as you led on

You said, 'just friends, and no strings'
But that leaves loose ends of old flings
Get back to old days and old flames
You never let burn out.

Won't you let me know?

How do I get away?
When you're beggin' me to stay
What do you need me to say?
You're anything but ordinary

And what do you want me to do?
I've given it all to you
I wish you would return the favor

Did you forget what I said?
Train wreck. Here we, here we go again
Derailed and I failed to mention
I put it on the line?

Whether you and me could ever be, we'll never see, no.
'Cause you keep the lights off
You only do it in the dark.
Won't you let me know?

How do I get away?

When you're beggin' me to stay
What do you need me to say?
You're anything but ordinary.
What do you want me to do?

I've given it all to you
I wish you would return the favor
Are you gonna throw it all away? (Do, do, do me a favor)

Are we gonna do this all again?
And maybe it's all pretend and the game should end
I guess nobody wins
(Won't you let me know?)

How do I get away?
When you're beggin' me to stay
What do you need me to say?
You're anything but ordinary.

And what do you want me to do?
I've given it all to you
I wish you would return the favor
How do I get away?
When you're beggin' me to stay
(throw it all away)
What do you need me to say?
You're anything but ordinary.
(be okay someday)
What do you want me to do?
(i'm gonna throw it all away)
I've given it all to you
I wish you would return the favor.
