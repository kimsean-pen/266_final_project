You've built your life
Above this sin
You hold my hand
Before the end comes
Forgiving me
For what I've done
To the end of days
'Cause I belong to you
'Cause I am part of you

I am dying in your arms
It's time to go
I can't make it through

I've come to realize
Tonight my dear
The end of time
Is not so far away
We cannot pray
To save our lives

I can feel you
And I think
That everything you wanted in me
Was the mirror of your dreams
But I couldn't believe what you take
As I belong to you
My flesh and blood in you
I am burning in this fire
It's time to go
I can't make it through

I've come to realize
Tonight my dear
The end of time
Is not so far away
We cannot pray
To save our lives

I've come to realize
Tonight my friend
The end of time
Is not so far away
We cannot pray
To save our lives

I'm coming home again
And now I know where I belong
Reeling from my instincts
Cause I realize I'm not alone

I've come to realize
Tonight my dear
The end of time
Is not so far away
We cannot pray
To save our lives
I've come to realize
Tonight my friend
The end of time
Is not so far away
We cannot pray
To save our lives
