Ere thou enter farther in such mysteries, comprehend:
The secret of the Lord is for those who fear Him
and He will make them know His covenant.
Cursed is he that removeth awaye the marke of hys master
to please men and not to serve in secrecy.
Amen.
Blessed is he that maketh the blind to goe oute of hys waye.
Amen.
Cursed is he that putteth his truste in man,
and taketh manne for his defence,
and in his harte goeth from the Lorde.
The lord prevails.
Amen.
Blessed is he that taketh rewarde to slea the soule of innocent bloude.
Amen.
Blessed is he that murders Christ in himself and in his fellow men.
Amen.
