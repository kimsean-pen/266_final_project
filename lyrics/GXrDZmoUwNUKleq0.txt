Just keep on pretending that we're nowhere
Creating everything as we go
Just keep on going till we have no fair
We're lost in the sky, we just don't care
Don't care
Yeah don't care
Yeah don't care
Don't care
Yeah don't care
We're lost in the sky, we just don't care
Someone will come as we get there
Changing all the fuss as it grows
Just keep on going untill it becomes square
We're lost in the sky, we just don't care
Don't care
Yeah don't care
Yeah don't care
Don't care
Yeah don't care
We're lost in the sky, we just don't care
Just keep on pretending that we're nowhere
Creating everything as we go
Just keep on going till we have no fair
We're lost in the sky, we just don't care
Don't care
Yeah don't care
Yeah don't care
Don't care
Yeah don't care
We're lost in the sky, we just don't care
Don't care
Don't care
