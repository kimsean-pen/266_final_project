When I held your hand
When I held your hand
When I helped you
When I held your hand
You still went the other way and you wanted me to stay with my arms streching away
With my arms streching away
I couldn't stand that sight 'cause I adored your face
I adore your face

Could it be that I'm the same
Could it be I'm your mirror showing you all those things that you never wanted to face

So you let me slip away
You just watched me walk away
And I just have to ask, do you know your fate?
Do you know your fate?

Could it be that I'm your
Could it be that you are my majesty

When it all comes back
When it all falls into place
Could it be that I don't want it anyways
Could it be as sad as that?
There was a day we used to laugh
And I wanted you by my side
The perfect match
I want to understand
The perfect match

Could it be that I'm your
Could it be that you are my majesty

You could have been my king
You could have been my king
You could have been my king
