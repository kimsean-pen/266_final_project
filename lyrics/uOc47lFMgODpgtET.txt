Broadway lights in taxi cabs
Everybody is moving fast
Uptown Downtown
What's your fame
She can take what you can bring

She gave me a light
came up to the inner city
She raise me up
and taught me to fight
Yeah

She opens my mind
I got to the late great day
The greatest town that you'll ever find

She's my heart
I love New York City
She's leaving down so many time
Yeah

Life is always tough
On New York City
Oh lord
But she's fine, she always survives
Yeah

She's the queen
and stands her ground
Nobody can take her down
Good time, bad time she can swine
ended any but a vibe

She's a rock
as...
And no one can take her freedom away
can take her freedom

I love her style
whatever she's clean or dirty
She's the greatest town that you'll ever find

She's my heart
I love New York City
She's leaving down so many time
Yeah

Life is always tough
on New York City
Oh lord
but she's fine, she always survives
Yeah

You know she's my heart
I really love New York City
She's lived and died so many times

You know life can be real tough
on my real city
but she's fine, she always survives
Yeah

She's my heart
I love New York City
She's leaving down so many time
Yeah

Life is always tough
on New York City
Oh lord
but she's fine, she always survives
Oh yeah

She's my heart
I love New York City
She's leaving down so many time
Yeah

Life is always tough
on New York City
Oh lord
but she's fine, she always survives
Oh yeah

Let's sing for New York City

Oh New York City

New York
New York

Hey New York City
New York

Let's sing for New York City
