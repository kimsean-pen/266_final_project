Playing with fire, I don't wanna burn in flames

Quitting you is so hard, but I finally got away

You's bad boy, can't be tamed

You's bad boy and you never change

I'm not a criminal, but after all that you put me through
I wouldn't mind killing you
I'm giving up on you
I'm giving up on you
I'm giving up on you
I gotta get away, never coming back again

I gotta get away, bullet from my loaded gun
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I gotta get away
I'm giving up on you
Now I smile so bright
You can see me from out of space, look at me shine
Baby, it's about time
I was so miserable and now I feel so alive

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
I feel alive

I'm giving up on you
I'm giving up on you
I'm giving up on you
I'm giving up on you

You's bad boy and you can't behave
You's bad boy and you never change
You's bad boy and you can't behave
You's bad bad bad bad bad boy

Tried to take it slow for the life of me
Every time you fall, you blame me for everything
I'm my own compass now
All the paths that you walk, I won't follow you down

I'm giving up on you
Loving you is drinking poison
Have no other choice
So I'm giving up on you

Loving you is drinking poison
Have no other choice
I'm giving up on you
I'm giving up on you
I'm giving up on you
I'm giving up on you
I gotta get away, never coming back again
I gotta get away, bullet from my loaded gun
I'm giving up on you
I'm giving up on you
I gotta get away, never coming back again
I gotta get away, bullet from my loaded gun
I'm giving up on you
I'm giving up on you
