Holding pictures in my hands now
Of the places we have been
Thinking about all our plans now
We were gonna live the dream

We used to drink together
See the night through
Hand in hand, you led me into things I never knew
You're drinking up the cure now
Forget that you were seen
I sit here analyzing what the hell is wrong with me

I will be your home, keep you warm when it's cold
I will try to be what you need when you're low
I can only promise the girl that I am
I'll do anything that I can

Meet me on the road to recovery, recovery
Meet me on the road to recovery, recovery
You're the only one who recovers me, recovers me
Meet me on the road to recovery, recovery
Meet me on the road

You would lie with arms around me
I'd be singing you to sleep
Every morning wake up to me
No one else you'd rather see

If we could take some time out
Remember where we've been
The only one I know now
I can't just let you leave
I know it won't be easy
They tell me all the time
But nothing would be harder
Than knowing you're not mine

I will be your home, keep you warm when it's cold
I will try to be what you need when you're low
I can only promise the girl that I am
I'll do anything that I can

Meet me on the road to recovery, covery
Meet me on the road to recovery, covery
You're the only one who recovers me, covers me
Meet me on the road to recovery, covery
Meet me on the road

I can't fake it, it's never enough
It's got a hold on me
Left behind here, I can't keep up
Can't get a hold of me
I was thinking if I could be tough
You'd wanna hold onto me
Hold onto me
Hold onto me

I will be your home, keep you warm when it's cold
I will try to be what you need when you're low
I can only promise the girl that I am
I'll do anything that I can

Meet me on the road to recovery, recovery
Meet me on the road to recovery, recovery
You're the only one who recovers me, recovers me
Meet me on the road to recovery, recovery
Meet me on the road
(Recovery, recovery)
(It's got a hold on me)
