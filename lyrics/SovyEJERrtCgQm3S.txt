Here in the light
It burns you up inside
Here in the shell of a sun
We echo on

Too much listening
Not enough living

And you say
What did I say
What did you, you say
We just go away, go away, go away

It helps you out
Knowing I'm left out
Locked in a box with a light
That won't shine

Turn it on and wait for
Someone to come

And you say
What did I say
What did you, you say
We just go away, go away, go away

I'm here now, waiting
Holding on to reasons
Wasted I faced it
Watching you deny me

Here in the light
It burns you out sometimes
Here in the shell of a sun
We echo on

Left alone forever
All alone together

And you say
What did I say
What did you, you say
We just go away, go away, go away

And you say
What did I say
What did you, you say
We just go away, go away, go away
