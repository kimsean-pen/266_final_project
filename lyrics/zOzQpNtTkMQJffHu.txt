How's the weather in Jersey
I bet it's cold and grey
I heard you're drinking
Don't lie to me

I don't want to bury you
This winter it's too soon
Don't make me come back home
From LA

'Cause I've lost so many
To the bottle, or the needle
I can't take another funeral

I'm not giving up today
Noooo
Everyone I love
Everyone I love is still in pain

I'm not giving up today
Nooooo
Everyone I love
Everyone I love needs to be saved

The sky at dawn it seems
So calm and promising
I can't believe that you're
Still breathing

Don't you want to believe
This life, it means something
No one can save you
But yourself this time

I'm not giving up today
Nooooo
Everyone I love
Everyone I love is still in pain

I'm not giving up today
Nooooo
Everyone I love
Everyone I love needs to be saved

I found myself
In a place where all my days were numbered
I overcame all my demons
And I know that you can too
You can too
What have you got to lose

I'm not giving up today
Nooooo
Everyone I love
Everyone I love is still in pain

I'm not giving up today
Nooooo
Everyone I love
Everyone I love needs to be saved
