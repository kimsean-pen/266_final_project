Fuck these emotions, I don't need them
People switch up like the seasons
These emotions, I don't need them
People switch up like the seasons
I pay no mind to no other mind, get what's mine
I do it on my time
I pay no mind to no other mind, get what's mine
I do it on my time
(I'm not the one)
I might've said I'd never run from you
That I'd never be done with you
At the time I told the truth
(I'm not the one)
Fuck these emotions, I don't need them
All these emotions, I don't need them
I pay no mind to no other mind, get what's mine
I pay no mind to no other mind, get what's mine
I do it on my time
