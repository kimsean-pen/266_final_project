I'm coming home!

The way those eyes look at me as I'm about to leave
I hold you close, can't you see
That I just wanna stay with you, I promise to
Write you letters and I'll be back soon
Don't you worry, I won't let us fall apart
(I won't let us fall apart)

No matter how far we find ourselves
Our love will keep us close
I want you to know, you will never be alone
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
I want you to know, I'm coming home!

Everyday it gets harder and harder to breathe
Why can't we make believe
That we've got it all and we're young and we're free
You're really all I need
I never found the right words to say
Kept it all inside, ignoring every ache
I get lost trying to close the distance between us
But I will follow my heart back to you

No matter how far we find ourselves
Our love will keep us close
I want you to know, you will never be alone
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
I want you to know, I'm coming home

Take my hand just one more time
It's safe to leave your doubts behind
I will be with you through the lonely days and the lonely nights
I will follow my heart back to you
I will follow my heart back to you
Take my hand just one more time
It's safe to leave your doubts behind
I will be with you through the lonely days and the lonely nights

Take my hand just one more time
It's safe to leave your doubts behind
I will be with you through the lonely days and the lonely nights

No matter how far we find ourselves
Our love will keep us close
I want you to know, you will never be alone
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
I want you to know, I'm coming home
