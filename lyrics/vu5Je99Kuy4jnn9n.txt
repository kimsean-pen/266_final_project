Ah, shit
Lovell, you one crazy motherfucker
And I love you for that
And if anybody got a problem
With you they got a
Problem with me, yeah

Do my dance,
Ya, do my dance I like
Do my dance,
Do my dance in that bitch
I do my dance,
Do my dance, ya
Do my dance, ayy, ya

Saw you at the party,
You was faded
This shit so outdated,
Show me how to play this
Drive you to your crib
Because it's raining
Park up, then I came in,
Grip you on the way in
Strip you down, wipe
That makeup off your face
Bitch, slow down,
I ain't tryna run no race
Eat that pussy up,
I forgot to say my grace
Drinking up this cup,
I don't know my fucking place
Take you 'round with gang,
'Cause you not no fucking fan
Show you 'round the city,
I'm the boss up in this land
I been through so much,
Take a look inside my bag
All you see is money, this
Shit covers up my past, bitch

Ayy, you sensible,
Tell 'em send some more
Tryna make you mine
But you a cannibal
Showing me your shit,
It ain't original
Listen to your head,
It's so simple
Think you ready but you
Walking with a limp though
Think you ready but that
Nigga got a pistol (Sweet), ayy

Do my dance, ya,
Do my dance I like
Do my dance,
Do my dance in that bitch
I do my dance,
Do my dance, ya
Do my dance, ayy, ya
