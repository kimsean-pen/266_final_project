As long as things sit pretty over here
Don't hesitate to dolefully flatline over there

Don't overstep (Don't overstep)
Cover your hole please...
Cover your hole please but not in my glory - Don't!

Deluge a chasm
Deluge a chasm (Deluge a chasm)
Deluge a chasm, deluge a chasm

As long as things sit pretty over here
Don't hesitate to dolefully flatline over there

Depart this dominion
Depart this dominion please
Depart this dominion please and slope off to your cesspit...
Cesspits!

Equal footing, as it would seem, in pursuant to containing the human sludge
In pursuant to containing the human sludge
In pursuant to containing the human sludge
Rank sludge, foul sludge, the sludge
Rank sludge, foul sludge, the sludge

Standing of the near-immaculate must still be shielded from...
The unfortunate's junk
The unfortunate's junk
Just junk, weird junk, the junk
Just junk, weird junk, the junk
The Junk

As long as things sit pretty over there
Passed off as equal footing, equal footing, equal footing, equal footing
Cesspits
