Face down, I fall to the floor.
Can't say I've never been here before.
So frustrating, debilitating,
This emptiness there must be more.

It's taking over me,
I don't know what to believe,
Forgetting everything
That makes me, makes me real.
I find an enemy,
In every word that you say,
I won't let you replace,
What makes me, makes me real.

Start, stop, start over again,
Even though you know that this will end.
So frustrating, aggravating,
I lost myself when I let you in.

But I will find myself again,
So don't you say, that you understand.

It's taking over me,
I don't know what to believe,
Forgetting everything
That makes me, makes me real.
I find an enemy,
In every word that you say,
I won't let you replace,
What makes me, makes me real.

You won't take the best of me.

Start, stop, start over again,
Even though you know that everything ends

It's taking over me,
I don't know what to believe,
Forgetting everything
That makes me, makes me real.
I find an enemy,
In every word that you say,
I won't let you replace,
What makes me, makes me real.
