There's a light
A certain kind of light
That never shown on me
I want my life to be
To lived with you
To lived with you
There's a way
Everybody says

To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
If I ain't got you
I ain't got you

Baby you don't know what it's like

Baby you don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you
In my mind
I see your face again

I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind

But I'm blind
So very blind

I'm a man
Can't you see what i am
I live and breathe for you

But what good does it do

If I ain't got you
If I ain't got you, baby
You don't know what it's like
Baby you don't know what it's like

To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you
You don't know what it's like
Baby you don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
To love somebody
To love somebody
You don't know
To love somebody
The way i love you
You don't know
You don't know
To love somebody
To love somebody
You don't know
Oohooo...
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you
