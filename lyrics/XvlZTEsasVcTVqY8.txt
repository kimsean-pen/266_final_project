And when I think
Of everything that we did together
Somewhere in Verona
The sunset over our time together
Thinking it over
So young and sentimental
Our hearts so gentle
Such a shame we had to drift apart

Oh, but I can't help just wonder
To be lost forever
I watch the sunset
And somethings telling me that I gotta get up and chase it
ahlalala...
Ba, nanana...

Day of transit
The gentle weight of your head on my shoulder
I wake you with the last stop
Your sleepy eyes in the gloomy weather
Raining in Florence
Your cold hands in the wet hair
While we're cursing
Cheap umbrellas trying to get home

Now we're written in history
We closed the book we opened up
There will always be a place in my heart
But baby can't you see we were meant to fall apart

We gave it up
Who would have thought love wasn't enough
In the end we say
Bye my love guess I'll see you some day
