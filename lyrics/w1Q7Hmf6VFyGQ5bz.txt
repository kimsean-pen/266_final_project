Chaos has descended in "Carandiru", the biggest penitentiary complex in South America
Over a hundred inmates dead and hundreds injured on the massacre
The police arrived with helicopters and over two hundred armed forces

They took the jailblock called "Pavilhão Nove"
And opened fire on the inmates in a holocaust method of annihilation
The government of the city of São Paulo cannot control the brutality of its police

Holocaust
Body piles
Confrontation
Mutilation

Discipline
Ignorance
Conflagration
Torture

Over eighty percent of the inmates were not sentenced yet
The bodies were filled with bullets and bites from the police dogs
The police try to hide the massacre saying there were only eight deaths

The violence of Brazilian cops is very well known outside Brazil
This kind of extermination is a method that they use to get rid of the overpopulation in the jails
The violence of the cops left the whole pavilion destroyed after the rebellion

"Pavilhão Nove"
