God damn, God damn
Uh
God damn, God damn
Yeah
God damn, God damn
Yeah

Yeah, look, aye
You got that heat?
Boy I came to kill the game you ain't gotta ask twice
If you ain't ready for the fame
Get up out my lane nigga this the fast life
I'm tryna cop a couple chains
And a diamond rang shining like a flashlight
And have them saying damn that's nice
I ain't never seen nothin that bright
Like, that's right
I know you heard about the name you ain't gotta act like it
Besides I'm worried bout the deals, making hella sales
Tryna get the cash right
I wanna eat the type of meals
Niggas probably still couldn't get at half price
And buy a crib up in the hills for a couple mil,
Did it with my skill

Niggas better act right beside me
If it's drama then you can find me
Niggas sell they soul you can't buy me
I ain't never gettin' on my knees
I don't want friends or colleagues
Why the fuck you worried about what I eat
If a nigga hungry come try me
I got seafood and chinese
I serve em like it's nothin' til I'm stunting overseas
Bitch stop frontin
Hoe you know you can't put nothin' over me
I'm the hottest fuckin' youngin'
They been bumping my releases
You gon see this, Wavy flow gon' make them sea sick

God damn, God damn, God damn, God damn
God damn, God damn, God damn, God damn
Kill the game, man I am
Fuck the change stack my bands
Kill the game, man I am
Fuck the change stack my bands
God damn, God damn, God damn, God damn
God damn, God damn, God damn, God damn
Kill the game, man I am
Fuck the change stack my bands
Kill the game, man I am
Fuck the change stack my bands

Okay, look
Aaron may commit murders
Aaron may cop converters
Aaron may switch the flow up
Yo some shit you never ever heard of
Fuck anyone who say he not
The way bring hell but they pray he stop
The minute this blow, he a school dropout
If he seen an AP with an AP watch
Or a Bentley, a brand new Range
A hundred thousand inside the bank
My dreams are just not the same
I ain't finna work for no pocket change
And I don't ask nigga, I proclaim
I let you know we is not the same
I give you work I do not complain
I'm winning now who you got to blame

God damn, God damn, God damn, God damn
God damn, God damn, God damn, God damn
Kill the game, man I am
Fuck the change stack my bands
Kill the game, man I am
Fuck the change stack my bands
God damn, God damn, God damn, God damn
God damn, God damn, God damn, God damn
Kill the game, man I am
Fuck the change stack my bands
Kill the game, man I am
Fuck the change stack my bands
