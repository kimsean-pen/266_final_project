Woke up this morning, I was late,
off out on the dark side,
With the moon and the room
on the wrong side.

I took a needle for myself
right back at the seams,
I saw my universal gleam.

I see the wonder of life
and look for the wall,
Taking a walk in the sun.
In time, in just a second like
the ghost of a bad idea,
I feel myself getting the fear.

Come on, have we decided if we
like being part of the plan.
It sends us shifting
and there's nowhere to land
It's on;
it doesn't matter if
all of these tickets are sold
and all the old stories are told
I know
you're gonna tell me that you hear every word I say
But the future gets written today;
Yeah the future gets written today.

Don't be deceived when our revolution
has been finally stamped out
and they pat you eternally on the shoulder
and say that there's no inequality worth
speaking of and no more reason for fighting
because if you believe them they will be completely in charge
in their marble homes and granite banks
from which they rob the people of the world
under the pretense of bringing them culture.

Watch out, for as soon as it pleases them they'll send you out
to protect their gold in wars whose weapons,
rapidly developed by servile scientists,
will become more and more deadly
until they can with a flick of the finger
tear a million of you to pieces.
