We're just waiting for our man
To come through with a plan
Of how the hell we turn this round
And dig ourselves out of the ground

We don't really want to know
The things you claim to know
It could fall around our ears
Might not hurt for years and years

We're just waiting for our man
To come through with a plan
Of how the hell we turn this round
And dig ourselves out of the ground

We don't really want to know
The things you claim you know
It could fall around our ears
Might not hurt for years and years

We're just waiting
We're just waiting
We're just waiting
We're just waiting
We're just waiting
We're just waiting
We're just waiting
We're just waiting
We're just waiting

We're just waiting for our man
Of how the hell we turn this round
And dig ourselves out of the ground

We don't really want to know
It could fall around our ears
Might not hurt for years and years

We're just waiting for our man
Of how the hell we turn this round
And dig ourselves out of the ground...

We don't really want to know
It could fall around our ears
Might not hurt for years and years
