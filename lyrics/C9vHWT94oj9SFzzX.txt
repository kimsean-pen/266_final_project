Yeah, I will take your side
You make me feel like I've been waiting my whole life
And I could die
To find that simple kind of love
You can't deny
(Just say it)

I wanna believe in your love again
Despite what anybody says
'Cause it ain't enough to mean it
When you feel it once
And you know it
So just say it

And you were just sitting quiet in the back of the car
Just sucking on your cigarette
But your eyes, they sold you out again
They always do, so say it
Just say it
Or at least, kiss me just to shut me up

I will take your side
You make me feel like I've been waiting my whole life
And I could die
To find that simple kind of love
You can't deny
(Just say it)

Been talking about it until I killed my voice
But it didn't change a single thing
It's that simple truth
That always means the most to you
And you know it
So just say it

And we were spilling wine on your best friend's bed
When you said this was ridiculous
And you kissed me just because
You knew it'd shut me up
All right, woman, say it
Just say it

I will take your side
You make me feel like I've been waiting my whole life
And I could die
To find that simple kind of love
You can't deny
(Just say it)

Say it like you mean it
Say it like you mean it
Baby, won't you stay awhile?

Say it like you mean it
Say it like you mean it
I'm begging you, baby
Won't you stay awhile?

Yeah, I will take your side
You make me feel like I've been waiting
Feel like I've been

Yeah, I will take your side
You make me feel like I've been waiting my whole life

I will take your side
You make me feel like I've been
Waiting my whole life
And I could die
To find that simple kind of love
You can't deny

And I could die
To find that simple kind of love
You can't deny
(Just say it)
