HEATER MOVES AND EYES

Problem mines burnin holes through my walls
You were the best thing in my life and now
Heater moves much more than my heart
And stops without a word

Mouths full of your face and truth
And I've been waiting for a pin like you
I waited and seated a year of truce
Your scowl was allowed
You were in love
But you are in love
