I've been angry
I've been changing
Always something
Always saying
I've been disappointed lately

Somethings come up
I can't go out
Tell me after, take a picture
I've been disappointed lately

Must be high if you think that you're gettin' ahead
No it never begins, no it never begins
You're a girl and a girl isn't welcome in here
Yeah it is what it is, yeah it is what it is

You were right, you were right, you were right all along
You're better than me, I'm never enough
In my head, in my head I thought I was more
Somewhere to be, somewhere to go
You were right, you were right, you were right all along
So I'll pack my shit up and go

I've been binging
I've been purging
I'll be skinny at least that's something
I've been disappointed lately
Somethings come up
I can't go out
You know a lot could happen
I've been disappointed lately

Must be high if you think that you're gettin' ahead
No it never begins, no it never never
You're a girl and a girl isn't welcome in here
Yeah it is what it is, yeah it is what it is

You were right, you were right, you were right all along
You're better than me, I'm never enough
In my head, in my head I thought I was more
Somewhere to be, somewhere to go
You were right, you were right, you were right all along
So I'll pack my shit up and go

I'm going
I'm gone
I'm going
I'm gone
I'm going

You were right, you were right, you were right all along
You're better than me, I'm never enough
In my head, in my head I thought I was more
So I'll pack my shit up
You were right, you were right, you were right all along
You're better than me, I'm never enough
In my head, in my head I thought I was more
Somewhere to be, somewhere to go
You were right, you were right, you were right all along
So I'll pack my shit up and go

I'm gone
I'm going
I'm gone
I'm going
I'm gone
