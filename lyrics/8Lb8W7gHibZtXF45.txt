When you cut your lover's slack
You'll get a fucking monster back
Formations indiscreet
It's just an acrobatic trick
Disintegrate at 2000 feet
Vanished into mercury
Light aircraft on fire
Light aircraft on

Tombstone Queen Victoria
Was an ex wing-walker
Everybody ignored her
Everybody implored her to
Vanish into the radio
Disappear in the waveband snow
Light aircraft on fire
Light aircraft on
Light aircraft on fire
Light aircraft on fire
Light aircraft on fire
Light aircraft on fire

Disappear at 2000 feet
Disintegrate into mercury
There's a dark premonition
An accident will happen
There's a pre-science preacher in the cabin
Everybody eat your dust
Everybody love your dust
Light aircraft on fire
Light aircraft on
