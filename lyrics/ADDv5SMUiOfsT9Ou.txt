We don't care what they say
We will be here all day
We'll stay here till it's over
Till the world's out of sight
We will stand
We will fight
It's not over till it's over

As I fell to the ocean floor
Feeling light through an open door
Saw myself rise with the water
They thought they could keep me down,
Hold their breath and watch me drown,
but all they did has pushed me higher.

We don't care what they say
We will be here all day
We'll stay here till it's over
Till the world's out of sight
We will stand
We will fight
It's not over till it's over
Through the night and the rain
Through the time and the pain
We'll stand and we'll never fall
And then at the end of it all
We will win, we will chant
It's not over till it's over.
