Mommy, mommy, mommy
Look at your son
You might have loved me
But now I got a gun
You better stay out of my way
I think I've had a bad day
I've had a bad day
I've had a bad day

Daddy, daddy, daddy
Proud of your son
He got him a good job
Killing niggers and Mexicans
I'll tell you something, and it's true
You can't find justice, it'll find you
It'll find you

It'll find you

People tell policemen
They've met their match
Down in them desert sands
The Dicks were hatched
Dicks hates policemen, and it's true
You can't find justice, it'll find you
It'll find you

It'll find you
It'll find you

Mommy, mommy
Look at your son
Maybe you once loved me
But now I got a gun
You better stay out of my way
Hey, I've had a bad day
I've had a bad day
Mommy, I've had a bad day
Mommy, I've had a bad day
Mommy, I've had a bad day
