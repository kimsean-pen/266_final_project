We tried to fight for what we thought that we believed in
Maybe it was all for nothing (I bet that it was all for nothing)
So we drive 'cause we like to be alone
There's nowhere for us to go
There's nowhere for us to go

How can you think that any of this was easy
With all the friends I've lost along the way?
When this is over, we're all getting older now
And we all play a part in it
Innocence is falling, can you hear them calling now?
But I'll be by your side until the end

We tried to fight, I guess sometimes you find it's pointless
As long as you can live with yourself
(Tell me how you live with yourself)
So it's time that we take the open road
There's nowhere for us to go
There's nowhere for us to go

How can you think that any of this was easy
With all the friends I've lost along the way?
When this is over, we're all getting older now
And we all play a part in it
Innocence is falling, can you hear them calling now?
But I'll be by your side until the end

To all my friends, let's make this count
We're not alone, not alone

How can you think that any of this was easy
With all the friends I've lost along the way?
When this is over, we're all getting older now
And we all play a part in it
Innocence is falling, can you hear them calling now?
And I'll be by your side until the end
