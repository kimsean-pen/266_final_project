I'm a liability
I'm a liability
Much for me
You're a little much for me, no, no, no, no
Whatcha gonna do?

All of the dreams that get harder
All of the things that I offer you
And all of the shit that we harbour
Make all of the kids in the choirs sing woo-hoo

Maybe all this is the party
Maybe the tears and the highs we breathe
Maybe all this is the party
Maybe we just do it violently

But you're not what you thought you were
But you're not what you thought you were
(Liability)
But you're not what you thought you were
(Make you leave)
But you're not what you thought you were
(You leave)
