You were insecure but I was so sure
But I wanted you
Yes I'm powerful, and a little girl
But I wanted you

So I told you so, wanted you to know
We've just one life to live
And I told you all my dreams and fears
And you looked at me and your eyes filled with tears
And you said those three words I'd been waiting for
You became a part of me, Yeah

You're Mine, For Life, And I'll be by your side
We are entwined, You're mine, for life,
Hold me until we die, I'm yours and you are mine
I'm yours, You're mine, I'm Yours, You're Mine

Now I'm so happy you found a place for me
Boy you wanted me
Some security and two heart beats
Boy you wanted me
Then you told me so wanted me to know
You let the past go

And I told you all my dreams and fears
And you looked at me and your eyes filled with tears
And you said those three words I'd been waiting for
You became a part of me, Yeah

You're Mine, For Life, And I'll be by your side
We are entwined, You're mine, for life,
Hold me until we die, I'm yours and you are mine
I'm yours, You're mine, I'm Yours, You're Mine

I'm yours, you're mine, I'm yours, you're mine
