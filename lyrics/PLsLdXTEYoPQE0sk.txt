I don't want to write this cause if I do it might be true
No I can't fight this I'm never able to get through
I can't deny ya and I'll be damned if it's not you who told me:
"I want you to need me"
And you left so none of it was true

How many times did you lie
You'd tell me anything
To hide this 'till you said goodbye

And now everything's wrong
Yeah, it's been so long
Am I the man that I promised to be
Did I let you down, tarnish your crown
Cause everything is wrong (Wrong)
Everything is wrong

So please believe me, when I say this was in vein
I trusted naively, let you go on with your charade
You'll just deceive me
I didn't try to make you stay you told me
You're planning to leave me
Then you left but none of that was

How many times did you lie
You'd tell me anything
To hide this 'till you said goodbye

And now everything's wrong
It's been so long
Am I the man that I promised to be
Did I let you down, tarnish your crown
Cause everything is wrong (Wrong)
Everything is wrong

Am I the man that I promised to be
Did I let you down, tarnish your crown
Cause everything is wrong (Wrong)
Everything is wrong

Everything is wrong
It's been so long
So long
So long
So long
