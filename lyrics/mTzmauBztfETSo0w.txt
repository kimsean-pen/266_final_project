we've waited for this day
we shared some tears of love now
like a desert in the rain
when the sun of the day went down

there's nobody like my mom
there's no place like my home since I was born
when I was young
the flavour is so strong
I've missed it so long now

these people are my heroes
from distant sky / from this to the sky (??)
they light me up with flying clouds
this ever gets me high like a cool blunt smoke

I'm shining like the moon
I'm feeling like a bloom in the bright sun
I remember when i was young
the flavour is so strong
I've missed it so long
