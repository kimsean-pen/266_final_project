Invisible is just a word.
Gotta shake of the dust and the mold.
Because I've got this feeling deep inside, and it's moving me.
Oh, and it's burning me...
So let's sing together:

"We've got honey dripping through our veins now baby.
Sweetest we've ever been."

Listen well: I don't care where you've been.
I don't care where you're from.
There's honey dripping through these veins, babe.
I never knew that I'd feel such a swell.
Been so long, not a care, and now I know you've all got what I need the most.

As soon as we walked in this place, my essence, it did return.
My lovely dears you all nurtured it, making it so pure, and I feel you so much more.

Dance with me through the night.
We'll feel all right.
We'll make it last all night.
Dance with me through the night.
We'll take this love, and make it last all night.
When we're together, it's elation I've never known.

Baby, baby, don't you know?
For far too long I've been caught up in nostalgia.
I almost thought the feeling was gone.
Couldn't have been more wrong.
It came flooding back when we all sang:

"We've got honey dripping though our veins now baby.
Sweetest we've ever been."

Dance with me through the night.
We'll feel all right.
We'll make it last all night.
Dance with me through the night.
We'll take this love, and make it last all night.
When we're together, it's elation I've never known.
When we're together, I've got so much to give.
When we're together, it's elation I've never known.
When we're together, I've got so much to give.

Now, my troubles, they are gone.
Now, my troubles, they all fall away.
(I've never heard you sing, but now I'm listening.)
Can I ever find another night that will feel this way?
