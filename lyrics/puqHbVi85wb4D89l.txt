I saw a white finger on a barbed wire fence.
I knew it was dangerous, but I took the risk.
And yes it was sweet, so sweet to eat.
Now see how the flesh is pricked, and bleeds.
Yeah, it bleeds, it bleeds, see how it bleeds...
I saw a little baby crawling down the street.
I said hey come over here baby, you look good enough to eat.
I said come over here dear, you know what I'll do.
Well I'll make you my mirror of the things that I chew.
Little yum-yab.
Little yum-yab.
We are the wild.
We are the risk.
Come little yum-yab.
Come slash your wrist.
We are the wild.
We are the risk.
Come little yum-yab.
Gimme a kiss.
Now blow your brains out.
I'll blow your brains out.
