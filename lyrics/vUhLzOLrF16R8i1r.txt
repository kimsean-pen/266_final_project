I'm needing a better resistance
Shading either side
I really wish I could reset, rewind
Someone has clawed out my eyes
Can't identify

I really wish I could reset, rewind
You know it's never the way we planned it
I really wish we could reset, rewind

I'm planning a revolution inside my head
I'm planning a revolution when I break free
I call for annihilation
Describe the sunlight so I can feel its burn
If only I could give up this plan

I don't know what they told you
But this place is not what you say
Reset, rewind

Living inside a hole
They put me underground
Where they can never find me
Unless they dig me out

I search for the answers
'Cause this is the end
I search for the answers

God, it's hanging out on me, I feel it watching
But no one seems to care anymore
Empty, I think of a way out
'Cause when I breathe in, there's no relief

I can't believe this, I can't believe this
My mind is starting to turn on me

I've been living inside a hole
They put me underground
Where they can never find me
Unless they dig me out

I've been living inside a hole
Where they can never find me
Unless they dig me out
