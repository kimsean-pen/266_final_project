Dead dreams and debauchery scenes
I spent the last 3 bucks
On the last thing that I'll need
There's no way that I'll end in the black for this term
Guess I got a lot to learn

Eight hours on the top of a bus
Just to find out in the end
I will never stop fallin' in love

I'm alright and I'm always getting better
Let the fire burn low cause we like it that
We let the ash flow down
Our throats so stout but we don't mind the burn
We will never ever let it go out

Open doors and sweat soaked floors
You find it hard to miss your family
When everyday you're part of one more
Just slow down, baby take it all in
And I promise you will never be angry again after this

Kicked out of the liquor store
But we're not the type of guys to fall asleep on the floor anyway
"You wanna join me for dinner?"
Man I got so much to do,
But never once did I expect it not to tear me in two

I'm alright and I'm always getting better
Let the fire burn high cause we like it that
We let the ash flow down
Our throats so stout but we don't mind the burn
We will never ever let it go out
