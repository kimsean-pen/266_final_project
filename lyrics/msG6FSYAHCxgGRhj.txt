five state-school lots
five girls at cost
that thing we know
the whole township lost
but

maybe it's love
maybe run luck
I'll man the bed
hammer out love

snow scenes level lonely bastards
eight feet of earth
the whole thing suddenly worth
faster gun
main motor down
and no shot left at the crown
faster gun

black jetty rock
rock splitter's shot
saddle creek stars
I miss them a lot
but

cable-car heights
cable snaps right
each devil out
out finding fights

faster gun
snow scenes level lonely bastards
eight feet of earth
the whole thing suddenly worth
faster gun
main motor down
and no shot left at the crown
faster gun
faster gun
faster gun
faster gun
faster gun
