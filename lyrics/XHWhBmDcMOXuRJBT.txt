"how can we give them something new
that's serious but entertaining too?"

The wind blows relieving the chain gang the whole thing
The full moon the war drums lookin for
a pulse here if Mother Earth's got one
How far down can we really go
Maybe all the way
Well I don't know
But when you get there tellem I sent ya
And I want the army back that I lent him

Heartbeats
Like the earth is pulsating and
there are shovels tearing into the ground
And we gotta wake the dead up and we gotta wake the dead up now
Like there are people in my city and
they're demons and they're running all around
It's enough to give a dead man a heartbeat

I walk through the graveyard like the police walk through prisons
Knowing I put some of these boys here but
these boys aren't as forgiving so they'll haunt me
I dug him up cuz I missed him
And I was all in and Ill soon join him and well settle our difference

Heartbeats
Like the earth is pulsating and
there are shovels tearing into the ground
And we gotta wake the dead up and we gotta wake the dead up now
Like there are people in my city and
they're demons and they're running all around
It's enough to give a dead man a heartbeat

Heartbeats
Like the earth is pulsating and
there are shovels tearing into the ground
And we gotta wake the dead up and we gotta wake the dead up now
Like there are people in my city and
they're demons and they're running all around
It's enough to give a dead man a heartbeat
