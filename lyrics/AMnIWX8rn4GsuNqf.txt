Hands in my sleeves
I've choked too many times before
She lets go of me
And I look her in her eyes once more

Your sister tells me
That you're moving on
And never going back
But I'll outrun the truth
Because you know that I won't
Face the fact
I don't wanna hear that

'Cause I'm not ready to
Throw in the towel and give up on you
No, I'm not ready to
Throw in the towel and give up on you
I say I'm sick of all these games
But in the end you know I'll stay
'Cause I'm not ready to throw in the towel
And give up on you
Up on you

Can I interrogate your mind?
Do you mind?
Do you mind?
What made your soul begin
To resign from mine
And leave me in this state of mind?

I'll let you go now

But I'm not ready to
Throw in the towel and give up on you
No I'm not ready to
Throw in the towel and give up on you
I say I'm sick of all these games
But in the end you know I'll stay
'Cause I'm not ready to throw in the towel
And give up on you
Up on you

Well I thought we
Were running on the same wavelength
I guess that I was wrong babe

Well I thought we (I'll let you go now)
Were running on the same wavelength (no, I'm not ready to)
I guess that I was wrong babe (throw in the towel)
