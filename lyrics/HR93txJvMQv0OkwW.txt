Starwatcher, starwatcher in the night
Starwatcher, starwatcher bend the light

There's a rider on the road
There's calamity awaiting to unfold
There is poison in the well
There's the arbor of a distant ringing bell
It's says: hold, hold, hold your ground

Skywatcher, skywatcher rules the day
Skywatcher, skywatcher cruel and fey

There are figures on the shore
At the laundromat, they're whispering of war
There's a lady on the stairs
All a-shambling with thistles in her hair
Singing: hold, hold, hold your ground
Hold, hold, hold your ground

Starwatcher, starwatcher in the night
