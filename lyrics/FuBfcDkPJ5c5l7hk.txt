I feel your heat through my body
Whenever you move
You know that I can't control it
With the things that you do
I'm just a fool for you

I'll take the chance on waiting for you
Can't hide my feelings, you see right through
Do you feel it too, you're

Taking my breath away
I know that I'm here to stay
You're taking my breath away
I can't be wrong, it feels so strong
And it's never gonna stop

It feels like years every second, that you are gone
You know I'd die if you left me
Left me alone, you keep me holding on

I'll take the chance on waiting for you
Can't hide my feelings, you see right through
Do you feel it too, you're

Taking my breath away
I know that I'm here to stay
You're taking my breath away
I can't be wrong, it feels so strong, cause
You're taking my breath away
I know that I'm here to stay
You're taking my breath away
I can't be wrong, it feels so strong
And it's never gonna stop, I hit the top

(Guitar solo)

It feels so strong
I can't be wrong, no no
You've got my temperature rising
When you come around
Won't cha come around
You push my heart to the limit
Don't let me down cause baby I found, you're

Taking my breath away
I know that I'm here to stay
You're taking my breath away
I can't be wrong, it feels so strong, cause
You're taking my breath away
I know that I'm here to stay
You're taking my breath away
I can't be wrong, it feels so strong
I can't be wrong
I can't be wrong
I can't be wrong
I can't be wrong

End
