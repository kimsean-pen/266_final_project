In a restless house,
You're feeling wired,
Like I want to disarm you,
They're only useless thought.

These moments in your head,
They leave you tired 'coz they move and alarm you,
They're only thoughts.

Hey,
You're caught in a dream,
More than it seems,
More than it seems.

Should I move my gaze,
I'd miss you smile in the moments your honest,
Honest to a fault.
Therse visions you defend,
You bring them home 'coz they're starving without you,
Starving thoughts

Hey,
You're caught in a dream,
More than it seems,
More than it seems.

Hey,
You're caught in a dream,
More than it seems,
More than it seems.

But you're heading for the pills,
'coz there's nothing but time,
Provision turns to strangers.

But you're heading for the pills,
'coz there's nothing but time,
Provision turns to strangers.

Hey,
You're caught in a dream,
More than it seems,
More than it seems.

Hey,
You're caught in a dream,
More than it seems,
More than it seems.

Should I move my gaze,
I'd miss your smile,
In the moments you're honest,
Honest to a fault.
Should I move the haze,
You'll find yourself in the fear of aloneness,
In a restless house.
