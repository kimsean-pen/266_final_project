Lipstick has a way of leaving more than just a mark on my sheets
Coloring my senses cherry red, at least for this week
Kisses under starry night skies, talked about in song
We play along, so bittersweet by our design
I'm sick and tired of writing songs about you
This is it, this is the end

Take off your makeup and put down the camera
Choke on the drama that makes me want to
Tear up the pictures, the pages you've saved
Creating a life of trends and make believe

I've got no place in my heart
For a criminal like you to dwell
In this endeavor, make this last forever
I'm just delirious, you can't be serious
You're so infamous for leaving me a mess

Take off your makeup and put down the camera
Choke on the drama that makes me want to
T-t-t-tear up the pictures, the pages you've saved
Creating a life of trends and make believe

She gets what she wants
And she breaks what she gets
Get out while you can
Or she'll tear you to pieces

She gets what she wants
And she breaks what she gets
Get out while you can
Or she'll tear you to pieces
"Are you having a good time sweetheart?"

Take off your makeup and put down the camera
Choke on the drama that makes me want to
Tear up the pictures, the pages you've saved
Creating a life of trends and make believe
Carry on home
I'll be waiting miles and miles away
Leaving you to be forever seventeen
Cleaning up the messes that you've made
