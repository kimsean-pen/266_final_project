Sometimes I can be a fucking airhead

(So tie me to your fingertips)

Being lonely is different than being alone
Like when you call and nobody picks up the phone
Sometimes it's nice to get away from the noise
It's your choice (It's your choice)
But I just miss your voice in the morning when nobody's up
You're talking loud cause you just don't give a fuck
Let's have a joint with our coffee and tea
I'm not afraid cause I know that you love me

Sometimes I can be a fucking airhead
So tie me to your fingertips so I don't float away
Sometimes I think I'd rather be alive than dead
So tie me to your fingertip

Crush me girl, crush my dreams
Show me pain, show me what gravity means
Pull me down to my knees
Make me real, I'm begging you please
('Cause I know that you love me)

Sometimes I can be a fucking airhead
So tie me to your fingertips so I don't float away
Sometimes I think I'd rather be alive than dead
So tie me to your fingertip

Crush me girl, crush my dreams
Show me pain, show me what gravity means
Pull me down to my knees
Make me real, I'm begging you please
('Cause I know that you love me)

Sometimes I can be a fucking airhead
So tie me to your fingertips so I don't float away
Sometimes I think I'd rather be alive than dead
So tie me to your fingertip

Sometimes I can be a fucking airhead
So tie me to your fingertips so I don't float away
Sometimes I think I'd rather be alive than dead
So tie me to your fingertip

Sometimes I think I'd rather be alive than dead
So tie me to your fingertip
