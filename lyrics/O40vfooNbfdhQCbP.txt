Can't be bothered you ain't my father
Sitting in the corner trying to do away with you (you)
(Back and forth you're rocking in my head)
Maybe I should phone you
Then again I could not too (ahh)
(walk it out walk it out)
Feeling like a loner gotta do away with you
(Back and forth you're rockin in my head
Rock rockin in my head
Rock rocking)
But I'm over it
Can't be bothered you ain't my father
Like I'm over it
Can't be bothered you ain't my father
Twist it break it drop it pick me up again
Burning me burning me like the muffin man
Lift it fix it hang it like an ornament
Like an ornament, I ain't no ornament
Twist it break it drop it drop it drop it
Twist it lift it break it drop it
Pick me up again (ornament)
Lift it fix it hang it like an ornament
Like like an ornament I ain't no ornament
I wish you were someone different
I wish I was someone
(rock rockin in my)
Someone
(rock rockin)
(rock rockin in my)
I wish i was someone
Twist it break it drop it pick me up again
Burning me burning me like the muffin man
Lift it fix it hang it like an ornament
Like an ornament, I ain't no ornament
Twist it break it drop it drop it drop it
Twist it lift it break it drop it
Pick me up again (ornament)
Lift it fix it hang it like an ornament
Like like an ornament I ain't no ornament
