Oh, got my hands tied around my back
And time put a rope around my head
And hung from the rafters of my fear
Dark in the eyes

Tryna face the world, I can't bare to
My knees hit the ground and my hands start shaking
Old feelings from new faces
A rope on the floor and a poor man hanging

Please help me shut this dream down
Hold me from underneath
Words never once cut me down
Oh, don't you cry for me

I've seen a notion run away
I'm torn from the truth that holds my soul
I'm down in the grave where I belong
Oh, what a ride

I dare to fight my devil
Wings to the sky on the run from trouble
With my own hands, no shovel
I dug in the ground, now I'm hanging above saying

Please help me shut this dream down
Hold me from underneath
Words never once cut me down
Oh, don't you cry for me

Down by the grave that the law man laid
When the gravel got paved, finally I'm saved
Down by the grave that the law man laid
When the gravel got paved, finally I'm saved
When the sun went down
Down by the grave that the law man laid
When the gravel got paved, finally I'm saved
It set the sky on fire
Down by the grave that the law man laid
When the gravel got paved, finally I'm saved
I saw an angel fly
Down by the grave that the law man laid
When the gravel got paved, finally I'm saved
I never felt so high
Down by the grave that the law man laid
When the gravel got paved, finally I'm saved
Please help me shut this dream down
Hold me from underneath
Words never once cut me down
Oh, don't you cry for me
