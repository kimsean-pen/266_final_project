Lip balm on watery clay,
Relationships hey hey hey
You kiss like a rock
But you know I need it anyway
Angle for the ringside seats
When they fall
Don't blame me

Bring on the Major Leagues
Bring on the Major Leagues
Bring on the Major Leagues
Bring on the Major Leagues

How you gonna teach him to walk
When he can't even finish the
He can't even finish the songs of the law

Are they civilized or satanist?
Cater to my walls and see if they fall
Don't leave me

Bring on the Major Leagues
Bring on the Major Leagues
Bring on the Major Leagues
Bring on the Major Leagues

They wear you down sometimes
Kids like wine,
Magic Christians chew the rind
Cause bad girls are always bad girls

Let's let'em in
Darling we're up against it
And there is no time for
Tie-ins tie-ins tie-ins go!

Bring on the Major Leagues
Bring on the Major Leagues
Bring on the Major Leagues
Bring on the Major Leagues

They'll wear you down sometime
Kiss the wine, magic Christians chew the rind
Cause bad girls are always bad girls
Let'em in.
