When I was young, I had swimming lessons
Kick your legs and keep your head above the water
You get older and you learn different lessons
Still keep it moving, keep your head above it all you grow and so
It stings my eyes so much I'm feeling chilled to the bone
No boat
Can't row
We're falling out can't hold on to the side reach out yeah
When we were young, we had swimming lessons
I pulled you down and watched you frown under the water
Now I'm older and I've learned different lessons
Can't take for granted that your world won't fall apart now
No echo
It freaks me out so much I'm feeling chilled to the bone
Love, sweet love
No Ro, won't hold on anymore reach out yeah
It shook up my perspective of our lives cause
every now and then I write a rhyme let out a sigh cause
Nothing will ever erase the image of that night,
oh why would I try, when the ink's already dry, love
There's no echo
It freaks me out so much I'm feeling chilled to the bone
Love, sweet love
Just give me more, I need you don't go, Ro
Don't go
