Sofly, in the winter time
softly, when we're about to dine
Softly in my heart of mine I talk to you
Has anybody of you two
got half a mind to go to the zoo
tonight won't you think we'd have fun
My daughter my son one by one
My daughter my son one by one

Softly in the winter time
Softly, when it goes towards nine
Softly, in my heart of mine

go feed the dog and cat and then go
to bed and have your right own dream
now be well off and start with the sun
My daughter my son one by one
My daughter my son one by one

Softly, in the winter time
Softly, when day's gonna shine
Softly, in my heart of mine I talk to you
about my actual favorite matter
that's how to live and laugh and feel better
I cut the bred for them and they run
My daughter my son one by one

off and away they set out for living
love them if ever they come, wherever they've gone
My daughter my son one by one
My daughter my son one by one
Softly
