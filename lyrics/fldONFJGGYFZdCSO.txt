How in the hell does one heart swell
To the size of beast with a bark like a big kick drum
Tell me what does it take to get a mouth that makes
Every old man around you to seem so young

And I know, you're afraid of falling flat
And I know, those walls are up against your back
And I know, there are those who'd see ya crack
But I know that you're stronger than that

If you're feelin bad, wave your hand at a cab
And hitch a ride to the other side of the town
I'd be standin there to pay the taxi's fare
And lend an ear, dry the tears of a friend who's down

And I know, you're afraid of falling flat
And I know, those walls are up against your back
And I know, there are those who'd see ya crack
Still I know that you're stronger than that

And I Know
Stronger than that

And I Know

And I Know
