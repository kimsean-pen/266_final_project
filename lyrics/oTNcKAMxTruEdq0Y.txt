In my mind, in my head,
this is where we all came from.

The dreams we had, the love we shared,
this is what we're waiting for.

And this is what I'm waiting for

And this is what I'm waiting for

In my mind, in my head,
this is where we all came from.

The dreams we had, the love we shared,
this is what we're waiting for.

In my mind, in my head,
this is where we all came from.

The dreams we had, the love we shared,
this is what we're waiting for.

In my mind, in my head,
this is where we all came from.

The dreams we had, the love we shared,
this is what we're waiting for.
