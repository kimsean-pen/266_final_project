There's something stirring
Something crackling like the firewood
A certain spirit that has lightened up the neighborhood
I think it's time for the timeless time of the year
Time of the year
You're bundled up
Got a blizzard coming on the way
The family fighting like they do 'Cause it's the holidays And
every memory you're holding in your
heart is alive once more, right here

Feels like you're a kid again
Making you remember when life was good
Just watching the snow fall down

Doesn't matter if the year's got you feeling down
Just remember in December what is coming 'round
And you'll find the feeling that you always found
You can count on Christmas, count on Christmas
Coming back home to the home address
Something burning in the kitchen with the house a mess
And this year is promising nothing less
You can count on Christmas, count on Christmas
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Count on Christmas, count on Christmas

We got a Christmas song Sing-a-long around
the tree Hit the eggnog flow until we all tipsy
There's another movie marathon on TV
Which one could it be?
But with all of the presents, all of the gifts
It's really about who you're sharing them with
And just for Christmas Eve
The world's the way it used to be

Doesn't matter if the year's got you feeling down
Just remember in December what is coming 'round
And you'll find the feeling that you always found
You can count on Christmas, count on Christmas
Coming back home to the home address
Something burning in the kitchen with the house a mess
And this year is promising nothing less
You can count on Christmas, count on Christmas
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Count on Christmas, count on Christmas
Doesn't matter if the year's got you feeling down
Just remember in December what is coming 'round
And you'll find the feeling that you always found
You can count on Christmas, count on Christmas
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You can count on Christmas, count on Christmas
