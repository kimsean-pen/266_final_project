As we're chasing all these fault lines
Never seen where we had it
I wonder where we disconnected
Still you haunt the space inside my mind
Run into the unexpected
We're not even at the end yeah

Could it be that we're
Just fading like the sun?
Look what we've become
Holding on for way too long
Could it be that we're lost
Searching madly for
The spark of the world that's far apart

Fault lines making me tremble
Only you can put me together
Fault lines making me tremble
Only you can put me together
Put me together
Put me together

I feel the urgency in your touch
It's all I really need to know
Caught up in the aftermath
Can't deny I need you so much
But it's not my only motive
I just want to make you notice

Could it be that we're
Just fading like the sun?
Look what we've become
Holding on for way too long
Could it be that we're lost
Searching madly for
The spark of the world that's far apart

Fault lines making me tremble
Only you can put me together
Fault lines making me tremble
Only you can put me together

Fault lines
Fault lines

Fault lines making me tremble
Only you can put me together
Fault lines making me tremble
Only you can put me together
Put me together
(Fault lines)
Put me together
