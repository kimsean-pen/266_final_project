It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh, no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling

I know that you think
You sound silly when you call my name
But I hear it inside my head all day

Then I realize I'm just holding on
To the hope that, maybe
Your feelings don't show

It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh, no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling

Seed of all this indecision isn't me, oh, no
'Cause I decided long ago
But that's the way it seems to go
When trying so hard to get to something real
It feels

It feels like I only go backwards, darling
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh, no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling

It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh, no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling

It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh, no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling
