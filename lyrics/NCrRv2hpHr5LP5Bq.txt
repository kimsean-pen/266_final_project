Throw your hands in the air and start this shit!

We are the name of the game, putting "filth" on the map
The right side of the reason, the wrong side of the tracks
It's not for fame, or for gain (that) we've crawled out from the dirt
'Cause I still can't fill my pockets with my name on your shirt

Yeah we bleed, scream, and get up off our knees
We ignite to excite. We're taking back the night

Generation lost, we don't sleep at night, we don't give up
Generation lost, make a fist and close your eyes, yeah
Generation lost, we're here to stay cause we've had enough
Generation lost, middle fingers in the sky

We are a beacon of hope, the dark side of the light
We always aim for the throat, we only come out at night
If you need bodies you should see my collection
You're sharing copies but you're lacking impression

Now we bleed the dream, so get up off your feet
We ignite to excite, throw your hands in the air and scream

Generation lost, we don't sleep at night, we don't give up
Generation lost, make a fist and close your eyes, yeah
Generation lost, we're here to stay cause we've had enough
Generation lost, middle fingers in the sky

Holding up to save yourself
And terrorize like no one else will
And screaming out some way out done
We'll live forever in the emptiness

Coast to coast I hear the masses calling
Turn up now this is the final warning

Throw your hands in the air, and start this shit!

Generation lost, we don't sleep at night, we don't give up
Generation lost, make a fist and close your eyes, yeah
Generation lost, we're here to stay cause we've had enough
Generation lost, middle fingers in the sky
