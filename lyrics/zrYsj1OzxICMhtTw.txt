I go out, right out
For a heart in a heartless town
I'd come unwind
And this love, my love
Isn't odd as I though it was
Am I no one, without someone to need me
Hold back your love, you know that I had my doubts
Wanna see what I feel without
Every feeling is streaming out
Now you know that I mean it
Hold back your love, you know that I had my doubts
Wanna see what I feel without
Every feeling is streaming out
Now you know that I mean it
I go out, right out
With the world nearly falling down
I go on now
And I saw, no love
A town that's guilty of breaking more
No one at dawn, trying to reason and pleading
Hold back your love, you know that I had my doubts
Wanna see what I feel without
Every feeling is streaming out
Now you know that I mean it
Hold back your love, you know that I had my doubts
Wanna see what I feel without
Every feeling is streaming out
Now you know that I mean it
If I'm dreaming, where do I go
Lost my feeling, so how will know
If I'm dreaming, where do I go
Lost my feeling, so how will know
If I'm dreaming, where do I go
Lost my feeling, so how will know
Hold back your love
Hold back your love
Hold back your love
How will I know
Hold back your love
Hold back your love
Hold back your love
How will I know
Hold back your love, you know that I had my doubts
Wanna see what I feel without
Every feeling is streaming out
Now you know that I mean it
