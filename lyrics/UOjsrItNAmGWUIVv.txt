Well, I feel so sorry for you
You'll always be the same
'Cause you're sad, you're sad
And I think you're very selfish
And you play a vicious game
'Cause you're bad, you're bad
And you'll end up very lonely
And you may end up in pain
'Cause you're mad, you're mad

I think you're awful
I think you're horrible
A waste of space
I think you're awful
I think you're horrible
A waste of space
It's your bad behavior
But you never see

Such a shame, such a shame
You'll always be the same
I'm sickened for the mother
Who endured your pain, yo-your
Such a shame, such a shame
You'll always be the same
I'm sickened for the mother
Who endured your pain, yo-yo-your

Arrogance, ignorance
Arrogance, ignorance
Arrogance, ignorance
Yo-yo-your

I should think you're very selfish
I should think you're very sad
It's your bad behavior
I should think you're very thankless
For the things you never had
It's your bad behavior

I think you're awful
I think you're horrible
A waste of space
I think you're awful
I think you're horrible
A waste of space
It's your bad behavior
"Who cares?", but you'll never see

Such a shame, such a shame
You'll always be the same
I'm sickened for the mother
Who endured your pain, yo-your
Such a shame, such a shame
You'll always be the same
I'm sickened for the mother
Who endured your pain, yo-yo-your

Such a shame, such a shame
Such a fool, such a fool
Such a clown, such a clown
Such a shamble, yo
Such a shame, such a shame
Such a fool, such a fool
Such a clown, such a clown
Such a shamble, yo

Such a shame, such a shame
Such a fool, such a fool
Such a clown, such a clown
Such a shamble, yo
Such a shame, such a shame
Such a fool, such a fool
Such a clown, such a clown
Such a shamble, yo
