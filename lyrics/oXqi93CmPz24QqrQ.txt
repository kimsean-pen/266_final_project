(Thank you baby)

I learned a lesson in my life,
but I learned it the hard way.
I don't know why I used to fall in love
with the wrong kind.
Than I'd suffer so much pain,
but I only had myself to blame.
Baby, you came in the nick of time

To show me love doesn't have to hurt
To feel good, it's such a revelation.
With you I can be myself
And always should
Don't have to cry,
Don't have to fight
Don't have to die
Night after night
Show me love
Doesn't have to hurt
To feel good

Thank you baby

Darling now it seems to me
like I've always known you
But I still shudder when I think back
on the lonely times
I used to keep al my feelings inside (deep inside)
From your eyes
I have nothing to hide
Baby, you came in the nick of time

To show me love doesn't have to hurt
To feel good, it's such a revelation
With you I can be myself
I know it should
Don't have to cry,
Don't have to fight
Don't have to die
Night after night
Show me love
Doesn't have to hurt
To feel good

Thank you baby

Lying here beside you feels so fine
Talking about everything
In this heart of mine

Love doesn't have to hurt
To feel good, it's such a revelation
With you I can be myself
I know it should
Don't have to cry,
Don't have to fight
And in your arms
Night after night
Show me love
Doesn't have to hurt
To feel good

Thank you baby
