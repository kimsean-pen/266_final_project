The theatre, the stage, the sets, the lights
The sets of Dali
The curtains drawn so many times
The light of Bunuel
The players weary every night
The sets of Dali
They slash their arms, slash their eyes
The light of Bunuel
Slash their arms, slash their eyes

Hole in your hand
Sheets of gold
Digging the land
Shapes to hold
We are dreaming

A theatre, a stage, the sets, the lights
The sets of Dali
Masking some grand delight
The light of Bunuel
The actors' homemade disguise
The sets of Dali
They slash their arms, they slash their eyes
The light of Bunuel
Slash their arms, slash their eyes

Hole in your hand
Sheets of gold
Digging the land
Shapes to hold
We are dreaming

Sets & Lights
Hole in your hand
Sets & Lights
Digging the land
Sets & Lights
Hole in your hand
Sets & Lights
Digging the land
Sets & Lights...
