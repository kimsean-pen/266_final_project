I can hear dancing
I can hear moonlight
I can hear footsteps following you through the night
I can see chances
I can see hazard lights
I can see you and I in the avenues in my mind
I can see you
Dark love light me up
Take me to the places you're dreaming of
Dark love light me up
Take me anywhere that you choose

Every answer, every rumour
Every chance I get a glance at the future
I can see danger, a little confusion
I can see you and I escape the illusion
I can see you
Dark love light me up
Take me to the places you're dreaming of
Dark love light me up
Take me to the places in you
Dark love light me up (light me up)
Take me to the places you're dreaming of
Dark love light me up (light me up)
Take me anywhere that you choose

It's white hot in the shadows baby
Take a shot in the dark
Shine a light on your darkness baby
Take another shot at your heart

Dark love light me up
Take me to the places you're dreaming of
Dark love light me up
Take me to the places in you
Dark love light me up (light me up)
Take me to the places you're dreaming of
Dark love light me up (light me up)
Take me anywhere that you choose
It's alright in the shadows baby
Take a shot in the dark
Shine a light on your darkness baby
Take another shot at your heart
