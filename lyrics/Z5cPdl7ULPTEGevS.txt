Asfetiu
Asfetiu

Fiends, criminals, slaves, blasphemers
The word of Ra is against ye
Ye are fettered and bound with leather straps
Helpless, doomed, wailing in unendurable torment
Lashed to the forked slave stick by the neck

Lashed to the slave stick
Abata ankh t khet
Neba t steb tcha
Lashed to the slave stick

Ra pronounceth the formulae against thee
The Eye of Horus is prepared to attack thee
Sekhmet uttereth words of flame
Against thee and pierceth thy breast

Your evil deeds have turned against you
Your plottings have come upon you
Your abominable acts
You shall be lashed to the slave stick

Abui, the god who burns the dead
Shall leave you smoldering in exile from the Netherworld
Abati, the gorer
Causes you to howl like a jackal in anguish

Your doom hath been decreed by Ra
Your unjust and perverse judgments are upon yourselves
The wickedness of your words of cursing are upon you
It is you who hath committed the unutterable and wrought iniquity in the Great Hall

Your corruptible bodies shall be cut to pieces
Your souls shall have no existence
Ye shall never again see Ra as he journeyeth in the Hidden Land
The doom of Ra is upon you

Lashed to the slave stick
Abata ankh t khet
Neba t steb tcha

Lashed to the slave stick
Abata ankh t khet
Neba t steb tcha
