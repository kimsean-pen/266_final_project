Been so long
since I felt alive.
How can I believe
in this tired body of mine?
Chasing myself, into the night,
will it all matter when I close my eyes?

Have I won the race?
Embraced all my pain,
told my family enough,
that I value our name.
And if the weight of the world
pulls me from my feet,
drags me to the ground,
my chest trying to breathe,
I just wanna be known
as the man who didn't sink,
as the man who didn't sink.
