Your soul was covered in dirt.
The sacrifice was never made.
You were unleashed in those days.
Now valid to grasp the inner self.

Is your heart gonna cave in.
Throw your soul into the sea.

All lessons must be taught
Heart and minds are unified by now.
Sweep up all those mistakes.
Feed the wide open wound...
