49 percent
1 percent short of half
and less than half
ain't really much of nothing

Bit off more than one could bite
and the taste is slight
it leaves this dullish appetite
'bout time I've finally seen the light
and said goodnight,
for the sling is tight
we'll lose this fight
in a corner painted white
as you fly your kite
I shun the sight, I've seen the light!
and now I've got to say goodnight, you know I'm right!

I won't try to stop your flight
or change your night or nothing,
less than half
why won't you try
to make this damage better?

Math and imagery
Equates cacophony
Multiplies muteness: a sum better disturbed
For silence subtracts
And shadows divide
light
less than half is slight
