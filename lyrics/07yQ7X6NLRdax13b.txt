Well there she goes with a brand new love affairrn
Dancin\' with him like she don\'t even carern
Well let her dance with himrn
Let her dance all night longrn
Well who would\'ve known that just yesterdayrn
She danced with me the very same wayrn
Well let her dance with himrn
Let her dance all night longrnrn
Chorus: rn
Well let her dance with him all night longrn
Ler dance to our favorite songrn
Well let her dance with him let her dance all night longrn
Well I\'ll find me a new lovern
And then she\'ll seern
Someone else will be dancing with mern
Let her dance with himrn
Let her dance all night longrnrn
