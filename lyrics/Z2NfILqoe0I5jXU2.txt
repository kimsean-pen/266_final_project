You are just a bee-sting
Swollen in my chest
Something must have died for
You to be my best yet

A new accomodation
To go out on my own
Civilised the stars that
Only shine alone

I tried, I'll try, I'll try
I tried, I'll try, I'll try

Bloated beating heartache
Your face singes mine
Mutual decision
To disconnect the flight-line

I reinforce the railway track
Which has sometimes stayed
But I made them too strong
For your wild ways, oh

I tried, I'll try, I'll try
I tried, I'll try, I'll try
I'll try, I'll try, I'll try
I'll try, I tried, I

I tried, I tried, I tried
I tried, I tried, I tried
I tried, I tried, I tried
I tried, I tried, I tried
