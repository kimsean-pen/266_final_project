Wake up and live
Wake up and live your life see what there is to see
I won't sit around all day cause life means more to me
wake up and live
so many kids content to sleep their lives away
but I'm gona try to make the most out of this day
wake up and live
it takes some motivation It takes some love for life
why just sit complacent and let life pass you by
boredom is a choice I choose not to make
unlock that door, strive for more
there's a better path to take
WAKE UP AND LIVE breath every breath
WAKE UP AND LIVE until my death
WAKE UP AND LIVE so much to do
WAKE UP AND LIVE all of you
c'mon, open your eyes
