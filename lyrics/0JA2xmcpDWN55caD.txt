Rust around the rim
Drink it anyway
I cut my lip

Isn't what I want

I'll keep on goin' back
Even...

Though I am bruises, face of contusions
Know I'll keep movin'
Though I am bruised, face of contusions
Know I'll keep movin'
Know I'll keep movin'

Rust around the rim
Drink it anyway
I cut my lip

Isn't what I want
Blood is on my tongue
I cut my lip, oh oh, yeah
I cut my lip, oh oh, yeah

Lean on my pride
Lean on my pride
