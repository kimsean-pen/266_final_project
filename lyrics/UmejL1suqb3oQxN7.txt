What if your brain, unexpectedly and suddenly,
Picked out things to flip around and view a lot differently?
What if blue sky, all of a sudden turned a purple hue?
We would shit a brick the size of all of it; what if?
What if I was just dreaming? What if I lived in a pear?
What if my watch read 4: 20 every hour, every day?
You can bet your dollar I'd be happy.

I forgot to remember; I forgot to remember my Pain.
Take me to your leader or die by the fly guy.

What if mothballs, hangin' around too close to microwaves,
suddenly woke up and said, "Take me to your leader
Or die by the fly guy; He'll push ya' out, no wings attached"?
Just do as I say, no mistake, he'll blow away.

What if I was just dreaming? What if I lived in a pear?
What if I had a mustard drenched cucumber tied to my leg
And I did not want my pants to get dirty?
What if this, what if that? Go.

I forgot to remember; I forgot to remember my pain
Take me to your leader or die by the fly guy.

I forgot to remember; I forgot to remember
My... Pain
My Pain
Forgot to inject my... cocaine.
Forgot to apply my... rogaine.
Forgot to remember... my Pain
Pain; Pain
I never think, I never thought, oh, maybe I'm insane?
I think I like being way the fuck outta my pain
I never think, I never thought, oh, maybe I'm insane?
I think I like being way the fuck outta my brain

I forgot to remember; I forgot to remember my pain.
Take me to your leader or die by the fly guy.
I forgot to remember; I forgot to remember my pain.
Take me to your leader or die by the fly guy.
