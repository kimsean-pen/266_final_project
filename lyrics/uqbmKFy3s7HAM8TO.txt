The deepest circle of Hell is reserved for betrayers and mutiniers.

Fucked up memories.
We're dead at every turn.
So spin your fucking shit and we'll die with every twist of tongue.
Your hollow gaze has shifted past my eyes.
Another dead face fades away.
Now what's left to take?
Another day I regret your memory.
In my mind you will never be more that this.
So what's left to fucking take?
Now my trust is gone.
As your world comes crashing down I'm going to watch it fucking burn.
Everything we had lies in pieces.
Everything we had fucking dies... tonight.

Through those deceiving eyes I've seen the blackest heart.
The blackest heart.
Everything you love fucking dies tonight.
