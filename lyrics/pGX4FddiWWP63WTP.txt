Boy, in the begining
In the begining, it was me, and you
I was Bonnie, you were Clyde
and we were running
We were running for a list we knew
(Roll the credits)

But then, in the middle,
In the middle you went and changed the script
Took a pencil and erased my happy ending
Instead of loving you, I feel so sick
(Roll the credits)

I know you directed it
I'm sure I produced a bit
So why is that chick stealing my show?

Baby, tell me who is she?
I need to know her name and number
Tell me, who does she hang out with
when you're not together?
I ain't gonna do nothing crazy
I just need you to hear me
(Roll the credits)

Roll the credits, and tell me
How many of your friends
You told all about it
They said you were working
Last friday night
When I was calling
Did you lie to all of them too?
Or was I just a fool
(Roll the credits)
(yeah yeah)

You worked under cover
Gave her every single line I owned
And it doesn't make me
Feel any better
That you took her places we would go
(Roll the credits)

I thought you meant for me
My name should be on that screen
Tell me why is that chick playing my role?

Baby, tell me who is she?
I need to know her name and number
Tell me, who does she hang out with
when you're not together?
I ain't gonna do nothing crazy
I just need you to hear me
(Roll the credits)

Roll the credits, and tell me
How many of your friends
You told all about it
They said you were working
Last friday night
When I was calling
Did you lie to all of them too?
Or was I just a fool
(Roll the credits)
Roll the credits

I know you directed it
I'm sure I produced a bit
I thought you were meant for me
My name should be on that screen
We weren't even at the end
But you started auditioning
And let somebody star in my show

Baby, tell me who is she?
I need to know her name and number
Tell me, who does she hang out with
when you're not together?
I ain't gonna do nothing crazy
I just need you to hear me
I just need you, I just need you to hear me baby (Roll the credits)
Baby tell me how many of your friends you told all about it.
They said you're working last Friday night when I was calling.
Did you lie to all of them too?
Or was I just a fool? (Roll the credits)

Roll the credits
Roll the credits
Roll the credits
(Roll the credits)
Roll the credits
Roll the credits
