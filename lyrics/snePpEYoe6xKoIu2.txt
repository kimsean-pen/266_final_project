How can I decide what's right
When you're clouding up my mind
I can't win your losing fight
All the time
Nor can I ever own what's mine
When you're always taking sides
But you won't take away my pride
No not this time
Not this time
How did we get here
When I used to know you so well
How did we get here
Well I think I know
The truth is hiding in your eyes
And it's hanging on your tongue
Just boiling in my blood
But you think that I can't see
What kind of man that you are
If you're a man at all
I will figure this one out
On my own
(I'm screaming, I love you so)
On my own
(But my thoughts you can't decode)
How did we get here
When I used to know you so well
Yeah
How did we get here
Well, I think I know
Yeah
Do you see what we've done
We're gonna make such fools of ourselves
Do you see what we've done
We're gonna make such fools of ourselves
Yeah
How did we get here
When I used to know you so well
Yeah, yeah
How did we get here
When I used to know you so well
I think I know
I think I know
There is something
I see in you
It might kill me
But I want it to be true
Thank you very much!
