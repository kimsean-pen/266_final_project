What do you think about this?
I've been holding it in now I'm letting it flow
What you think about this?
I'm gonna do my own thing, yeah, I'm flying solo
So don't tell me how it's gonna be
On my own and the thing of it is
There's nothing 'round here
That I'm gonna miss
'Cause you're holding me down, I just wanna fly
And there comes a time when I gotta say goodbye
To the life that you see me in
Here's where I begin

And I promise myself
I ain't nobody, I just wanna be free
And I promise myself
Even though it don't always come easy
Gonna learn from my pain, never explain
Do it my way, that's what I say
Promise myself
I'm the only one who will believe me

There's a voice in my head
Telling me come on, come on, move on
There's a voice in my head
Telling me I know my right from wrong
They, they say what doesn't kill you
Can make you strong, now I know what it means
You can try to bend
But you ain't breaking my dreams
I'll be making mistakes, coming up at a loss
I'll be tumbling down but like MC shake it off
I'll stay cool 'cause I know who's boss
Of me and myself and I

And I promise myself
I ain't nobody, I just wanna be free
And I promise myself
Even though it don't always come easy
Gonna learn from my pain, never explain
Do it my way, that's what I say
Promise myself
I'm the only one who will believe me

I'll keep moving even when the beat is gone

I will, I'm on, I won't
I'll keep doing what I gotta do to carry on
I won't, I will, I'm on
So don't hold me down 'cause I'm gonna fly
And the time is come and I gotta say goodbye
To the life that you see me in

Here's where I begin

And I promise myself
I ain't nobody, I just wanna be free
And I promise myself
Even though it don't always come easy
Gonna learn from my pain, never explain, yeah
Do it my way, that's what I say
Promise myself
I'm the only one who will believe me

And I promise myself
I ain't nobody, I just wanna be free
And I promise myself
Even though it don't always come easy
Gonna learn from my pain, never explain
Do it my way, that's what I say
Promise myself
I'm the only one who will believe me
Yeah yeah
