In the middle of a dream
On the darkest night
Woke up in a scream
Thought I'd lost my sight
Who you selling for tonight?

Pack my bags, time to fly
Don't be sad
I'm not that high
Who you selling for tonight?
Who you selling for tonight?
Who you selling for tonight?
Who you selling for?

Tonight it's alright
I can see the tunnel at the end of these lights
And when Travis called I didn't even answer
John was a walrus but he ain't no dancer like Paul
Know it all
And when Roger showed me I was building a wall
I've been waiting a long time
Waiting a long time
Waiting a long time
Waiting for it to fall
Who you selling for tonight?
Who you selling for tonight?

In the middle of a dream
On the darkest night
Or so it seems
But I think I'm right
