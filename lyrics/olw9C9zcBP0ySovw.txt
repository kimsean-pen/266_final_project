they control your life, they control all your thoughts and who you are.
sacrificed yourself for friends.
filled with insecurities and self-abhorrence.
you wish for your own death, but why wont you die.
waste of space, a burden to the world.
leeching off all of us.
your sickness can't be cured.
all the ones you called friends, are the ones who want you dead.
terminate yourself.
