(Back in time)
Mistakes I've made, I can't replay
Oh to have a second chance to try
The things I've done, whilst having fun
And thinking 'bout what I did still makes me cry
(Back in time)
I wanna go back in time
I wanna go back and do it all again
That day, in my life, again
(la la la la la la) (la la la la)
(la la la la la la) (la la la la)
Such deep regrets, can't pay my debts
I pray to have the chance to try again
So now you see, come set me free
I need to have the chance to make amends
(Back in time)
I wanna go back in time
I wanna go back and do it all again
That day, in my life, again
I wanna go back in time
I wanna go back and do it all again
That day, in my life, again
(la la la la la la) (la la la la)
I wanna do it again
(la la la la la la) (la la la la)
You know it feels so good (so good)
Take me back
I wanna go back in time
I wanna go back and do it all again
That day, in my life, again
I wanna go back in time (i wanna go back)
I wanna go back and do it all again
That day, in my life, again
(la la la la la la) (la la la la)
(la la la la la la) (la la la la)
