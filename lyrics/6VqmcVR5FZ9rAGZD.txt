There's an old, old giant
Sneaking around inside this house
Help move the cupboard
Make a huge barricade
So he won't enter
Draw some life from the sun and the day
We heard a noise, and it took shape
I mean cold, cold blood
Running right through deep inside our veins
What is he gonna tell us?
Shimmering, warm and bright
Shimmering warm on the opposite side
Isn't he gonna tempt us?
Shimmering, warm and bright
We need a helping hand
We have lost our touch
If his shadow appears
We're going to fall apart
I mean we got addicted long time ago
But that spooky, old giant won't withdraw
Give me a sign, oh good omen
Give me a sign, oh good omen
What if he does resent us?
Shimmering, warm and bright
Shimmering warm on the opposite side
Isn't he gonna tempt us?
Shimmering, warm and bright
