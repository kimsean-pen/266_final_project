Speak to me, my master, speak to me
Come save me, Redeemer, revive me
This black void, through my heart I can't see
Your dark sky, Almighty, above me

By grace, save me
Believe in me
By grace, save me
Believe in me

I am your lie (I am, I am)
I am your lie (I am, I am)
I am deceit disguised (I am, I am)
I am your lie (I am)

Speak to me, my master, speak to me
Rise to me from the dead, appear
From this earth, this your world, this your hell
Forgive my feeble lies, I shall die

By grace, save me
Believe in me
By grace, save me
Believe in me

I am your lie (I am, I am)
I am your lie (I am, I am)
I am deceit disguised (I am, I am)
I am your lie (I am)

As masses submit to embrace
And the maker reveals his one face
As the plague of humanity arrives
I drown in this blood contrived

Creator of suffering divine
Of baseness surmounting these minds
Of reflection and reason impaired
As grief trails endless despair

By grace, save me
Believe in me
By grace, save me
Believe in me

By grace, save me
Believe in me
By grace, save me
Believe in me

I am your lie (I am, I am)
I am your lie (I am, I am)
I am deceit disguised (I am, I am)
I am your lie (I am)
