Today I feel like running naked through your street
To get your attention (Your attention)
Whoa oh oh (Whoa oh oh)

I broke up with my girl so tell me where to meet
Or did I mention? (Did I mention?
Whoa oh oh (Whoa oh oh)

I dream on, dream about you
What can I do to make you feel all right?
Baby I dont want to see you cry, no.

I wanna see you smile
I wanna see you smile

Today I feel like blowing all my cash on you
I'd buy you anything (buy you anything)
Until I'm broke (Until I'm broke broke)

Today I want to turn your skies from gray to blue
And if it rains on you
I'll be your coat whoa oh oh

I dream on, dream about you
What can I do to make you feel all right?
Baby, I dont want to see you cry, no

I wanna see you smile
I wanna see you smile

Let me take your picture, baby
I'll save it for a rainy day
I dont need much
I guess I'm just old fashioned in that way
So on the count of three, lets see you

Uh 1, uh 2, uh 1, 2... 1, 2, 3!

Smile (I wanna make you smile, yeah) (oh oh)

I wanna see you smile
I wanna see you smile

It's the things you do

I wanna make you smile.
