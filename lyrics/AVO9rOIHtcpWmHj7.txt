Bronzen Embrace

Burning winds I stride
amongst the gales I glide
amidst the bronzen light
I dwell

Above the clouds I rise
for I the storms evoke
while nine ravens
encircle me

Rejouce in my sunset's gold
all ye who joined my trails
its rays herald the stars
now vailed

Breaking through the woods
its autumn leaves inflamed
my fervent awaited
bronzen embrace
