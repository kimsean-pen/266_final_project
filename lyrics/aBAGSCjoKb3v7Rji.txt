Crying like a baby
In my momma's arms
The day they came to tell me
You were gone

What have you done to me
You did not do before
I had you standing right next to me
On the floor

Well, we sang in the same places
We were a double-draw
And the folks came to see us
Had it all

But they took you to some stony place
And they broke your double-jaw
Now the pieces of its ivory
Line the wall

With cold iron in the fireplace
And pictures on the wall
Well I guess it's a-dying peacefully, so far
Yes, I guess it's dying peacefully, so far

Crying like a baby
In my momma's arms
The day they came to tell me
You were gone
You were gone
You were gone
