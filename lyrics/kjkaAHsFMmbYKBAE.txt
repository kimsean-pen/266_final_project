I'm not your nervous feeling
Each time we say goodnight
You picture buildings burning to the ground
From the basement to the streetlight
I'm not your drinking problem
A hole is in the sky
It's not your heart that you've been thinkin of
Just the feeling like you're gonna die

All you know how to do is
Shake shake
Keep your body still, keep your body still
All you do is
Shake shake shake
Keep your body still, keep your body still

I'm not your paranoia
When someone's at the door
Virgin fires calling out the throat of a body rising through the floor
I'm not your fortune teller
I'm not your spinning bed
I'm never like you
Uncomfortable too
This is starting to fuck with my head

All you know how to do is
Shake shake
Keep your body still, keep your body still
All you do is
Shake shake shake
Keep your body still, keep your body still

Don't you realize you're fine
Oh can't you see that you're fine
And know that you're still alive
You know that you're still alive
Oh don't you know you're alive
Don't you know you're alive
Burning in the sky
