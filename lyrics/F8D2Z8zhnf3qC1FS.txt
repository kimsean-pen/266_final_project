It's time to get away
It's time to get away
From you.

It's time to get away
It's time to get away
From you.

You brought a lot of money
But me, I kept a tiny tummy
And you, you make me sleep
I tried and tried.
But you undermine me
And I start to be sensible
(If you know what I mean).

And so it's time to get away
It's time to get away
From you.

I'm dying to get away
I'm dying to get away.

And next time we'll talk it over.
And we can start again.

Shocked!

For you
I caught a lot of static.
And me
I'm like an automatic.
Oh what, what, what, what, what
Did you think would happen next?
Oh what, what, what, what, what
Could it ever be?

So it's time to get away
It's time to get away
From you.

I'm dying to get away
I'm dying to get away.

And next time let's talk about it.
Or maybe start again.

Shocked!
To think I used to pity you.
To think I used to pity you
It's true.
To think I used to pity you.
To think i used to talk to you
It's true.

Next time we can talk about it
Or even start again.
I couldn't tell you what you wanted.
Know what I'm sayin'?
I knew you were low, man
But the truth is I was shocked.
Blood!
Power!
Eyes!
Eyes never lie!
Kids!
Kids never lie!
