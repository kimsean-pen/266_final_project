Un jom Era
Un jom Era, and I'm coming for the light
All or nothing
Now or never
Coming straight from the KO
And my heart knows the way, oh
Never get in my way, oh
Sun e bon sun e bon sun e bon sun e bonbon

Bonbon, I know what you want
Bonbon, bet you wanna taste it
Bonbon, bet you wanna taste it
I know what you want, want, want
Bonbon, can you get it done, done?
Bonbon, bet you wanna taste it
Bonbon, my sip will get you wasted
I know what you want, want, want

Nice to, nice to meet ya
Mister, I'ma teach ya
King, but you met your first Queen, ya
Nice to, nice to meet ya
Mister, I'ma teach ya
King, but you met your first Queen, ya

Sunday night, I put a light in my blunt right
In my blunt right
Spending dough til we all go broke that is our M.O
Let it go if you wanna ride
Gonna be alright

Bounce to the rhythm while we pour some more
Cause my time has come and I'm bossin'
Them wanna, wanna flex with us
Cause we higher than the limit, high and mellow
Oh, all the lines we crossin'
Oh, the drama we be causin'
So sick like we got that flu
I'ma switch it up, my hair turn blue

Nice to, nice to meet ya
Mister, I'ma teach ya
King, but you met your first Queen, ya
Nice to, nice to meet ya
Mister, I'ma teach ya
King, but you met your first Queen, ya

I'ma let you out here if you cross the seas
If you wanna melt, you gotta heat the freeze
Nothing's sweet like my honey
That you'll have to lick, before you can taste
