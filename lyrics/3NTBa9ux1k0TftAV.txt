Take off my clothes
Get into bed
I hit the pillow let persistent thoughts begin
I haven't slept well in weeks
I don't know how to fix this
Or if I'll ever know true peace
I hope for the best
I need rest
I feel the weight press on my chest
Open my eyes
Take a breath
I know exactly what comes next
I can't move my legs
Can't move at all
Shadows creep along my wall
And I just want them gone
What did I do wrong
To deserve this?
Now I can't refrain
From any attempt to scream cause every signal coming from my brain is in vain
And it's not fair
Every figure looming over me has locked me in its stare
Breathe
Calm down and give in
I hope that it's all over soon
I hope you find the end
Relax
As the voices start to fade
The shadows float away
And you find your escape
Whoa sweet release
Rise to my feet
A couple tears roll down my cheek
I know that I am free
I am free
Even if it's momentarily
Drop to my knees
I am free
I am free momentarily
I know that I am free
I am free
Even if it's momentarily
I know that I am free
I am free
