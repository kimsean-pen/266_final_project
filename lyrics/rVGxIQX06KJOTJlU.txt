I know you keep your silence.
I know that secret better than you.
Sometimes all the matters of the heart
are the chaos and the cowardice that keep us apart.
I know you want to shut down.
I know you think we're better alone.
Sometimes all the words are unsaid
but you listen to them argue every night in your head.

Just breathe in and out.
Because all I want to do is just talk talk talk to you.
Please hear me out.
Because all I want to do is just talk talk talk to you.

I know that you've been pushed down.
I know you think we're better as two.
Sometimes well the miracle of love is meaningless
and clumsy like the beating of a heart.
Just breathe in and out.
Because all I want to do is just talk talk talk to you.

Please hear me out.
Because all I want to do is just talk talk talk to you.
Calling out.
Got to hear an echo got to get to you.
When I'm walking out.
All I want to do is just talk talk talk to you.

Well you can hide away your feelings.
And burn your bridges in the dark.
But I know you want to break through.
But we're worlds apart.

Just breathe in and out.
Because all I want to do is just talk talk talk to you.
Please hear me out.
Because all I want to do is just talk talk talk.
And I'm calling out.
Got to hear an echo got to get to you.
When I'm walking out.
Well all I want to do is just talk talk talk to you yeah
