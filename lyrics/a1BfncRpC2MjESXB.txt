Lately I've been thinking everyone around me is insane
March in single file cause I'm thinking that it's the only way
But I'm never gonna fall in line
Never gonna live life color blind
Living between all the black and white, oh
Lately I've been thinking that
there is something wrong inside my brain

I just feel so strange
Strange
I'm out of mind most of the time
I just feel so strange
Strange
The harder I try, I don't recognize
I always feel so...

Sometimes I can't tell between the highs when I'm lost in the low
Every thing is backwards when I'm staring at the people below
I'm standing outside like a renegade
When everybody's here it's a masquerade
Their eyes cut through like a razor blade, oh
Sometimes I can't tell that they are better with the devil they know

Maybe I'm just so strange
Strange
I'm out of mind most of the time
I just feel so strange
Strange
The harder I try, I don't recognize
I always feel so...
Am I the only alone?
I'm losing grip on everything I used to know
Strange
Strange
I'm out of mind most of the time
I just feel so...

Am I the only one that feels this way?
I keep on running, but I can't escape
Am I the only one that feels this way?
Cause I feel this way
Cause I feel this way
Am I the only one that feels this way?
I keep on running, but I can't escape
Am I the only one that feels this way?
Cause I feel this way
Cause I feel this way

I just feel so strange
Strange
I'm out of mind most of the time
I just feel so strange
Strange
The harder I try, I don't recognize
I always feel so...
Am I the only alone?
I'm losing grip on everything I used to know
Strange
Strange
I'm out of mind most of the time
I just feel so...
Strange
