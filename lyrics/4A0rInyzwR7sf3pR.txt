Ummmmmm...
Company always on the run
Destiny is a rising s... un
Oh...
I was born 6 gun in my hand
Behind a gun
I'll make my final stand... hey
That's why they call me

Bad company
And I can't deny
Bad company
Till the day I die, oh
Till the day I die
Till the day I die

Rebel souls
Deserters we are called
Chose a gun
And threw away the sun...
Now these towns
They all know our name
6 gun sound is our claim to fame...
I can hear them say

Bad company
And I won't deny...
Bad, bad company
Till the day I die...
Oh, yeah
Till the day I die
Ooh, ooh, ooh...

Hey, hey, hey
Bad company
I can't deny...
Bad company
Till the day I die...
And I say it's
Bad company
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Bad company
Till the day I die...
Oh, yeah

Tell me that you are not a thief
Oh, but I am
Bad company
It's the way I play
Dirty for dirty
Oh
Somebody double crossed me
Double cross double cross

Yeah we're bad company
Killed in cold blood
