It don't look good, standing in a nuclear breeze
The Earth at a cool negative ten degrees
But I feel alright
I still have my electric light
Though I can't breathe the air outside

Oh, it don't look good but it feels alright
Oh, it don't look good but it feels alright

They say Jesus saves, sorry people crying in their graves
I sure hope he don't forget about me
But still I don't mind
Taking my sweet time dying
Cause Earth ain't such a bad place to be

Oh, it don't look good but it feels alright
Oh, it don't look good but it feels alright
Like a friend's death on a starry night
Yeah, you know it's alright

I'm gonna try, to break the cycle if I can
If it's my last act in this whole life
I'm not gonna cry
Or hide my face behind my hands
I wanna die with an open soul

Oh, it don't look good but it feels alright
Oh, it don't look good but it feels alright
Alright
Oh, it don't look good but it feels alright
Alright, alright, alright
Oh, it don't look good but it feels alright
Oh, it don't look good but it feels alright
Oh, it don't look good but it feels alright
Alright, alright, alright
