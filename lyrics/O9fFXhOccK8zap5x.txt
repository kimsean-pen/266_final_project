To the deep end, to the heart line
Hold it straight together, man,
hold it straight together if you can
Little fevers wrapped in dedication
All strung out on novelty,
collapse yourself and try to comprehend

An angry island, a bitter bee sting
Severing and shattering free the self and fix the between
It's isolation, mark the earth around you
Guess who's on the waiting list,
I'll let you in on something secret

I can disappear anytime I want to, time I feel you
Shovel through my skin, I am with you till the end

First you breathe out then you have to breathe in
Lash yourself repeatedly until it sticks, until it sticks
Under the eyelids, carry on cadaver
Festering interiors, all hollow breach and vapor silhouette

Need medication, more medication coursing through your interstates
All mad and great confused and counterfeit
Kamikaze sear the blood inside me
Guess who's got it figured out,
I'll let you in on something secret

I can disappear anytime I want to, time I feel you
Shovel through my skin, I am with you till the end
And I can decompose when it suits me I accelerate it
Wicked on all fours, I surrender to the storm

You'll never know how it feels
You'll never know how it feels
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?

I can disappear anytime I want to, time I feel you
Shovel through my skin, I am with you till the end

I can decompose when it suits me I accelerate it
Wicked on all fours, I surrender to the storm
And I can disappear anytime I want to, time I feel you
Shovel through my skin, I am with you till the end
I am with you till the end
