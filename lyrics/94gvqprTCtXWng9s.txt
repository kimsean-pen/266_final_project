I had a boy
Daddy was his name
Since he left me
Haven't been the same
And I know why I love him
Darling, why you go away?
Oh daddy, why you go?

Oh, daddy
Oh, daddy
Oh, daddy
Oh, daddy

I know I love him
Know that it's true
I know that I need him
Know that it's true
You are everything I dream of
You are my gangster
You are everything I dream of
Darling, why you go away?
Oh daddy, why you go?

Oh, daddy
Oh, daddy
Oh, daddy
Oh, daddy

You are my men, no cry
I tell him I can not fight
This love I'm feeling
Is not good leaving
A good woman like me
A good woman like me
A good woman like me
A good woman like me, me me

Mama told me I was just a game you were playing
Someone to hook up, you are a fake love displayer
A bullet to my heart, run run he is a slayer
Murder up

Mi corazón te llora, llora, llora, llora (Uoh-oh)
Llora por un hombre que no cura mis penas
Mi corazón te llora, llora, llora, llora (Oh-oh)
Llora por un hombre que no vale la pena

Oh, daddy
Oh, daddy
Oh, daddy
Oh, daddy

Why you promised to love?
To give you lady all your sweet loves
Night and day you promised to stay
So why you leaving me, what you say'?
You crossed your heart, you promised to love
To give you lady all your sweet loves
Night and day you promised to stay
So why you leaving me, what you say'?

Mi corazón te llora, llora, llora, llora (Uoh-oh)
Llora por un hombre que no cura mis penas
Mi corazón te llora, llora, llora, llora (Oh-oh)
Llora por un hombre que no vale la pena

Yo tenía un novio
Daddy was his name
Él lo sabía
Llamarlo era mi ley
Me ganó con sus besos
Pero con el viento se fue
Él sana mi dolor

Oh, daddy
Oh, daddy
Oh, daddy
Oh, daddy
