A borrowed prayer died before it filled your lips
Your grandfather was the one who taught you it
To speak in troubled times, to carry you to port
Now mechanical, it seems so meaningless

And what do I think
Death is death is death
And no amount of prayer will change that
And anyway, time is better spent on things you can change
