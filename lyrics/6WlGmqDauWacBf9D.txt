There's something you said
A whirlwind, a voice
"Together," you said
But I have no choice
Oh please
Stay a while
God, I love your smile

I never felt alone
But here feels like hell
When I am on my own
And you're all I feel
Oh please
Stay a while
God, I love your smile

A rat in a cage
A stone in a stream
I float far away
I live in a dream
Oh please
Stay a while
God, I love your smile

And how bout that thing
You do when you're awake
A laugh with a sting
A bite from a snake
Oh please
Stay a while
God, I love your smile
