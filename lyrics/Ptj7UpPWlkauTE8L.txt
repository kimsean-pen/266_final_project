Clap your hands now

Clap your hands now

Let the dammed water be
There's some people down the way that's thirsty
Let the liquid spirit free
The folk are thirsty
Coz of mans unnaturel hand
watch what happens when the people catch winds
of water hitting the banks of the hard dry land

Liquid spirit
Liquid spirit
Liquid spirit
Liquid spirit

Clap your hands now

Clap your hands now

Liquid spirit

Liquid spirit

Let the dammed water be
There's some people down the way that's thirsty
Let the liquid spirit free
The people are thirsty
Coz of mans unnaturel hand
watch what happens when the people catch winds
of water hitting the banks of the hard dry land

Liquid spirit

Liquid spirit

Clap your hands now
