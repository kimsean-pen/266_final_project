You see my oldest friend
Tell her that I'm gone again
You take my old guitar
One that I once said was ours
Don't be blue

You hum that old tune
The one I used to sing for you
When we were alone
You ask her if she knew
Was this something I would do?
From the start

Please don't pass me by
If I'm walking but I don't know why
It's something that I have to try
Can you love me if I put up a fight?

Take my old guitar
And sell it off for parts
As you should
Take my old tune
Turn it into something new
Something good

Please don't pass me by
If I'm walking but I don't know why
I can't get you off of my mind
Can you love me if I put up a fight?

Is it something you make a habit of?
That's not what I need from love, right now
Right now, right now, right now
