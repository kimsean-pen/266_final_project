Under light rays of sunrise
You spring out of bed

Shaved skin and perfume, 8am
I'm still in my head

And the seed you sowed
is now reaching the
bedroom ceiling fan

Well, am I really your man?
(Am I really your man?)

Yeah, I'm sorry, but these things come and go
Hard to pin down
Why would I think that we're different somehow?
So much work just to keep it light

Oh, I am sorry that these things come and go,
I tell you now the only way I can convey it, with sound
With some chords I can't even play
and will never know how

There's trouble every day
so why are you awake this early?

There's trouble every day
so why are you awake already?
