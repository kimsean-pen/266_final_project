I don't know why, I love ya like I do,
(with) all the changes, you put me through,
Take my money, my cigarettes,
I haven't seen the worst of it yet,

I wanna know, can you tell me?
I'd really love to stay...

Take me to the river,
Drop me in the water,
Take me to the river,
Dip me in the water,

(Washing me down, washing me down, washing me down, washing me down)

I don't know why you treat me so bad,
Think of all the things, that we could have had,
Love is a notion, and I cant forget, (aahhh)
My sweet sixteen, I'll never regret
I wanna know, can you tell me?
Id really love to stay...

Take me to the river,
Drop me in the water,
Take me to the river,
Dip me in the water,

Love me, squeeze me,
Love me, tease me,
Till I can't, till I can't, till I can't, till I can't...

I don't know why, I love ya like I do,
All the trouble, you put me through,
Sixteen candles, blowing on the wall,
And here I am, the biggest fool of all
I wanna know, can you tell me?
Id really love to stay...

Take me to the river,
Drop me in the water, (come on, come on, come on)
Dip me in the water, (oh yeah, you got to take me)
Drop me in the river, (in the river, come on)
Dip me in the water, (now take me in the water, yeah)
Drop me in the river,
(you got to drop me in the river, come on, come on)
Push me in the water, (push me in the water now, come on)
Drop me in the river,
