William don't you love that struggle
Don't think music's real
Let the ethics of sleep
Turn on its own wheel
Let's get drunk in the fields tonight
Like melons
Now that I'm seen
Pain and skill
Pain and skill
Pain and skill
Pain and skill
Pain and skill
Read like a dream
The body's language is hard
Like solitaire without cards
Faces unsolved
Still appear
Still appear
Still appear
Still appear
Still appear
The language of the body lingers on
