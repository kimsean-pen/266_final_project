I can't get high enough above you
I can't get drunk enough to love you
I'm the angel to your devil
I won't sink down to your level
The way I fell for you is tragic
You must have used that dirty magic over me
I can't get high enough above you
I can't get drunk enough to love you
I am the angel to your devil
I won't sink down to your level
The way I fell for you is tragic
You must have used that dirty magic over me
How did I let you talk me into love?
It's the same old way I let that push become a shot
(Ooh) Now I walk like a zombie
(Ooh) Into the chill of the night
(Ooh) I just want you to hold me
Until everything's alright
I can't get high enough above you
I can't get drunk enough to love you
I am the angel to your devil
I won't sink down to your level
The way I fell for you is tragic
You must have used that dirty magic over me
You hypnotize me with your love
Now I stepped into your darkness
[?] let me go
(Ooh) Now I walk like a zombie
(Ooh) Into the chill of the night
(Ooh) I just want you to hold me
Until everything's alright
I can't get high enough above you
I can't get drunk enough to love you
I am the angel to your devil
I won't sink down to your level
The way I fell for you is tragic
You must have used that dirty magic over me
(Ooh)
I can't get high enough
I can't get high enough
I can't get high enough above you
I can't get drunk enough to love you
I am the angel to your devil
I won't sink down to your level
The way I fell for you is tragic
You must have used that dirty magic over me
I can't get high enough above you
I can't get drunk enough to love you
I am the angel to your devil
I won't sink down to your level
The way I fell for you is tragic
You must have used that dirty magic over me
