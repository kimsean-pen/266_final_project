Look behind you
Avoid the shadows
Watch your back now
Make your breathing shallow
Keep your room locked
And leave the blinds closed
I'm right there staring at your window
And all I need is you, all I need is you

I'm in the background on the radio
I'm in your car, in your house, waiting at your door
Under your footsteps, I'm everything you know
Just let me haunt, Let me haunt, Let me be your ghost
Let me haunt, Let me haunt, Let me be your ghost

You had your chance love
You tried to stay strong
You tried to let go
Tell yourself you moved on
But then it comes back
That feeling in your bones
Like I 'm right there
And all I need is you, and all I need is you

I'm in the background on the radio
I'm in your car, in your house, waiting at your door
Under your footsteps, I'm everything you know
Just let me haunt, Let me haunt, Let me be your ghost
Let me be your ghost, Just let me be your ghost

I'm in the background on the radio
I'm in your car, in your house, waiting at your door
Under your footsteps, I'm everything you know
Just let me haunt, Let me haunt, Let me be your ghost
