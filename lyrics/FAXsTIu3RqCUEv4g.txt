Hey, I can be the answer
I'm ready to dance when the vamp up
And when I hit that dip, get your camera
You could see I been that bitch since the Pamper
And that I am that young sis, the beacon
The bitch who wants to compete, and
I can freak a 'fit that pump with the peep and
You know what your bitch become when her weave in
I just wanna sip that punch wit your peeps and
Sit in that lunch if you're treatin'
Kick it wit your bitch who come from Parisian
She know where I get mine from and the season
Now she wanna lick my plum in the evenin'
And fit that ton-tongue d-deep in
I guess that cunt gettin' eaten
I guess that cunt gettin' eaten
I guess that cunt gettin' eaten
I guess that cunt gettin' eaten
I guess that cunt...

Nigga, you know what's up or don't you?
Word to who made ya, I'm a rude bitch, nigga

Cock-a-lickin' in the water by the blue bayou
Caught the warm goo in your doo-rag too, son?

Wonder who let you come to 1-2 wit your doo-doo crew, son
Fuck, are you into, huh?

Tell your crew don't front, I'm a hoodlum nigga

Tellin' 'em you made some
Saying you grindin' but ya ain't goin' nowhere
Why procrastinate, girl?
You've got a lot, but you just waste all yours, and
They'll forget your name soon
And won't nobody be to blame but yourself, yeah

Fuck ya gon do when ya goon sprayed up?
Bet his bitch won't get 'em, betcha you won't do much
