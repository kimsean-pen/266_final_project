(Spoken)
"I'm so sure", what a snotty thing to say
Stuck up people always get their way
They think they're so cool
These are the kind of people that you drool over
That is because they don't really care except about their finger nails and their long pretty
hair
Go up to one of these girls someday and say "I think I've found your cure" and I'll bet
they'll turn their back on you and say "I'm so sure"

I don't wanna be like you (3x)

(Verse 1)
Every time that I walk in the door
You put me down just a little bit more
You think that you're better than everyone else
But everyone knows that you're stuck on yourself
And I don't know what you want me to do
And I don't know what you want me to say
I think that I need to get away, away, away, away, away

(Chorus)
Over and over and over and over and over again
It's the same old questions
Over and over it's over it's over again
With the same suggestions
I don't wanna be like you, I don't wanna be like you, I don't wanna be like you

(Verse 2)
Sometimes I'm wrong, sometimes I'm right
I just need a little taste to get by
The flavors so good it's much better than you
There's nothing left and there's no more to do
Every time that I walk in the door you put me down just a little bit more
You think that your better than everyone else
You don't know nothing, your stuck on yourself

(Chorus)
Over and over and over and over and over again
It's the same old questions
Over and over it's over it's over again
With the same suggestions
I don't wanna be like you, I don't wanna be like you, I don't wanna be like you

(Bridge)
I never wanna be anything like you cause I hate you (that's right)
I never wanna be anything like you I don't trust you (yeah!)
I never wanna be anything like you cause I hate you (yeah)
I don't trust you and I hate you, I don't love you anymore
I don't trust you and there's no solution over and over and over it's over, it's over again

Now that you're gone and you're gone far away
Everything's perfect, everything's okay
No bitchin' and fussin' and fighting all day
I don't have anything left to say

(Chorus)
Over and over and over and over and over again
It's the same old questions
Over and over it's over it's over again
With the same suggestions
I don't wanna be like you (cause there's no solution!), I don't wanna be like you, I don't
wanna be like you

Sick of makin' pollution!
Cause there's no solution, cause there's no solution!
