I want to be a dry town after first rain
I want to be green, uncommonly
A life of want
A life that's always pending
A childhood home that's now pretending

Doesn't seem so far
Doesn't seem so impossible
Keep me close or else I'm out of control
Call for attention
This is critical
A welcome sign turned off so typical

It's simple really, how sad it is
It's simple really, how sad it is

There's nothing new under the moon
I've seen enough, haven't you?

I want to be a fawn, orphaned young
I want to have grace, to spite everyone
A life of want
A life that's always longing
We'll skip town once I'm done stalling

Doesn't seem so far
Doesn't seem so impossible
Keep me close because I'm losing control
Call for attention
This is critical
A welcome sign turned off it's time to go

It's simple really, how sad it is
It's simple really, how sad it is

There's nothing new under the moon
So burn it down, I'll see you soon
