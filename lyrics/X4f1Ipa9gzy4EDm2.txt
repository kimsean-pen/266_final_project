I take a hammer and I break my legs
I break them for the better
The two of them are always walking me
Into the stormy weather

I got the government to change my name, yeah
Change it all together
The silly thing it never had a ring
As though it skipped a letter, letter, letter

Now that you're all gone (all gone, all gone)
(I bet you don't feel lighter)
Well no I don't feel lighter
'Cos I'm all gone (all gone, all done)
So there's a little left over
Yeah there's a lot left over, though I'm all gone (hooo-hoo-hoo)

I take a pistol and I blow my brain
I blow it out the window
The little thing was always acting strange
And thinking like a devil

I'm getting close to reinventing me, yeah
Zeroing my levels
I get the feeling that it will not be
At all or any better, better, better

Now that you're all gone (all gone, all gone)
(I bet you don't feel lighter)
Well no I don't feel lighter
'Cos I did it wrong, did it wrong, did it wrong
So there's a little left over
Yeah there's a lot left over,
Though I'm all gone, (all gone), all gone, (all gone)

Oooooooooh
I gotta get away
From myself
I gotta get help
Oooooooooh

I take a hammer, yeah
I take a little pistol, yeah
I got the government,
I got old Prime Minister

I build a bomb, yeah a big old bomb
And I put it on a tether
Spin it around 'til the bomb goes off
And now I'm floating in the ever, ever, after

Now that you're all gone (all gone, all gone)
(I bet you don't feel lighter)
Well no I don't feel lighter
'Cos I did it wrong, did it wrong, did it wrong
So there's a little left over
Yeah there's a lot left over,
Though I'm all gone, (all gone), all gone, (all gone)
