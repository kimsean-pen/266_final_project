We're born to reign as masters
To ashes we'll burn the pastures
Repell their ways back to nothingness
Chaos in symmetry
This glorious victory
In darkness only we can see

Our name has seen the future
Headshot target now on god
Pointblank crimson dawn
Spew forth tomorrow's spawn

Transcend with rage of the elite
The new order come to rise and shine
Write new history as we wipe and delete
An urge to rid this world of human waste
Weak aside

Defiled bloodlines severed
The lowlife's doom endeavoured
The sheep of masses trampled under our march
Set out to lead and create
This power indulge our fate
This era calls for annihilation
Our whispers outsound prayers
We claimwhat was never theirs
Sworn to the triumph of darkness

Down... insects bow to me
Die... insects too blind to see
Down... disgusting foul flea
Die... we remove the life of thee
