friends of mine
They said they were friends of mine
Said they were passing time
More like a waste of time

Close the door
I said close the door
I've told you twice before
What are you waiting for?

Georgie Davies is coming out
No more heroew, we twist and shout
Oh no, not me, I'm not too late,
And I know that I'm not taking any more
Rocky Picture has lost his gun
Leave him out now, he's having fun
Oh no, not me, I'm not too late
And I know that I'm not waiting any more
Hey hey

Through the eyes
Don't have to advertise
When will you realize
I'm sick of your alibis?

Running cold
The water's running cold
It's time that you were told
I think you're growing old

Georgie Davies is coming out
No more heroes, we twist and shout
Oh no, not me, I'm not too late,
And I know that I'm not waiting any more
Rocky Picture has lost his gun
Leave him out now, he's having fun
Oh no, not me, I'm not too late,
And I know that I'm not taking any more
Hey hey

(pictures on the wall
they're all friends of yours
see them sell your alibi
it runs you by
think yourself lucky!)

Friends of mine
They said they were friends of mine
They were just wasting time
Out on the dotted line

The money's gone
I've known it all along
Why don't you say I'm wrong?
Why don't they drop the bomb?

'Cause Georgie Davies is coming out
No more heroes, we twist and shout,
Oh no, not me, I'm not too late,
and I know that I'm not waiting any more
Rocky Picture's thrown away his gun
Leave him out now, he's having fun
Oh no, not me, I'm not too late,
And I know that I'm not taking any more

What you doing, friends of mine
Holding back now, friends of mine
I've always heard you calling...
