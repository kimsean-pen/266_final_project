Oh, It's too easy
We're already bored
But we leave every party the last
just like before.
We're so young in old places
and we have nothing but our young faces
And the world is sick
sick and closed since hundreds of years
Red neon in the street
strangers will never meet
Was it worth it, was it really worth it?
Was it worth it, was it really worth it?
I don't know
But something got stuck in our clothes
ciggarette smoke in our hair
I have a feeling
we should be going somewhere

But you know, that I know that
We're never coming home,
We're never coming home
We're never coming home...

But you know, that I know that
We're never coming home,
We're never coming home
We're never coming home...

And you know,
that I know that you know that I know...

Oh, It's so easy
In the night
It takes a while for our eyes
to adjust to the light
We're so young in the city
our bodies are young and pretty
And the world is old
old and freezing cold
It needs our feverish heat
in the street
The red neon playing in the rain
and you say
that's our young thick blood
running down the drain
Even when I try
I know that's a lie, cause

You know that I know that
We're never coming home
We're never coming home
We're never coming home

You know that I know that
We're never coming home
We're never coming home
We're never coming home

You know that I know that
We're never coming home
We're never coming home
We're never coming home
