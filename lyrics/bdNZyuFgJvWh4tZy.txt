Could you cover all this
Though I like your friend better
No plan, just run into me
At this pont I go far for a heartbeat
At this pont I go far for a heartbeat
(Anything)
At this pont I go far for a heartbeat
You don't even thrill me, am I better off without it?
Could you cover all this
Though I like your friend better

Still you text me baby
Start to bore me lately
And when we meet up late you
You act like all is good, like I'm your girlfriend
(I'm no girlfriend)
I don't even wanna be your girlfriend
(No girlfriend)
But at this point I go far
At this pont I go far for a heartbeat
You souldn't call me later if you're hooked on me baby

Cause you don't know?
We're nothing
Cause you don't know?
