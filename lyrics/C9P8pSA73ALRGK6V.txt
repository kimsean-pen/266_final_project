You say that you're a free spirit
All you seem to do is hit it and quit it
I wish I was a free spirit
I guess you're not the type of guy to commit to shit
You say that you're a free spirit
All I seem to do is kiss it and miss it
That's just another way of saying your bullshit
Today you woke up in my bed and legged it
You're fit
But you're not in it for the long trip
We're just a holiday and I quit
Being your side chick
You show me love when you just don't want it
Maybe without you I'm cool enough
And I don't need to
Play it cool
Play it cool
Maybe without you I'm cool enough
And I don't need to
Play it cool
Play it cool
Play it cool, play it cool
(You never)
Play it cool, play it cool
For me
Play it cool, play it cool
(You never)
Play it cool, play it cool
For me
We turn up to your mate's party
You see that Stacy girl and act like you don't know me
You make me feel so lonely
See you at 4AM when you still wanna go home with me
You're fit
But you're not in it for the long trip
We're just a holiday and I quit
Being your side chick
You show me love when you just don't want it
Maybe without you I'm cool enough
And I don't need to
Play it cool
Play it cool
Maybe without you I'm cool enough
And I don't need to
Play it cool
Play it cool
Play it cool, play it cool
(You never)
Play it cool, play it cool
For me
Play it cool, play it cool
(You never)
Play it cool, play it cool
For me
I know that I'm a cool chick
But you make me forget it
Tell me how do you do it
One look from you, I'm losing my shit
I know that I'm a cool chick
But you make me possessive
Tell me how do you do it
One look from you, I'm losing my shit
You're fit
But you're not in it for the long trip
We're just a holiday and I quit
Being your side chick
You show me love when you just don't want it
Maybe without you I'm cool enough
And I don't need to
Play it cool
Play it cool
Maybe without you I'm cool enough
And I don't need to
Play it cool
Play it cool
Play it cool, play it cool
(You never)
Play it cool, play it cool
For me
Play it cool, play it cool
(You never)
Play it cool, play it cool
For me
