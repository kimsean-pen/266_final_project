You
You
You
You

Tell me what you want
What you like
It's okay
I'm a little curious, too
Tell me if it's wrong
If it's right
I don't care
I can keep a secret, can you?

Got my mind on your body and your body on my mind
Got a taste for the cherry, I just need to take a bite

Don't tell your mother
Kiss one another
Die for each other
We're cool for the summer

Take me down into your paradise
Don't be scared 'cause I'm your body type
Just something that we wanna try
'Cause you and I
We're cool for the summer
(We're cool for the summer)

Tell me if I won
If I did
What's my prize?
I just wanna play with you, too
Even if they judge
Fuck it
I'll do the time
I just wanna have some fun with you

Got my mind on your body and your body on my mind
Got a taste for the cherry, I just need to take a bite

Don't tell your mother
Kiss one another
Die for each other
We're cool for the summer

Take me down into your paradise
Don't be scared 'cause I'm your body type
Just something that we wanna try
'Cause You and I (You and I)
We're cool for the summer
We're cool for the summer
We're cool for the summer
We're cool for the summer
We're cool for the summer

(We're cool for the summer)

Take me down into your paradise
Don't be scared 'cause I'm your body type
Just something that we wanna try (wanna try)
'Cause You and I (You and I)
We're cool for the summer
We're cool for the summer

'Cause I'm your body type
Just something that we wanna try
'Cause You and I (You and I)
We're cool for the summer
We're cool for the summer

Take me down
Don't be scared
Take me down
Don't be scared
Take me down
Don't be scared
