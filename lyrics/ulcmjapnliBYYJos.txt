You said you'd stay
I said I'd wait
Oh, those words we spoke in vain
I still recall the bitter taste

I guess something's never changed
And then I think of yesterday
And every promise that you made
I never thought I'd be the one that you would break

But I will fight until the day the world stops turning
And they will fall to ashes

I will just keep burning
But tonight
I need you to save me
I'm too close to breaking
I see a light

I am standing on the edge of my life
Standing on the edge of my life
Standing on the edge of my life
So this is how it all turns out

You're the hero, I'm left out
I should've known you couldn't stand up for me and be a man
I still have dreams of you and I
I can't tell the dark from light

I never thought I'd be the one you leave behind
But I will fight until the day the world stops turning

And they will fall to ashes
I will just keep burning
But tonight

I need you to save me
I'm too close to breaking
I see a light
I am standing on the edge of my life

With each step
I hold my breath

And I'm tangled in your spider webs
I call
How can I fall?

And I wonder if you ever care at all
And I will fight until the day the world stops turning
And they will fall to ashes
I will just keep burning
But tonight
I need you to save me
I'm too close to breaking
I see a light
I am standing on the edge of my life
Standing on the edge of my life
Standing on the edge of my life
I am standing on the edge of my life
