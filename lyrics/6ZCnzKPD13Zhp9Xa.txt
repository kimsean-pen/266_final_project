Down by your side
I watch the dreary light
It illuminates your sleeping skin
I reach my cold arm across the bed
You make no move
You never do
Own these dire nights
Own their seething lies
Own my damage
Own my sears
They paint a broken life's
Shattered art
And time won't turn
My wretched world
To stand in your shadow is to be home
