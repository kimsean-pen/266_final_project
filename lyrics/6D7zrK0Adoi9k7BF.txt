See the ghost I have become
Save the prayers for the living ones
Feel the dark that I've become
Send your crows into the light
To fill the skies and dim the sun

Cast the shadows on my side
Fulfil the oath of the broken ones
Hallowed halls of setting suns
Lost in the vacuum of this heart

Hear my heartstrings shattering
As tombs open before me
And she sang

Bury my heart
Cover it with the coldest stones
So it will suffer longer
Like I did in your arms
Like I did in your arms
Like I did in your arms
Your arms

You led me into the darkest night
To the deepest shades with your heart open wide
Into the battle with death on your shoulder

Like a templar knight
With god on his side
Straight into the arms of your enemy
Through the flames with fire in her eyes

Saints, have mercy upon us

Cast the shadows on my side
Fulfil the oath of the broken ones
Hallowed halls of setting suns
Lost in the vacuum of this heart
Lost in the vacuum of this heart

You led me into the darkest night
To the deepest shades with your heart open wide
Into the battle with death on your shoulder

Like a templar knight
With god on his side
Straight into the arms of your enemy
Through the flames with fire in her eyes

Saints, have mercy upon us

See the ghost I have become
Save the prayers for the living ones
Feel the dark that we've become
Send your crows into the light
To fill the skies and dim the sun

Bury my heart
Cover it with the coldest stones
So it will suffer longer
Like I did in your arms
Like I did in your arms
Like I did in your arms
Your arms
