Sigh at all the lies I believed
Outshine a million G's
No disguise don't keep I underneath
Should never mention me
Been doing this ting since screwface and stimpy
Since den didn't sleep
Never lied on a beat
Just started off in 96
Heart taken from my ribs
I tell her go & flick wrist
Show no love na that's a risk
Fuck your other man try get me but he missed
Fuck it see no evil
Selling coke is illegal
Stick up stack up with my people
Nothing to lose
And I don't sit down I don't stick round I stick up and move
And if I hold the light shine it bright on my crew
Tellem it's not me it's you
That's why I make tune after tune after tune
That's why they all wheel up they rewind it
Your gonna blow it's just timing
I rap cause cos I'm from no silence
just sirens and the guns and violence
Saw your face u went red
Did I make you upset
When you looked at me
You said I'll be a sheg we'll I could of been
Fuck dat, chase paper chase dream
Look mum I step clean
Me and my team
We know what it means to survive
Back den no asking polite
The mandem will scar him for life
Said he was a good hearted kid
But in the field when ur strapped there's no asking could I would I
It's straight eye for an eye
But look how your both blind
Kinda sad daddy died but look at your boy rise
You mandem are getting too close
Be careful how you approach me or my bros yh
Bitch move slow
So many man that wanna take my glow
That's why they all wheel it up they rewind it
Your gonna blow it's just timing
I rap cause I from no silence just sirens and the guns and violence
