I don't wanna hear it
All you do is talk about you
I don't wanna hear it
'Cause I know that none of it's true
I don't wanna hear it
I'm sick and tired of all your lies
I don't wanna hear it

When are you gonna realize
I don't wanna hear it
Know you're full of shit
I don't wanna hear it
Know you're full of shit
I don't wanna hear it
Know you're full of shit
I don't wanna hear it

I don't wanna hear it
All you do is talk about you
I don't wanna hear it
'Cause I know that none of it's true
I don't wanna hear it
I'm sick and tired of all your lies
I don't wanna hear it

When are you gonna realize
That I don't wanna hear it
Know you're full of shit
I don't wanna hear it
Know you're full of shit
I don't wanna hear it
Know you're full of shit
I don't wanna hear it

Shut your fucking mouth
I don't care what you say
You keep talking, talking everyday
First you're telling stories
Then you're telling lies

When the fuck are you gonna realize
I don't wanna hear it
Know you're full of shit
I don't wanna hear it
Know you're full of shit
I don't wanna hear it
Know you're full of shit
I don't wanna hear it
Oh, shut up
