I just want to be invisible with you
I drift in and out of time zones with you
Just squeeze me until my skin turns to dark blue
My pity party's not the same without you

I don't wanna be your crybaby
I don't wanna be your crybaby now
I don't wanna be your crybaby
I don't wanna be your crybaby now

You're the morning I can't wait to wake to
After chasing you through my dreams in bloom
I'll please you until you're sick of me in full
Maybe I can sleep through my mood 'til June

I don't wanna be your crybaby
I don't wanna be your crybaby now
I don't wanna be your crybaby
I don't wanna be your crybaby now
I don't wanna be your crybaby
I don't wanna be your crybaby now
I don't wanna be your crybaby
I don't wanna be your crybaby now

Now I'm squinting at life through my sad, sour vision
Your silent sting concretely left my face twisted
Your mess in my chest has me stressed and depressed
Do your eyes miss my name
When you check on your texts, or not?

Nothing, nothing good comes from late night thinking
Don't you, don't you know it's that gloom boy season?
Nothing, nothing good comes from late night thinking
I thought I told you it's that gloom boy season?

I don't wanna be your crybaby
I don't wanna be your crybaby now
I don't wanna be your crybaby
I don't wanna be your crybaby now
I don't wanna be your crybaby
I don't wanna be your crybaby now
I don't wanna be your crybaby
I don't wanna be your crybaby now
I don't wanna be your crybaby
I don't wanna be your crybaby now
