Make a space
For my body
Dead or whole,
Push this side apart
This is what I'm controlling,
It's a mole, the inside that I cart

This will be my monument
This will be a beacon when I'm gone, gone, gone
When I'm gone, gone, gone
When I'm gone!

Soon when that moment comes,
I can say I did it all with love, love, love
All with love, love, love
All with love!

Make a space
For my body
Dead or whole,
Push this side apart
This is what I'm controlling,
It's a mole, the inside that I cart

This will be my monument
This will be a beacon when I'm gone, gone, gone
When I'm gone, gone, gone
When I'm gone!

Make a cast of my body
Pull back out,
So that I can see
Make a world Are you ruling?
Make a world
What I used to be

Soon when that moment comes,
I can say I did it all with love, love, love
All with love, love, love,
All with love, love,
love, love, love
love, love, love
All with love
