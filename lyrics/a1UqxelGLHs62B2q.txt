Tell me pretty lies
Look me in the face
Tell me that you love me
Even if it's fake
'Cause I don't fuckin' care, at all

You been out all night
I don't know where you've been
You're slurrin' all your words
Not makin' any sense
But I don't fuckin' care, at all

'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fuckin' care
Like they ain't even there
'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fuckin' care
'Cause I'm so fuckin' scared

I'm only a fool for you
And maybe you're too good for me
I'm only a fool for you
But I don't fuckin' care, at all, oh, oooh
Ooh yeah

Tell me pretty lies
Look me in the face
Tell me that you love me
Even if it's fake
'Cause I don't fuckin' care, at all

You been out all night
I don't know where you've been
You're slurrin' all your words
Not makin' any sense
But I don't fuckin' care, at all

'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fuckin' care
Like they ain't even there
'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fuckin' care
'Cause I'm so fuckin' scared

I'm only a fool for you
And maybe you're too good for me
I'm only a fool for you
But I don't fuckin' care, at all, oh, ooh
Ooh yeah
