Yes

Just distant, afraid
Get you on the same page
I'm not sure if you understand
(There is no medicine once you open that)
What exactly is the truth that's happening for you?
Do you get it and you know it's not the same?
Don't you think that everything now is fast and failing?

Better days ahead
It's, it's bad right now
It's, it's big right now
(There is no medicine once you open that)
It's been before
It, it will be ahead

Don't you see the ship is right in front of you?
It never will linger
I'm not hiding anything
I'm not trying to say that help is not around

It's all just a tune
Just a simple phrase
(There is no medicine once you open that)
To let you know the way out
To see how you feel about that

And I've seen it, everything
The only thing to say is slow
The only thing to say is slow
How

Just, just a simple phrase
(There is no medicine once you open that)
Just a simple phrase
Just a simple phrase
Simple
It's dancing

Just a simple phrase
(There is no medicine once you open that)
Just a simple phrase
