We waited all night to hear the story
How the two stupidest kids could come to glory
The doctor always said we had bad bones
They were having such a good one

I'm sorry for being sorry
That cause of anxiety
It's wasted all night
This should never have been a crime

They locked up our fathers for twenty
Now they limit our culture to Fridays
You had to work four jobs and used two phones
But the drug store still ends up with our money

I'm sorry for being sorry
That cause of anxiety
It's wasted all night
This should never have been a crime

I'm sorry for being sorry
That cause of anxiety
It's wasting all our nights
This should never have been a crime
I'm sorry for being sorry
That cause of anxiety
It's wasted all night
This should never have been a crime
