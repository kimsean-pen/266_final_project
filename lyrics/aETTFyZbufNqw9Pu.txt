Coming through a cloud, you're looking at me from above
And I'm a revelation, spreading out before your eyes
And you find me beautiful and irresistible
A giant creature that forever seems to grow in size,
And you feel a strange attraction,
Ooh, ooh the air is vibrant and electrified,
Welcome to me, here I am my arms are open wide

Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise,
There is a pulse, a steady rhythm of a heart that beats
And a million voices blend into a single voice,
And you can hear it in the clamour of the crowded streets,
People come and take their chances,
Ooh, ooh, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose a lot
Come make your own contribution to this melting pot

I'm the street you walk, the language you talk
I am the city, the skyline is me and the energy
I am the city, the famous hotels
And the cocktail bars, and the funny smells
And the turmoil of cars, and the people
The air that you're breathing is me,
Yes I am the city, you let me be

People feed me with their lives, I am a hungry soul
And they all worship me, and pay their homage day and night
Everyday I hear a lot of tired, shuffling feet
But come tonight they will be dancing in the neon light,
Dazzled by the crazy magic,
Ooh, ooh, they're grabbing pieces of the fatted calf
And in the wind if you listen hard, you'll hear me laugh

I'm the street you walk, the language you talk
I am the city, the skyline is me and the energy
I am the city, the famous hotels
And the cocktail bars, and the funny smells
And the turmoil of cars, and the people
The parks and the squares that you see,
All the sounds that you hear,
And the air that you're breathing is me,
Yes I am the city, you let me be
I am the city, you let me be, I am the city

The famous hotels and the cocktail bars,
And the funny smells and the turmoil of cars,
And the people, the air that you're breathing is me
Coming through a cloud, you're looking at me from above
And I'm a revelation, spreading out before your eyes

I'm the street you walk, the language you talk
I am the city yes, I am the city, you let me be
And you find me beautiful and irresistible,
A giant creature that forever seems to grow in size,
The skyline is me and the energy,
I am the city you let me be

Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise,
There is a pulse, a steady rhythm of a heart that beats
I'm the street you walk, the language you talk
I am the city, yes I am the city, you let me be
And a million voices blend into a single voice,
And you can hear it in the clamour of the crowded streets,
The skyline is me, and the energy
I am the city you let me be.
