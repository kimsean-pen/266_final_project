Painted doorway, open minded.
Creaking stair set take me skyward.
Close your blue eyes, kiss my dry lips.
Learn my lessons, put your dress on.

Light this sidewalk, drunk i stumble.
Words from my mouth, hear me mumble.
Who am i to fall in something
Close to loving, ever hurting.

Find my heartbeat drugs and failures.
Make your way to cure my senses.
Close your blue eyes, kiss my dry lips.
Fall in love with my own loneliness.

Baby, lick your wounds.
