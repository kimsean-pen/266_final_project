i no longer feel like sinking
down the black moor on my own
those heavy winds feel more frosty
wish i could be with someone
i like to give but now i feel like taking
let me consume you and escape these times
i no longer feel like walking
in your car please make sure that we fly
the softest way of taking is exploiting
your body for the pleasure of mine
and noone kisses with such a fire
the only way we give and take at the same time
