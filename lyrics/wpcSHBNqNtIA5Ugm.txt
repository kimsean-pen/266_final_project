Shout it out, I can't hold back no more
I let it out, all these feelings that were trapped inside
I was frozen every time I looked in your eyes

Clear my head from all the clutter
Things I should have said that wasn't me
No, I can't live like that breaking up
And there is no looking back

Every little tear I was scared to cry
Everything I feared but I kept inside
I don't want to hold it back one more day
Oh, I'll wash it away

Every time a thought clouded up my head
Every single word that I never said
I refuse to feel ashamed, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain

Clear the sky, I start to breath again now
Been too high, let you through to who I am inside
Every layer till you get underneath my skin
Let you in, let you in

Every little tear I was scared to cry
Everything I feared but I kept inside
I don't want to hold it back one more day
Oh, I'll wash it away

Every time a thought clouded up my head
Every single word that I never said
I refuse to feel ashamed
Let it rain, let it rain

All the hurt that's been stuck inside of me
Make it pour, make it bleed
Let the rain wash it clean, wash it clean
Let it rain

Every little tear I was scared to cry
Everything I feared but I kept inside
I don't want to hold it back one more day
Oh, I'll wash it away

Every time a thought clouded up my head
Every single word that I never said
I refuse to feel ashamed
Let it rain, oh, let it rain

Yeah, wash me clean
Wash me clean
