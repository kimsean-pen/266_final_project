A storm is on the horizon
Five years burning up the sky
Time to break the silence
Wild like me, w-w-wild like me

We are living the wild life
They're trying to hunt us down
We come alive in the night time
Wild like me, w-w-wild like me

You and me underneath the sun
We're living while we're young
Hey, won't you come get wild like me?
Wild like me

Hey, we're too hard to bring us down
Tonight we're going loud
Hey, won't you come get wild like me?
Wild like me

W-w-wild like me
W-w-wild like me

They're trying to tame us
Cage me like an animal
They can never ever change us
Wild like me, w-w-wild like me

We're the z generation
Oh no no, we don't stop
Good girl but no angel
Wild like me, w-w-wild like me

You and me underneath the sun
We're living while we're young
Hey, won't you come get wild like me?
Wild like me

Hey, we're too hard to bring us down
Tonight we're going loud
Hey, won't you come get wild like me?
Wild like me

W-w-wild like me
W-w-wild like me

(Hey!)
They're trying to hunt us down, down, down, down, down
(Oh no no no, oh no no no)
But they can never hunt us down, down, down, down, down
(Oh no no no, oh no no no)
They're trying to hunt us down, down, down, down, down
(Oh no no no, oh no no no)
Wild, wild, wild, wild like me
Wild, wild, wild, wild like me

W-w-wild like me
W-w-wild like me
