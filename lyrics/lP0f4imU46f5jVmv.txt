Fear for the morning of a life in dream parade
Tears fall tomorrow, in autumn sun brigade

Fear...
Pain...
And the ever falling rain

Pray for the dawn when the colors start to fade
Swear by your God when all life is down the drain

Still...
Yearn for the everlasting flame

Turn to me,
Bless the sun,
All of this is sane.
Turn from me,
Start to run,
None of this is saved.

Life for the promise all fortune come today
Graceful we wander through a life of grey

Remember when the orchids dream
Try to save the blood that's falling from you
Will you be there in war and grief?
And try to speak the word of God?

Swear no remorse for the ones who lost their fate
Symbols of horror in handsome masquerade

Still...
No mortal soul to resignate

Wake from the coma you've chosen to create
Pay for your solace
And a life in vain

Still, call my name,
Drown your heart,
The orchid sky is dead.
Take my blame,
Fall apart in tides of no regret.
Kill the pain,
Hide the scars,
The orchids die now.
