Good evening people, welcome to the show
Got somethin' here I want you all to know
When laughin' people bring on primal screams
You got to think of
What it's gonna take to make your dreams

Make It
Don't break it
I said Make It
Don't Brake it
Do then you feel like the world's coming down on you

You know that history repeats itself
But you just learned so by somebody else
You know you do, you gotta think up fast
You gotta figure what it's gonna take to make it last
Make It
Don't brake it
I said Make It
Don't brake it
Then you do

Better weather, pull yourself together
Don't be catchin' the blues
Better weather, pull yourself together
What have you got to lose
You're only paying your dues
Too stinkin' proud but you're gonna pay
If you're gone I'll get you anyway
Although you know what you've been going through
Your only dreams feel like a tattoo

Make It
Don't brake it
I said Make It
Don't brake it
Then you do

Better weather, pull yourself together
Don't be catchin' the blues
Better weather, pull yourself together
What have you got to lose
