High just like the runners
We survived under the crystal skies
Silver tides, whipping winds and shore lines
Grows just like a grape vine
We align weather-beaten spines
Settle scores, we just want to be adored

I am still clinging to
These signs that I hope to find
A heart no home can hold
The hole we left behind
I feel your body right here
It takes on any shape
This place that made me run
And gave me any reason to

Stay
In the rain
In the rain
Stay
In the rain
In the rain

Caught in the reminder
Will I sleep? Will I beg for peace?
Leave the reckless hearts (leave the reckless hearts)
And find the little sparks (and find the little sparks)
To lead you through the dark
When you fall apart

My ears are ringing to these
Summers not quite defined
A heart no home can hold
The hole we left behind
I feel your body right here
It takes on any shape
This place that made me run
And gave me any reason to

Stay
In the rain
In the rain
Stay
In the rain
In the rain

My ears are ringing to these
Summers not quite defined
A heart no home can hold
The hole we left behind
I feel your body right here
It takes on any shape
This place that made me run
And gave me any reason to

Stay
In the rain
In the rain
Stay
In the rain
In the rain
