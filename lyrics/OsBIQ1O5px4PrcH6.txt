Love is a game that we could play
Even only for today
I don't wanna lose you
We've been apart for far too long

Now we only have a song
Let the music move you
There was a part of me
That never left a part of you
I wish, I could be everything you wanted

But I'm still young
Wide eyed and hopeless
Yeah, I'm still young
I want your devotion to this

Can we kiss like we do in my head?
Can we dance like we do on my bed?
Like we're still young

Love is a loss that we incur
When we gamble with the world
I don't wanna lose you
I feel my life has just begun

I can hear you sing along
Now the music in you
There was a part of me
That never left a part of you
I wish, I could be everything you wanted

But I'm still young
Wide eyed and hopeless
Yeah, I'm still young
I want your devotion to this

Can we kiss like we do in my head?
Can we dance like we do on my bed?
Like we're still young

Baby, don't you cry
I won't tell you lies
I'll just sit and sing you lullabies

'Cause I'm still young
Wide eyed and hopeless
Yeah, I'm still young
I want your devotion to this

Can we kiss like we do in my head?
Can we dance like we do on my bed?
Like we're still young
