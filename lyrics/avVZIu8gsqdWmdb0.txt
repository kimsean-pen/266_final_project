Put the bottle down, finally got something to say.
Take another look around and find someone else to play.
Needless to say, that you've got problems.
There's no fucking way, that I'm gonna solve them.
It's never the same, every time you slip then you fall down, down, down.

Ever wonder what I've been thinking about?
I've been thinking about throwing you out.

I'm so happy how about you. I'm fed up, so get up, and get out.
I'm so happy now we're through. I'm fed up, so get up, and get out.
I was so afraid, now you've gone away,
Sent you packin', look who's laughin' now.
I'm so happy that I feel this way.
I'm so happy that I threw you away.

Put your problems down and pick up whats left of the blame.
Take a good look at yourself, and see who's really to blame.
Needless to say, you've got issues.
There's no fucking way, that I'm gonna fix you.
It's never the same, ever since you went fallin', down, down, down.
