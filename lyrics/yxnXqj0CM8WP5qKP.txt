Turn all the lights down low
Trying to fade your apathy
Made up a world where you can even be you
Star in a tragedy
A shattered voice on an open chord
They line up around the world just to hear you scream

Blown away by fame
We could all feel the shotgun hit the floor
Never mind in faith
If you can't believe

Drowning in misery
The nightmare began when you closed the door
You sat in your angry chair and just tried to be you
The needle became your queen
The drug had become your enemy
And music was just a way for you to bleed

Blown away by fame
We could all feel the shotgun hit the floor
Never learn in faith
If you can't believe

Blown away by the fame
We could all feel the shotgun hit the floor
Never mind in faith
If you can't believe
And you won't believe
And he can't believe

Blown away by the fame
We could all feel the shotgun hit the floor
Never mind in faith
If you can't believe

Blown away by the fame
We could all feel the shotgun hit the floor
Never mind in faith
If you can't believe
And you won't believe
And he can't believe
And they won't believe
And they can't believe
