Baby I get sick of you
You're that same old tune
I don't ever wanna hear you again
Why are you here, I'd like to skip
Wanna be deaf to it
Can not turn my ears off

But time stops
When your beat drops
It's too strong-ong, long-ong
But time stops
(Time stops)
When your beat drops
(Beat drops)

Turn if off, off, off, off

Baby I hate listening, listening, listening
You drive me so crazy, so crazy, so crazy
Boy can you please play that again

You know you're not what I wanna sing
But you're the only thing, only thing
That's playing in my head
My head, my head, my head, my head

Time stops
(Time stops)
When your beat drops

(Beat drops)
It's too strong-ong, long-ong
But time stops
(Time stops)
When your beat drops
(Beat drops)

Turn if off, off, off, off

When that beat drops
It shatters, glass ceilings
I'm in my feelings
Adrenaline be thrilling
Shards cut deep when you play
Shards cut deep when you stray
Vibrations move those mountains
Chaos flows like fountains
When I don't hear you I need it
When I do hear you I'm bleeding

There's no in between, between it
There's no middle, explain no feelings
It's a loving war with radio
Stop it, stop it
It's a loving war with radio
But I feel it, feel it, feel it

Shooby-dooby-do-do-do-do

Shooby-dooby-do-do-do
Shooby-dooby-do-do-do-do
Shooby-dooby-do-do

Time stops
(Time stops)
When your beat drops
(Beat drops)
It's too strong-ong, long-ong
But time stops
(Time stops)
When your beat drops
(Beat drops)
Turn if off, off, off, off
