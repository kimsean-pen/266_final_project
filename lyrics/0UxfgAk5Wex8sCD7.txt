Eyes lock with yours, my head distorts
You pull me in then turn to a ghost
And now you got me like, frozen in the headlights
Soft, golden skin
Kiss like heaven
You're an open door but you won't let me in
And now you got me like
And now you got me like, oh, oh, oh
Why you gotta' be so

Indestructible
Fire in your bones
Nothing can touch you
Why you gotta', why you gotta'
Why you gotta' be so indestructible?
With a heart that's made of stone
And nothing can break you
Why you gotta' be so indestructible?
Indestructible

You're my blood rush
Just out of touch kills me inside
But I feel so alive
And now you got me like
And now you got me like
I'm flashing like a red light
But you know I'm gonna keep trying
(Why you gotta be so)

Indestructible
Fire in your bones
Nothing can touch you
Why you gotta', why you gotta'
Why you gotta' be so indestructible?
With a heart that's made of stone
And nothing can break you
Why you gotta' be so indestructible?
Indestructible, indestructible

Standing in the cold
It's more than physical
I don't wanna let you go
I don't wanna let you go
Standing in the cold
It's more than physical
I don't wanna let you go
I don't wanna let you go, oh

Indestructible
Fire in your bones
Nothing can touch you
Why you gotta', why you gotta'
Why you gotta' be so indestructible?
With a heart that's made of stone
And nothing can break you
Why you gotta' be so indestructible?
Oh, indestructible, oh, indestructible
Hey, ey, indestructible
Oh, indestructible
