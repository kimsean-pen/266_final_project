It takes ten years just to get
Your stinking leg up
Then five more to make it
Not look like shit

Soviet children form a crowd
Sized and tested
Who will be a star
Nobody knows how you can live without the love of your life

Hero of passion of whom they'll say
She took her final breath in grand plie

O! My mother!
Russian Ballerina!

You were a swan
But now you're swimming in the Carribean

O! My mother!
Russian Ballerina!

Nobody knows how you can live without the love of your life

Everybody's asking me
Where is Mary?
I don't see her at the theatre
Or the parties

That's right, because
She's carving bamboo
Far from the artistic millieu

Never thought she'd live without
Allegiance to a life of art

Oh! My mother! Russian ballerina!

You were a swan but now you're swimming in the Carribean

Oh! My mother! Russian ballerina!

Nobody knows how you can live without the love of your life

La la la, la la la la la

Life changes
One day its eggshells and bread
Married to an intellect
The next you drive a corvette

Things change
You live your life for the stage
Til your kidney floats away
Thrown in a car accident

A time for art
A time for living
Sometimes the two can be conflicting

And mama I'll meet you at Caribana
Together we're the highest form of art

Oh! My mother!
Russian Ballerina!

You were a swan but now you're swimming in the Caribbean

Oh! My mother!
Russian Ballerina!

Nobody knows how you can live without the love of your life

Oh! My mother!
Russian Ballerina!

Too bad your priuettes now look almost as bad as mine

Oh! My mother!
Russian Ballerina!

Who needs that bullshit we can drink at the casino all night

(Everybody now!)

La la la, la la la la la
