Leather jackets, stupid boyfriends,
poor report cards, life is just a ball
Hi- top Chucks and bubblegum and oh my gosh I'd
love to love them all
They're so cool their style is never cramped
Too much of everything and everyone is amped
Well, don't get hot and bothered
listen, I know I got problems
I also know just what this goofy world needs

Yummy yummy punk rock girls (x4)
I wish they all were punk rock girls

The smartest of the smartest and the sweetest of
the sweetest, they're the most
Me and Dr. Frank have both decided that we love
them more than toast
I wish they'd let me share their bubblegum
And let me hang with them and life would be so fun
I should be sedated 'cause my heart is all inflated
I guess I gotta get me one or two

Yummy yummy punk rock girls (x4)
I wish they all were punk rock girls

I don't know where I'm going, but I know just
where I'd like to be
With my punk rock girlfriend kissing me
Let's go

They're so cool their style is never cramped
Too much of everything and everyone is amped
Well, don't get hot and bothered
listen, I know I got problems
I also know just what this goofy world needs

Yummy yummy punk rock girls (x4)
I wish they all were punk rock girls

Cha, cha, cha
