Late night flight, L.A.X.,
limousine and you're all set
for sunset, for sunset

Riot house a penthouse suite
the street's alive below your feet
on sunset, on sunset

Rainbow girl, whiskey man
spotting every star they can
on sunset, on sunset

Rock an' roll every night
underneath them neon signs
on sunset, on sunset

Sunset people, doin' it right -- night after night
sunset people, night after night -- doin' it right
sunset people, doin' it right -- night after night
sunset people, doin' it right -- night after night
holdin' on to the last breath of life
on sunset, on sunset

Smooth haired guys thumbing rides
linin' up from side to side
on sunset, on sunset

In between pretty girls
still sixteen but know the world
on sunset, on sunset

Foreign cars full of stars
tinted glass to hide the scars
from sunset, from sunset

Billboard signs on the strip
glamorize the latest hits
on sunset, on sunset

Sunset people, doin' it right -- night after night
sunset people, night after night -- doin' it right
sunset people, doin' it right -- night after night
sunset people, doin' it right -- night after night
holdin' on to the last breath of life
on sunset, on sunset

Friday night the weekend crowd
moves on in to get on down
on sunset, on sunset

Life is hot life is fast
people try to make it last
on sunset, on sunset

Sunset people, doin' it right -- night after night
sunset people, night after night -- doin' it right
sunset people, doin' it right -- night after night
sunset people, night after night -- doin' it right
sunset people, doin' it right -- night after night
sunset people, night after night -- doin' it right
sunset people, doin' it right -- night after night
