Oh no, I can see it
It's coming for us now
There's nowhere left to run
There's no secret
An animal and I don't wanna let you go
An animal

So let go and breathe in
The neon jungle, I can taste it on your skin
My heart is beating
Hold me closer, I will never let you go
Animal and I will never let you go
Animal

Save me now, I just want it all right now
I just can't control myself, I'm an animal
All I know is I need you
Save me now, I just want it all right now
I just can't control myself, I'm an animal
All I know is I need you

Come down from the ceiling
Lights are falling and the walls are caving in
Sun down and dreaming
Animal, I will never let you go
Animal, I will never let you go

Save me now, I just want it all right now
I just can't control myself, I'm an animal
All I know is I need you
Save me now, I just want it all right now
I just can't control myself, I'm an animal
All I know is I need you

We stand in the glow of the sky
Yeah, I know that I need you
We ran for the dark of the night
Oh yeah, I know that I need you
It's one I can tell of a line
Yeah, I know that I need you
Oh yeah, I know that I need you
