I'm so tired of good health
I'm so tired of this roof and my bed
I'm so tired of cooked food and good moods
A good coup with A/C to cruise
So tired of myself, my word and my wealth
Too big is my heart, too small are my cares
Then she said . . .
I'm so tired of making love
I'm so tired of being kissed
I'm so tired of making money
So tired of this kush and my splif, it don't make sense
I'm so tired of my family, my friends
I'm so tired of one night stands
So tired of living lavish
Two birds and one nest and being notorious

Even when you're gone I can still feel you
I want it more than air
And don't you care?
That's not fair
The only thing you ever really loved
Was right there, right there, right there
Even when you're gone I can still feel you
I want it more than air
And don't you care?
That's not fair
The only thing you ever really loved
Was right there, right there, right there, right there

I'm so tired of this scene
I'm so tired of this ocean, this breeze
So tired but can't close my eyes to find sleep
So tired of this dream (reoccurring)
Your smile, your charm, your patience, loyalty, your love
Ain't you tired of me?
To have it all but not at all complete
Wanting you is all that ever drives my being
That never-ending, ever-tempting, tipping-over
All my energy...
It's all that ever drives my being

Even when you're gone I can still feel you
I want it more than air
And don't you care?
That's not fair
The only thing you ever really loved
Was right there, right there, right there
Even when you're gone I can still feel you
I want it more than air
And don't you care?
That's not fair
The only thing you ever really loved
Was right there, right there, right there, right there, right there
