And if you're really love me
I'll never leave you lonely
Boy you could be my only
'Cause you got the key

Tonight untill forever
As long as we're together
We'll make it through whatever
You got the key yo my heart

Let me up, take me higher
Breath me in my desire
No regrets, don't deny it
Play to win, play to win

I know what they say,
And none of them know
You make me feel say
J'adore, j'adore
I know what they say,
And none of them know

And if you're really love me
I'll never leave you lonely
Boy you could be my only
'Cause you got the key

Tonight untill forever
As long as we're together
We'll make it through whatever
You got the key to my heart

You got the key to my heart
To my heart, to my, to my, to my heart
You got the key to my...
To my heart, to my heart
You got the key to my heart

Tell the world I belong here
Next to you I am stronger
Take my hand, pull me closer
Understand, you got the, got the...

I know what they say,
And none of them know
You make me feel say
J'adore, j'adore
I know what they say,
And none of them know

And if you're really love me
I'll never leave you lonely
Boy you could be my only
'Cause you got the key

Tonight untill forever
As long as we're together
We'll make it through whatever
You got the key to my heart

To my heart, to my, to my, to my heart
To my heart, to my heart
You got the key to my heart
To my heart, to my, to my, to my heart
You got the key to my...
To my heart, to my heart
You got the key to my heart

And I'll never let you go
'Cause you take my breath away
And I can't control this love
You're like a part of me

To my heart, to my, to my, to my heart
To my heart, to my heart
You got the key to my heart
To my heart, to my, to my, to my heart
You got the key to my...
To my heart, to my heart

And if you're really love me
I'll never leave you lonely
Boy you could be my only
'Cause you got the key

Tonight until forever
As long as we're together
We'll make it through whatever
You got the key to my heart
