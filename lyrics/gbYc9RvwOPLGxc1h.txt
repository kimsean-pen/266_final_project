I gotta go, I gotta go
I gotta go somewhere that I don't even know
I gotta be, I gotta be
I gotta be someone that you don't ever see

And now you're picking up the slack
I know you hate that
But you've still got my back
Just let me go, just let me go
But don't you fall for someone else before I'm home
Meanwhile you're living our life without me

But I will make it up to you
'Cause I broke the rules
I'm doing it all, doing it all for us
And I've been acting like a fool
'Cause I love you too much
I'm doing it all, doing it all for us
Doing it all, doing it all for us

I gotta run, I gotta run
I gotta run, you know I'm always in a rush
I gotta fly, I gotta fly
I gotta fly away so I can get a spot

And now you're picking up the slack
I know you hate that
But you've still got my back
I gotta run, I gotta run
I gotta show you I know how to get it done
And now you're living our life without me

But I will make it up to you
'Cause I broke the rules
I'm doing it all, doing it all for us
And I've been acting like a fool
'Cause I love you too much
I'm doing it all, doing it all for us

(I am doing it all for us, oh
I am doing it all for us, yeah)

I gotta go, I gotta go
I gotta go somewhere that I don't even know
I gotta be, I gotta be
I gotta be someone that you don't ever see

But I will make it up to you
'Cause I broke the rules
I'm doing it all, doing it all for us
And I've been acting like a fool
'Cause I love you too much
I'm doing it all, doing it all for us
Doing it all, doing it all for us
Doing it all, doing it all, doing it all for
Doing it all, doing it all, doing it all for
Doing it all, doing it all, doing it all
