Here we are, just let it go
Forget the fear and let yourself explode
Break down the walls
Freedom is yours if you strive for something more

I see through your lies, under the whole disguise
Another hollow mind
I see through your eyes, the light has made you blind
Leaving your soul behind

Wake up before your time is up
You'll never know if you don't try now
So go and don't look back
This is your life, this is your time to shine

Welcome to the revelation
Liberate yourself it's now or never
Don't let them take you down
Welcome to your evolution
Free yourself and make it last forever
Welcome to the revelation

I see through your lies, under the whole disguise
Another hollow mind
I see through your eyes, the light has made you blind
It's not too late to try
So bring yourself back

Welcome to the revelation
Liberate yourself it's now or never
Don't you let them take you down
Welcome to your evolution
Free yourself and make it last forever
Welcome to the revelation

See and you will find all you need is inside

Welcome to the revelation
Liberate yourself it's now or never
Don't you let them take you down
Welcome to your evolution
Free yourself and make it last forever
Welcome to the revelation

Seek and you will find all you need is inside
