It's summertime and the living is easy
Fish are jumping and the cotton is high
Your daddy's rich and your mama's good-looking
Hush, little baby don't you cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry
No no no no
Don't cry, don't cry

One of these mornings you're gonna rise up singing
You spread your wings and take to the sky
But until that morning there is nothing can harm you
With your daddy and mommy standing by
They are standing by, I know, don't cry

Summertime, summertime, summertime
and the living is, living is easy
Fish are, I know the fish are jumping
and cotton is so high
Your daddy is so, so rich and your mama good-
She had to be good-looking
So hush, little baby, don't you cry
Don't you cry, no no, don't cry
No need to cry, don't cry, don't cry
Summertime, summertime
