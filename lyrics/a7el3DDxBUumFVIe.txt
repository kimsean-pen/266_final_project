This is it
This is life, the one you get
So go and have a ball

This is it
Straight ahead and rest assured
You can't be sure at all

So while you're here enjoy the view
Keep on doing what you do
Hold on tight we'll muddle through
One day at a time

So up on your feet
Somewhere there's music playing
Don't you worry none
Just take it like it comes

One day at a time
One day at a time
One day at a time
One day, one day, one day at a time

One day at a time
One day at a time
One day at a time
