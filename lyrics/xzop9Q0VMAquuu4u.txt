In a way its all a matter of time
I will not worry for you you'll be just fine
Take my thoughts with you and when you look behind
You will surely see, a face that you recognize

Your not alone
I'll wait 'till the end of time
Open your mind, surely it's plain to see
Your not alone
I'll wait 'till the end of time for you
Open your mind, surely there's time to be with me

It is the distance that makes life a little hard
Two minds that once were close now so many miles apart
I will not falter though, I'll hold on to your home
Safely back where you belong
And see how our love has grown

Your not alone
I'll wait 'till the end of time
Open your mind, surely its plain to see

Your not alone
I'll wait 'till the end of time for you
Open your mind, surely there's time to be with me

You're not alone
I'll wait 'till the end of time
Open your mind, surely it's plain to see

Your not alone
I'll wait 'till the end of time for you
Open your mind, surely there's time to be with me

Your not alone
I'll wait 'till the end of time
Open your mind, baby there's time to be with me

Your not alone
I'll wait 'till the end of time
Open your mind, surely there's time to be with me

Your not alone
I'll wait 'till the end of time with you
Open your mind, baby there's time for me and
(You, you, you, you, you, you, you)
