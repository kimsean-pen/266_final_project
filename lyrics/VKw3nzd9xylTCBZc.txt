Taken the shot
a punch in the head
running from God
he thinks that i'm dead

I took the runway around
to get ahead
moment of truth
bring in the bells

Bleeding for your love
for your love
Bledding for your love
for your love
Bleeding for your love

A brick on the gas
making my bed
I wanted flowers
you gave me lead
Shutting my eyes
wind in my hair
I'm close to the edge
holding my breath

Bleeding for your love
for your love
Bledding for your love
for your love
Bleeding for your love
for your love
Bleeding for your love

You know
I am
You know
what I am
you know
I am
You know
what I am
You know what I am

Bleeding for your love
for your love
Bleeding for your love
for your love
Bleeding for your love
for your love
Bleeding for your love
for your love
Bleeding for your love
