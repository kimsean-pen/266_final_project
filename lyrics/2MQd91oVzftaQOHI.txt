All my greetings are dying wishes to get close
All my being is caught up and tied in with yours

We're caught up in a bad dream
Our bodies acting out the sin
And I let you entertain me
'Cause I can be your everything

And you could be the dea-a-ath of me
And you could be the dea-a-ath of me
And you could be the dea-a-ath of me
And you could be the dea-a-ath of me

But it's too late
But it's too late
But it's too late
But it's too late

All my dreamings just a conversation with myself
All my feelings just a ghost that I imagine in my head

Caught up in a bad dream
Our bodies acting out the sin
And you said you'd entertain me
If I can be your everything

And you could be the dea-a-ath of me
And you could be the dea-a-ath of me
And you could be the dea-a-ath of me
And you could be the dea-a-ath of me

But it's too late
But it's too late
But it's too late
And you could be the dea-a-ath of me
And you could be the dea-a-ath of me
But it's too late
And you could be the dea-a-ath of me
And you could be the dea-a-ath of me
But it's too late
And you could be the dea-a-ath of me
And you could be the dea-a-ath of me
But it's too late
And you could be the
And you could be the
And you could be the
