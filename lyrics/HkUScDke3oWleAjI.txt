Gravity, gravity, gravity, gravity, gravity, gravity
Stop pullin' me

I know that you still haven't found you
And when I wanna stand on my own too
Suddenly you start to show signs of what is possible

Then you're back to your ways and I let me down
Tell me why I keep tryna stay around
When all my family, they always tellin' me be through with you
And I know that deep down I'm calling time on you, on you, on you

Every time I'm ready to leave
I seem to be pullin' in the wrong direction, divin' in with no protection
And you can't keep steering me wrong, oh gravity

Pulling me back, pulling me in
Why you pulling me back, pulling me in?
Just like gravity, gravity, gravity, gravity, gravity, gravity

I know I betrayed what I'm made to
Ignore the universe when I see you
'Cause every night the stars will shine merging into U-turn signs

Anything that they can just to change my mind
When I pass your road, I can't help rewind
What is wrong with me? All that I wanna be is through with you
And I know that deep down I'm calling time on you, on you, on you

Every time I'm ready to leave
I seem to be pullin' in the wrong direction, divin' in with no protection
And you can't keep steering me wrong, oh, gravity

Pulling me back, pulling me in
Why you pulling me back, pulling me in?
Just like gravity, gravity, gravity, gravity, gravity, gravity, gravity
Stop pullin' me gravity, gravity, gravity, gravity, gravity, gravity

Be quiet, let me leave, let me go, don't say another word
'Cause with every sound you're pullin' me down
Baby, you got a hold on me like gravity
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, gravity

Every time I'm ready to leave
I seem to be pullin' in the wrong direction,
divin' in with no protection
Oh, you can't keep steering me wrong, oh, gravity

Pulling me back, pulling me in
Why you pulling me back, pulling me in?
Just like gravity, gravity, gravity, gravity, gravity, gravity
Gravity, gravity, gravity, gravity, gravity, gravity
