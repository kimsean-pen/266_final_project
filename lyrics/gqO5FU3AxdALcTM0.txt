Darling I know, you only cry when you're alone
Darling I know, you only laugh to keep it all in

It's scaring the both of us, the things that we've seen
The places we know we must go
But I've only loved one person through all

Don't need an apology to make it right
I just need you as a whole
Don't want an apology to make it right
I want you in all of your glory
All of your glory

You know before me, the people that we, were meant to be
But I'm only trying to be who I thought, you needed

It's killing the both of us, the place that we're in
All the things we've come to
No amount of chaos can keep me from you

Don't need an apology to make it right
I just need you as a whole
Don't want an apology to make it right
I want you in all of your glory

Don't need an apology to make it right
I just need you as a whole
Don't want an apology to make it right
I want you in all of your glory
All of your glory
Oh, all of your glory
