Mines not a solitary heart
Ask him what's wrong
And he won't know where he should start
We'll never ever never ever ever know
We'll never know

Free my mind
Ultraviolent shine
We've got time
To walk a line

(Every single day, every single day)
Anything you want is fine
(I've got enemies, a million enemies)
Does it ever cross your mind?
I got enemies, a million enemies
Living in the streets tonight
I got enemies, a million enemies
But baby, and I'm feeling fine

Another identical verse
Ask her what's wrong
And it will only make things worse
We'll never ever never ever ever know
We'll never know

Free my mind
Ultraviolent shine
We've got time
To walk a line

(Every single day, every single day)
Anything you want is fine
(I got enemies, a million enemies)
Does it ever cross your mind?
I got enemies, a million enemies
Living in the streets tonight
I got enemies, a million enemies
But baby, and I'm feeling fine

I got enemies, a million enemies
Living in the streets tonight
I got enemies, a million enemies
But baby, and I'm feeling fine
(Every single day, every single day)
Anything you want is fine
I got enemies, a million enemies
But baby, and I'm feeling fine
