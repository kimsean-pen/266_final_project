My time couldn't see it coming
But I lost my senses it was falling away
Couldn't leave in the middle of the night
Took the dawn to the day and the day to the night

Every single day that I've done my time
Raising every doubt that is in my mind
My crime I rhyme
And everybody's set aside I take it down
And you know that you can't face me
Got to face that you cannot help me
I can feel every day that I'm lost in a dream

I've been searching my dreams for a lifetime
I don't want to believe it's the last time
The way that I feel
Like I want to be free in serenity
I've been searching my dreams for a lifetime
I'm going to ignite what is in my mind
And I am sincere won't give in to my fears
I don't want to be
Lost in a dream

I fly I'm high when you get low
But I know it's a chance we can redo what's already done
I can fix you I wanna make you strong
But somehow I've known you long

I have no doubt a needle in the eye
I want to change and I know what's right
Cross the waters
Crossing the line
Cross the borders
I know what it's like
And i know that you won't fear me
But I fear that you cannot help me
And I know every day that I'm lost in a dream

I've been searching my dreams for a lifetime
I don't want to believe it's the last time
The way that I feel
Like I want to be free in serenity
I've been searching my dreams for a lifetime
I'm going to ignite what is in my mind
And I am sincere won't give in to my fears
I don't want to be
Lost in a dream

Let the inside of me
And guide your way
Let it out of me out of me
Need serenity
To make you see
My dream

I've been searching my dreams for a lifetime
I don't want to believe it's the last time
The way that I feel
Like I want to be free in serenity

I've been searching my dreams for a lifetime
I don't want to believe it's the last time
The way that I feel
Like I want to be free in serenity
I've been searching my dreams for a lifetime
I'm going to ignite what is in my mind
And I am sincere won't give in to my fears
I don't want to be
Lost in a dream
