Running down the avenues
Makes no difference what you do
Hiding in the alleyway
They won't hear what you say

I wanna be a drone
I wanna be a drone
No more

I can see the blue sky
Is it gonna to fly by
Living like a parasite

I wanna be a drone
I wanna be a drone
No more

Running down the avenue
Makes no difference what you do
Hiding in the alleyway
They won't hear what you say

Running down the avenues
Makes no difference what you do
Hiding in the alleyway
They won't hear what you say

I wanna be a drone
I wanna be a drone
I wanna be a drone
I wanna be a drone
No more
No more
No more
