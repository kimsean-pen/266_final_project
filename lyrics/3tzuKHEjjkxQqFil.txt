OG Parker

We high like a fever, I'm in love with your features
I'm on your team, not the bleachers
I'm a snack, I can feed you
Got that ice walkin', freezin'
We get high like cathedrals
Mansion wake up and season
You my drug, I be fiendin'
I ain't playin' 'round
Lay it out, face down, ass up, when I hit your line
Back to back, you know you better answer, we make the same amount
Cash flow, me and my baby ballin' out, you can claim me now
This your shit, fuck what niggas talkin' 'bout
I been lit, learning, man, the fast life's gettin' too real
I done been there, done that, want to have somethin' I feel
Hear them raindrops, think about it, hit me up, 773
Nigga pull up on me, park the whip, and do me like you used to, baby

When you get it right, nigga, spend the night
Got me feelin' like ain't no other nigga that can hit it right
Left me leakin'
I got that water, that Fiji
Bring out that savage like RiRi
I'm good for your body, you need me

Oh nah, it's pourin' down, keep your doors locked
The forecast say 'round 4 o'clock gon' be stormin' out
With foreigns, had me soakin' wet, thought it was a drought
That hard knocked, ain't use no hands, got me showin' out
Showin' out, showin' out
Took my wrist and flood it out
Showin' out, showin' out
It's pourin' down

Now let's go
Have a private party, I was thinkin' maybe I can invite you
Got good head on him, nigga, he say he don't even like school
Got it bad for you, baby, can't nobody hit it like you
Beatin' the block up
I'm on Rodeo, we shoppin'
He got Off-White on his pocket
Make him put in that work like he clocked in
Like Matilda, he lovin' that chocolate
Took my ex out the picture, we cropped it
Treat me like a queen, Naija
Baby, you don't have no other option

Damn, when you get it right, nigga, spend the night
Got me feelin' like ain't no other nigga that can hit it right
Left me leakin'
I got that water, that Fiji
Bring out that savage like RiRi
I'm good for your body, you need me

Oh nah, it's pourin' down, keep your doors locked
The forecast say 'round 4 o'clock gon' be stormin' out
With foreigns, had me soakin' wet, thought it was a drought
That hard knocked, ain't use no hands, got me showin' out
Showin' out, showin' out
Took my wrist and flood it out
Showin' out, showin' out
It's pourin' down
