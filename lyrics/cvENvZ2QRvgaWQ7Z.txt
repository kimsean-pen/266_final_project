Leaves on the promenade
down on the disco floor
dreams eat the bitter tea
I'm sleepin through the war

cash in the broken hands
pockets seen better scores
I built a house like this
I'm sleepin through the war

I'm married to my boredom
no man afraid of gore
I'm drivin round my worry
I'm sleepin through the war

cash in the broken hands
pockets seen better scores
I built a house like this
I'm sleepin through the war

???
hands off the???
