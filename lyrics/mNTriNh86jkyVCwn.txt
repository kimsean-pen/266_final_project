In the sky, your form and I met
We are older, now
We are, we are older now
See our lungs dissipate in silence
We are older now
We are, we are older now
All the colours and I
Sent up wilding
All the colours and I
The warnings lied

Fall along in the depths of evil
I was born 'neath the kill of the afterglow
One and one became none by evening
This is all we know, this is, this is all we know

It all wasn't right
Take what you need and call it
The scent of you dies
A threat of a dream absorbs it
The colours were lies
They fall at the heave of violence
Breaking the scene with silence
Breach it and reach the wildness

Ah, keep it on ice, it's just the warning tide
I was there and you were there in the morning light
This foolish love leaves a foolish sign
Was it warnings?
All the poplar trees
That you gave to me
Was death at my feet

Send up everything, send up everything
All the poplar trees
(It all wasn't right, take what you need and call it)
That you gave to me
(The scent of you dies, a threat of a dream absorbs it)
Was death at my feet
(The colours were lies, they fall at the heave of violence)
Send up everything (Breaking the scene with silence)
Send up everything (Breach it and reach the wildness)
All the poplar trees
(It all wasn't right, take what you need and call it)
That you gave to me
(The scent of you dies, a threat of a dream absorbs it)
Was death at my feet
(The colours were lies, they fall at the heave of violence)
Send up everything (Breaking the scene with silence)
Send up everything (Breach it and reach the wildness)
