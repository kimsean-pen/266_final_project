She was giving the world
So much that she couldn't see
That she needed someone
To show her who she could be
And she tried to survive
Wearing her heart on her sleeve
But I needed you to believe

You had your dreams, I had mine
You had your fears, I was fine
It showed me what I couldn't find
When two different worlds collide

She was scared of it all
Watching from far away
She was given a role
Never knew just when to play
And she tried to survive
Living her life on her own
Always afraid of the throne
But you've given me strength to find home

You had your dreams, I had mine
You had your fears, I was fine
It showed me what I couldn't find
When two different worlds collide

She was scared, unprepared
Lost in the dark, falling apart
I can survive
With you by my side
We're gonna be alright
This is what happens when two worlds collide

You had your dreams, I had mine
You had your fears, I was fine
It show me what I couldn't find
When two different worlds collide

You had your dreams, I had mine
You had your fears, I was fine
It showed me what I couldn't find
When two different worlds collide
When two different worlds
Collide
