My day & night have coalesced
Each time the same as the last
My fears personified here
As testament of recklessness
Tainted soul regained in whole
In comatose I lose control

Brace for, all those nights you dream of death
Brace for, those dreams you will regret

Comatose embracing me
Each thought frozen in breath
My shame exemplified
A testament of self-contempt
I wait for the impulse to fade

As comatose embraces me Fate divides, you from the things you love
From, fixation not understood

Brace for, those nights you dream of death
Scars from those nights you now regret
