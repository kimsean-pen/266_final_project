This is my resignation
From the s-c-e-n-e
Hating MTV is getting old
I said "no" once
Got stabbed in the back
While they said "relax"
In Sweden, they got it right I guess
But where does that leave me

Leaving

Always leaving, never staying
Good thing my feet are still in tact
It's just my hands that are killing me
Killing someone else may make for better poetry
At least that's what they said

But at this moment
Clarity's appeared
And I am gone
Off to what I've found more in
The fact I hate the way I talk
Cynics mock all surroundings
Instead of hating MTV
Beat on the floorboards to wake their tenants
That they know are not asleep
The way we're sure they're not asleep
We woke up in the same bed

This whole imaginary underground
Has got me thinking, got me dreaming

And if we're all our own co-pilots
In our cockpits made of tin
And then we fall down hills of pavement

It's time I grew and said to them
"It's not what you think it is"
We analyze the states we're in
Why is it that when we sneeze
There's a chance we'll die
Alone, alone
Alone, alone
Alone
Alone
Alone, that's what I hope I'll want to be
When all acquaintance leaves me
Because if I don't, who knows, I might just see
That no one needs me seeing
