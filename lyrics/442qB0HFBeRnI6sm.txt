Laying in my bed ceiling gazing
Wide awake with jet lag from Australia
Got a stack of mail, a wedding invitation
From a new, young relative, I've never even met

Got me thinking about my Grandpa for some reason
Met him half a dozen times in the nursing home
Last time I saw him he was in a box
They were lowering him into the ground

St. Mary's Church stood so high
It was the first and the last time I saw my Dad cry
The ground had a thin coat of snow
And I wandered off in the cold

It's 3: 47 am, June 13th
It's my sister's birthday today, I think
I wanna give her a call, see how she's doing
She had a rough divorce, I hope she's improved

I want to reach out and give her my love
Put a smile on her face like when we were young
Listening to records from the library
Hermit of Mink Hollow and Dreamboat Annie

She lives with her daughters all alone
Across the street from a cornfield in Ohio
One's 4, one's 7 and I love them so
I want to live a long time and see them grow

Outside my window tonight, Sausalito's twinkling lights
My love's beside me deep asleep
The dog is laying between my feet
Outside my window tonight

The cargo ships are cruising
And I'm so happy to be alive
To have these people in my life
Laying in my bed ceiling gazing

Don't know to make my mind stop from racing
It's not good or bad, it's just how God made me
To lay awake at night ceiling gazing
To lay awake night ceiling gazing
