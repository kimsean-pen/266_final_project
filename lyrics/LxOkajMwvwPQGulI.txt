How could I ever ever let ya
Make me believe that you knew better?
I'm gonna teach you how to let go
Like no one has ever ever said no
Like no one has ever ever said no

Something tells me that you've never been alone
Yeah I wonder what you think
About when everybody's gone
Something tells me that you won't pick up the phone
I've been trying to get along
But I'm better when you're gone and

Oh ohh ahhh
I'm better when you're gone
Oh ohh ahhh
I'm better when you're gone

Something tells me that you've never fully grown up
Oh ohh ahh
'Cause I'm better when you're gone

Now you've got them wrapped around your finger
Then I'd given you all that I could give ya
No they couldn't teach you how to let go
Oh no one has ever ever said no

Something tells me that you've never been alone
Yeah I wonder what you think
About when everybody's gone
Something tells me that you won't pick up the phone
I've been trying to get along
But I'm better when you're gone and

Oh ohh ahhh
I'm better when you're gone
Oh ohh ahhh
I'm better when you're gone

Something tells me that you've never fully grown up
Oh ohh ahh
'Cause I'm better when you're gone

Been around
Now I'm back
And nothing's changed

This is where
I used to stand
Every day

Just soaking up the shit you tell me
Just soaking up the shit you tell me

Something tells me that you've never been alone
Yeah I wonder what you think
About when everybody's gone
Something tells me that you won't pick up the phone
I've been trying to get along
But I'm better when you're gone and

Oh ohh ahhh
I'm better when you're gone
Oh ohh ahhh
I'm better when you're gone

Something tells me that you've never fully grown up
Oh ohh ahh
'Cause I'm better when you're gone

Oh ohh ahh
'Cause I'm better when you're gone
Oh ohh ahh
'Cause I'm better when you're gone
