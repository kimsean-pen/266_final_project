So grab this statement and read between the lines
I'm walking on an edge, that's how I stay alive
I need a fix now
The pills I have to take
It helps me live a lie and blinds all my mistakes

Before I die I will have seen it all
The mountains I have climbed help me enjoy the fall

Oh! The webs you weave
We are caught in the fame
The passions dead
The life you've lead is drowned in your shame
Oh! The webs I weave
I am caught in this game
My passions dead
The life I've lead has drown me in vein

So paint my portrait the colors of my life
And the untold stories are painted in black and white
I can hear the footsteps that follow to my pulse
This paranoia has haunted me like a ghost

Before I die I will have seen it all
The mountains I have climbed help me enjoy the fall

Oh! The webs you weave
We are caught in the fame
The passions dead
The life you've lead is drowned in your shame
Oh! The webs I weave
I am caught in this game
My passions dead
The life I've lead has drown me in vein

I will have seen it all
I will have seen it all

I'm killing time. Let me go
(Before I die I will have seen it all)

It reads their minds, brings them close
(Before I die I will have seen it all)
Oh! The webs you weave
We are caught in the fame
The passions dead
The life you've lead is drowned in your shame
Oh! The webs I weave
I am caught in this game
My passions dead
The life I've lead has drown me in vein
