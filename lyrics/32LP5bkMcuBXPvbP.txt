You will remember this moment as you dig into me
And from your smile now It seems as if you liked it
You'd better cherish this moment as you dig into me
You'll never get another chance at this

I won't stand another minute of your questioning me
You hear me, bitch, stop, the interrogation's over
I can't handle the feeling of your pestering me
How would you like to meet my favorite fist?

Now you can't renege
I'd love to see you beg

I dream this moment as you run away
You would only separate me from what I believe
This moment in brutality
You're the one who kept on pushing
'Til I made you bleed

It seems your pride has been stolen since you stood up to me
I'll tell you now you know I think I really like it
So learn a lesson from someone who will never repeat
The many tragic mistakes of his past

I hope you savor this moment
As you're still on your feet
So keep it quiet now I think you're gonna like it
Words have their consequences when they're spoken to me
Better be careful
When you're writing checks

Don't you question how
I stand above you now

I dream this moment as you run away
You would only separate me from what I believe
This moment in brutality
You're the one who kept on pushing
'Til I made you bleed

Now you know the answer
Save yourself from danger
I cannot forget
How all of this began

I know you know the answer
Save yourself from danger
Beaten by a stranger
Blood still on his hands

I dream this moment as you run away
You would only separate me from what I believe
This moment in brutality
You're the one who kept on pushing
'Til I made you bleed
