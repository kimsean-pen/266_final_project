Dear Voodoo Queen Marie Laveau
I'm on my knees, I'm beggin' you
Awake the fallen one in me
Thy power above all I hail

The white room on your grave I brought
Together with cigars and gold
I'll find you at the river's end
As the followers enter your realm

Sing, Voodoo Marie
Let me hear thy tone
Speak, Voodoo Marie
Let me hear thy tongue
Queen of New Orleans
Mother of the coven
Sing, Voodoo Marie
You've been called out again

Concerned about the soul I hold
In my heart I know he's stubborn too
Awake the fallen father please
Thy power above all I hail

Sing, Voodoo Marie
Let me hear thy tone
Speak, Voodoo Marie
Let me hear thy tongue
Queen of New Orleans
Mother of the coven
Sing, Voodoo Marie
You've been called out again

How silent is the lonely one?
What do we see, What do we know?
Marie Laveau, I'm full of hope
Let me speak until forever more

How silent is the lonely one?
What do we see, What do we know?
Marie Laveau, I'm full of hope
Let me speak until forever more

Sing, Voodoo Marie
Let me hear thy tone
Speak, Voodoo Marie
Let me hear thy tongue
Queen of New Orleans
Mother of the coven
Sing, Voodoo Marie
You've been called out again
Called out again
Called out again
Called out again
Called out again.
