I'm tired, I'm thirsty
I'm wild eyed in my misery
Timeless in your finery
A high price for your luxury

Sorcerer who is the master
Man and woman on a star stream
In the middle of a snow dream
Sorcerer show me the high life
Come over let me put you on ice

All around black ink darkness
Who found the lady from the mountain
All around black ink darkness
Who found the lady from the mountain
Lady from the mountain

I'm tired I need you badly
I'm wild eyed in the middle of your dream
Timeless in your finery
It's a high price for your luxury

Sorcerer who is the master
Man and woman on a star stream
In the middle of a snow dream
Sorcerer show me the high life
Come over let me put you on ice

All around black ink darkness
Who found the lady from the mountain
All around black ink darkness
Who found the lady from the mountain
Lady from the mountain

Won't you tell me who found
The lady from the mountain
Won't you tell me who found

Who found, tell me who found
Who found, tell me who found

I'm tired, I'm thirsty
I'm wild eyed in my misery
Tired, thirsty, wild eyed in my misery
In my misery, in my misery, in my misery
