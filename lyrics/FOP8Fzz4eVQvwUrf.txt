If I could wake up and the taste was gone
I could get over you, forget your wrongs
So I exhale and let you out my lungs
Somehow your name's still rolling off my tongue
Everybody knows how this story goes
Everybody knows how this story...
Everybody knows how this story goes
Everybody knows how this story...
Face it, you know your slick touch would have me like
Pasted under your thumb
Face it, you know your slick touch would have me like
Melted under the sun
How this story
How this story
Everybody knows how this
How this story goes
I fall in love, you break my heart, step one.
Step two I call you saying I was wrong
And for step three you say that we belong
We keep on stepping 'til we're back at one
Everybody knows how this story goes
Everybody knows how this story...
Everybody knows how this story goes
Everybody knows how this story...
Face it, you know your slick touch would have me like
Pasted under your thumb
Face it, you know your slick touch would have me like
Melted under the sun
How this story
Everybody knows how this
How this story goes
Face it, you know your slick touch would have me like
Pasted under your thumb
Face it, you know your slick touch would have me like
Melted under the sun
How this story
Everybody knows how this
How this story goes
