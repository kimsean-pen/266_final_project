Don't turn around the say
Marching in the hit parade
Oh don't let it get away
Get away

You where blissful in the dive
Oh while the world took five
You were counting the days
Oh you are standing for something

Tangled up in the arms of the night
I just can't wait for the light
And hear the news from the sun
News from the sun
News from the sun

More afraid to die unknown than to die alone
Oh you gotta give it up
You're just young thing
And your dreams have a restless host
There's no giving up the ghost
Stand your post
It's still caught in the upswing

And time pulls at you like a tireless child
And all you want to do is to stay a while
Stay a while

Tangled up in the arms of the night
I just can't wait for the light
And hear the news from the sun
News from the sun
News from the sun

I'm just
Tangled up in the arms of the night
I just can't wait for the light
And hear the news from the sun
News from the sun
News from the sun

We're all just waiting for something
Yeah
Oh just waiting for something
Something
Till love touches you, like a hand in the dark

Tangled up in the arms of the night
I just can't wait for the light
And hear the news from the sun
News from the sun
News from the sun

I'm just
Tangled up in the arms of the night
I just can't wait for the light
And hear the news from the sun yeah
News from the sun (News from the sun)
News from the sun (Yeah)
