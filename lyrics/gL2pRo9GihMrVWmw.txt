You got my soul on fire
You got my heart beneath your feet
You got my soul in need
Why must I know, why must I bleed

You got the one desire
Build me up to break me down
You shook my ass out of town
So tiny man can wear my crown

You're just a soul shaker
Twisted heart breaker
You got me on my knees
Baby please
I'm running all the time
You took my peace of mind
You got me on
High alert
High alert
High alert
You got me

You got my soul on fire
You got my heart beneath you
You got the one desire
To break me down just to please you

You're just a soul shaker
Twisted heart breaker
You got me on my knees
Baby please
I'm running all the time
You took my peace of mind
You got me on
High alert
High alert
High alert
High alert
