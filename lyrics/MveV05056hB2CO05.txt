Do we bar the gates with iron
To guard our holy flame?
For your poor, your sick and tired
Your nutshell navies came
What do they know of Europe
Who only Europe know?

And who will hail our brothers slayers
Who will hail the invading men?
We may not speak of nation
We may not speak of soil and flags
What do they know of Europe
Who only Europe know?

And this endless ocean of bodies
May well swallow it all
Do we miss our world so little
Do we miss our sea so lone?
What do they know of Europe
Who only Europe know?

Did we not justly hurl
Our flag over the slaver?
Did we not stand down
And see the slave free?
What do they know of Europe
Who only Europe know?

And the day they sold us out
Our hearts grew cold
'Cause we were never asked
No brother, we were told!
What do they know of Europe
Who only Europe know?

Will there be rivers of blood?
I don't know. I hope no.
Will there be rivers of blood?
I don't know...
What do they know of Europe
Who only Europe know?

We're building ghettos
Entrenching ghettos
Flooding Ghettos
We're building ghettos

We shall give and receive reason
