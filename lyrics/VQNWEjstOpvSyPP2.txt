Heartache'sknocking on her door
Shadows dance outside her window
Tears keep falling on the floor
As the world around her crumbles

If you want to save her
then first you have to save yourself
If you want to free her from the hurt
don't do it with your pain
If you want to see her smile again
don't show her you're afraid
Because your circle of fear is the same

Love can be as cold as grave
A one-way ticket to endless sorrow
An empire of gentle hate
Today without tomorrow

If you want to save her
then first you have to save yourself
If you want to free her from the hurt
don't do it with your pain
If you wanna see her smile again
don't show her you're afraid
Because your circle of fear is the same

It's the circle of regret
the circle of hate
the circle of death
The circle of fear is the same
Your circle of fear is the same

If you want to save her
then first you have to save yourself
If you want to free her from the hurt
don't do it with your pain
If you want to see her smile again
don't show her you're afraid
Because your circle of fear is the same
Your circle of fear is the same
Your circle of fear is the same
Your circle of fear is the same
Your circle of fear is the same
