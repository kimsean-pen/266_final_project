I think you know
Because it's old news
The people you love
Are hard to find
So I think if I
Were in your shoes
I would be kind

I look out for you
Come rain, come shine
What good does it do?
I guess, I'm a toy that is broken
I guess, we're just older now

I want to stay
Another season
See summer upon
This sorry land
So don't dust off your gun
Without a reason
You understand

I look out for you
Come rain, come shine
What good does it do?
I guess, I'm a toy that is broken
I guess, we're just older now

Who says the river can't leave its waters?
Who says you walk in a line?
Who says the city change its borders?
Who says you're mine?

I look out for you
Come rain, come shine
What good does it do?
I guess, I'm a record you're tired of
I guess, we're just older now
I guess, I'm a toy that is broken
I guess, we're just older now
