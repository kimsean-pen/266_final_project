It's like no matter how many good people in my life
I feel lonely, always feel lonely
It's just a moment, I can still everytime
It's taking over
Maybe it's your love that I need
How can I let you in if I'm putting up a wall everytime?
You gotta break it down if you wanna come across that line
How can you breathe me in if youre never gonna get no air?
Yeah I know that
I know that
I know that
I know that ain't better
Will you think of me when you drive with the windows down?
Will you understand why I'm here with the broken crown?
My city, my home, my heart, my town
No, I'm not gonna leave now

Heya, I will always be a lone wolf
There is nothing you can do
I will always be a lone wolf
Forever howling at the moon
