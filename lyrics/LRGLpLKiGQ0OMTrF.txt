Too much ugly talking

Too many bad politicians
We need some practical dreamers
Maybe few magicians
Shall we get away from here?
Where no one can find us
The north will blow us away
We'll leave this all behind us
We'll vanish, no one will know why
Into thin air
Into thin air
Into thin air
Into thin air

No one will ever know
No one will ever know
No one will ever know
No one will ever know where
We're different from the others,
No one understands us here

Imagine how free we will be
If we'd disappear
We won't even pack a case
Just cashing all that we own
Create a new identities,
and fly into the unknown
We'll vanish, no one will know why

Into thin air
Into thin air
Into thin air
Into thin air
We'll vanish, no one will know why
Into thin air
Into thin air
