Judgement is easy:
You pick a side and a comfortable lie.
Heavy the burden
When every victim is self-defined.
Try to understand
It's harder to apologize
When all committed crimes,
They're just in our minds.

It's not enough!
How hard I try
- It's not enough! -
To clear my mind.
It's not enough!
I'm the jury, I'm the judge
And I committed all the crimes.
How hard I try.
It's not enough!

I walked away and left you bleeding
As I kicked the mud off my feet.
Lay on the ground and watched you leaving,
My heart fights for every beat.
Try to understand
It's harder to apologize
When all committed crimes,
They're just in our minds.

It's not enough!
How hard I try
- It's not enough! -
To clear my mind.
It's not enough!
I'm the jury, I'm the judge
And I committed all the crimes.
How hard I try.
It's not enough!
