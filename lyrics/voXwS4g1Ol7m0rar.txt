Melt into
The other world
Melt, melt
He saw my eyes turn gold and reptile
I'll dream tonight,
Bare and baptized
Bare and baptized

Coyote bones
Flex the muscle of animal spirit old
A bond so simple

Borderline with my, my atoms
Borderline with my, my atoms
Borderline with my, my atoms
Borderline, in time, it alkaline

After the coal has settled deep
Beneath ash resting
Quiet as silk the remedy tempers
The willing
A ripe submergence of the highest order
No borders
After the coal has settled
Deep beneath ash resting
Quiet as silk the remedy
Tempers the willing
A ripe submergence of the highest order
No borders

Borderline with my, my atoms
Borderline with my, my atoms
Borderline with my, my atoms
