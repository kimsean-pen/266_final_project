On a razor's edge
At the first sign of light
The car was packed
While the house was quiet
And my sister slept
As we started the drive
To California
Where it's warmer
Gonna start a new life

Gonna miss Ohio but this time
We're gonna get it right

Station wagon tires, flying
Katie's counting crows through the
Tears in her blue eyes
State lines and capitals go rushing
By as I'm trying to find
A station on the radio
Everything's gonna be better on the west coast

And the days move fast
On northern plains
And I read the maps
The prairie grass moved
In the wind like waves
And we can't look back
Some men you just can't save
We had our reasons for leaving
It's better this way

Gonna miss Ohio but I'm not
Gonna miss the rain

Station wagon tires, flying
Katie's counting crows through the
Tears in her blue eyes
State lines and capitals go rushing
By as I'm trying to find
A station on the radio
Everything's gonna be better on the west coast
Better than the mess that we left back home
In Ohio
Ohio

Goodbye blue house
Goodbye red door
Abandoned worlds where we would drink on weekends
There's magnet's pulling from the ocean floor
I can't forget
The way you looked when we were leaving

Tires, flying
Katie's counting crows through the
Tears in her blue eyes
State lines and capitals go rushing
By as I'm trying to find
A station on the radio
Everything's gonna be better on the west coast
Better than the mess that we left back home
In Ohio
Ohio
Ohio
Ohio

Ohio
