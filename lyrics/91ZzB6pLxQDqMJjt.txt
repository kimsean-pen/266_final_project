Hit the beat now
Lost in emotion
Some guys will promise you a marriage made in heaven
But I'm gonna stick to my guns
Like waiting for that love that I might be getting
My dreams have yet begun

Oh baby
Am I a fool 'cause I don't know just how you feel?
And is my love for you? Oh I
Can't conceal, oh

I'm lost in emotion

Telling you things you really shouldn't know
Oh baby I'm
Lost in emotion

Am I a fool? At least my friends think so
Que-sera, que-sera
Baby
Whatever will be
Que-sera, que-sera

Between you and me
Just how true are the rumors I am hearing
About the crash you have on me
Oh baby
I'm blind 'cause I just don't see it
But I wanna believe what they see
I find myself telling you things
I don't even tell my best friend
I keep showing emotions not knowing
Just where it all stands for us

From time to time I wonder what I am in your heart
And even though I don't live there yet
I'm afraid it will be cold and dark

I'm lost in emotion
Telling you things you really shouldn't know
Oh baby I'm
Lost in emotion

Am I a fool? At least my friends think so
Que-sera, que-sera
Baby
Whatever will be
Que-sera, que-sera

Between you and me
Oh, oh, no

Baby
Am I a fool 'cause I don't know just how you feel?
And is my love for you? Oh I
Can't conceal
Hit the beat now
With my feeling
I hit the ceiling
With big emotions
I can't be dealing
I wanna be with you
But I don't know how
In my heart baby
I can feel the beat now

Lost in emotion
Lost in emotion
Lost in emotion

Lost
My baby
You know that I'm lost
My baby
Lost in emotion
My, my, my, my my, baby
Lost in emotion
Lost in emotion
Lost
