I'd watch the world go by in the morning
Lose myself in the the news
Looks like the cost of houses are falling but I don't notice

I'd write a long love song with no meaning
And hope nobody would hear
A life of filter coffee and dreaming, dreaming

Thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking around with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, oh no
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

I'd lock myself away in the evening
Afraid to ever come out
Watch TV and get lost in my feelings, feelings

Never thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking around with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, oh no
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

It's a lovely day, it's a lovely day
Never thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when I'm looking with you

Glad you took the time to say hello, hello
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, let you go
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh

Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello
All the bells are ringing out and all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh, oh, oh
Hello
