Now now now now - what i wanna know is that
Why not finish your home anymore and knock me up and take my funk?
Say, why not finish your home anymore and knock me up and take my funk?
Cause i'm too old to be
I'm too old to be
Keepin' up with all of the kids
Keepin' up with all of the kids
Some - some other way
Some other place i could be real important
No - not anymore - i'm just a bore
And you should be disappointed
Now now why not finish your home anymore and knock me up and take my funk?
Say why not finish your home anymore knock me up and take my funk?
Cause i'm too old to be
I'm too old to be
Keepin' up with all of the kids
Keepin' up with all of the kids
Some - some other way
Some other place i could be real important
No - not anymore - i'm just a bore
And you should be disappointed
Now - no other way but rush the stage and take away my fortune
Now - you should be king and i should be dead
And no one would be disappointed
I'm too old to be

I'm too old to be

Keepin' up with all of the kids
