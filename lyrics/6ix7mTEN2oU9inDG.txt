Counting reasons not to get up
Yeah, between sheets all this shit shall end...
If only the world gave me a fucking chance
I would follow the line and my dreams and I would secure them all
You know I know about failure
And the harder I try, the deeper I sink
The sunrise is a crucifixion
The apostles still a painful weight
Don't get me started on sanctuaries
It burns to pronounce their names
I don't have to know, it's alright
Wether the thought of a friend
Or the taste of a smile could feel right
I'm not leaving this place, I won't fight
And if I held the last straw
I'd still be the only winner in here
I don't need your concern
Thank you for all

Counting reasons not to get up
Yeah, between sheets all this shit shall end...
If only you gave me a fucking break I would bear you at least
And I wouldn't just lock up the doors
Do you know how much I try?
Do you know how much I try?
It's the run of the disrespected
And I sprint here day after day
If only you could know all the suffering I feel
And all the pain I survived
You were running as well
And I told you to shut up
