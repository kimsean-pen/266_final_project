We drink to those lost at sea
Who never made it off the beach
To those who won't make it home
Buried in the salty deep

While these sons that we knew so well
Without a care or a chance in hell
Laid their life on the line
And got traded at a price so their brothers could live to tell

So my brother could live to tell

The ocean never looked so deep
With the moon shining down on me
I didn't know we'd perform for you on foreign shores
Boys in black could trash bridges and transform ya' entirely

So old man pour another couple rounds on me
Keep 'em coming and right in reach
Being shellshocked more like brain rot
While I'm dying for a stiffer drink

We're dying on a line
No god there to hear our plea
We've been laid out, left desperate
No blood here left to bleed

Drink to those lost at sea
Who never made it off the beach
To those who won't make it home
Buried in the salty deep

While these sons that we knew so well
Without a care or a chance in hell
Laid their life on the line
And got traded at a price so their brothers could live to tell

So old man pour another couple rounds on me
Keep 'em coming and right in reach
Being shellshocked more like brain

We're dying on a line
No god there to hear our plea
We've been laid out, left desperate
No blood here left to bleed
So my brother could live to tell
So my brother and I...
