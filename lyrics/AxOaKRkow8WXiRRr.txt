Seems we had been tripping over things
How he left me here wondering
Whether Imma sink or swim
Whether I'll be good for him
Whether I should fall right in

Been missing you baby
Haven't seen you lately
Both been complicated
But I don't wanna lose out
Thanks for waiting patient
Know that you been waiting
So keep concentrating
Cause I don't wanna lose you know it

You're energy is something I fuck with
This chemistry is something I fuck with
Our symmetry is something I love this
No ever drug it's
Something I fuck with

Seems we have been tripping over things
It's so much more than what the dolger brings
That's got me feeling light
Thinking now it's flight my fight
Knowing that the mood here ride it

Been missing you baby
Haven't seen you lately
Both been complicated
But I don't wanna lose out
Know that it's bad not the can of this
Cause you have to be tough to handle this
You've taken much more than anyone did
Got a feeling that you are the man for it and

You're energy is something I fuck with
This chemistry is something I fuck with
Our symmetry is something I love this
No ever drug it's
Something I fuck with

You're energy is something I fuck with
This chemistry is something I fuck with
Our symmetry is something I love this
No ever drug it's
Something I fuck with
