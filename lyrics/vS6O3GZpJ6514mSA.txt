I will tell you the story about the little boy I found in the grass
Tired, solace, he told me he could hear the children wanting to pass

Sounds of laughter in the air
Still today we hear them

Finally we are over it, oh
Finally we are over it, oh

(Let them run)
Let them run from the violence
The world is way too cold and bright for their eyes
Little boy runs beside them
As they take his hands and jump to the sky

Still today you hear them

Finally I am over it, over it oh
Finally I am over, over it oh
Oh-wooh-woah, ha-ha
Oh-wooh-woah, ha-ha

When will my healing come?
When will my healing come along?
Sinking like a stone
When will my healing come along?

Finally I am over it, oh
Finally I am over it, oh
Oh-wooh-woah, ha-ha
Oh-wooh-woah, ha-ha
Oh-wooh-woah, ha-ha
Oh-wooh-woah, ha-ha
Finally I, am, am
