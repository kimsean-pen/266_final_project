Not long ago but far away
A rainy winter's day
All her pain she kept inside
Could no longer hide
No cry for help
She killed herself
Both life & love could not be saved
She took them both to the grave

To the grave
A pair of souls become undone
Where were two now one
Divided by this wall of death
I soon will join you yet
With my blood I'll find your love
You found the strength to end you life

As you did so shall I
Oh no
Please don't go

Please don't go
It's like a death
Death
A death in the family
Don't you die
A crimson pool so warm and deep
Lulls me to an endless sleep

Your hand in mine - I will be brave
Take me from this earth
An endless night - this, the end of life

From the dark I feel your lips
And I taste your bloody kiss
Oh no
Please don't go
Oh no
Please don't go
Please don't go
Please don't go
Please don't
Please don't
Go
It's like a death
A Death
Death in the family
It's like a death
A Death
Death in the family
Don't die on me
Don't die on me
Don't die on me
Don't die
