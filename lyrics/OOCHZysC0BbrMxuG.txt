all of the astronauts
champagne in plastic cups
waiting for the big hero to show
outside the door, he stands

his head in his hands
and his heart in his throat
what can he tell em now?
sorry, i let you down?

sorry, it wasn't quite the truth?
but don't get hung up on it
just soldier on with it
and good luck with shooting the moon

(shooting the moon)
(shooting the moon)
(the moo-oo-oon)
(shooting the moon)

...
all of the principals
generals, admirals
and the podium lit with the spotlight

the crowd buzzes quietly
waiting expectantly
like it's opening night
what can he tell em now?
sorry, i let you down?
sorry, it wasn't quite the truth?
but don't get hung up on it
just soldier on with it
and good luck with shooting the moon
(shooting the moon)
(shooting the moon)
(the moo-oo-oon)
(shooting the moon)
...
