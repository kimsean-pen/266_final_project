A world without heroes
Is like a world without sun.
You can't look up to anyone
Without heroes.
And a world without heroes
Is like a neverending race,
It's like a time without a pace,
A pointless thing devoid of grace.

When you don't know what they're after
Or if something's after you,
And you don't know why you don't know
In a world without heroes.

In a world without dreams
Things are no more than they seem.
And a world without heroes
Is like a bird without wings
Or a bell that never rings.
Just a sad and useless thing.

When you don't know what you're after
Or if something's after you,
And you don't know why you don't know.

When you don't know what you're after
Or if something's after you,
And you don't know why you don't know.
(You don't know, you don't know.)

When you don't know what you're after
Or if something's after you,
And you don't know why you don't know.
(You don't know, you don't know.)

When you don't know what you're after
Or if something's after you,
And you don't know why you don't know.
(You don't know, you don't know.)

When you don't know what you're after
Or if something's after you,
And you don't know why you don't know.
(You don't know, you don't know.)
