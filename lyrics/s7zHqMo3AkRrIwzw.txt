From a distance, the truth is so obvious
Answers are all so clear
Logic stays at arm's length when engulfed in the present, here
Desperation draws near

If I could pull the fabric of time and bring the future near
The answers wouldn't be so far, the truth would be so clear

Time is black!
Time is black!
And nothing will escape
Nothing will remain
Nothing

From a distance time is black
Tangible and dense
With each rotation a new day passed
And past, at last, makes sense

There where past obstacles seem just pebbles on your path
Always just a step ahead, the peace I hope to catch

Time is black!
Time is black!
And nothing can escape
Nothing will remain
Nothing

Time is black!
Time is black!
And nothing will escape
Nothing will remain
Nothing will remain
