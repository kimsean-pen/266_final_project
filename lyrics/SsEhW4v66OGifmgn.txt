She don't wanna write a song
She knows exactly when and where and what went wrong
Besides it's been too long

She don't mean to be a drag
She's just indifferent to the old blue fact
That you can't go back

But she's the only one who can take you to a pawn shop
And sell you for twice what you're worth
Nobody tells you it hurts to be loved

And one day you will realize
You are nothing, nothing without her
You're an asshole from a bar
On a break, in a break room
And you're never happy

But she's the only one who can take you to a pawn shop
And sell you for twice what you're worth
Nobody tells you it hurts to be loved
