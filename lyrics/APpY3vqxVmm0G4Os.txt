Cross my heart and hope to die
You never cross my fucking mind
Do you know what your little lies do?
You know what I had to fight through

Nothing that you say is mildly true
Spit deceit through shifty smiles
Two faces you've had for a while
You act like such a fucking child

Who are you now?
You're so hostile to me
I'm feeling homicidal, you better run and try to hide
Ooh, I was living in denial

Through all this time you had me riled up
All the shit has finally piled up
There's no chance of reconciling us
With the falsehoods I've been filing away

For months you made these stories up
Sick from the untruths you're throwing up
Had me thinkin' I was crazy but
Turns out I'm your favorite thing to discuss

You keep on talking, shut it up
You keep rubbing salt into the cut
Broke the cycle, need to reconstruct
You're no use to me, I'm giving up

Baby, you're a loser
And I'm ashamed to say I ever knew ya
A user, taking all I'd give ya
I swear to God, I'll never miss ya

Swear to God, I haven't missed ya
God, I hope I never miss ya
