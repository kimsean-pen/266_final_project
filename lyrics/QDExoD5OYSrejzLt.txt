Woah, woah
This is where we start
It's time to wake up the fire inside
This is where we start
Ignite your mind, open your eyes

We all move like spirits in the wind
In the wind
We've been stripped of what used to be within
Be within
If everyone had more soul
Maybe we would have more control
We're the ones to blame if everything stays the same
Stays the same

Where's the fire, the desire
An inherent right to stand up and fight
Stand up
Stand up and fight
Stand up
I said stand up and fight

It's time to set our blood to boil
Feel the heat rise inside
This is where we start
It's time to wake up the fire inside
This is where we start
Ignite your mind, open your eyes

Where did we, where did we go wrong?
You can't charge forward when your limbs will not listen
Where did we, where did we go wrong?
You can't mount a comeback
When you don't know what you're missing

It's apathy turned into atrophy
A lesson learned in human anatomy

This is where we start
It's time to wake up the fire inside
This is where we start
Ignite your mind, open your eyes
This is where we start
Change has never started with silence
This is where we start
So stop telling us to be quiet

Wake up, wake up
Wake up the fire inside
Wake up, wake up
It's time to open your eyes
