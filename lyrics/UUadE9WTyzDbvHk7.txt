Six feet under struggling to breathe
Im covered in the dirt on your mind
Digging deeper with every word that you speak
Your on to me but honestly
I tried to warn you so you gotta risk bad news yeah
I never wanted to make, a mess of everything

These eyes these dirty little lies
Theyre keeping me up all night
This time theyre dragging me down
I dont know how, Ill turn it around yeah
These lies these dirty little lies
Theyre running right through my mind
If Ive been dragging you down
Im telling you now, Ill turn it around yeah

(Ah ah ah)
These lies these dirty little lies

Couldnt keep my hands to myself
Love to stay now you may never be clean
Wish I could wash away all the hurt
I just messed you up with my words
And you believed but honestly

I tried to warn you, so you gotta got issues yeah
And I never wanted to stray but it was all so easy

These lies these dirty little lies
Theyre keeping me up all night
This time theyre dragging me down
I dont know how, Ill turn it around yeah
These lies these dirty little lies
Theyre running right through my mind
If Ive been dragging you down
Im telling you now, Ill turn it around yeah

(Ah ah ah)
These lies these dirty little lies
(Ah ah ah)
These lies these dirty little lies

Maybe its all in my head and you dont see through me just yet
but sooner or later (you regret) sooner or later (we never met)
These lies these dirty little lies
Theyre keeping me up all night
(Up all night) Ill turn it around

These eyes these dirty little lies
Theyre keeping me up all night
This time theyre dragging me down
I dont know how, Ill turn it around yeah
These lies these dirty little lies
Theyre running right through my mind
If Ive been dragging you down
Im telling you now, Ill turn it around yeah

Ah ah ah)
These lies these dirty little lies
(Ah ah ah)
These lies these dirty little lies
