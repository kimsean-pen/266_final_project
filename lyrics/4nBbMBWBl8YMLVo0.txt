She's checking out
She's checking out on me

Not long ago
You were laying right here
And the blue light flickered
Love everywhere
Now you're checking out
And I'm missing you
The smell of cigarettes
Is taking over for this pain in my chest
And you're checking out
This old hotel will never be home 'cause you are home to me

This is my wake up call
I slept through it
Going through life
Hypnotic
Come ho-o-o-o-ome, come ho-o-o-o-ome
These four walls is where I live
With a ghost of you
Is all I get
Come ho-o-o-o-ome, come ho-o-o-o-ome
This old hotel will never be home 'cause you are home to me

This worn out rug has seen its day
These old walls are peeling away
Just like us
And I'm freaking out (freaking out)
The TV's broke there's nothing on
Just memories of us that'll soon be gone
And I'm freaking out
This old hotel will never be home 'cause you are home to me

This is my wake up call
I slept through it
Going through life
Hypnotic
Come ho-o-o-o-ome, come ho-o-o-o-ome
These four walls is where I live
With a ghost of you
Is all I get
Come ho-o-o-o-ome, come ho-o-o-o-ome
This old hotel will never be home 'cause you are home to me

It's funny how our love fucks me like it always does
It's funny now your gone, I'm seeing how it really was
I don't wanna wake up, I've really had enough
I don't wanna wake up, still feeling in love

She's checking out
She's checking out

This is my wake up call
I slept through it
Going through life
Hypnotic
Come ho-o-o-o-ome, come ho-o-o-o-ome
These four walls is where I live
With a ghost of you
Is all I get
Come ho-o-o-o-ome, come ho-o-o-o-ome
This old hotel will never be home 'cause you are home to me
