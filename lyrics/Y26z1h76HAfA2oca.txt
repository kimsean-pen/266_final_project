Hey, in the silence
I think of you
I send a message
Hope it gets through
Think of the distance
Think of the miles
Over the valleys
Could take a while

I miss the people
I miss the fun
You're my aberration
She's my only one

And I imagine
You're standing here
It's subliminal
So inspirational
Man of the world
For all the good reasons
Take away the pain
And drink the wine

I miss the people
And I miss the fun
You're my aberration
She's my only one

Here, in the silence
I think of you
I send a message
And hope it gets through
Think of the distance
Think of the miles
Over the valleys
Could take a while

I miss the people
And I miss the fun
You're my aberration
She's my only one

I miss the people
You miss the fun
You're my aberration
She's my only one
