Why can you just tell me the truth?
Hard to believe the things you say
Why can't you feel the tears I cried today, cried today, cried today
How do you win if we all lose?
You change the facts to justify
Your lips move [?] your words get in the way, in the way, in the way
Kings and Queens, crooks and thiefs
You don't see the forest or the trees
Head and heart on their knees
You can see what we all see
How do you sleep when the world is turning?
All that we built has come undone
How do you sleep when the world is burning?
Everyone answers to someone
Don't lie to me, don't lie to me, you lie to me
Don't lie to me, don't lie to me, you lie to me
You can built towers of bronze and gold
You can built castles in the sky
You can use smoke and mirrors all clich√©s
Not today, not today
Kings and Queens, crooks and thiefs
You don't see the forest or the trees
Head and heart down their knees
You can see what everyone see
How do you sleep when the world is turning?
All that we built has come undone
How do you sleep when the world is burning?
Everyone answers to someone
Don't lie to me, don't lie to me, you lie to me
Don't lie to me, don't lie to me, you lie to me
Can you see I'm crying?
Can you see we're crying?
Where's the new horizon?
Where's the new horizon?

How do you sleep?
How do you sleep?
How do you sleep?
How do you sleep?
Enough is enough
How do you sleep?

Don't lie to me, don't lie to me, you lie to me
Don't lie to me, don't lie to me, you lie to me
Can you see I'm crying?
Can you see we're crying?
Everyone answers to someone
