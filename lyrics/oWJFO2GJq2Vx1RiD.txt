If you could see what's inside my head
You'd be disappointed
I'm just concentrating on not falling down
And not saying anything stupid

Oh why do you do it
Look under the surface
Try to find some kind of meaning
Reason or purpose

The nameplate necklace around my neck
Bears the name of somebody I've never met
A name I pulled out of an unreadable book
It's purely phonetic

Oh why do you do it
Look under the surface
Try to find some kind of meaning
Reason or purpose

My leaking eyes are caused by the wind
It's a physical condition

Oh why do you do it
Look under the surface
Try to find some kind of meaning
Reason or purpose

The world is sick and in my head
I'm just counting steps or letters in a name
From one to eleven and back again

Trying to get to a place
Where thought has been erased
By ritual systems
