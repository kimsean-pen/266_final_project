By day
Positioning pearls on younger girls
Who couldn't be bothered
Buttoning poise on younger boys
Avoiding their father
A shade in my employer's waking dream
I conduct myself invisibly

By moon
A fan of reprimand and the new man in the room
I'm queer in a way that works for you
If this is stupid will you see it through
The lengths I go to get hold on to

By day
Positioning pearls on younger girls
Who couldn't be bothered
Buttoning poise on younger boys
Avoiding their father
I ran out of expectancy
Everyone alive live fuller lives than me

By moon
I'm queer in a way that works for you
I might allow the devil through
If this is awful I will not be moved
The lengths I go to get held on to

By hate
Pearls on younger girls
Who couldn't be bothered
Poise on younger boys
Avoiding their father
I ran out of expectancy
Everyone alive live fuller lives than me
Lie lie lie lie lie lie lie
Lie lie lie lie lie
Lie lie lie lie lie lie lie
Lie lie lie lie lie
Queer in a way that's failed me
I'm not enough of anything

Queer in a way that works for them
Common tongue work in uncommon beds
I'm so stupid in my confidence
I doubt my will can last this thinly spread

Everyone outside swallow the light and creed
Everyone alive live fuller lives than me
I'm queer in a way that's failed me
Everyone alive live fuller lives than me
