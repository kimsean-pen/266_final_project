So if you looked away to round your eyes, dear
And I'm building you up
The illusion of love
Touch you look obliged
To a stomp mirror
These visions of trust
The ELISION of love
Tried my best to make you understand me
Do you lips like even
When I turn away?
Try to find a heart where both your hands meet
'Cause I'm falling deeper
With each cross I make
For you I'll trip away
And your body won't ever fade
'Cause you are my

'Cause you are my masterpiece
A perfect work and symmetry
Something's missing
Now that I've made you for the world to see
Angel with such golden wings
I'll make you prison before I let you go
Some time down the road

Baby growing up and down your size, dear
Have I given you up?
My illusion of love
Time will tell how much I need you here
'Cause I won't let you cumber
I won't disappear
For you I'll trip away
And your body won't ever fade
'Cause you are my

'Cause you are my masterpiece
A perfect work and symmetry
Something's missing
Now that I've made you for the world to see
Angel with such golden wings
I'll make you prison before I let you go
Some time down the road

And now I want you to remember me
A moment, each moment you gave
That your shape is changing endlessly
So if you looked away to round your eyes, dear

'Cause you are my masterpiece
A perfect work and symmetry
Something's missing
Now that I've made you for the world to see
Angel with such golden wings
I envision, my elision
I'll make you prison before I let you go
Some time down the road
