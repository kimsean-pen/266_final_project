I start to melt
With your arms, round my waist
And your mouth, starts to spell
And the words, telling me to fade

I start to fade
With her arms, round my waist
And he mouth, starts to spell
And the words, telling me to stay

I start to melt
With my arms, round your waist
And my mouth, starts to spell
And the words, saying its okay
