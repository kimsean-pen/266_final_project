Folks, now here's a story 'bout Minnie the Moocher
She was a red hot hoochie coocher
She was the roughest, toughest frail
But Minnie had a heart as big as a whale

Ho-de-ho-de-ho (Ho-de-ho-de-ho)
Hi-de-hi-de-hi (Hi-de-hi-de-hi)
Hee-de-hee-de-hee (Hee-de-hee-de-hee)
Ho-de-ho-de-ho (Ho-de-ho-de-ho)

Now, she messed around with a bloke named Smokey
She loved him though he was kokey
He took her down to Chinatown
He showed her how to kick the gong around
(Showed her how to kick the gong around)

Ho-de-ho (Ho-de-ho)
Hi-de-hi (Hi-de-hi-hi)
Wah-di-we-boh (Wah-di-we-boh)
Ho-de-ho-de-ho (Ho-de-ho-de-ho)

Now she had a dream about the king of Sweden
He gave her things, that she was needin'
He gave her a home built of gold and steel
A diamond car, with the platinum wheels

Wha-di-woo-di-way (Wha-di-woo-di-way)
Oh baby (Oh baby)
Wanna be wi-yu (Wanna be wi-yu)
Ho-de-ho (Ho-de-ho)

Now he gave her his townhouse and his racing horses
Each meal she ate was a dozen courses
She had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes
And he sat around and counted them all a million times

Ho-de-ho-de (Ho-de-ho-de)
Poor Minnie (Poor Minnie)
Wa-away (Wa-away)
Ho-ho (Oh no)

Poor Min, poor Min, poor Min
