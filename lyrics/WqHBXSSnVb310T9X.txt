Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by a wild desire
And I fell right into a great ring of fire

And I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down as the flames went rising higher
And it burns, burns, burns
And it burns, burns, burns
In a ring of fire

The taste of love is sweet
When hearts just like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
But I jumped right in as the fire went wild

When I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down as the flames went rising higher
And it burns, burns, burns
And it burns, burns, burns
In a ring of fire

Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by a wild desire
And I fell right into a great ring of fire

And I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down as the flames went rising higher
And it burns, burns, burns
And it burns, burns, burns
In a ring of fire
