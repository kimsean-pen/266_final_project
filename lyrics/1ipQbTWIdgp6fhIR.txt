My heart has drifted out into a place I cannot find
And the days go by searching all the time
I was searching all, searching all the time

I looked into the eyes, the eyes of everyone I know
And the days go by wondering where to go
I was searching all, searching all the time

I tell myself these bitter, these bitter days will end
You gotta, you just gotta let them go, just let go

So, I stumble and I sway into the room and I fade
I hope my darkest day are behind me
I want to stay here in the sun for a while
I hope my darkest days are behind me

Oh for way too long these things they occupy my mind
And all the things that I, things I left behind
I was searching all, searching all the time

Oh my my my these bitter, these bitter days will end
You gotta, you just gotta let them go, just let go

So, I stumble and I sway into the room and I fade
I hope my darkest days are behind me
I want to stay here in the sun for a while
I saw i saw the wide old world wide old way

And I saw I saw the wide old world wide old way
