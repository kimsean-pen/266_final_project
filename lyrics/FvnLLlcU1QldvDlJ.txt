Decaying hands they reach for me
They're telling me, telling me that there's no choice at all
The whispers sound so sweet
How can I even resist?

Falling into the dark
I can feel them pulling me under
A fire burning under my skin
It's not suppose to end this way

The demons are nothing more than a fear inside
Their grip tightens, I must open my eyes fuck

Oh god, just give me the strength because
I can't let them get the best of me now

Is there nothing left for me to fear?
I'm so tired of holding on
I'm going back and forth inside my mind
Save me, save me

Falling into the dark
I can feel them pulling me under
A fire burning under my skin
It's not supposed to end this way

Reach for me, don't let me lose control
Speak to me, and let your voice lead me home
Reach for me, don't let me lose control
Speak to me, and let your voice lead me home
Reach for me, don't let me lose control
Speak to me, and let your voice lead me home
