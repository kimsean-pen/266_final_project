When the spoon is hot
And the needle's sharp
And you drift away
I can hear you say

That the world in black
Is upon your back
And your body shakes
So you ditch away
And you close the shades

Don't try to do it
Don't try to kill your time
Yeah, you might do it
Then you can't change your mind

You've got a hold on to your time
Till your break through these times of trouble

When you try to talk
And the words get hard
And they put you down
Don't you stay
Don't you ditch away

I saw you swinging
Yeah, swinging your mother's sword
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know you're playing but
Sometimes the rules get hard

But if somebody left you out on a ledge
If somebody pushed you over the edge
You got to hold on to your time till you break
Through these times of trouble

I saw you swinging
Yeah, swinging your mother's sword
And yeah, yeah, yeah, I know you're playing but
Sometimes the rules get hard
But if somebody left you out on a ledge
If somebody pushed you over the edge
If somebody loved you and left you for dead
You got to hold on to your time till you break
Through these times of trouble
