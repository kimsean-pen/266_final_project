Alone, is this how it goes?
You're reaching out but your fingertips gone cold
Tonight, I'm terrified
But I won't apologize for chasing paradise
Because it's you...
That pulls me into reality
Just come alive and then we die easy
Just come alive and tell me ya' need me yeah
Is this happiness, maybe
Just come alive and say what I can't say
Just come alive and tell me it's gonna be okay
I'll need somebody when baby you know that I'll fade away

Funny how it goes,
In this thing called Rock 'n Roll
You've seen a thousand faces
But never felt more alone
So just let it ride
Try to see the light
'Cause holding on is a lot like letting go
Because it's you...
That pulls me into reality
Just come alive and then we die easy
Just come alive and tell me ya' need me yeah
Is this happiness, maybe
Just come alive and say what I can't say
Just come alive and tell me it's gonna be okay
I'll need somebody when baby you know that I'll fade away

You...
That pulls me into reality
Just come alive and then we die easy
Just come alive and tell me ya' need me yeah
Is this happiness, maybe
Just come alive and say what I can't say
Just come alive and tell me it's gonna be okay
I'll need somebody when baby you know that I'll fade away
