Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah

Saw it in your eyes when you said goodbye
You didn't even try, so this time I don't care

And honestly I was just about to pick up the phone
And then I realized that I didn't do nothing wrong
You would even tell two lies to prove that you were right
Usually I'd go on and take the blame but not this time (not this time!)

What you want from me?
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
No apologies
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
I'm not perfect, I got pride
That's not what it is this time
No apologies
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it

I can't help that you, feel the way you do
Try not to get confused 'cause this time I don't care
And honestly I was just about to pick up the phone
And then I realized that I didn't do nothing wrong

What you want from me?
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
No apologies
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
I'm not perfect, I got pride
That's not what it is this time
No apologies
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it, yeah

If I, If I, if I really
If I, If I, but I don't really
No I, I was sayin I'm sorry if I really meant it

If I, If I, if I really
If I, If I, but I don't really
No I, I was sayin I'm sorry if I really meant it

What you want from me?
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
No apologies
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
I'm not perfect, I got pride
That's not what it is this time
No apologies
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it, yeah

What you want from me?
I'm not sorry, no, (no apologies), no, no, no
No, I'm sayin no
I'm not perfect, I got pride
That's not what it is this time
No apologies
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it, I don't meant it baby
If I, If I, If I really meant it
