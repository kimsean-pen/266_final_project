Out of gas, out of road
Out of car, I don't know how I'm going to go
And I had a drink the other day
Opinions were like kittens, I was giving them away

I had a drink the other day
I had a lot to say
And I said...

You will come down soon too
You will come down too soon
You will come down soon too
You will come down, you'll come down, come down

You will come down soon too
You will come down too soon
You will come down soon too
Soon enough you will come down, come down

Out of gas, out of road
Out of car, I don't know how I'm going to go
And I had a drink the other day
Opinions were like kittens, I was giving them away

I had a drink the other day
I had a lot to say
And I said...

You will come down soon too
You will come down too soon
You will come down soon too
Soon enough you will come down, come down

You will come down soon too
You will come down too soon
You'll come down, come down
You'll come down, come down
