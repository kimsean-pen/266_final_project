As Time was ticking
We were winning
And it all was going as planned
Politicians stand between the lines of making headlines
Street signs saying you're going the wrong way

Fading faster now?
You can try to break us

And make us fall apart
But the fires in our hearts
Reminisce on memories

Cause were gone
Don't forget to
Hold back your thoughts
And live like robots
Because you all know what goes on

Reminisce on memories cause were gone
(Were gone so gone)

Fallen soldiers all around us
But we're still standing strong
Barely seeing, contradicting

Cause now were making
Headlines primetime saying what a story
Billboards packed tours
Don't forget

You can try to break us
And make us fall apart

But the fires in our hearts
Reminisce on memories
Cause were gone

Don't forget to
Hold back your thoughts
And live like robots
Because you all know what goes on
Reminisce on memories cause were gone
(Were gone so gone)
Bridge
Game over
You're done
Woo
Outer left field
We won
Pack our bags
Yeah we'll run
Hollywood here we come
x2
You can try to break us
And make us fall apart
But the fires in our hearts
Reminisce on memories
Cause were gone
Don't forget to
Hold back your thoughts
And live like robots
Because you all know what goes on
Reminisce on memories cause were gone
(so gone)

And you can try to break us
and make us fall apart
but the fire is in our hearts
Reminisce on memories cause were gone
