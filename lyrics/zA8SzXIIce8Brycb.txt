I've been working on myself and on my patience
But sometimes that shit don't come easy
And I see you've been tryin your best to give me explanations
But words don't really cut it lately

Remember when our love was precious
We thought what we had was the best, yeah
Now every answer's a question
Like every night is one of us is getting agressive
The other one's acting possessive
Guess it's the way that we do shit now

You and me we never say we're sorry
Hands around my body
Fucking 'til we're good
Fucking 'til we're good
And we promise we'll do better
Both go down together
Fucking 'til we're good

If it isn't love, tell me why do we hurt so good?
If it isn't love, tell me why do we hurt so good together?
If it isn't love, tell me why do we feel so good?
If it isn't love, tell me why do we hurt so good together?
So good together

We don't do no, we don't do no conversations
We don't talk the way we used to
You act like we're all good sometimes, you know I hate it
'Cause it's so obvious it ain't true

Remember when our love was precious
We thought what we had was the best yet
Now every answer's a question
Like every night is one of us is getting agressive
The other one's acting possessive
Guess it's the way that we do shit now

You and me we never say we sorry
Hands around my body
Fucking 'til we're good, good
Fucking 'til we're good
And we promise we'll do better
Both go down together
Fucking 'til we're good

If it isn't love, tell me why do we hurt so good?
If it isn't love, tell me why do we hurt so good together?
If it isn't love, tell me why do we feel so good?
If it isn't love, tell me why do we hurt so good together?
So good together

Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe we're crazy
No one loves me better
Than you, you, you, you

You and me we never say we sorry
Hands around my body
Fucking 'til we're good, good
Fucking 'til we're good
And we promise we'll do better
Both go down together
Fucking 'til we're good

If it isn't love, tell me why do we hurt so good?
If it isn't love, tell me why do we hurt so good together?
If it isn't love, tell me why do we feel so good?
If it isn't love, tell me why do we hurt so good together?
So good together
