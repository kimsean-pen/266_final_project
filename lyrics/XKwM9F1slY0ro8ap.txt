She didn't come this far
To go elsewhere
And fuck if I care
'Cause we don't ever play fair
And I made a mess thus far
With time to spare
Fuck if they care
In a stone cold stare

And you're acting like you're not washed out
You're traveling the safe route
Your level headed as a scape goat

Three credit cards, two jobs
And no health care
Fuck what they say
They living in fear

Expectations set high
The move was clear
Fuck what they say
Yeah I'm still here

Pour out a glass
One toast to all my peers
Fuck your fake friends
They just trying to make ends

Down for the cause
No time to set things clear
That's the minute I know
'Cause we in control

But you're acting like we were washed out
You're traveling the safe route
Your level headed as a scape goat

Three credit cards, two jobs
And no health care
Fuck what they say
They living in fear

Expectations set high
The move was clear
Fuck what they say
Yeah I'm still here
