So listen up
(So listen up)
I worked in daylight feeding fashion to housewives
For just this once
(For just this once)
I'll take my chances at truck stops and state lines

Go ahead and tell them again
Well, I think that I know that they won't remember
Go out and tell them twice
Yeah, twice is nice but three times is just right

Hey, hey, now we're almost home
I'm missing you to death but it's all for the best I know
Hey, hey, we're not far from home
And I've got my pride, and I'll let you sleep tonight

So listen up
(So listen up)
My old friends have been dropping like houseflies
The smoking gun still sits in my pocket
And I know how to use it

Go ahead and tell them again
Well, I think that I know that I won't forgive them
For turning their backs when we started to get busy
Well yeah twice is fine but three times is just right

Hey, hey, now we're almost home
I'm missing you to death but to each in his own
Hey, hey, we're not far from home
I've got my pride, and I'll let you sleep tonight

Hey, hey, now we're almost home
I'm missing you to death, missing you to death
hey, hey we're not far from home
I'll swallow my pride and push back my seat tonight

I'm on my feet, I'm on my feet, I'm on my feet
I'm on my feet, I'm on my feet
(This isn't like us anyway, this isn't like us anyway)
I'm on my feet
(This isn't like us anyway)

I'm running

Our time is almost, our time is almost here
(This isn't like us anyway)
Our time is almost, our time is almost here
(This isn't like us anyway)

Our time is almost, our time is almost here
(This isn't like us anyway)
Our time is almost, our time is almost here
(This isn't like us anyway)

Our time is almost, our time is almost here
(This isn't like us anyway)
Our time is almost, our time is almost here
(This isn't like us anyway)

Our time is almost, our time is almost here
(This isn't like us anyway)
