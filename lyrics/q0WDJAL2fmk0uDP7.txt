"Show me, show me, show me
How you do that trick?
The one that makes me scream", she said
"The one that makes me laugh", she said
Threw her arms around my neck

"Show me how you do it?
And I promise you, I promise
That I'll run away with you
I'll run away with you"

Spinning on that dizzy edge
I kissed her face, I kissed her head
Dreamed of all the different ways I had
To make her glow

"Why are you so far away?", she said
"Why won't you ever know
That I'm in love with you?
That I'm in love with you?"

You, soft and only
You, lost and lonely
You, strange as angels

Dancing in the deepest oceans
Twisting in the water
You're just like a dream
You're just like a dream

Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
I moved my lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes

Found myself alone, alone
Alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me

You, soft and only
You, lost and lonely
You, just like heaven
