Drop back, fall into a kiddy pool
Splayed out in the front yard of a white trash lower middle class home
How appropriate this is where I chose to relax
Though the thought of the act might offend you
I never wanted to offend you

I was the one to break your fall, but now I'm gone
(Shedding better layers, fucking everything we wanted up)
You were the hits I took, you were the smoke in my lungs
(Please don't get offended, you were everything I wanted, but)
Now you're just another sing-along
For lonely nights and drunken drives home
And you say you're fine without me, but you take me everywhere that you go
Oh, you should let me go

I hope this song makes your playlist
The ones you make and think I don't notice
That every one has your favorite song
You didn't know until I showed it to you
We grew apart
We're not setting off fireworks from my car anymore
Retrace your steps to your backyard and find out exactly where this all fell apart
'Cause I don't want to keep you here any longer
I know it's hard but if you give up you'll feel stronger, I promise

I was the one to break your fall, but now I'm gone
(Shedding better layers, fucking everything we wanted up)
You were the hits I took, you were the smoke in my lungs
(Please don't get offended, you were everything I wanted, but)
Now you're just another sing-along
For lonely nights and drunken drives home
And you say you're fine without me, but you take me everywhere that you go
I hope this song makes your playlist

So I can give you something sentimental
Something you'll always remember me for
The words that I wrote
And the way that they felt
I just hope they feel better now

I was the one to break your fall, but now I'm gone
(Shedding better layers, fucking everything we wanted up)
You were the hits I took, you were the smoke in my lungs
(Please don't get offended, you were everything I wanted, but)
Now you're just another sing-along
For lonely nights and drunken drives home
And you say you're fine without me, but you take me everywhere that you go
I hope this song makes your playlist
