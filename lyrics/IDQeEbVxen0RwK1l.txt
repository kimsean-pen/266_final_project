Heaven never ever heard a word I said
I've cried enough to raise the dead
"Everything comes and goes," they say
Here tomorrow, gone today

Heaven won't let me in, I don't know why
No one ever loved half as much as I
Everyone's a sinner in the balancer's eye
I've prayed enough, I rolled the dice
Anyone's luck can turn, I've heard
Not soon enough, I gave my word

I was born right into nothing
Under a very bad sign
Can I cross beyond that line?
Is it in my mind?
Is it in my mind?
Is it in my mind?
Is it in my mind?

Nothing's waiting for us in the great sky
Life is equal to dust in the balancer's eye
Now I know that I can't lift an old curse
Tell me, how does a man change the universe?

Will I ever be forgiven for the crime of my life?
Will it haunt me 'til I die?
To the end of time
To the end of time
To the end of time
To the end of time

Heaven won't let me in, I don't know why
No one ever loved half as much as I

If I follow the starlight and call your name
Will I see you again on the astral plane?
Why did learnin' the truth make me feel worse?
Tell me, how does a man change the universe?
Doesn't matter; it's too late to do right
Heading into the void at the speed of light
Now I know that I can't lift an old curse
Tell me, how does a man change the universe?

Tell me, how does a man change the universe?
Tell me, how does a man change the universe?

Follow the emerald star!
