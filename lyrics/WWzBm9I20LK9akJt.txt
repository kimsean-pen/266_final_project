pull the blinds
all the black dreams i've had
well they don't mean much now

when i rise at noon
i'm missing someone i don't know
and i don't want to be alone

and this house is now a grave
i've been sleeping here for days
i'm too hidden to awake
so i disappear always

call someone up
just having a dream
we can talk about anything, i don't care

getting out of the house
for an hour or two
but it's missing something i can't explain

and this house is now a grave
i've been sleeping here for days
i'm too hidden to awake
so i disappear always
