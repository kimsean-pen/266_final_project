Bleeding now I'm
Crying out I'm
Falling down and I'm
Feeling nothing, like
Laughing now I'm
Stopping now I'm
Reaching out and I'm
Feeling Nothing

Yeah, You created a rift within me
Now there have been several complications
That have left me feeling nothing
I might say
You were wrong to take it from me
Left me feeling nothing

Crawling now I'm
Beaten down I'm
Tortured now and I'm
Feeling nothing like
Hunting now I'm
Stalking now I'm
Reaching out and I'm
Killing nothing

Yeah, You created a rift within me
Now there have been several complications
That have left me feeling nothing
I might say
You were wrong to take it from me
Left me feeling nothing

Ripping and tearing and feeding and growing inside of me
