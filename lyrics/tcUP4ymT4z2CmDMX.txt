I ain't no dumb blonde
I ain't no stupid Barbie doll
I got my game on
You gon' watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong

Well, there you go again telling me where I belong
You put me on the bench, don't think that I can play strong
So quick to condescend well, you think I'm empty, I'm not
You won't be so confident when I'm crushing you from the top

I'm a babe, I'm a boss and I'm making this money (oh huh)
I can flip like a switch and I cut like a blade (try to get it now)
I can sting like a bee, but I'm sweeter than honey
And I'm quick as a whip so get outta my way

I ain't no dumb blonde
I ain't no stupid Barbie doll
I got my game on
You gon' watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong
I ain't no dumb blonde
I am a freaking cherry bomb
I'll be your icon
You gon' watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong

Well, there you go again, you're talking down to me
I may not give a damn, do not underestimate me
I'm golden, I'm platinum,
And you know I'm outta your league (so outta your league)
Sit down, your time is up, sit down and taken the lead

I'm a babe, I'm a boss and I'm making this money (oh huh)
I can flip like a switch and I cut like a blade (try to get it now)
I can sting like a bee, but I'm sweeter than honey
And I'm quick as a whip so get outta my way (gonna get it now)

I ain't no dumb blonde
I ain't no stupid Barbie doll
I got my game on
You gon' watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong
I ain't no dumb blonde
I am a freaking cherry bomb
I'll be your icon
You gon' watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong

Stand up, bend your body
Right now, say it loud
Bombshell, raising hell now
Watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong
Stand up, bend your body
Right now, say it loud
Bombshell, raising hell now
Watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong
Yo, I ain't playin', but I won the cup
Came through heavy on it in the Bentley truck (Uh-huh)
It was me, young Avril, security tucked (Okay)
In the back just in case one of y'all run up (Rrr)
One of y'all, um, um, all of y'all be stuck (Uh-huh)
When you see a young queen in the flesh, what's up? (What up?)
All the hatin' you was doin' got the Barbie poppin'
Now all of them wanna be a Barbie, I'm watchin'
But you never gon' stop me, never gon' top me
Millions on millions, they never gon' dock me (What else?)
I am the prototype, the pinkprint (Uh-huh)
And no, I don't want no frauds, wink, wink
(Oh, no)
I ain't no dumb blonde
I ain't no stupid Barbie doll (Hell no)
I got my game on
Watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong
I ain't no dumb blonde (Nuh-uh)
I am a freaking cherry bomb (That's right)
I'll be your icon (Just watch me)
Watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong
Stand up everybody (Stand up)
Get up, say it loud (Get loud)
We're bombshells raisin' hell now
Watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong
Stand up everybody (Come on)
Get up, say it loud (Let's go)
We're bombshells raisin' hell now
Watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong
