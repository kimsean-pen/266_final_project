Kissing a strange hand my city like street lamps fade
On the edge of an answer you weigh lust beginnings are made
Lover forgive me my guilt is my only crime
And I'll carry it round till it breaks me down every time

This is the time of night when the moonlight shines down
And we can reveal who we truly are
Within the darkest most depraved
Of joys

If you're afraid to say but you'd like to try
Just give me the safe word and take your hand
And smack me in the mouth
My love

From hunger you call and it falls upon the ears of faith
A half open mouth and the whole truth that no one would take
Pretend all you want you can cry to your hearts own beat
We will take love and swear upon the things that we just cant keep

This is the time of night when the moonlight shines down
And we can reveal who we truly are
Within the darkest most depraved
Of joys

If your afraid to say but you'd like to try
Just give me the safe word and take your hand
And smack me in the mouth
My love

This is the time of night when the moonlight shines down
And we can reveal who we truly are
Within the darkest most depraved
Of joys

If your afraid to say but you'd like to try
Just give me the safe word and take your hand
And smack me in the mouth
My love
