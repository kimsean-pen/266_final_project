Twisted through so deep
Everything you see is make believe
Castles in your sleep
You never seem to reach but in dreams

Day after day
Spiral out in doubt
I give, you take
This is not what it's about

Don't marry me for my money
I've got this love for you honey
It's baby blue
I'll carry you if you trust me
I know it's hard for you lately to take a view

Every stone you throw
I see through
I know what you mean
Silently and slow you catch every blow underneath

Day after day
Spiral out in doubt
I give, you take
This is not what it's about

Don't marry me for my money
I've got this love for you honey
It's baby blue
I'll carry you if you trust me
I know it's hard for you lately to take a view
Take a view

I'm tied to this
Caught wrist to wrist
Tell me what, tell me what to do

I'm tied to this
Caught wrist to wrist
Tell me what, tell me what to do

I'm tied to this
Caught wrist to wrist
Tell me what, tell me what to do

I'm tied to this
Caught wrist to wrist
Tell me what, tell me what to do

(Don't marry me for my money)

I'm tied to this
Caught wrist to wrist
Tell me what, tell me what to do
