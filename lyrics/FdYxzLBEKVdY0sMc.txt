Met this girl called Josephine and took her up on my machine
We had a little fun and now we got a little one
Had to get married, being chased out of town
Found ourselves a place to live, we put all our money down

Home Sweet Home, home sweet home
Eleven floors up in a tower block
Happy just to have a home
I've gone and changed the lock on our home

Nothing really worked out right
Things got broke, they stayed that way
None of our friends came around at night
And little Sam got no place to play
"We've got to get out of here, Bill" she said
"I've been telling you all the while"
When I came home from work that night
She'd jumped out the window with our child

From our Home Sweet Home, home sweet home
Just a place to take a rest
Just a place to make our nest
We call it our home

When the insurance money came through
Seemed dirty didn't know what to do
Took the cash went down the casino
Down on the wheel on the double
And I won, oh yes I won, like I never won before
Bought myself a country house
With an antique carved oak door

It was Home Sweet Home, home sweet home
Just a place to lay our head think of all those things we said
About in our Home Sweet Home
