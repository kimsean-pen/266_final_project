The snipers of the Maidan
They scope at flowers in your hair
The snipers of the Maidan
There are traitors everywhere
The snipers of the Maidan
They aim at flowers in your hair
The snipers of the Maidan
Bloody flowers everywhere

The culprits of sedition
The culprits of compassion
Flowers painted on their helmets
For the snipers of the Maidan

The snipers of the Maidan
They scope at flowers in your hair
The snipers of the Maidan
There are traitors everywhere

Now filled with blood and hair
Paper weight corpses everywhere
Like pagan music to the stars
A Trojan horse, Excalibur
