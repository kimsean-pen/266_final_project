You're always looking back running from the past
You're always sweating me about the next big heart attack
You're looking over your shoulder, staring down the path
I'm falling down falling down falling down

It's in your head
All the voices mistaken
Shake it off, shake it off
We're all dying in the end
It's in your head
All the voices mistaken
Shake it off shake it off
We're all dying in the end

I terrify me images so horrible (so horrible)
To clear my thoughts I'd drill a hole into my skull
Clean up my brains and sweep them underneath the rug
I need them more then I needed any other drug
I'm falling down, falling down, falling down

It's in your head
All the voices mistaken
Shake it off, shake it off
We're all dying in the end
It's in your head
All the voices mistaken
Shake it off, shake it off
We're all dying in the end (dying in the end)

Come on!

I'm falling down, falling down, falling down

It's in your head
All the voices mistaken
Shake it off, shake it off
We're all dying in the end (dying in the end)
It's in your head
All the voices mistaken
Shake it off, shake it off
We're all dying in the end (dying in the end)
Dying in the end
Sing it!
