I gotta tell, don't mean to be rude
I got it all, and nothing to prove
You get away, we gotta stand out
I've got the fix, don't turn it up loud

I-I-I gon' be okay, said the say, gon' be okay
I-I-I if you said the say, and I'll be okay
I don't brag about my great life,
Don't brag about my tops down
Sweetest thing set my head on fire
No need for me to shout it out
I don't brag about my great line
Just rollin' on my inside, oh oh
Don't brag about my sweet li-li-li-life
No need for me to sweat it out!

You get to worry, you get to care
I got a lot I'm eager to share
I've got the perfect pink in lights
I've got to show I'm having a blast

I-I-I gon' be okay, said the say, gon' be okay
I-I-I if you said the say, and I'll be okay
I don't brag about my great life,
Don't brag about my tops down
Sweetest thing set my head on fire
No need for me to shout it out
I don't brag about my great line
Just rollin' on my inside, oh oh
Don't brag about my sweet li-li-li-life
No need for me to sweat it out!

I don't brag about my tricks, honey
I'm not like
I swear I'll never to doubt your heart
No I don't brag about the kicks in line, but
I never talk about the dark sides
I never brag about my sweet
I never brag about my sweet life
I never brag about my sweet li-li-life
No need for me to shout it out!
Never brag about my sweet
Never brag about my sweet life
Never brag about my sweet li-li-life
No need for me to sweat it out!
