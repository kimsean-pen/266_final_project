The situations progressed
We built this city on rock and roll
It's my only regret
But bad is never good till there's worse
Scatter the ash of our homes
At the advisor's request
They suggest that we blame someone else
And we all say nothing more
Lay down your hands over your eyes
Our hearts don't beat like before
Bathing in the river of half hearted souls
Take me away from everything
We gathered wings of an angel
And we flew up to the gates to be with God
But when we got to the sun
We lost our wings up to the flames
And sold our souls to the devil
The red devil
