Scarlet red is all that's left of us
A room where no honesty remains
Still farther fetched is our return to grace
Though I'd give anything to turn back these idle hands of shame

Let the rain come down, let the lightning fly
Rest assured, your stars won't have the answers
Erosion therapy, all that's left of you and me
Falling down and hiding all the ways that we've gone wrong

Let's watch the people point and stare at us today
You know we've brought this on ourselves
They'll see us crumble as we count the many ways
You left us spineless and scarlet red... scarlet red

Both found complicit in this mess we've made
Intruders lay with us in bed
Rabid yet penitent we hide in shame
And these spurious adulterations... our vile form of treason

Let the rain come down, Let the lightning fly
Rest assured, we'll never have the answers
Erosion therapy, all that's left of you and me
Falling down and hiding all the ways that we've gone wrong

Let's watch the people point and stare at us each day
You know we've brought this on ourselves
They'll see us crumble as we count the many ways
I left us spineless and scarlet red... scarlet red

Dishonor and disgrace
Shining bright for all to see
Betrayal in our faces
And every stop sign in between
