Watching winter pools take me to the sea
Carried by the wind sighing feeling free
On the beach alone seabirds circle there above me
Lonely winter day makes me want to stay
There where I belong
Where I am real, where I can feel sounds of the sea

Rivers flowing down streaming in the sand
Shells are tangled in seaweed-drifting strands
Pools of silence stem peace is sounding all around me
Lonely winter day makes me want to stay
There where I belong
Where I am real, where I can feel sounds of the sea

Sun sets slowly and night returns once more
Standing by the surf coasting on the shore
Shadows in the night echoes of the sea inside me
Lonely winter day makes me want to stay
There where I belong
Where I am real, where I can feel sounds of the sea
