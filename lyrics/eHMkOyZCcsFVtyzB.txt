Look behind, your head is on fire
Whirling masses, rolling ashes
Keep on yawning, career dawning
Life is tasteless, folding paces

To turn away from the night
Allowing the light a low
He's surely fooling yourself
Leaving life on the shelf

You'll never know
How low an angry heart can go
How long a sitting hands return meant

Look behind, your head is on fire
Whirling masses, rolling ashes
Keep on yawning, career dawning
Life is tasteless, folding paces
