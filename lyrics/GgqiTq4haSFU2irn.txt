I am the Anti product, rotten to the core
Sell me, the Anti product, rock me to the core
Sell me, tell me, I'm the only one

I AM THE ANTI PRODUCT, ROCK ME TO THE BONE

I am the Anti product, quantum-mechanically pure
So you will show me, be automatic, we must be perfectly sure
Sell me, tell me I'm the chosen one

I AM THE ANTI PRODUCT, ROCK ME TO THE BONE
FOR SALE

I am the Anti product, rotten to the core
Sell me, the Anti product
Rock me to the bone
...to the bone

I AM THE ANTI PRODUCT
WE ARE THE ANTI PRODUCT
