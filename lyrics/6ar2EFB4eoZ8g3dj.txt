Boy, boy
Boy, boy
Boy, please, fuck off
You make me feel like there's no one else in the room
Me feel like a cherry garden in bloom
Boy, you really got me started up (Boy, please, fuck off)
It's true, babe, no one can do it better than you
No one can see through me just like you do
Boy, you really got me wound up, ay (Boy, please, fuck off)
Say you're my boy
I would escape and abort
If I only knew how to change my thoughts
I try to run but I fall
I try to run but I fall right back to you
Boy, please, fuck off
Boy, please, fuck off
Why don't you tell me all about the things that you like?
You tell it to my ear, it's okay, I can fly your kite
Blowing in the wind right to the top (Boy, please, fuck off)
It's cruel, babe, you broke into my heart like a thief in the night
You're running through my veins like a train at the speed of light
Ain't nothin' in the world can make it stop (Boy, please fuck off)
Hey, wanna be my boy?
I would escape and abort
If I only knew how to change my thoughts
I try to run but I fall, yeah, I try to run but I fall
I try to run but I fall right back to you
Music stops, wakes me up, stare into a paper cup
I'll confess I'm a mess, all I think about is
