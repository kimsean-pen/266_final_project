I hate the way that you've taken back
Everything you've given to me
And the way that you'd always say
It's nothing to do with me
Different versions of many men
Come before you came
All their questions was similar
The answers just the same

I gonna get me a motor car
Maybe a Jaguar maybe a plane or a day of fame
I gonna be a millionaire so can you take me there
Wanna be wild cos my life's so tame
Here am I, going nowhere on a train
Here am I, growing older in the rain

Here am I, gettin lost and lonely, sad and only wild sometimes cos my life feels so tame
