This isn't... good
No, this is not at all
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday
You're all gonna die
Everybody dies!
Danger! Warning! Mayday!
Abandon, evacuate, get out of here!

Oh no! You lived like you did and you thought everything would be fine?
Now you scamper and run, but you've already out of time
It's rotting and deteriorating from the inside There's no way to stop it, and clearly there's nowhere to hide

Calculation of survival rate 0%

Doom, gloom, The world goes boom
None will be spared, so don't assume
Not ragged clothes, not silver spooned
You're all the same when extiction looms

No food supplies, no water supplies
No power supplies, or other supplies
No compromise, just say your goodbyes
And everybody dies

No explanation or clarification
No information or justification
Forget the why's, just cover your eyes
And everybody dies

Oh no! It's not like your screaming
Can somehow elongate your life
You're best off to shut up
And calm down and wait for it

The world is black, there's no way back
You're way off the track, no plan of attack
So recognize, your pending demise
And everybody dies

And in the end when all is silent
The core is melting down
A quantum supernova's blasting out
The ominous skies materialize and everybody dies

Oh no! Now holding your breath
isn't going to bide you more time
You're best off to lay down and curl up and wait for it

The ultimate blast will be the last
And when it's passed, so terribly fast
It blinds your eyes, you're paralyzed
And everybody dies

The soil'll be red, where people have bled
The cities all dead, the radiation will spread
It's no surprise, we swallowed the lies and everybody dies

And in the end when all is silent
The core is melting down
A quantum supernova's blasting out
The ominous skies materize and everybody dies

Don't give up
We are still breathing
Don't give in
That's what they want
Don't despair
Just keep believing
Don't lose heart
We'll blast our way out of here

Danger! Warning! Mayday!
Abandon, evacuate!

Follow me
To a place beyond us
Follow me
To another world
Time is short, the hour's upon us
Follow me to the stars

Oh yes! Not ideal conditions, but stable enough, you could try
The chances are slim, but perhaps you could make it alive?

And in the end when all is silent
The core is melting down
A quantum supernova's blasting out
And in the end beyond the violence
No humans will be found
Now a quantum supernova's blasted out

Then ominous skies materialize
No compromise, just say your goodbyes
It's no surprise, we swallowed the lies
And everybody dies
