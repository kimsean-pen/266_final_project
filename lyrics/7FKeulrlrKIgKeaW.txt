You wanna know if I know why
I can't say that I do
Don't understand the evil eye
Or how one becomes two

I just can't recall what started it all
Or how to begin the end
I ain't here to break it, just see how far it will bend
Again and again, again and again

I wanna make it
I wanna make it wit chu
(Anytime, anywhere)

I wanna make it
(Again and again and again)
I wanna make it wit chu

Sometimes the same is different
Mostly it's the same
These mysteries of life
That just ain't my thing

If I told you that I knew
About the sun and the moon, I'd be untrue
The only thing I know for sure
Is what I wann' do
Anytime, anywhere, I must say, baby

I wanna make it
(Again and again)
I wanna make it wit chu
(Anytime, anywhere)

I wanna make it
(Again and again)
I wanna make it wit chu

I wanna make it
(Anytime, anywhere)
I wanna make it wit chu
I wanna make it
I wanna make it wit chu

I wanna make it
(Again and again)
I wanna make it wit chu
I wanna make it
(Anytime, anywhere)
I wanna make it wit chu
I wanna make it
(Again and again)
I wanna make it wit chu
(Again and again and again and again and again)
I wanna make it
