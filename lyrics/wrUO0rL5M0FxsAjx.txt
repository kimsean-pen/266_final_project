Feels like I've got the holy ghost
Feels like I've got the holy ghost
I'm losing all my, I'm losing all my control

I feel you in my, I feel you in my
I feel you in my dreams
I see you in my, I see you in my
I see you in my dreams

Just wanna get my mind off of you
Out drinking every night hoping I'll run into you
I know you're no good boy, I can't get enough of you

I feel you in my, I feel you in my
I feel you in my dreams
I see you in my, I see you in my
I see you in my dreams
