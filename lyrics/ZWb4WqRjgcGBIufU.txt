You drew the lines of my fingerprints
I'm the design, You're the artisan
You wrote the days of my destiny
And on every page reads Your love for me

You know me better than I know myself
Your ways are higher than anything else
You have the plan far beyond all my wildest dreams

Just like You paint the fiery skies
You chose the color of my eyes
From the start until the end of time
You're in the details, You're in the details

You map the road of my traveling
You never let go no, You're here with me
In every high, low and in between
You are my one and only consistency

You know me better than I know myself
Your ways are higher than anything else
You have the plan far beyond all my wildest dreams

Just like You paint the fiery skies
You chose the color of my eyes
From the start until the end of time
You're in the details, You're in the details
You're in the details

You know me better than I know myself
Your ways are higher than anything else
You have the plan far beyond all my wildest
All my wildest
All my wildest dreams

You set the moon to pull the tide
You speak and move this heart of mine
From the start until the end of time
You're in the details, You're in the details
