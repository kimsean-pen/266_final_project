There's a place we know
What's cold enough won't grow
We have seen the dark
And the darkness took its toll

And the journey waits for no one
If no one breaks the mould
And ours hearts are stronger
Then we know oh

(Ohhhhhh, ohhhhhhh)

That you and I could learn to love again
After all this time
Maybe that is how I knew you were the one
That you could still believe in me again
After all our trials
Maybe that is how I knew you were the one

To awake and know
We made it through the storm
And someone saves their sweet embrace
For you and you alone

(Ohhhhhh, ohhhhhhh)

That you and I could learn to love again
After all this time
Maybe that is how I knew you were the one
That you could still believe in me again
After all our trials
Maybe that is how I knew you were the one

(Ohhhhhh, ohhhhhhh)
Silence says we remember oh oh
We remember
Two lost souls in the shadow oh oh
In the shadows
And that is how I knew you were the one
And that is how I knew you were the one
