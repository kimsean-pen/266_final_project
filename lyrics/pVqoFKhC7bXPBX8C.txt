ust off the beaten track
Way from the Vegas trap
No more shiny Hollywood Bowl
New York streets have lost their soul
Think I'm in a state
Take me where it's desolate
Leave my senses in the clouds
Worlds away from city crowds

Into the Valley of the Bomb
Going for a desert song
See the nuclear family
Pointing to the sky at me

There's nowhere to go
There's nowhere to go
In the Land of Enchantment
The Land of Enchantment
New Mexico
New Mexico

This is the place to be a stranger
From another space
Everyone's a stranger there
See the rednecks stop and stare
Leave me in the scorching air
The blood is going to flow
From the place I love
New Mexico

Listen here to Moonface Mike
Tell you all what is was like
To light the sky not so long ago
Not so long ago
In crimson red hills so dead
Sands that bled in burning red
New Mexico

See the rednecks watch the skies
Flying saucers myths and lies
Myths and lies
Snakes are rattling on the ground
Wriggling into what they've found
Gouged-out holes of ripped-out eyes
See the rednecks watch the skies
In the megadeath birthplace
The megadeath birthplace
New Mexico

The White Sands of time
Are losing face, running down and going slow
In the Land of Enchantment
The Land of Enchantment
New Mexico
New Mexico
