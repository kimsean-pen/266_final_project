Don't say the word
if you don't want it done
Don't tell me your name
if you don't want it sung

Don't come any closer
that's good enough
Don't go away
I can't stand the thought

Oh oh It's too warm
Inside your hands
Oh oh it's too hot
Oh oh it's too good

It's just that
when you touched me
I could not
stand up

Oh oh I fell into
Oh oh I fell down
Why can't you tell me
Ã­s it worth a fight?

Do I sound crazy?
Well, I just might
Why do your words
have to ring so false?

Why do your eyes
have to change so much?
Oh oh it's too warm
Inside your hands

Oh oh it's too hot
Oh oh it's too good
It's just that
when you touched me
I could not
stand up
Oh I fell into
Oh oh I fell down
Turn, turn it on, turn, turn it on
You can turn it on, turn it into my song
I want to turn it on, turn it all night long
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on, turn it on
Turn, turn it on, turn, turn it on
You can turn it on, turn it into my song
I want to turn it on, turn it all night long
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on, turn it on
Don't say the word
If you don't want it done
Don't tell me your name
If you don't want it sung
