With mistletoe and candle green
To Halloween we go
Ten murdered oranges bled on board ship
Lent comedy to shame
The cattle graze bolt uprightly
Seducing down the door
To saddle swords and meeting place
We have no place to go

Then wearily the footsteps worked
The hallelujah crowds
Too late but wait the long-legged bait
Tripped uselessly around
Sebastopol Adrianapolis
The prayers of all combined
Tear down the flags of ownership
The walls are falling down

A belt to hold
Columbus too, perimeters of nails
Perceived the Mamma's golden touch
Good neighbours were we all
