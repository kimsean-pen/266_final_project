Driving through the night on my ones I'm drifting
Thinking 'bout you, I can't even handle this I'm liftin'
I see all the quality around me even though I'm blind
Aye
She so fucking sexy, what a god damn mistress
2 A.M., you all up in my god damn business
Fuck you, like I told you when I hit you up that time online
Yeah
Watching how you moving is a motherfucking art piece
Slowly you'll be mine like a motherfucking car lease
Chasin' all my problems down the valley, I don't got no time
Yeah
Pickin' out your flaws just to prove that I ain't dreamin'
I'm a lost cause, why they think a nigga teachin'
Copy all these words just to read it later when I die
Yeah
Jamie wasn't Jamie when she drank up all the Jameson
I done fucked my time just so I could fuckin' lay this sin
Caught me slippin' when you saw me out of place again
Yeah
Jamie wasn't Jamie when she drank up all the Jameson
Jamie, Jamie, Jamie drank up all the Jameson
Jamie, Jamie, Jamie drank up all the Jameson
