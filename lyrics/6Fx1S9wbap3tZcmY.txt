The second half, right?

We started a fire
That was never supposed to burn out
You started a band
That was cool for awhile but it turned pretty bland
I started a fight
With the neighbor next door and his pesky wife
You started a job
That you hate when your sober and hate even more when you're not

I know you hate me too
Always say you do

And you moved to Japan
Thought a clean bill of health and a camera could show you the plan
I bought a bird
That repeats what I say but I'm lonely is all that he's heard
You found a guy
That is clearly the opposite me with a black motor bike
I dicked around
But its just like a movie that's picture is off with the sound

I know you hate me too
Always say you do

And you started to write
It was subtle at first but the danger was clearly in sight
I don't reply
Due to a lack of an ego and laziness cuts like a knife
You say that you're good
Had a baby with biker and named him Forest Whitaker
I'm laying low
On the probable chance you convince me to give him a home

I know you hate me too
Always say you do
I know that you hate me too
Always say you do
