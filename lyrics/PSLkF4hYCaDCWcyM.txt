Human - a child of the Earth
Still fallowing his rules and laws
Demanding, enslaving and using
Enthroned himself as a Lord of the Whole

Creator of a God of a man
Too proud to perceive the realities
His constant way to the grave
A Fate set up by the code

To the grave
To the grave
Still marching on
To the gates
To the gates
Where the Death awaits You...

Come closer, my Child
Now sleep well in my arms
Cold kiss of Death
Shall free your final breath

To the grave
To the grave
Still marching on

To the grave
To the grave

You'll meet the Human... DEAD

O tempera, o mores!
How weak became this pride...

Ad portas inferi

Where even Death may cry...

Human-a child of the Earth
Still fallowing his rules and laws
Demanding, enslaving and using
Enthroned himself as a Lord of the World

To the grave
To the grave
Still marching on
To the grave
To the grave

You'll meet the Human... DEAD

To the grave
To the grave
To the grave
To the grave
Still marching on
