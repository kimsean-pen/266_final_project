Oh tonight began with anything
Shaft of a light, a warm breath and a scream, ah yeah...
Oh, tamper if you like between the doors, oh yeah... huh... huh...
Oh, can't expect to go out... to go out...
With anything... anything more...

Oh reach the door... a breath and a...
Oh reach the door
And a la la la la yeah
Life ain't what it's worth... a breath and a...
Oh reach the door

All these reaching hands out grabbin' things, grabbin' me
Day in, day out, accumulating, ah yeah
Oh, I suggest you step out on your porch
Oh yeah, huh, huh, huh, huh, yeah...
Run away my son, to see it all... oh, see the world

Oh reach the door... a breath and a...
Oh reach the door
And a la la la la yeah
Life ain't what it's worth... a breath and a...
Oh reach the door

Come... here it comes...
There it goes... when it comes
Where it goes... where it comes...
Can't see through the faith... whoa
Ooh, come... here it comes...
There it goes, grasp what you can
Don't you know there's something inside your head, yeah...

Oh, if I knew where it was I would take you there
There's much more than this, ooh...
Much more than this
Oh, see the world... much more than, oh...
Much more than... Why?
