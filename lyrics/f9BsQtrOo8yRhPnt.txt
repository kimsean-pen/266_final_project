Fighting my time with this old lie
Nothing to say, nothing to do
Expressions
Expressions

Pull down the blinds, vicariously
I got nothing see, born finto the lead
And I wore your clothes, I wore you near
I'm watching for signs, I'm watching for signs

Orpheo Orpheo
Orpheo Orpheo

So much to hate and so much to like
I'm constantly struck in these modern time
Watch from afar, Where you build your own life
And this is the age of running your mouth

Orpheo Orpheo
Orpheo Orpheo

And
We're running out. we're running out
We're running out of time
We're running out. we're running out
We're running out of time

We're running out. we're running out
We're running out of time
We're running out. we're running out
We're running out of time

Oh time Oh time
Oh time Oh time
Oh time Oh time
Oh time Oh time
