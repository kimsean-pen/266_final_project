Precious love is random
But we inhale the slightest breeze
Men can cure the symptoms
But never cure the disease

What I discovered in a corner of my mind
Tells me it's time to face the truth
I tried to fight it but it's powerful and blind
And tells me what I long to do

When every lie is only mirrored verity
And every sin a cry for help
When you say things you never wanted to be said
You know it's time to walk ahead

Will I ever beat my demons?
Will I ever bear myself?

Precious love is random
But we inhale the slightest breeze
Men can cure the symptoms
But never cure the disease
When moments seem eternal
We should satisfy our needs
'Cause when the drought is coming
We should have filled our magazines

In ever vice you'll find a little purity
And darkness shows the smallest spark
In the calm you feel the lightest summer wind
And tide is followed by the flood

A drop can overflow an ocean easily
A moment can destroy a life
A little failure is enough to lose your course
To find your way back may be hard

Will I ever beat my demons?
Are the demons bad at all?

Precious love is random
But we inhale the slightest breeze
Men can cure the symptoms
But never cure the disease
When moments seem eternal
We should satisfy our needs
'Cause when the drought is coming
We should have filled our magazines
