I'm just gonna be myself
They don't look at me the way I am
So what? they are boring, boring
Look at me, you're smiling
I don't wanna act like everybody else
If not, they will think I'm ridiculous
But you, you, you
You're the only who doesn't
(Doesn't, doesn't, doesn't)
Doesn't think I'm weird

You whisper love
Maybe it's not love
I'm hypnotised, but doesn't matter
I feel love

You whisper love
Maybe it's not love
I'm hypnotised but, doesn't matter
I feel love

넌 날 비웃지
그럼 난 윙크를 하지
너도 뭔가 이상하다 느끼지?
뭐 반은 넘어왔네

넌 나를 모르지
이건 시간 문제겠지만
노랠 불렀지 (흥얼흥얼흥얼) 불렀지
날 사랑 안 할 수 있겠니?

You whisper love
Maybe it's not love
I'm hypnotised, but doesn't matter
I feel love

You whisper love
Maybe it's not love
I'm hypnotised, but doesn't matter

You whisper that's love
I don't know why
I feel insecure
But, whenever it's so quiet
I want to cry oh cry

You whisper that's love
I don't know why
You keep smiling, smiling, smiling
You whisper that's love
I don't know why
Oh I love you
