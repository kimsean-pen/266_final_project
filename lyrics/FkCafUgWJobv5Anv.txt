I'm never satisfied
I keep feeding myself lies
And when I realized that we're all alive
I feel like I could die

But it's fine
But it's fine
But it's fine

We're on the floor
All my friends and me
But I still want more
Colors blurry

Can't remember a thing without confusing things
What did you say? What did you mean?
Ends in my dream, all my friends were there
Surrounding me, smiling

In my dream
In my dream
In my dream

We're on the floor
All my friends and me
But I still want more
Colors blurry
