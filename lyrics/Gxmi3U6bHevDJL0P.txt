Once you let in the troubles from your past
Once again
Take your time and decide which ones were worth
All the fights

That is all that i ask
Summer knows you the best

So once you learn every color coded word
That i wrote
Move your heart sing it, burn it in you mind
Once again

And now that you want me
I waste my love
And now that you know me
I waste my love
Let me tell you, i've seen better days

(we could make it work
Better turn me up)

That is all that i ask
Some believe it's a test

That is all that i ask
Summer knows you the best

And now that you want me
I waste my love
And now that you know me
I waste my love
And no more falling back
Let me tell i've seen better days

Better days
Better days
