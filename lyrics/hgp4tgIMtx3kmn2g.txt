He's walkin' like a small child
But watch his eyes burn you away
Black holes in his golden stare
God knows, he wants to go home
Children of the damned
Children of the damned
Children of the damned
Children of the damned

He's walkin' like a dead man
If he had lived, he would have crucified us all
Now he's standing on his last step
He thought oblivion well it beckons us all
Children of the damned
Children of the damned
Children of the damned

Children of the damned

Now it's burnin' his hands, he's turnin' to laugh
Smiles as the flame sears his flesh
Melting his face screamin' in pain
Peeling the skin from his eyes

Watch him die according to plan
He's dust on the ground, what did we learn?

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're children of the damned
Your back's against the wall
You turn into the light
You're burning in the night
You're children of the damned
Like candles watch them burn
Burning in the light
You'll burn again tonight
Children of the damned
