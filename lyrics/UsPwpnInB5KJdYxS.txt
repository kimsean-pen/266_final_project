I could not remember
I said in a whisper to myself
I tried to get your attention
You said it Doesn't matter
Doesn't matter
Doesn't matter
Doesn't matter
Doesn't matter
Doesn't matter

I could not remember
I took a hammer to my head
I cursed the walls around me
You said it Doesn't matter
Doesn't matter
Doesn't matter
Doesn't matter
Doesn't matter
Doesn't matter
