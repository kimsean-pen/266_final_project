My guy is a tad transcontinental
But it keeps me enchained.
Watch an old black and white movie
Fred and Ginger are too sentimental.
Cryin' in shame, I don't want to be forgotten.

I can't be alone
So don't you dare leave me.
It's like coming home
To skin that has died.
Human voices like a drum
And they're looking right through me;
Scatter the ashes one more time, for me
One more time, for me

My guy is a tad too ornamental
When he's frozen in space.
cut your eye far to me
Covered carcasses, too elemental
Caught underneath a subway, I don't want to be forgotten.

I can't be alone
So don't you dare leave me.
It's like coming home
To skin that has died.
Human voices like a drum
And they're looking right through me;
Scatter the ashes one more time, for me
One more time, for me

One more time for me, one more time for me
One more time for me, one more time for me
One more time for me, one more time for me

Trans-likened, twisting my ankle
Doing the grave dance.
Narcotic? Yes please, I'll have a sample!
Riding on my very last chance.
Then the clouds will open for me!
Gonna meet my Jesus Christ!
I see history playing before me
For pleasure and passion, you play the price.
Sadness; the name of the spike that took me.
I'm naked, that's all.
Like some raging, hard, horny Mephistopheles
Came for my soul.
