It's a shame that we need everything
Still everything I see, I need
Just go, please don't go
I, I want all, all, all that I see, see, see
Just go, please don't go
'Cause I'll only let you down
And I'll only let you down

And watch the world spinnin' 'round
And know that it's alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Just go, please don't go
'Cause I'll only let you down
And I'll only let you down
And watch the world
Watch the world
Watch the world
Watch the world
Watch the world
'Cause I'll only let you down
Only let you down
Let you down
