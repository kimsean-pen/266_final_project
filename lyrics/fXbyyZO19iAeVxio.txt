Lousy with virginity
Won't go to bed 'til I'm legally wed
I can't, I'm Sandra Dee

Watch it! Hey, I'm Doris Day
I was not brought up that way
Won't come across, even Rock Hudson lost
His heart to Doris Day

I don't drink (No!) or swear (Oh!)
I don't rat my hair (Eww!)
I get ill from one cigarette (Ah-ah-chem!)
Keep your filthy paws off my silky drawers!
Would you pull that crap with Annette?

As for you, Troy Donahue
I know what you wanna do
You got your crust, I'm no object of lust
I'm just plain Sandra Dee

Elvis, Elvis, let me be!
Keep that pelvis far from me
Just keep your cool, now you're starting to drool
Hey, fongool! I'm Sandra Dee
