The old tell the youth, "Do exactly what you're told"
The day the youth might listen is the day the youth grows old
The youth need the money, there's no such thing as enough
But the old know that money ain't gonna give them what they want
Oh, we got bills
We got taxes
We got dreams
We need satisfaction
And on the day
That I lie still
But I still have taxes,
And I still have bills
And I still have bills
And I still have bills
The old tell the youth, "that's the wrong way that they livin"
The youth always want more than what the youth is given
The youth think the money is gonna give them what they need
But the old know that money isn't always what it seems
Oh, we got bills
We got taxes
We got dreams
We need satisfaction
And on the day
That I lie still
But I still have taxes,
And I still have bills
And I still have bills
And I still have bills
And I still have bills
And I still have bills
Bills, bills, bills i still have bills, bills, bills
I still have dollars to pay
I still have bills, bills, bills i still have bills, bills, bills
I still have dollars to pay
And I still have bills
I still have bills
And I still have bills
