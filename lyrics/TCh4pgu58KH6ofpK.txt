Well, I don't see you, I won't call you
I don't know enough to stall you
Is it me, or is it all you?
Guess, it's on and on

On a day, maybe I'd show you
But it's the least of all I go through
But the thing is I don't know you
And it's on and on

The trembling words, don't make my eyes close
And if anyone then you'd know I can't find out
'Cause it won't show
And it's on and on

Well, every dream is shot by daylight
And I pray that maybe you're right
But if you don't, maybe I might
'Cause it's on and on

When it takes too long I lose it
I'll just hang while you abuse it
If you knew then why'd you choose it
'Cause it's on and on

You're not gonna get me through this, are you?
You're not gonna get me through this, are you?

Well, anytime I'm there to show you
But if it takes too long I know you
Out the door just leavin' me screwed
And it's on and on

Well, everytime I try to fight it
It's so hard to seem excited
And if you don't turn, I'll bite it
And it's on and on

You're not gonna get me through this, are you?
You're not gonna get me through this, are you?

Well, I don't see you, I won't call you
I don't know enough to stall you
Is it me or is it all you?
Yes, it's on and on

Well, every dream is shot by daylight
And I pray maybe that you're right
But if you don't, maybe I might
'Cause it's on and on
