I never stop feeling strange
'Cause you never know if you really change
You can never tell if you're center stage
Is thin as glass and never meant a thing

And you never feel good or bad
Only strange and unprepared
'Cause I never see you coming or you leaving

Now we'll always never know
Now we'll always
But now we'll always never know
Now we'll always

And you never feel good or bad
Only strange and unprepared
'Cause I never see you coming or you leaving

Now we'll always never know
Now we'll always
Now we'll always never know
Now we'll always
