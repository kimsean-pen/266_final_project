Just a simple touch, just a little clutch
Makes me feel like flying
But where are you tonight?
Something isn't right
Can you please stop hiding?

I am trying not to think about
All the things you did before
But sometimes it all just gets to me
I can't fake it anymore

I'll stay with you but remember
And be careful what you do
'Cause I'm not bulletproof

In your secret place, staring into space
Leaves me feeling frozen
I just need to feel that what we have is real
And I'm the one you've chosen

I am trying not to think about
All the things you did before
But sometimes it all just gets to me
I can't fake it anymore

I'll stay with you but remember
And be careful what you do
'Cause I'm not bulletproof

I am trying not to think about
All the things you did before
But sometimes it all just gets to me
I can't fake it anymore

I'll stay with you but remember
And be careful what you do
'Cause I'm not bulletproof

And I'm not bulletproof
(And I'm not bulletproof)
And I'm not bulletproof
(And I'm not bulletproof)

I'm not bulletproof
(And I'm not bulletproof)
I'm not bulletproof
(And I'm not bulletproof)
I'm not bulletproof

(I am trying not to think about)
I'm not bulletproof
(But sometimes it all just gets to me)
I'm not bulletproof

(I'll stay with you but remember)
I'm not bulletproof
('Cause I'm not bulletproof)
I'm not bulletproof
('Cause I'm not bulletproof)
I'm not bulletproof
