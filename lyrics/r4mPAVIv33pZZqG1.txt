resigned to sit behind the others, smile it's not so
bad to be the only one
wait, wait, wait, wait don't go!
stay, please, stay, please!
wait, wait, wait, wait don't go!
stay, stay!
until I find, until i find, until i find,
another one, another one.
resigned, the sunrise was a lie, was a dream, it's too
dark outside to be alive
wait, wait, wait, wait don't go!
stay, stay!
wait, wait, wait, wait don't go!
stay, stay!
until i find, until i find, until i find,
another one, another one.
resigned to fade to what was joy is pain, it's not so
bad to be the only one alive.
