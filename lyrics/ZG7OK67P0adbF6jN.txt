Lie beneath the cold blanket
Watch the mountain sleep
The train rolls by every hour
As I wake and dream

Woods and the hills
And faces so dear to me
Frozen lakes, flatlands low
When I'm called, I'll go

Such still quiet
Then the whistle echoes
My fragile sleep torn from me
As many other things will be
