Well, guy in a skeleton costume
Comes up to the guy
In the Superman suit
Runs through him with a broadsword!

I flip the television off
Bring all the bright lights up
Turn the radio up loud
I don't know why I'm so persuaded

That if I think things through
Long enough and hard enough
I'll somehow get to you
But then you came in

And we locked eyes
You kicked the ashtray over as we came toward each other
Stubbed my cigarette out against the west wall
Quickly lit another

Look at that
Would you look at that
We're throwing off sparks
What will I do when I don't have you

To hold onto in the dark?
Yes, everybody's going to need a witness
Everybody's going to need a little backup in case the scene gets nasty
You throw the attic window open

And I throw myself all around you
And night comes to Tallahassee
I don't know why it's gotten harder
To keep myself away
Thought I'd finally beat the feeling back
It all came back today
And then we fell down
And we locked arms
We knocked the dresser over as we rolled across the floor
I don't mean it when I tell you
That I don't love you anymore
Look at that
Would you look at that
The way the ceiling starts to swerve
What will I do when I don't have you?
When I finally get what I deserve
