When, when all the world falls
And when, when you are here
There's a glow just like the stars
I hear a distant voice
Listen, listen
I dream, I dream of starlight
I dream, I dream of you
There's a glow just like the sun
I hear a distant voice
Listen, listen
I hear the voice
I hear the voice
I hear the voice of love
