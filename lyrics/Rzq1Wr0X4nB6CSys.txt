our aches and pains run wild
we drag around our lives
from town to town in a bad way
so these days i prefer the quiet

some people want to know every thought in your mind
I only want to hold you close and let the days slip by
lets not reminisce
the past is cauterized
memories will only twist the blade that slips deep inside
some people want to know every thought in your mind
I just want to hold you close and let the days slip by
