So dark... I'm facing my destiny
As far as pleasure led my disciple was me
For ages I have been searching for my bride
Since she passed away grief became my guide

As darkness falls above
It will be there for centuries
My mistress of sorrow she will hear my call

I sort of entered the other side...
when those words were called up to the sky

As darkness falls above
It will be there for centuries
Mistress of sorrow, please hear my call

As darkness falls above
It will be there for centuries
No mistress of sorrow ever heard my call
