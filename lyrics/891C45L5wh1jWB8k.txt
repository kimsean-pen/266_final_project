We had our life, we had our love
But you don't know what you've got till you lose it
Well that was then and this is now
And I want you back, how many times can I say I'm sorry (How many times)
Yes I'm sorry

How can something so good go so bad (Ooh)
How can something so right go so wrong (Ooh, ooh)
I don't know, I don't have all the answers (Ooh)
And I want you back, how many times can I say I'm sorry (How many times)

Well you know you can run and you can hide
But I'm not leaving unless you come with me
We've had our problems but I'm on your side
You're all I need, please believe in me, oh yeah

I only wanted someone to love (Ooh)
But something happened on the way to heaven (Ooh, ooh)
It got a hold of me, and wouldn't let go (Ooh)
I want you back, how many times can I say I'm sorry (How many times)
Oh yes I'm sorry (Sorry)

Well you know you can run and you can hide
But I'm not leaving unless you come with me
We've had our problems but I'm on your side
You're all I need, please believe me

You can run and you can hide
But I'm not leaving 'til it's all over
We've had our problems but I'm on your side
You're all that I need, let me show you

They say you can't take it with you when you go
I believe it, taking what I've got or being here with you
You know I, I'd rather leave it

We had our life, we had our love (Ooh)
But you don't know what you've got till you lose it (Ooh, ooh)
Well that was then and this is now, and I want you back (Ooh)
How many times can I say I'm sorry (How many times)
Oh yes I'm sorry (Yes I'm sorry)

Well you know you can run and you can hide
But I'm not leaving unless you come with me
We've had our problems but I'm on your side
You're all I need, please believe me

You can run and you can hide
But I'm not leaving 'til it's all over
We've had our problems but I'm on your side
You're all I need, please believe in me
