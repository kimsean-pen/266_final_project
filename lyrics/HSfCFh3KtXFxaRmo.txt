One evening, came close to sleep
Watching documentaries about birds
I went to bed and shut my eyes
But, I was just feeling down
Took a while just to slip away
But, I was still having a hard time
In the bad dream
In the bad dream

Counting from the day one, two
Waiting for you to come three, four
Nothing left on the face
Chasing your eyes and voice

Fell asleep late, but woke up early
Wanna have a totally different day
Shake my head to forget the things
In the bad dream

Counting from the day one, two
Waiting for you to come three, four
Trying to guess why we're here
Holding a phone watching your eyes

Where have you been for so long?
Go back to where you were
Where we were together

Fed up with my stupid day
But, I decided to enjoy it without any thought
You called my name
Wrote "I have to forget about it"
But, that makes it easy to remember
Chasing your voice
Someone laughs and I laugh along with her
I'm so glad this has happened to me
Where have you been
Miss your laugh, just joking around
Your hands and short legs, dancing around
