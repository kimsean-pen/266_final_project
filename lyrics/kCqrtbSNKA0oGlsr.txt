I came here from outer space, a planet called 808
In the Galazy of Funk, where the robots gravitate
A message came from NASA, an urgent SOS,
"The rock don't talk, hip-hop is cold, and we need a brand-new beat."

I bring the beat

I am the UFO: United Funk Official
Commanding you to bust a move or suffer with my missiles
No harm is my intention, but if you disobey
My wrath will stop all booty pop and blow this world away

Take me to your DJ
(Peace, love, happiness)
Take me to your DJ
(Five, four, three, two, one)
Commence shake down

I bring-- I bring,
I bring the beat
I bring-- I bring
I bring the beat
