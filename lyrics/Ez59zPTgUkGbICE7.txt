Oh Mary, where have you been?
There's so much to fill you in
And the world's in a tailspin
Oh Mary, where have you been?

And Mary, should I have some kids?
Build a house where no one lives
Get away from my phone and drugs
Just my wife and people I love

And Mary, they forgot about songs
Give us ten Goshen's and some sing-alongs
Just be 20 without problems
Oh Mary, they forgot about songs

And Mary, have you read the news?
He's putting his hands all over you
Foolish kid thinks that he can't lose
Oh Mary, don't read the news
Don't read the news

I am the Eraserland
I can start again
I am the Eraserland
I can start again
I am the Eraserland
I can start again
I am the Eraserland
I can start again
