Living, fighting, obsessing
Just as long as I can share it all with you
Yesterday, today, tomorrow, come rain, come shine
Hell and back, the beginning, inbetween, till the end of time

All that shines turns to rust
All that stands in time
Turns to dust

As above, so below
You ain't no fool and honey, I'm damn sure that you know
Yesterday, today, tomorrow, come rain, come shine
Hell and back, the beginning, inbetween, till the end of time

All that shines turns to rust
All that stands in time
Turns to dust

Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... ah ah
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... ah ah
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... ah ah
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... ah ah

All that shines turns to rust
All that stands in time
Turns to dust

All that shines turns to rust
All that stands in time
Turns to dust
