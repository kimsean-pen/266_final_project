1923, he sent a letter and it reached me
Some things never change, be it a river or be it your name
I call to you from another century
To see it, the world had been kind and sweet
And it really seems that the shadows
Have stopped following your every beat
Baby come back to me
Baby come back to me
Baby come back to me

Oh the strangest things are happening
To everyone around here
But some things never change
You're still missing from my dreams
I call to you from another century
To see you, the world had been kind and sweet
And it really seems that the shadows
Have stopped following your every beat
Baby come back to me
Baby come back to me
Baby come back to me
