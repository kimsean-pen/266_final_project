one day we were a sitting and a wondering where it's at
when down came a dragon with the wizard on his back
he said to us step on board, i'll take you for a trip
and off we flew off into space, the astro-gate was slipped... alright!

looking back behind us to the freaks and heads we waved
then off behind our system out into the deepest space
and on the edge of time and space there stood two towers black
but on we flew the wizard knew there was no turning back

wizard... cast a spell on me

higher and higher through the cosmos we had tripped
seeing stars turned inside out we thought our minds had flipped
colours swirling, sounds a drifting, thinking we were dead
the wizard turned and spoke to us and this is what he said...

through the virgin universe our bodies back we claimed
creating and destroying with the music we made
undulate with cosmic rhythm, galaxies were born
clouds of blue fluorescent? dupes? spreading out before... yeah!
