You only want to hear the good news
You and I never play by the same rules
I took a look inside the pantry
Close enough to know a bagel understands me

More than expected
No plans, happy endings
Get the fuck out my mentions
If you follow my lead

Call me by name
Call me your savior
Fell for the fame
It's alright, it's okay
Call me by name
Call me your savior
Fell for the fame
It's alright, it's okay

I see you go into your weekend
Never making an excuse for a reason
To be different
I got tempt it
But I could never expect it

No plans, happy endings
Never walk through my entrance
If you follow my lead

Call me by name
Call me your savior
Fell for the fame
It's alright, it's okay

Call me by name
Call me your savior
Fell for the fame
It's alright, it's okay

Call me by name
Call me your savior
Fell for the fame
It's alright, it's okay

Call me by name
Call me your savior
Fell for the fame
It's alright, it's okay
