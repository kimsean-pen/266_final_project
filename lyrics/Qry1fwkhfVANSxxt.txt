We are none of us

If I still believed in me
I would lie
If I had another chance I would try
If I lost my dreams I would blame myself again
If I were myself I would be someone else

If I didnt want to feel
I would stay
If I were myself I would be someone else

Cause I can
See the truth in the photograph
And with all thats mine
I need to look back inside
