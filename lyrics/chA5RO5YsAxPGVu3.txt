I can hear the sound of your barely beating heart
Pieces on the ground from the world that fell apart

Just hold on
It won't be long

I will find you here inside the dark
I will break through
No matter where you are
I will find you
I will find you

Like the wind that cries
I can feel you in the night
A distant lullaby
Underneath the shattered sky

Just hold on
It won't be long

I will find you here inside the dark
I will break through no matter where you are
I will find you
I will find you

I'll be the light and lead you home when there's nowhere left to go
I'll be the voice you always know when you're lost and all alone
I won't let you go

I will find you here inside the dark
I will break through no matter where you are
I will find you here inside the dark
I will break through no matter where you are
I will find you
I will find you
