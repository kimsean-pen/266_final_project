Ah, we are numbered,
We are numb, we are not alone.
Ah, we are numbered.
We are numb, we are numb...

All the world's been waiting for a photograph.
All the time we've waited for a sign.
It'll soon be over, all we want is honesty.
It'll soon be over, all we've got is time.

Ah, we are numbered,
We are numb, we are not alone.
Ah, we are numbered.
We are numb, we are numb...

So we search for home.
Only god knows god, oh.
I'm alright to fly!
Only we both know we never once were right...
We tried.
Say it!

Ah, we are numbered,
We are numb, we are not alone.
Ah, we are numbered.
We are numb, we are not alone...
Say it to me!

Why must we die?
Let us be one.

Ah, we are numbered.
We are numb, we are not alone.
