Should I offer up my hand
And save a wish for once for all of us
And should I offer up my hand
And lay the guilt on myself
So it's easier to not stay, to not stay

Because I found you in your corner
I pulled you out of the clouds
You left in such a hurry
Your face is lost in the crowd

Should I open up my eye's
Or just ignore who you are
And what you could have been
And should I open up my eye's
And make believe you will change
So it's easier to not stay, to not stay

Because I found you in your corner
I pulled you out of the clouds
You left in such a hurry
Your face is lost in the crowd

Because I found you in your corner
I pulled you out of the clouds
You left in such a hurry
Your face is lost in the crowd

Because I found you in your corner
I pulled you out of the clouds
You left in such a hurry
Your face is lost in the crowd

Your face is lost in the crowd
Your face is lost in the crowd
