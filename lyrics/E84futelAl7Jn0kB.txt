Been sleeping over for the past couple of weeks
Making a habit out of it, yeah
When I woke up, I saw your toothbrush on the sink
It kinda scared me, I'll admit

If there's a line, then I think that we crossed it
Second time you stayed the night
If there's a cool, then I think that I lost it
And I should take my own advice

Let's stop before it gets m-m-m-m-messy
Let's stop before it gets h-h-h-h-heavy
It's not too late to say you never met me
Let's stop before it gets m-m-m-m-m-m-messy

I try to tell myself that you gotta take it slow
I always jump in way too fast, yeah
If you wake up and I'm not there
It's nothing personal
Just got some problems from my past, yeah

If there's a line, then I think that we crossed it
Second time you stayed the night
If there's a cool, then I think that I lost it
And I should take my own advice

Let's stop before it gets m-m-m-m-messy
Let's stop before it gets h-h-h-h-heavy
It's not too late to say you never met me
Let's stop before it gets m-m-m-m-m-m-messy
Before it gets messy

Messy
Take another look at myself
Before it gets messy

If there's a line, then I think that we crossed it
Second time you stayed the night
If there's a cool, then I think that I lost it
And I should take my own advice

Let's stop before it gets m-m-m-m-messy
Let's stop before it gets h-h-h-h-heavy
It's not too late to say you never met me
Let's stop before it gets m-m-m-m-m-m-messy
