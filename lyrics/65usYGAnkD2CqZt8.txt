In the shadows, in the background
Out of the sunlight
You are hiding, scared of showing
What you really look like

But all our scars
They make us who we are
Lose your shame
We see, you've come so far, so far

And all this time
I've been by your side

Dance like nobody's watching
Nobody's judging who you love
Scream like you won't be silenced
Kill them with kindness and your love
From the stars and the dust
We were made, all of us
So let's dance like nobody's watching
Nobody's watching us

Your desires, all those little whispers
Yearn to be realised
All the haters and liars can't break us
We're free on the inside
And all this time
I've been by your side

Dance like nobody's watching
Nobody's judging who you love
Scream like you won't be silenced
Kill them with kindness and your love
From the stars and the dust
We were made, all of us
So let's dance like nobody's watching
Nobody's watching us

But all our scars
They make us who we are
Lose your shame
We see you've come so far

Dance like nobody's watching
Nobody's judging who you love
Scream like you won't be silenced
Kill them with kindness
Dance like nobody's watching
Nobody's judging who you love
Scream like you won't be silenced
Kill them with kindness and your love
From the stars and the dust
We were made, all of us
So let's dance like nobody's watching
Nobody's watching us
