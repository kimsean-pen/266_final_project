Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, In my mind

I am DDB I got my thoughts up on a tree high
So high, so high, so high, so high
Feeling oh so cool
I got my Henny and my blues by
Don't de step me
Feeling my soul too much lately

Thinking I feel blue
But really I'm just into the wrong things
Sometimes, I like to indulge in wine
Come and dine with me
Live by my dreams
Take it oh so deep, deep
Take it how you like
But I feel so damn good
We no fight, we love
We really misunderstood
Numbing my mind and my soul
I can't contain this thing I know
I try, but I cannot control my, my love
Sitting on my ones, I can't stand it
Try to be with people
But people they can't manage
just to see if I am happy
Priorities all messed up
No wonder they can't manage me
You can't handle me
I'm too much sauce in your dreams
Sauce, sauce

I am DDB I got my thoughts up on a tree high
High high high
Feeling oh so cool
I got my Henny and my blues by
Don't De step me
Feeling myself too much lately

Another time, another life
Maybe we can find some time to try
Another fold, maybe a glass or two
Can never be too cautious, I ran into you
Yeah eh eh eh eh
Kill'em with the sauce
Kill'em with the sauce, so sauced
I kill'em with the sauce
Cause I'm oh so sauced
Cause you got shit on your chin again
Have you been sniffing that rim again?
Ha Ha, Dirty little something
Ooooo mermaid season
Swimming in that, eh
