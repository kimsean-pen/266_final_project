Not into playing games with these plain Jane's
Either love me or leave me, the same thing
I can still feel the pain lingering from 5th grade
Young misfit with the crew wrist - slim fist
Give a fuck about a Soundcloud rapper
Give 'em two years and the clout won't matter
And I hate it so I'm lurking in the shadows
See you rocking Gucci but you look like an asshole

So what if I died, would you even cry?
Would you weep, would you keep it all inside?
Would you reminiscence back on my life?
Would you forgive me for all of my lies?
So what if I died, would you even cry?
Would you weep, would you keep it all inside?
Would you reminisce back on my life?
Would you forgive me for all of my lies?

I like to fantasize my funeral while stuck inside my cubicle
Think of everyone I hate and say my life was beautiful
Think of everyone who ever let me read a eulogy
Try to say they sorry, now they missed the opportunity
Cause I can't even act like I'm okay
Tryna get me to socialize, that's a no way
They say, the grass is greener on the other side
I seen it with my eyes, you must be color blind

So what if I died, would you even cry?
Would you weep, would you keep it all inside?
Would you reminisce back on my life?
Would you forgive me for all of my lies?
So what if I died, would you even cry?
Would you weep, would you keep it all inside?
Would you reminisce back on my life?
Would you forgive me for all of my lies?

So what if I died, would you even cry?
Would you weep, would you keep it all inside?
Would you reminisce back on my life?
Would you forgive me for all of my lies?
So what if I died, would you even cry?
Would you weep, would you keep it all inside?
Would you reminisce back on my life?
Would you forgive me for all of my lies?
