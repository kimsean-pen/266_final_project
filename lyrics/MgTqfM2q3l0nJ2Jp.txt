Laying on a dark beach
Pulsing waves cover me
Flowers bloom on the sea
Silver sand underneath

Talk to me as I am sleeping
Hold me while I'm dreaming
Honestly I could just breathe you in
Met you when my heart was bleeding
I'm constantly feeling
Drifting through an endless reverie

Twilight moon, interlude
Fell in love in my youth
On a cloud not a sound
Silent kiss just like this

Talk to me as I am sleeping
Hold me while I'm dreaming
Honestly I could just breathe you in
Met you when my heart was bleeding
I'm constantly feeling
Drifting through an endless reverie
