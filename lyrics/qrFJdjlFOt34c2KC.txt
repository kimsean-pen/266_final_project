Ooooohhhh
It's just like you avoiding every word
Ooooohhhh
You cross the street you saw someone you know.
And know just what that's like.
Ooooohhhh
You could not know it happens every day
Ooooohhhh
You'd stop yourself and pray inside your home
If I mentioned you were not alone.

Your dollar's divided.
I'm on glorious islands.
Presumptuous wanting
Makes sumptuous wants.
You're right on time
For the dwindling goose
Whose good time's bad
and who's justly obtuse.
Avoiding these languages
That I may love you,
You'll figure out where???
Nothing can choose.
To you, so long to use.
To you, so long to use.

Inverness?
Leaving me tasked without exit
And dangers
Remorseless? by???

Ooooohhhh
It's like you avoiding every word
Ooooohhhh
You'd stop yourself and pray inside your home
If I mentioned you were not alone
If I mentioned you were not alone
If I mentioned you were not alone
If I mentioned you were not alone
