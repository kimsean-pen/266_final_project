No place to hide away from evil
And they don't know why
Escaping from a kind of devil
And start to cry
Always watching, always on the run
And the fear is going on and on

Out in the cold an open fire
For a frozen heart
Tiny bodies getting tired
Of this senseless war
Trying to survive in hopeless dreams
Don't know what "tomorrow" seems

Don't you know that for the future
(We need them all)
Time is drifting out of order
(We need them all)
Always looking for a helping hand
Love is what they need
They don't understand, they're always

Living in hysteria
They are children of the night
They're living in hysteria
Always looking for a never-ending light

Prepared to grow up in the jungle
For a million nights
In their hearts a burning hunger
And nothing comes in sight
Looking for a magic spell
To get out from this burning hell

Don't you know that for the future
(We need them all)
Time is drifting out of order
(We need them all)
Always looking for a helping hand
Love is what they need
They don't understand, they're always

Living in hysteria
They are children of the night
They're living in hysteria
Always looking for a never-ending light

Living in a land they call Hysteria
Every helping hand could be mysteria
World is turning round and round for everyone
Always think about the damage you have done
Always praying for your love
Always praying for a serious love

They are living in hysteria
They are children of the night
They're living in hysteria
Always looking for a never-ending light
They are children of the night
They're living in hysteria
Always looking for a never-ending light
