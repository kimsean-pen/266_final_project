Don't throw it away just because it's broken
'Cause anything can mend
Don't call it a day just because the road's blocked
Doesn't mean we're at the end

If it's something you love, you don't leave it
If its' something you care for, you keep it

It's never too far, it's never too late
To tell someone, "You're the only one"
And even if it's hard, it's never goodbye
If you love someone then you try, try, try, try

Don't jump the train just because it's not moving
Doesn't mean we're on the wrong track
I'll always remain even if the wind blows
Just please remember that

If it's something you love, you don't leave it
If it's something you care for, you keep it

It's never too far, it's never too late
To tell someone, "You're the only one"
And even if it's hard, it's never goodbye
If you love someone then you try, try, try and you try

I won't let go, I won't give up
And if we fight, we'll only fight for us
Might not have much but what we've got
Is more than enough 'cause what we've got is love

It's never too far, it's never too late
To tell someone, "You're the only one"
Oh, and even if it's hard, it's never goodbye
If you love someone then you try, try
Then you try

And even if it's hard, it's never goodbye
If you love someone then you try, try, try

Don't throw us away just because we're broken
'Cause anything can mend
