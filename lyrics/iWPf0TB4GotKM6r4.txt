This party was dope
Bitches are freaky here

Kid,
Kool Aid & Frozen Pizza
its a work of art
I ain't talking Mona Lisa
Dream of rockin crowds
Fillin up arenas
This weed got me laughin like a damn Hyena (yeah)
I'm living life pretty similiar to yours
Used to go to school hang with friends and play sports
Every single summer takin trips to the shore
It was all gravy but I knew I wanted more
You never seen a young rapper like MOI
Can't believe the eyes its just a mirage
Still got my training wheels still in the garage
But I ain't gonna need those I'mma go hard

So far I've done pretty well for myself
Couple of trophies on the shelf
What else could I want that I don't have yet
A little more cash and my own fast jet
So I can go anywhere (anywhere)
Anywhere (anywhere)
Cali for the Kush
Boy I know there's plenty there
About to be in music stores everywhere
But no yet!
They can't understand my concept
I've been climbing up the great wall
Haven't had a fall yet
These? gotta know that I'm on next
Clean conscious
Good Samaritan
Companies sending me clothes so I'm wearing them
If you don't know, I'm from the burbs
Everything I drop recorded by Big Germ
I smoke herb
I make music

I don't even talk about it, I just do it!
Everyone got their own opinion
Reason why they fellin em
You must admit he's killin em
Runnin off adrenaline
Waiting for the game to let him in
So open up
The boy of a barrel smoke and gun
Whether old or young the chosen one
I got hundred million flows to come

Mac Miller
(says hi to the girls)

You know the lyrics to every single song
So when I'm at a show everyone can sing along.
My weed bag empty
Bottle at its last drop
I'm feelin like this could be my last shot
But many more songs to make, cousin
So why the f** you buggin.

Yeah, we just some muther fu** kids
We just some muther fu** kids
We just some muther fu** kids
We just some muther fu** kids
We just some muther fu** kids
We just some muther fu** kids
We just some muther fu**
we just some
we just some muther fu** kids
