You look familiar yeah I've seen you before
I thought I knew you when you walked in the door
You're so magnetic yeah you push and you pull
And you make everybody comfortable
I see how you use your charm
There's something wrong

You made me nervous when you sat on the floor
And blocked the exit, no one noticed at all
You shared your simple wisdom
Now you're adored
While you made everybody comfortable
I saw that you changed the lock, you devil
It's the only way out

It's so easy that I can't believe they don't see the plan
You put the beauty in the front
And you control from the back
I wanna hate you but only because you beat me to it
Maybe I'll join you, I've got ideas too

You look at me as if you already knew
I'm only here because I'm doing it too
We speak no words but we are obvious kin
Let's teach them how to build a pyramid
Tell them if they keep it up, they can reach the top

It's so easy that I can't believe they don't see the plan
You put the beauty in the front
And you control from the back
I wanna hate us but only because we're so good at it
We should stop but who's gonna stop us?

It's so easy that I can't believe they still don't see it
We took their trust and took their money
And they're still believers
I wanna hate us but only because we're so good at it
We should stop but who's gonna stop us now?

I used to try to be decent and kind
But time after time I would get eaten alive

It's so easy that I can't believe they don't see the plan
You put the beauty in the front
And you control from the back
I wanna hate us but only because we're so good at it
We should stop but who's gonna stop us?

It's so easy that I can't believe they still don't see it
We took their trust and took their money
And they're still believers
I wanna hate us but only because we're so good at it
We should stop but who's gonna stop us now?
