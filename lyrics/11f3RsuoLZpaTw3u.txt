(Dodododo 1)
Dodododo, dodododo, dodododo, dodeedododo...

(1A)
Waking up at twelve in my clothes again,
Feel my head explode from a night of gin,
Another night out late.
I don't wanna drink,
Don't wanna be a clown,
Gotta get my feet back on the ground
Before it pulls me in

(1B)
How come it ended up like this?
And who's gonna catch me
When I'm coming down to hit the ground again?

All by myself, (waking up at twelve im my clothes again)
Cos' I don't wanna drag you down,
Hold you down,
Cos' you're a friend,
I blame myself, (feel my head explode from a night a gin)
I guess you think it's funny now,
Funny now.

Dodododo, dodododo, dodododo, dodeedododo...
Dodododo, dodododo, dodododo, dodeedododo...

(2A)
On the underground,
With the freaks and frowns,
Looking at the world,
Through silver clouds,
But then it all came down.
I've gotta rise above
The emotional flood,
Gotta cut these ropes around my hands,
Pull myself around.

How come it ended up like this?
And who's gonna be there
When I've lost control and I'm heading to crash-land?

All by myself, (waking up at twelve im my clothes again)
Cos' I don't wanna drag you down,
Hold you down,
Cos' you're a friend,
I blame myself, (feel my head explode from a night a gin)
I guess you think it's funny now,
Funny now.

(Riff)

All by myself,
Cos' I don't wanna drag you down,
Hold you down,
Cause you're a friend,
I blame myself,
I guess you think it's funny now,
Funny now.

It's such a shame.
All by myself, (Waking up at twelve in my clothes again)
Cos' I don't wanna drag you down,
Hold you down,
Cos' you're a friend,
I blame myself, (Feel my head explode from a night of gin)
I guess you think it's funny now,
Funny now.

It's such a sin.
All by myself, (Waking up at twelve in my clothes again)
Cos' I don't wanna drag you down,
Hold you down,
Cos' you're a friend,
I blame myself. (Feel my head explode from a night of gin)
I guess you think it's funny now,
Funny now.
