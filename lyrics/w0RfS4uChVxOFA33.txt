It's all this reeking ego craves
The sun to never set
Why do threads of anger never linger?
Why does the ember turn to stone?
To where the longing goes
In with the sins of old
A face of nothing, to never see
As blind as free

Everything I want
Is in at the end of this
Everything I need
Will be at the end of me

My negation
How will you know my name
And sense the danger coming?
My negation
How can you see my face?
What's to become of me?

The art of reduction
Stripped down through
What seems defendable
Scaled to bare revisions
To stop making sense
Levelling pillars of towering fear
Rational instincts and insight to spare
End of falseness, end of grace

Everything I fear
Is in this failing
Nothing of what I am
Is in this end

My negation
How will you know my name
And sense the danger coming?
My negation
How can you see my face?
What's to become of me?

How will you know my name?
