Ooh yeah
Word is out
Now the word is out
Innocence
Word is out
Over town

Now the word is out
Word is out
Now the word is out
The word is out

You're clinging to a lie
Still you hope to try
And save your face
It's a no-win situation
There ain't gonna be a saving grace

Because you're sticking to a story
It really makes no sense
No judge or jury
Could ignore the evidence

Because the word is out
I can't go on believing in your innocence
Now the word is out
(The word is out)

The word is out
You can't go on pretending
It's all over town
Now the word is out
(The word is out)

But one redeeming feature
So you may as well accept your fate
(Accept your fate)
You can't wriggle out of this, it's gone too far
It's much too late
(It's much too late)

But it's funny my suspicions lead me to the lie
From the friend of a so called friend
I heard about your double life

Because the word is out
Can't go on beleiving in your innocence
The word is out
(The word is out)

The word is out
Can't go on pretending
It's all over town
Now the word is out
(The word is out)

Because the word is out
Can't go on pretending, innocence
The word is out

The word is out
Over town
It's all over the town

Because the word is out
Can't go on beleiving in your inocence

The word is out
Can't go on pretending
It's all over town

Because the word is out
Can't go on beleiving in your inncocence
The word is out
The word is out
