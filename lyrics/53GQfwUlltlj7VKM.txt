And if I have to go, will you remember me?
Will you find someone else, while I'm away?
There's nothing for me, in this world full of strangers
It's all someone else's idea
I don't belong here, and you can't go with me
You'll only slow me down

Until I send for you, don't wear your hair that way
If you cannot be true, I'll understand
Tell all the others, you'll hold in your arms
That I said I'd come back for you
I'll leave my jacket to keep you warm
That's all that I can do

And if I have to go, will you remember me?
Will you find someone else, while I'm away?
