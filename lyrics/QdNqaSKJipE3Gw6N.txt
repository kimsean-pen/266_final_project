Now we're face to face
But now's not the time to stand here and embrace
Get your hands off my waist
You're testing my patience so now tell me straight
Why am I hearing your name?
When I'm out with my girls, now's the time to explain
Who's Sarah? Who's Jane?
Why you acting betrayed?

'Cause I'm not the one to blame here
No I'm not the one to blame here, no
You know that I ain't

Too blind to see it
Too blind to see what you are doing
You look me dead in the eyes, told a thousand lies
Too blind to see it
Too blind to see what you are doing
You lie, you lie, you lie

I know what I saw
So why you ignoring missed calls on your phones?
All your messages show
You know this person, it's clear you're involved
Isn't this what you want?
To drive me crazy, so crazy
Isn't this what you want?
You're into the drama

'Cause I'm not the one to blame here, no
No I'm not the one to blame here, no
You know that I ain't

Too blind to see it
Too blind to see what you are doing
You look me dead in the eyes, told a thousand lies
Too blind to see it
Too blind to see what you are doing
You lie, you lie, you lie

Fool me once but you can't fool me twice
'Cause I ain't too blind to see
Too blind to see what you're doing to me
Fool me once but you can't fool me twice
'Cause I ain't too blind to see
Too blind to see what you're doing to me

Too blind to see it
Too blind to see what you are doing what you're doing
You look me dead in the eyes, told a thousand lies
Too blind to see it
Too blind to see what you are doing
You lie, you lie, you lie

Too blind to see it
Too blind to see what you are doing
You look me dead in the eyes, told a thousand lies
Too blind to see it
Too blind to see what you are doing
You lie, you lie, you lie
