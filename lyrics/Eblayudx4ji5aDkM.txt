They landed at Plymouth
With a smile on their face
They said "We're your brothers
From a far away place."
The Indians greeted them
With wide open arms
Too simple minded and trusting
To see through the charms

Ex-hoodlums and jail birds
With backgrounds of crime
They had a chance to breathe freely
For the very first time
To drink cool clear water
From clean mountain streams
When taken for granted it's not what it seems

They landed at Plymouth
With a smile on their face
They said "We're your brothers
From a far away place."
I know the Indians greeted them
With wide open arms
Too simple minded
To see through the charms

Slowly but surely
In came the forked tongue
To trick those who trusted
Humiliate the young
They said "Indians are different
They got to stay in their place
Not pure and holy
An inferior race."

They landed at Plymouth
With a smile on their face
They said "We're your brothers
From a far away place."
I know the Indians greeted them
With wide open arms
Too simple minded and trusting
To see through the charms

In came the religions
The liquor, and the guns
They claimed to be good guys
Yeah but they acted like huns
Creating chaos, spreading disease
As agents of god
They did damn well what they please

They landed at Plymouth
With a smile on their face
They said "We're your brothers
From a far away place."
The Indians greeted them
With wide open arms
Too simple minded
To see through the charms

Polluting the water
God damn, defiling the air
Rewriting the standards
Of what's good, and fair
Promote law and order
Yeah, just let justice go to hell
If the laws hard to swallow
Use the old wishing well

They landed at Plymouth
With a smile on their face
They said "We're your brothers
From a far away place."
The Indians greeted them
With wide open arms
Too simple minded
To see through the charms

Now the sun's slowly setting
Yes and the Indians are few
They've been murdered and pillaged
My god, what they've been through
Stranded on deserts
Where it's barren and dry
With bad air and foul water, yeah
They exist til they die

They landed at Plymouth
With a smile on their face
They said "We're your brothers
From a far away place."
The Indians greeted them with wide open arms
