Things I say and do may not come clear through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin'
But I, I hope hope you'll recognize what's right before your eyes
Oh, your heart should realize from where I'm dealin'

Baby, I'm tryin' to show you that I love you
Baby, I'm tryin' to show you that I care
Baby, I'm tryin' to tell you that I, I need you
Baby, I'm tryin' to tell you that I care

Oh, you may not understand just why I show my hand
The method to my madness you inspire
Perception is the key, it's evident, you see
What this is all about is love entire

Baby, I'm tryin' to show you that I love you
Baby, I'm tryin' to show you that I care
Baby, I'm tryin' to tell you that I, I need you
Baby, I'm tryin' to tell you that I care

And all I know is true
Is this love I have for you
And all I know is true is

Baby, I'm tryin' to show you that I love you
Baby, I'm tryin' to show you that I care
Baby, I'm tryin' to tell you that I, I need you
Baby, I'm tryin' to tell you that I care

And all I know is true
Is this love I have for you
And all I know is true
Is this love I have for you
And all I know is true is

Baby I'm tryin' to show you that I love you
(Baby, baby)
Baby I'm tryin' to show you that I care
(Baby, baby)

Baby, baby
Baby, baby
Baby, baby
