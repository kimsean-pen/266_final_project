Your hunger, your greed
Made it right for a few
To truly be free
And not having to serve
So come here and bleed
Come here and sing
As traitors sing
Of the road not taken

But how can I forgive
How can I hold you?
Don't you see just what you've done?
How can I forget
How can I know who you were
Before the damage was done?

What could and should be
So bright and so new
A future for me
In some borderless world
So come here and bleed
Come here and sing
As soldiers sing
Of the prisoner not taken

But how can I forgive
How can I hold you?
Don't you see just what you've done?
How can I forget
How can I know who you were
Before the damage was done?

... 'cause it just
Does not seem right, feel right
Can't be right
If it does not feel right
Seems like it can't be right
It just does not
Seem right, feel right
Can't be right
If it does not feel right
Seems like...

I am not a choice you make
I am not a habit you shake
I am not a smile you fake
I am not a bond you break
I am not a prize you take
I am not a plan you make
I am not a faith you shake
I am not a promise you break

Your hunger, your greed
Made it right for a few
To truly be free
And not having to serve
So come here and bleed
Come here and see
There's no turning back
No turning...
