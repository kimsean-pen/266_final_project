I've been all around the world
I've been a new sensation
But it doesn't really matter
In this ge-generation
The sophomore slump is an uphill battle
And someone said it ain't my scene

'Cause they need a new song
Like a new religion
Music for the television
I can't do the long division
Someone do the math

For the record label puts me on the shelf up in the freezer
Got to find another way to live the life of leisure
So I drop my top, mix and I mingle
Is everybody ready for the single and it goes

Ah, la, la, la, la
Now listen closer to the verse I lay
Ah, la, la, la, la
It's all about the wordplay
Ah, la, la, la, love
The wonderful thing it does
Because, because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's
Yeah, the Mister A to Z
They say I'm all about the wordplay

And it's time to get ill
I got your remedy for those who don't remember me
Well, let me introduce you to my style
I tried to keep it jumble but the lyrics never mumble
When the music's making people tongue-tied
You want a new song

Like a new religion
Music for the television
I can't do the long division
Someone do the math
For the people write me off like I'm a one-hit wonder

Got to find another way to keep from going under
Pull out the stops- got your attention
I guess it's time again for me to mention the wordplay
Ah, la, la, la, la

Now listen closer to the verse I lay
Ah, la, la, la, la
It's all about the wordplay
Ah, la, la, la, love
The wonderful thing it does
Because, because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's
Yeah, the Mister A to Z
They say I'm all about the wordplay
I built a across the stream of consciousness

It always seems to be a flowing
But I don't know which way my brain is going
Oh, the ryhming and the timing
Keeps the melodies inside me
And they're climbing
Till I'm running out of air
Are you prepared to take a dive into the deep end of my head
Are you listening to a single word I've said
Ah, la, la, la, la

Listen closely to the words I say
Ah, la, la, la, la
I'm sticking to the wordplay
Ah, la, la, la, love
The wonderful thing it does
Because, because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's
Yeah, the Mister A to Z
They say I'm all about the wordplay
Ah, la, la, la, la
I'm all about the wordplay
Ah, la, la, la, la
Stickin' with the wordplay
Ah, la, la, la, love
I love the wonderful thing it does
Because, because
The ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's are back in love
For the Mister A to Z, they say
Is all about the wordplay
