But I adore her
This will never happen
But I adore her
That will never happen
over my dead body
of course I think about it
burn my path if it does
shape my body as I feel torn
shape my body as I feel torn, broken
and if it happens
I'll burn and crawl deeper
in my hole
darkness always says hello
and your burning body will light my way
burning body
light my way
