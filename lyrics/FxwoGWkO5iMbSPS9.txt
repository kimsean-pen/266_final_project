I peek into the hole, I struggle for control
The children love the show
But they fail to see the anguish in my eyes
Fail to see the anguish in my eyes

I scratch around the brim, I let my mind give in, yeah, yeah
The crowd begins to grin
But they seem to scream when darkness fills my eyes
Seem to scream when darkness fills my eyes, it's no surprise

Fail to see the tragic, turn it into magic
My big top tricks will always make you happy
But we all know the hat is wearing me

My bag is in the hat
It's filled with this and that
My vision's getting fat
The rabbit's just a monkey in disguise

Stars and pills and needles
Dance before our eyes
They will bite the hand if it is slower than
The quickness of their scrutinizing eyes

Fail to see the tragic, turn it into magic
My big top tricks will always make you happy
But we all know the hat is wearing me

Chicanery will always make you happy
But we all know the hat is wearing me
