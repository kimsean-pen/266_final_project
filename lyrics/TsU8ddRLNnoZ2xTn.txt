Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom
Well who am I to keep you down
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
Yeah, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing

Yeah, women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean you'll know, you'll know
Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions
'Cause I keep my visions to myself

Well it's only me that wants to wrap around your dreams
And have you any dreams you'd like to sell dreams of loneliness
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
(Drives you mad)
In the stillness of remembering what you had

(Drives you mad)
And what you lost
(Remember what you had)
Thunder only happens when it's raining
(Thunder only happens when it's)
Players only love you when they're playing
(Players only love you when they're)
Yeah, women they will come and they will go
(They will go)
When the rain washes you clean you will know
Yeah, thunder only happens when it's raining
(Thunder only happens when it's)
And players only love you when they're playing
(Players only love you when they're)
Yeah, women they will come and they will go
(They will go)
When the rain washes you clean you'll know
You will know
(The heartbeat drives you mad)
You will know
(Remember what you had)
You will know
(The heartbeat drives you mad)
You will know
(Remember what you had)
