I can't remember feeling real
Like the candle burning bright
Visions of love and me
And another face of the world

Beyond your eyes forever moonlight
I look into your eyes
I can't pretend there's two ways

You could hear the sound of the world
Breaking this feeling
Candle burning bright

I see you and me passion
When you tell me what a wonderful world
Loving me I swear you just can fall
Into my arms
Into my arms

But I break out of feeling real
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
