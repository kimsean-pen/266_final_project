Breathe in for luck
Breathe in so deep
This air is blessed
You share with me
This night is wild
So calm and dull

These hearts they race
From self control
Your legs are smooth
As they graze mine
We're doing fine
We're doing nothing at all
My hopes are so high

That your kiss might kill me

So won't you kill me
So I die happy
My heart is yours to fill or burst
To break or bury
Or wear as jewelry

Whichever you prefer
The words are hushed

Let's not get busted
Just lay entwined here
Undiscovered
Safe in here from
All those stupid questions

"Hey did you get some?"
Man, that is so dumb
Stay quiet

Stay near
Stay close, they can't hear
So we can get some
My hopes are so high
That your kiss might kill me
So won't you kill me
So I die happy
My heart is yours to fill or burst
To break or bury
Or wear as jewelry
Whichever you prefer
Hands down this is the best day I can ever remember
I'll always remember the sound of the stereo
The dim of the soft lights
The scent of your hair
That you twirled in your fingers
And the time on the clock
When we realized it's so late
And this walk that we shared together
And the streets were wet
And the gate was locked
So I jumped it
And I let you in
And you stood at your door
With your hands on my waist
And you kissed me
Like you meant it
And I knew
That you meant it
That you meant it
That you meant it
And I knew
That you meant it
That you meant it
