I stand beside all that I am
Alive through all my fears
A drive inside me to succeed
Will that never dies

I'm spilling all my problems to you
I cry
You're deaf
So no one's hearing me at all

A weaker man would lose his faith
So many days without end
Undying need to take it all
Will that never dies

I've never turned my head to see
How it might have been
If I were weaker than my peers
I'd have given in
