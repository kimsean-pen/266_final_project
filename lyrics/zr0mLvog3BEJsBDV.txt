Born of the water
Born of the flame
This life is a monster
Don't you know it's name
The house it is wooden
The house it is stone
The proud broken hearted
And close to the bone
Once you had a nightmare
And then it came to pass
Crazy sky in the morning
Green as the grass
Covering a grave

Just a slip away
Just a slip away
Mmhmm mmm
Just a slip away

Down to the water
Drawn to the flame
This life will leave you crippled
Don't you know the game
Once you woke up choking
But then you held it down
Dry as the sand in the desert
Black as the clouds covering the sun
