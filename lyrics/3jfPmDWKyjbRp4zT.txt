Your mama's got nothing on me
Your daddy's got nothing on me
And the world that sleeps in its lunacy
It's got nothing on me

No stars got nothing on me
Your sun's got nothing on me
And the fool who sees it's the thief that needs
Has got nothing on me

You know it's not because the light here gets brighter
And it's not that I'm evil
I got a friend in the devil

But I can't even be your friend
I can't even be your friend
I can't even be your friend

I can get so wound up
But I feel all right
And if I get some rest
Yeah that'd be nice
When I shouldn't do it, I still do it
What you think's got nothing to do with this
Before you were born, I was already sinning

Yeah, yeah yeah
When I get too worked up
Well I work it out
And if I get too down
I just shout it out
I bet I have it all, but the rest will do
And it's nothing against all I do with you

Before you were born, I was already sinning

It's not because the light here is brighter
And it's not that I'm evil, I just don't like to pretend
That I could ever be your friend

If you don't listen so good
I can hum it out
Na na na na na na na na
I know I shouldn't do it
I just do it
And what ya think's got nothing to do with it
Before you were born, I was already sinning

It's not because the light here is brighter
And it's not that I'm evil
I just don't like to pretend
That I could ever be your friend
I could never be your friend
I never needed a friend
I don't wanna be friends

You'll never find a friend like me
