Well the first days are the hardest days
Don't you worry any more
'Cause when life looks like Easy Street
There is danger at your door
Think this through with me
Let me know your mind
Wo, oh, what I want to know
Is are you kind?

It's a buck dancer's choice my friend
Better take my advice
You know all the rules by now
And the fire from the ice
Will you come with me?
Won't you come with me?
Wo, oh, what I want to know
Will you come with me?

Goddamn, well I declare
Have you seen the like?
Their wall are built of cannonballs
Their motto is "Don't tread on me"
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come with me, or go alone
He's come to take his children home

It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he knows
Like the morning sun you come
And like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate
Barely time to wait
Wo, oh, what I want to know
Where does the time go?

I live in a silver mine
And I call it Beggar's Tomb
I got me a violin
And I beg you call the tune
Anybodys choice
I can hear your voice
Wo, oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along, or go alone
He's come to take his children home

Wo, oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along, or go alone
He's come to take his children home
