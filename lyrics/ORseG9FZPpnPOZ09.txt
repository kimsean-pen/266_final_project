Last night, I just wanted to have fun
To go out with my friends
I took my dads car
I never thought he
Would find out
But I crashed in a wall
Man I'm dead
I guess it's no use
I'm screwing up every little thing I ever
Try to do, I'm born to lose
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

God must hate me
He cursed me for eternity
God must hate me
Maybe you should pray for me
I'm breaking down and you can't save me
I'm stuck in hell and
I wanna go home
I wanna go home

Last night, I had to study for this test
I forgot man I'm dead
And now my brain is
Bursting out of
Of my head
I can't think, I can't breathe
Once again, I guess it's no use
I'm screwing up every little thing I ever
Try to do, I'm born to lose
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

God must hate me
He cursed me for eternity
God must hate me
Maybe you should pray for me
I'm breaking down and you can't save me
I'm stuck in hell and
I wanna go home

So what in the world
Am I supposed to do
I never did anything to you
So can't you find something else to do

God must hate me
He cursed me for eternity
God must hate me
Maybe you should pray for me
I'm breaking down and you can't save me
I'm stuck in hell and
I wanna go home, (God must hate me)
I wanna go home, (God must hate me)
I wanna go home, (God must hate me)
I wanna go home, (God must hate me)
I wanna go home
You can't save me
God must hate me now
