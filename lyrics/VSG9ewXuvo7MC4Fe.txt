Come on, come out
The weather is warm
Come on, come out
Come on come on

A spot in the shade
Where oranges fall
A spot in the shade
Away from it all

Watching the sky, you're watching a painting
Coming to life, shifting and shaping
Staying inside, it all goes all goes by

A blanket unfolds
A blanket to lie
The pieces of gold
They light up your eyes
And now we're alone
And now we're alive

Watching the sky, you're watching a painting
Coming to life, shifting and shaping
Staying inside, it all goes
All goes all goes all goes by
Stopping the time, the rush and the waiting
Leave it behind, shifting and shaping
Keep it inside, it all goes all goes all goes all goes by

It all goes passing by
All goes passing by

Watching the sky, you're watching a painting
Coming to life, shifting and shaping
Staying inside, it all goes
All goes all goes all goes by
Stopping the time, the rush and the waiting
Leave it behind, shifting and shaping
Keep it inside, it all goes all goes by
Come on come out, come on come out
