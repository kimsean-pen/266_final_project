Am I standing in my own way?
It's my own advice I should take
Every day's the same damn thing
I can't ignore these thoughts, not today
Another one and I'll be astray
Every day's the same damn thing
We'll run
Consider us gone
Cause I can't take it if you can't take it
We'll run
Consider us gone
Cause I can't take it if you can't take it
Countless hours down a two-lane
Why am I always the last awake?
I need you again
To comfort me, to make me feel
Like there's no place I'd rather be
Than to be here with them
Do you ever feel like you're the one
Who never takes the jump but always takes the fall?
That was me, no that's not me
Now I can run
Consider us gone
Cause I can't take it if you can't take it
We'll run
Consider us gone
Cause I can't take it if you can't take it
No, I won't make it if you won't make it
I won't make it if you won't make it
I won't make it
