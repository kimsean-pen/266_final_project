In a motel
Sleeping in the shower
I can feel you close
Like the ocean

Wanna tell you
I've been waiting so long
When I'm sober

My soul comes screeching
Screeching

Fuck the notion
That you should be higher
I've been lost in a fog
For forever

Wanna tell you
I been watching so long
When I'm sober

My soul comes screeching
Screeching

The world is radical
And I wait for it
To shine on the stage
That I built
The world is radical
And I wait for it
To rain

Screeching
Screeching
