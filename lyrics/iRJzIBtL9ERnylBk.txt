I will just keep waiting...
you will just keep waiting. In the cold...
The supplement...
we lost some friends...
we drove the bends...
so small...
A conscious decision to persuade
ourselves amongst the common human...
The drive to complete ourselves has become a blurry vision.
Always wanting more...
bettering ourselves through selfish minds.
it has started to overflow.
A current that creates this undertow...
swimming beneath it all... left behind...
