There goes our love again
Forgive my heart, forgive my heart
There goes our love again
Elate my heart and take the time
That's burning at the back of my mind

Cause I'm broken and blind
And holding up the jar of desire
I didn't go far
I didn't go far
I didn't go far
And I came home
I didn't go far
I didn't go far

I didn't go far

And I came home
But he said there goes our love again
Home is a desperate end
Cocoon my heart, cocoon my heart
And carry me to love again

Cocoon my heart and bring me calm
Hushing at the fear and the love

I know you're open and out
Just trying to pick my feelings undone
I didn't go far
I didn't go far
I didn't go far
And I came home
I didn't go far

I didn't go far
I didn't go far
And I came home

But he said there goes our love again
But he said there goes our love again
I didn't go far
I didn't go far
I didn't go far
And I came home

I didn't go far
I didn't go far
I didn't go far
And I came home

But he said there goes our love again
But he said there goes our love again
I didn't go far
I didn't go far
I didn't go far
And I came home
I didn't go far
I didn't go far
I didn't go far
And I came home
I didn't go far
I didn't go far
I didn't go far
And I came home
I didn't go far
I didn't go far
I didn't go far
And I came home
