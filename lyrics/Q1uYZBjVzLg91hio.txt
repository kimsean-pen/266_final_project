Hat and my dream, my head's up and on that broad avenue
We crossed the road and never spoke to another as we flew

We left your man alone and drag, nothin' there at us
A romantic bust, a blundered son,
an explosive blunderbuss

An ancient grand hotel of Persian thread and ivory
And when your man would turn his head
I'd see you look at me
Pool of brown and see of red demons in your pocket
That sang romance and formed a dance inside your silver locket

Corner exit, not tall enough to walk out standin' straight
Designed by men so ladies would have to lean back in their gait
You grabbed my arm and left with me but you were not allowed to
You took me to a public place to quietly blend into

Such a trick pretending not to be doin' what you want to do
But seems like everybody does this every waking moment

I laid you down and touched you like the two of us both needed
Safe to say that others might not approve of this and pleaded
"So selfish them" would be their cry
and who'd be brave to argue
Doin' what two people need is never on the menu
