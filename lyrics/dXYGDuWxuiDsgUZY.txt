I've got an addiction to the friction when you rub me around
I could tell you I'm sorry
But I'd do it again
I got the feeling, the feeling
We're too much of a good thing
And instead of pulling you closer, I push you away

And my make up is smudged
My tears on the floor
Oh this is the part
I went out the door
I tell you to go, I want you to stay
But it's too late

I, I, I'm always playing the blame game
Killing the good times
Always the same, same
I'm always laying the blame game
Such a shame, shame
Because I'm crazy about this
Wouldn't come for such a risk
Cause I, I, I'm always playing the blame game
I'm always playing the blame game

Second shot of tequila
Now I'm back on the dance floor
But seconds later you turn
And I get lost in the crowd
And when you take my hand
Oh it's the hand of a stranger
You're asking me what's wrong
But the music is too loud

And my make up is smudged
My tears on the floor
Oh this is the part
I went out the door
I tell you to go, I want you to stay
But it's too late

I, I, I'm always playing the blame game
Killing the good times
Always the same, same
I'm always laying the blame game
Such a shame, shame
Because I'm crazy about this
Wouldn't come for such a risk
Cause I, I, I'm always playing the blame game
I'm always playing the blame game
I'm always playing the blame game
Playing the blame game

There's tears in your eyes
I've been here before
This is the part you walk out the door
I tell you to go
I want you to stay
But it's too late

I, I, I'm always playing the blame game
Killing the good times
Always the same, same
I'm always laying the blame game
Such a shame, shame
Because I'm crazy about this
Wouldn't come for such a risk
Cause I, I, I'm always playing the blame game
I'm always playing the blame game
But it comes with such a risk
Playing the blame game
But it comes with such a risk
Cause I'm crazy about your kiss
But it comes with such a risk
Cause I'm crazy about your kiss
But it comes with such a risk
Cause I'm crazy about your kiss
But it comes with such a risk
