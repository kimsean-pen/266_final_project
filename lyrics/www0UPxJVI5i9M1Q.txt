You didn't know what to say
But I'll come at you today
Can't get out your own way
Well hold on, hold on, hold on

I'm hiding out in the sun
I'm getting everyone done
Just me hitting the wall
Here I come, here I come, here I come

Just call me the roller
I'll squeeze and unfold you
Call me the roller
I'm just gonna show you

So you've been crawling through a maze
An alcohol lemon haze
I've been watching you for days
You've been out of sight, alright, alright

I'll take you somewhere you never need to be
I'll give you something you never need to feel
The only thing is everything is real tonight, Tonight, tonight

Just call me the roller
I'll squeeze and unfold you
Call me the roller
I'm just gonna show you
Just call me the roller
I'll come blow you over
Call me the roller
I'm pleased that I know you

I'll take you somewhere you never need to be
I'll give you something you never need to feel
The only thing is everything is real

Tonight, tonight, tonight
Just call me the roller
I'll squeeze and unfold you
Call me the roller
I'm just gonna show you
The roller, the roller, the roller, the roller
The roller, the roller, the roller, the roller
The roller, the roller, the roller, the roller
The roller, the roller
