With my hands around your throat
That's the way I like you most
When you're choking on the feelings rushing out
I just want to hate
The same way that you hate
So that I don't feel this love no more
I'm choking on the feelings rushing out
I'm choking on the feelings rushing out

Time won't open up its wings
Let me fall from grace and land into the flames
I don't want to feel this love go cold
I don't know how you opened up this light before
I'm choking on the feelings rushing out
I'm choking on the feelings rushing out

(Wake) It's only getting worse
(Wake) Behold this bitter curse
(Wake) It's only getting worse, the end is nigh
(Wake) It's only getting worse
(Wake) Behold this bitter curse
(Wake) It's only getting worse, the end is nigh
Take it away, every second of pain
Like a stake through the brain, existence, inhumane

Am I awake or dreaming?
Is this the life we're breeding?
Why stay alive when dying is much easier?

(Wake) It's only getting worse
(Wake) Behold this bitter curse
(Wake) It's only getting worse, the end is nigh
(Wake) It's only getting worse
(Wake) Behold this bitter curse
(Wake) It's only getting worse, the end is nigh
Take it away, every second of pain
Like a stake through the brain, existence, inhumane

Am I awake or dreaming?
Is this the life we're breeding?
Why stay alive when dying is much easier?
Am I awake or dreaming?
Is this the life we're breeding?
Why stay alive when dying is much easier?

It's not gonna end the way you want
The end is nigh
It's not gonna end the way you want
The end is nigh
We've wasted away every second and day
Trying to ascertain our dominion in faith
It's not gonna end the way you want
The end is nigh, the end is nigh

The end is nigh
The end is nigh
The end is nigh
The end is nigh
The end is nigh...
