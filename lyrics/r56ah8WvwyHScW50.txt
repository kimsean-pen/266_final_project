The silence kills the calm of the night
I force an anxious patience
Counting every beat and waiting for my turn to die

Give it up, give it up
Don't fall for the same things
Give it up, give it up
Don't fall for mistakes that I've made
Don't turn away

I understand your ways
Won't give it up

It's not me you're waiting for
Alright, stop waiting
It's not me you're waiting for
It's time to let go, time to let it go

And when you've become
All you've lost
Wandering the streets and searching for a place to die

Give it up, give it up
Don't fall for the same things
Give it up, give it up
Don't fall for mistakes that I've made
Don't turn away
I understand your ways
Won't give it up

It's not me you're waiting for
Alright
Stop waiting
It's not me you're waiting for
This is where it ends
It's not me you're waiting for
It's time to let go, time to let it go
This where it ends

And if you promise to forget
I'll try to find a way to make mistakes
Make mistakes

Give it up, give it up...
(Try to find a way...)
Give it up, give it up...
(Try to find a way...)
(Fall for the same mistakes...)
Give it up, give it up...
(Try to find a way...)
(Fall for the same mistakes...)
Give it up, give it up

Give it up, give it up

Won't give it up

It's not me you're waiting for
It's not me you're waiting for

Alright, stop waiting
It's not me you're waiting for
Alright, stop waiting
It's not me you're waiting for

Give it up, give it up
Don't fall for the same things
Alright, stop waiting
Give it up, give it up
Don't fall for mistakes that I've made
(Alright, don't turn away)
Give it up, give it up
Don't fall for the same things
(Don't turn away)
Give it up, give it up
Don't fall for mistakes that I've made

Don't turn away
