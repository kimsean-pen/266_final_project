It's hard to shake the feeling
These phonies make my blood run cold
That talk ain't got no meaning
The shadowing is growing old
It's getting hard to fake it
Pretending that I fit this scene
Fed up with the chasing
If I lead, would you follow me?

Running, running, running from my problems
You'll be sitting pretty baby, hold on tight
Racing towards a dream on the horizon
Gimme something better than this Hollow life

I'm starving for an answer
I'm dying for an antidote
This planets moving faster
Why don't we hurry up and take it slow?
And we could chase the sunrise, sunrise
I been waiting my whole life, whole life
To sleep under the moonlight, moonlight
So tell me what you're thinking, babe

Running, running, running from my problems
You'll be sitting pretty baby, hold on tight
Racing towards a dream on the horizon
Gimme something better than this Hollow life

You do
You do
This hollow life
You do
You do
This hollow life

Fear is breaking us in two
In the end it's just a daydream
Are you feeling like I do?

Running, running, running from my problems
You'll be sitting pretty baby, hold on tight
Racing towards a dream on the horizon
Gimme something better than this Hollow life

You do
It's all an illusion
It's all an illusion
It's all an illusion
It's all an illusion

Running, running, running from my problems
You'll be sitting pretty baby, hold on tight
Racing towards a dream on the horizon
Gimme something better than this Hollow life
Hollow life
