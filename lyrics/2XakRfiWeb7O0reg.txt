Racing day by day
Post the work you share
Drowning in a lifetime
Watching the silver blowing hair
Watching the cats lined in her room
Catching eyes and full set zoom
Electric clouds of information
Tumble down
Too fast

My world spin faster
Your world spin faster
My world spin
Your world spin
Our world spin faster

I'm blind, I'm blind, I'm blind
Couldn't follow rules if I tried
Now we are all in search of speed
Leave mankind for machine
There are souls, staring screens

So caught up
With the things I don't need
So fast
The world spin fast

My world spin faster
Your world spin
Our world spin
The world spin faster
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Faster
