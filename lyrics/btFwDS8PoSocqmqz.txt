Hey man, what's your problem?
Don't you know that I don't belong to you
It's hard and hard enough to keep it up
When everything is so new

I'm not trying to forget you
I just like to be alone
Come and give me the space I need

And you may and you may
And you may and you may
And you may find that we're alright

I'm not trying to forget you
I just like to be my own
Come and give me the space I need

And you may and you may
And you may and you may
And you may find that we're alright

I mean no offense to you but grow up
Can't you just grow up
When are you going to give it your own go?
Give it your own go
I know I'm being way too hard
But I know that I'm trying

I know myself
And I know what I want to do
I'm doing my best
And I want to know is it good for you

You give me trouble
You give me everything that you've got
I'll show you that what's right for you me
Ain't for you

Don't look out for me

Who are you to tell me how
When you've problems of your own
I do love you
And I want to hold on to you for always
