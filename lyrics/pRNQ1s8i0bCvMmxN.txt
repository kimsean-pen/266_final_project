floating like a ghost man
floating like a baby
swaying in a mother's arm
sleeping like a baby

fans stay all in light
and friends stay all in hide

for they talk him up, together
together, there's life flowing

sending for the season
flowers for the rapture
shield her from the fire
flowers for the sleeping

fans stay all in light
and friends stay all in hide

for they don't get up, together
together, there's life flowing

soldier, child of honor
sleeping like a baby
swaying in his mother's arm
floating like a ghost man

fans stay all in light
and friends stay all in hide

fallen talk it out, together
together, there's life flowing.
