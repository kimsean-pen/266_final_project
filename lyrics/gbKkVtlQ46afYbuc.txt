Who put the mess in your head?
Filtering the sense of all your could have said
I stole the words from your mouth
So twisted in contagion, and reaching out

If this is the lullaby, then
Why am I not sleeping easy?
If you leave me alone, I will come home
Dragging my tails behind me

Sweetheart, don't hang me out to dry
When nothing is left
There is always us
When nothing is left
There is always us

If I could sing you to sleep
Lay you down and pray that your soul to keep
I would be all that you need
Wider eyes oblivious to everything

If this is the lullaby, then
Why am I not sleeping easy?
If you leave me alone, I will come home
Dragging my tails behind me

Sweetheart, don't hang me out to dry
When nothing is left
There is always us
When nothing is left
There is always us
When nothing is left
There is always us
When nothing is left
There is always us
