Cuckoo! Cuckoo!
Cuckoo! Cuckoo!
Cuckoo! Cuckoo!
Cuckoo! Cuckoo!

Ten silver spoons coming after me
One life with one dream on repeat
I'll escape if I try hard enough
Till King of the Jungle calls my bluff

Oh, lord (oh, lord)
I have been told (I have been told)
That I must take the unforsaken road (forsaken road)

There's a fork in the road, I'll do as I am told
And I don't know (don't know, don't know, don't know)
Who, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, I want to be

Cuckoo! Cuckoo!
Cuckoo! Cuckoo!
Cuckoo! Cuckoo!
Cuckoo! Cuckoo!

You say Y-E-S to everything
Will that guarantee you a win?
Do you think you will be good enough
To love others and to be loved?

Oh, lord (oh, lord)
Now I can see (now I can see)
The cutlery will keep on chasing me (forsaken road)

There's a fork in the road, I'll do as I am told
And I don't know (don't know, don't know, don't know)
Who, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, I want to be

We are the spoons, metally mean
We scooped our way into your dreams
To knock the knives out bloody cold
And lead you down the unforsaken road (forsaken road)

There's a fork in the road, I'll do as I am told
And I don't know (don't know, don't know, don't know)
Who, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, I want to be
Cuckoo!
