Oh Mississippi. Oh Mississippi River
Won't you send me on my way?
I can see the sun and
I can figure I'd be dead later today

Cause I harmed my woman
I killed her there today
Oh Mississippi. Oh Mississippi River
Won't you send me on my way?

Oh Hold me. Hold me won't yah Mr.
Can I have a couple dollars and a place to stay
I'm a good man and you'd figure
I'll stay for just one night and be on my way

But my lady she heard me too
She said she'd loved
Oh, but she wasn't true
Oh I'm begging you Mr. or Mr.?

Tell me what was I supposed to do?
