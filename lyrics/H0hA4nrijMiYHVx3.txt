I must be dreaming,
you fit so perfect.
I wanna give myself away,
you must be worth it.
Give you my touch,
You take me higher and above and then you turn,
and leave me here with nothin.
Red love, red red love.
ooohhohoh
Red love, red red love

All that I wanted,
was for the first one to care.
You kept your secret,
and told me life was unfair.
Gave you my trust,
you had me right there in your clutch, I felt the rush,
Then you just looked away like
Red love, red red love.
ooohhohoh
Red love, red red love

You didn't even turn around to look back,
didn't even stay to watch me cry.
Now when I turn around to look back,
ever thing you said was a lie.
ooh baby baby
Red love, red red love.
ooohhohoh
Red love, red red love

Guess I was dreaming,
I wore my heart on my sleeve.
And when the rain came pouring down you were so far out of reach.
But I'm waking up,
sometimes enough is enough.
If i can't ever get it back atleast i gave it all for
Red love, red red love.
ooohhohoh
Red love, red red love

You didn't even turn around to look back,
didn't even stay to watch me cry.
Now when I turn around to look back,
ever thing you said was a lie.
Ohh baby baby.
Red love, red red love.
ooohhohoh
Red love, red red love
