We just had to ask
Maybe some one out of heaven
Would hear us down here

We couldn't bear to stand
How the people leave us waiting
For something up there

Oh, why did you leave?
Why won't you come?
And save us again?

Come back to us spiders
Come uncrush my hand
Let peace and beauty reign
And bring us love again, like you can

We just didn't know
Someone there outside of heaven
Heard us down here

We couldn't stand it here
How the people leave us longing
For something up there

Oh, why did you leave?
And why won't you come?
And save us again?

Come back to us spiders
Come uncrush my hands
Let peace and beauty reign
And bring us love again, like you can
(2x)

So much time, we need to ask everything
How did it go, you need it I got it

Come back to us spiders
Come uncrush my hands
Let peace and beauty reign
And bring us love again, like you can
(2x)

Like you can
