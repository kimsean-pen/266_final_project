Reeling in the skeins to cable fed simulacra
To which I run the feed

Sandblasted faces no mouths to scream
needless object always scratching

This breach in Heaven irised shut
It scorns this land without even ghosts

Reinventing the wheel so many times
I've become calloused to its genius

I clock the signal to noise
And take suicide capsules now
For me the sky has fallen
Is this how Braille sounds?
