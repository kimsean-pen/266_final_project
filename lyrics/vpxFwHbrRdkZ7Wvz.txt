You bet we fight 'til pressed
Against six feet of distance and earth
Yeah, we make mistakes that our fathers have made
And my troubles come up from the earth

My teeth, grit, fierce and I bet you understand, Grace is my name
The tongues run amok and fangs will breed on fangs
So keep your secrets in the mattress, pray they don't escape
It's the impossible act of building our bridges much faster then they burn

Stay, 'cause I can't afford, distance is shadowing my heart
What good is a sinner if we haven't got grace?
Can't afford, distance is shadowing my heart
And what good is a sinner if we haven't got grace?

Save the son, my troubles boulevard across the land
Save the son, they keep their secrets in the mattress
Save the son, discard, save the son
I'm trying to keep it in the right hands

Medic, medic, medic
I've given up all my weapons and I've headed home

Well, I can see the words inside your silence
But I can't speak about your pain for you
How long can you burn for anyways?
Turning over and back again with tongues ablaze

Like, like lions without teeth, hungry
Staring at the forest with flames in our eyes
Just talking with the trees

If we can drift long enough, we'll be home
Sails blown by the fire within pushing me to you
And you can live inside of me, sewn together
Breaking and healing, growing and breaking again and again

And, and you're a part of me
You are my home and I'm your home
But I'm no place you'll want to be
So I'm out here again sparks hid behind my teeth

But won't say a word for fear of failure spreading
It takes some of us longer to get to our dead ends
We have old blood stained with loose living
Ran through charcoal hearts to make it red

And we can be on fire again, you and I
Do you want this? Well, say what you want
Say what you mean

We can talk lung to closed ear
Head inside of hand, turning over again together
Cut up for the cheap heat running through our veins
And we can lay brick by broken brick, our ashes pushed in between

And build this road back home to where we want to be
We are not our own, we are the same

Let fangs give birth to fangs but I can't walk away
Let them breed
Fangs give birth to fangs but I can't walk away
Let them breed
