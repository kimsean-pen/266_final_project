She said, I guess you let me down again,
I don't wanna be just friends,
I wanna sleep in your living room,
She said, I think it's all you,
You haven't seen yourself lately,
You remember that ring you gave me -
I do

She said, been drinking far too much,
You've been drunk every night this week,
I'm so sick of falling asleep,
Without you,
She said (she said), just touch my body,
And kiss me like you used to,
She said, boy I miss you (I miss you)

I've been thinking about you girl,
And sweetheart I owe you the world,
Even though you get drunk and shout all the way home,
I've been thinking about you girl,
And sweetheart I owe you the world,
Even though you get drunk and shout all the way home

Let me hold you hand,
we can talk about our favourite bands,
and how Nevermind still blows me away,
Let me hold you hand,
we can talk about our favourite bands,
and how Nevermind still blows me away,
Let me hold you hand,
we can talk about our favourite bands,
and how Nevermind still blows me away,
Let me hold you hand,
we can talk about our favourite bands,
and how Nevermind still blows me away
