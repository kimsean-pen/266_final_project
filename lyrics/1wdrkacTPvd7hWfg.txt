One more thing before I go
I know you said you'd call me in an hour or so
But I have to call and say
That I can't get last night out of my head
No, I can't get last night out of my head
One more thing before I grow
Mix it up, let's take it slow
But I have to call and say
That I can't get last night out of my head
No, I can't get last night out of my head
And I know that i'll be here
And I'll take you over tears
I just want to make it clear that I love you
One more thing before I check out
This dry well has sprung a leak and I'll
Just have to say that I
Can't get last night out of my head (last night out of my head)
I can't get last night out of my head (last night out of my head)
I don't want to spend a single night
in my own bed (last night out of my head)
Slow down
Slow down
I bruise easily
I bruise easily
I bruise easily
I bruise easily
I can't get last night out of my head i (last night out of my head)
No, I can't get last night out of my head (last night out of my head)
I don't want to spend a single night in my own head
(last night out of my head)
I can't get last night out of my head (last night out of my head)
