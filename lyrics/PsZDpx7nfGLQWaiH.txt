I like to have a good time
Joke a little, Toke a little
Drink a little wine

They say there's goodtimes and badtimes
Well let me talk about the good in the hood
Cause this might be the last time I get to say my piece
I might decease
Cause the bad do to take over sometimes, kapish?
We're from the home of the killer bees
Where nine millis be peeling these caps
Filling these gaps some civillians get taxed
The feelings you catch from killing these rats
Happen sometimes but mostly we just chill and relax
Women we mack
Full time hustlers, money we stack
Six deuce
One broad in the front and four in the back
Two if You're fat
In your own car follow the pack
Got some jack in my lap to hold me back
It's that lust potion
After the bottle they look like a model
Otherwise one of the homies will do me the paro
My crew's motto let's get some naked time baby
If not we'll drop you off and we'll see you tomorrow

I like to have a good time
Joke a little, Toke a little
Drink a little wine

I'm that rolling stone that roams the streets stoned
Unless you got some money for me leave me alone
It's my life and I live it, too short for a loan
So I can't do it your way, I stick to my own
Block parties, backyard boogies, and mozy wozies
Alcohol, music, hoes, and homies
Girls that hold me and love me
Think the world of me
Beautiful women that don't give a fuck if I'm ugly
I got more time than money, homes
You know the song
If you think that they're getting dough from me
You're dead wrong
Those that play games get clowned my games strong
They get the L.D. then we move'em along
To the next pink the next drink
The next joint gets my eyes chinked
Who gives a fuck what you think
It's in the name of fun that's how my game is run
And I'll be joking and toking till my days are done

I like to have a good time
Joke a little, Toke a little
Drink a little wine

I like to have a good time
Joke a little, Toke a little
Drink a little wine

I like to have a good time
Joke a little, Toke a little
Drink a little wine

I like to have a good time
Joke a little, Toke a little
Drink a little wine
