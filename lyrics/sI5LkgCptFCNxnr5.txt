I hover two centimetres over your body
I'm dripping
I'm dripping
I'm dripping with dementia (You can not believe)

I'm excited and not in a good way
I'm steadily spinning
I'm spinning
I'm spinning

Way to slow for you to perceive
Wrap you up in my gravity
Use my words incorrect-a-ly

I am plump with proclivities and I'm falling
I'm losing my balance
I'm losing my balance
I'm losing it

And when I bite down I don't stop until my teeth are touching
I don't stop until my teeth are touching
I don't stop until they meet

And when I'm hungry I don't rest until my fangs are bloody
I don't rest until my fangs are bloody
I don't rest until I eat

I hover two centimetres over your body
I'm dripping
