One life fades
Let another shine its place
It's just the moving of colour
My hands don't play the same
But they'll try anyway
Each accusing the other
You can do what you want
But I'm making my own way

Either you will or you won't
If you count yourself in

If daylight breaks and you're still miles away
You should move into cover
I'll try to stay in a more permanent way
Can we keep to each other?

Where have you been all this time?
Would you give one more day
If you're able I wonder
Before they kill
One more place at the table I've wondered
A penny for your thoughts
So many fall before they meet the shore

Woah
Woah
Woah

If daylight breaks and you're still miles away
You should move into cover
I'll try and stay in a more permanent way
Can we keep to each other?

You can do what you want
But I'm making my own way
