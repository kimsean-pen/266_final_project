The crumpled ocean with
No boat trip
The dark waters stole
My clothing

The shape stirs beneath me
A pulse pounds along blood streams
First bite marks
Beginning of

The clothe-less wrestle
The clothe-less animal

Bare those teeth to me, please
My eater
You can see all of me
Naked with fear

This is the test I left land for
To grip flesh and pull muscle
Well, the vice grips of the struggle
I can't give into, we owe

The clothe-less wrestle
The clothe-less animal
Animal, animal, animal

My enemy
Please stay close to me
No breath left
Cold breath thief

The last gasp of air, burst lung
They fight fathers, the weak son
The last taste of salt in my mouth
The skin breaks, there's no sound

They tore limb from limb
There is bone, there is gristle
I'm despairing

The clothe-less wrestle
The clothe-less animal
Animal, animal, animal, animal
