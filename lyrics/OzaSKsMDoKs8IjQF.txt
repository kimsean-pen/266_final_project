Over, over and over 'til you go and lock your heart
Open, totally broken when you've tumbled through the dark
Hold me, hold me closer 'til you're breaking up, don't leave
Fold it, fold it over, eight times then start again

I was your world, I was okay
I was the light that shone one everything
I was your world, I was okay
And I wasn't like that for you always

But if we've only got one parachute
If we've only got one parachute
You know I'd give it to you, you
I'd give it to you

Nowhere, nowhere is home unless we're both in the same place
Older, shoulder to shoulder cause we don't have separate ways
Hold me, hold me closer 'til we're breaking up, don't leave
Folded, I've folded it over, great times that start again

I was your world, I was okay
And I was the light that shined on every day
I was your world, I was okay
And I was the light that followed you always

But if we've only got one parachute
If we've only got one parachute
You know I'd give it to you, you
I'd give it to you
If we've only got one parachute
If we've only got one parachute
You know I'd give it to you, you
I'd give it to you

Out of mind, it's not important anymore
I realize you're at the core of what I need

And if we've only got one parachute
And if we've only got one parachute
You know I'd give it to you, you
I'd give it to you
If we've only got one parachute
If we've only got one parachute
You know I'd give it to you, you
I'd give it to you
