Dies Irae - Dies Illa
Solvet saeclum in favilla
Teste David cum Sibylla

Quantus tremor est futurus
Quando judex est venturus
Cuncta stricte discussurus

The earth
Thousands of years of wrath and pain

The birth
A kingdom of light and fire will reign

The life
Serve me and then eternity you gain

The death
In gardens with seeds and fruits you reign
And death

Cross of fire
Cross of fire
Cross of fire
Cross of fire
