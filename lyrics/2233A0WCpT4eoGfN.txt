There's a weakness, at the window
Place my footprints in the dark room
There's lonely voices, like a scarecrow
In the hallway, like a lost ghost

In the bedroom, I see a shadow
From the moon with light from a candle
On a bedframe, lies a girl
Her reflection, in the mirror

Lalala, dadada, dadada, dadala, dada
I like your eyes wide
Lalala, dadada, dadada, dadala, dada
Been knocking at your back door

Lalala, dadada, dadada, dadala, dada
Nervous like a knife fight
Lalala, dadada, dadada, dadada, dada
Be careful what you ask for

I do this from time to time
Where I can never wake from a bad dream (from time to time)
I do this from time to time
Where I can never say the things I mean (from time to time)

I do this from time to time
Where I like to watch you as you sleep (from time to time)
I do this from time to time
Where I like to think of you and me (from time to time)

It's a dark night, on the west coast
Then a soft breeze, as the sun rose
Then the phone rang, like a gun shot
Like a siren, on the beach rock

There's a message, at the river
A certain package here, to deliver
When the day breaks, after night fall
I will be there, you know I will.

Lalala, dadada, dadada, dadala, dada
I like your eyes wide
Lalala, dadada, dadada, dadala, dada
Been knocking at your back door
Lalala, dadada, dadada, dadala, dada
Nervous like a knife fight
Lalala, dadada, dadada, dadala, dada
Be careful what you ask for

I do this from time to time
Where I can never wake from a bad dream (from time to time)
I do this from time to time
Where I can never say the things I mean (from time to time)
I do this from time to time
Where I like to watch you as you sleep (from time to time)
I do this from time to time
Where I like to think of you and me (from time to time)

From time to time...
I hear you leave
I'm feeling the shake
and the sound of my heartbeat
Can't let go...
Do you know?
I'm feeling the pain
Of my first love
I let it go... can't let go

I do this from time to time
Where I can never wake from a bad dream (from time to time)
I do this from time to time
Where I can never say the things I mean (from time to time)
I do this from time to time
Where I like to watch you as you sleep (from time to time)
I do this from time to time
Where I wanna taste you as you breathe (from time to time)

I do this from time to time
Where I can never wake from a bad dream (from time to time)
I do this from time to time
Where I can never say the things I mean (from time to time)
I do this from time to time
Where I like to watch you as you sleep (from time to time)
I do this from time to time
Where I like to think of you and me (from time to time)
