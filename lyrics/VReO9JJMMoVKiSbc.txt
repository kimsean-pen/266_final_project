Silent as we drive
Worn down
Tongue tied
I can't.
I can't get it right
You say that you love me
You're tired and lonely
This don't...
This don't feel the same
Take me back to your love
I never say it loud enough for you (take me back, take me back)
Take me back to your tears
Before you calmed your fears
I know...
Stand in the doorway
Act like we're ok
Why can't this feel the same
Hands down
Control
Darling is this what we both want?
It don't feel right
Take me back to your love
I never say it loud enough for you (take me back, take me back)
Take me back to your tears
Before you calmed your fears
I know...

I want you
I want you only
For your highs
For your lows
I want you
And i want you only
All your highs
All your lows
I want you
When you're lonely
All your highs
All your lows
Take me back to your love
I never say it loud enough for you (take me back, take me back)
Take me back to your tears
Before you calmed your fears (take me back, take me back)
I know
(take me back, take me back)
(take me back, take me back)
I never say it loud enough for you (take me back, take me back)
(take me back, take me back)
Take me back to your tears
Before you calmed your fears (take me back, take me back)
I know...
