Memory rushes in, then washes you away
I am losing you to the sea
I'll break from the weight of my mind,
but your ghost I will gladly bear
and with all your grief in my arms I will labor by singing light
I'll keep my lanterns lit x8
If you had a single fall,
You just could not last forever could you?
You just could not last for me
