I don't want a wave to come carry me under
It's a time of designs
I open up a book I can't understand the meaning
I need something to read
Falling over backwards in an embarrassing fashion
Embarrassing fashion
I just get the feeling I don't have any sensation
It isn't much of a feeling

When you sleep
And you breathe an unconscious melody
Turning on your intricate circuitry
In the sea you can see infinity
When you breathe an unconscious melody

I hear a drum
But there's no music
Different kind of beat through a different kind of drum
There's too much fire
To keep from burning
There's too much water
To keep from sinking
Too much distraction
To help my thinking
That maybe all these subjects
Aren't worth discussing
But the joy comes softly
The joy comes softly

When you sleep
And you breathe an unconscious melody
Turning on your intricate circuitry
In the sea you can see infinity
When you breathe an unconscious melody
