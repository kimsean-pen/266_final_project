Ready, aim and fire your gun, nothing can cool me down
white like Venus, hot like the sun, whoah, nothing can cool me down
got my high stilettos on fleek, nothing can cool me down
see the shadows dancing on me, no nothing can cool me down

And before the night is over, I'ma let sprinkle, let the crazy out
I'm your goddess, on your knees
dum-da-da-dum da-dum

I'm hotter than fire, water can't cool me down
water can't cool me do-o-wn
oh-oh, oh-oh
I'm dancing like flames and nothing can cool me down
watch me I run this to-o-wn
oh-oh, oh, no water can't cool me d-down
d-down, no water can't cool me

There's no need to call 911, nothing can cool me down
If you do, you're spoiling the fun, oh, nothing can cool me down

And before you're begging please, I'ma let it sprinkle, let the crazy out
I'm your goddess, on your knees
dum-da-da-dum da-dum

I'm hotter than fire, water can't cool me down
water can't cool me do-o-wn
oh-oh, oh-oh
I'm dancing like flames and nothing can cool me down
watch me I run this to-o-wn
oh-oh, oh, no water can't cool me d-down
d-down, no water can't cool me d-down
d-down, no water can't cool me

I love the way that you want it
come get it like you own it
Yeah, yeah, we blaze even brighter
We're meant too

I'm hotter than fire, water can't cool me down
water can't cool me do-o-wn
oh-oh, oh-oh

I'm hotter than fire, water can't cool me down
water can't cool me do-o-wn
oh-oh, oh-oh
I'm dancing like flames and nothing can cool me down
watch me I run this to-o-wn
oh-oh, oh, no water can't cool me d-down
d-down, no water can't cool me d-down
d-down, no water can't cool me d-down
d-down, no water can't cool me d-down
