The beaten ends of this sickening life
And mistakes we've been crying about
Born to a world of lies
It's the constant sorrow, bolted into your heart
You own the agony, the one I'm looking for

Meaningless mess boils inside your head
Can't let it out
Maybe someday is all you can say
That is not a promise but a lie
Found myself on the tracks
Following my own traces
Made myself my own shadow

One vision, a distorted self-image
Always overloading the one you love
Kill yourself and everyone with you
Is this the end?
You own the agony, the one I'm looking for

Meaningless mess boils inside your head
Can't let it out
Maybe someday is all you can say
That is not a promise but a lie
Found myself on the tracks
Following my own traces
Made myself my own shadow

I am an empty frame
I am an empty frame
I am an empty frame
I am an empty frame

I am an empty frame
I am an empty frame
I am an empty frame
I am an empty frame

Meaningless mess boils inside your head
Can't let it out
Maybe someday is all you can say
That is not a promise but a lie
Found myself on the tracks
Following my own traces
Made myself my own shadow
