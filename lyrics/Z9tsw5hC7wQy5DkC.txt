I think it's a good idea if you stay the fuck away from me

I'm a gravedigger
I'm a gravedigger
I'm a, I'm a gravedigger
I'm a, I'm a gravedigger

Six deep single fish, floatin' on the river
You're goin' on a devil dance, do the Macarena
Black on my eyes and I'm cold as a cadaver
I'm immortal motherfucker, can't see me in the mirror
Crown on my head and the thorns on my mind
Blade in the flesh and you're drinkin' my wine
I kiss, you disappear, you wanna keep it a secret
I know you wanna fuck me, and you'll never forget it

I'm a gravedigger
I'm a, I'm a gravedigger
I'm a, I'm a gravedigger

Ohhh
I dig you
I dig you up
Honk in the trunk, there's an amber alert
From behind the mausoleum and the back of the church
I'm immortal motherfucker and I hang in a cage
I'm the girl you fuckin' over at your new name and your days
Everybody wants pretty girls they see
Nobody knows pretty girls make graves
Got you on a skewer so you crack on the pop
I'm not gonna stop 'til the box drops

I'm a gravedigger
I'm a, I'm a gravedigger
I'm a, I'm a gravedigger

Follow me into the fire
I'm a gravedigger
Follow me in to the fire
I'm a, I'm a gravedigger
I'm a, I'm a gravedigger
