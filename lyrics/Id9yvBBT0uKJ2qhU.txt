Processed. Diluted.
Virtually enrecognizable
I was lost there - no direction
A scattered void

No more
It's over
I'm onto you
(you're evil game)
The tables have turned

I'm taking back my soul

Solo
Tranquilized. Scrutinized.

Hate injected mind
As if eternal wounds

Would'nt bleed, would'nt hurt me
No more
It's over
I'm onto you
(you're evil game)
The tables have turned
I'm taking back my soul
Solo
I see through you're lies
Taking back what's mine
Solos
No more
It's over
I'm onto you
(you're evil game)
The tables have turned
I'm taking back my soul
My Soul
