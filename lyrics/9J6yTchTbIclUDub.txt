Locked in a building
The place is on fire
Up in the penthouse
Taking a view
Alarms are ringing
The seconds are ticking
The canisters fly
And everyone laughs
And everyone laughs

This is the new world
This is your time
Down in the basement
Dancing again
Everybody get ready to sing
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
Come join the party at Club Vertigo
Move to the searchlight songs
Everybody get ready to clap your hands
When the lights go out
When the lights go out

Out with the old war
In with the new
Dressed to the nines
Atomic chic looks so good on you
The zeitgeist trend for a new generation
For a new radiation
And everyone laughs
And everyone laughs

This is the new world
This is your time
Down in the basement
Dancing again
Everybody get ready to sing
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
Come join the party at Club Vertigo
Move to the searchlight songs
Everybody get ready to clap your hands
When the lights go out
When the lights go out

Dance to the last song
Stay with me
Over and over
Tell me you love me
Tell me the words that I want to hear
Let's embrace
Let's embrace
And wait for the all-clear

This is the new world
This is your time
Down in the basement
Dancing again
Everybody get ready to sing
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
Come join the party at Club Vertigo
Move to the searchlight songs
Everybody get ready to clap your hands
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
