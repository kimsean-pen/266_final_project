I miss that look in your eye
How your body felt on mine
Remember everything
I remember everything
I'm saying sorry again
Cause it's you I can't forget
There's something more to this
I know there's something more to this

Would you bleed for me like I'd bleed for you?
Would you tear your heart open?
Tell me the truth
Would you bleed for me like I'd bleed for you?
Even if I was broken, broken like you

I miss the taste of your lips
Feeling your breath on my skin
Remember everything
I remember everything
I hope one day things can change
Cause you're worth all of the pain
I keep on holding on
I just keep on holding on

Would you bleed for me like I'd bleed for you?
Would you tear your heart open?
Tell me the truth
Would you bleed for me like I'd bleed for you?
Even if I was broken, broken like you

Somebody save me
I feel like I'm on my own
Even when I'm alone with you
Somebody save me
When you hold me in your arms
I don't know if I belong with you

Would you bleed for me like I'd bleed for you?
Would you tear your heart open?
Tell me the truth
Would you bleed for me like I'd bleed for you?
Even if I was broken, broken like you
Would you bleed for me like I'd bleed for you?
Would you tear your heart open?
Tell me the truth (Tell me the truth)
Would you bleed for me like I'd bleed for you?
(Like I'd bleed for you)
Even if I was broken, broken like you
