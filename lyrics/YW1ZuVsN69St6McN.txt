I kinda used you.
I kind of used you too.
I wanted to go out so badly I just said yes to anybody.

I'm crawling on my hands and knees like an infant
If I plead for my life will you give me forgiveness, baby?
I ain't got no money, I ain't got no job, I ain't got no flowers,
But I got the power
I got the power, I got the power,
I got the power, I got pow-
Baby I got the power

(It takes two to make a thing go right)
(It takes two to make it outta sight)
(I got the power!)
(It takes two to make a thing go right)
(It takes two to make it outta sight)
(I got the power!)
(It takes two to make a thing go right)
(It takes two to make it outta sight)
(I got the power!)
(It takes two to make it outta sight)
(It takes two to make it outta sight)
(It takes two to make it outta sight)
(It takes two to make a thing go-)

Say you'll never do to me
What I did to you
What I had to do

Baby talk, baby leave
You've got me on my fucking knees
You're bringing back memories
Say you'll never do to me
(It takes two to make a thing go right)
Baby talk, baby leave
(Baby talk, baby leave)
You've got me on my fucking knees
(Got me on my fucking knees)
Bringing back memories
Say you'll never do to me
What I did to you

(It takes two to make a thing go right)
(It takes two to make it outta sight)
(I got the power!)
(It takes two to make a thing go right)
(It takes two to make it outta sight)
(I got the power!)
(It takes two to make a thing go right)
(It takes two to make it outta sight)
(I got the power!)
