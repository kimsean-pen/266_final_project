Your love is nothing I can't fight
Can't sleep with the man who dims my shine

I'm in the bedroom with tissues, and when
I know you're outside banging, then I won't let you in
'Cause it's a hard life with love in the world
And I'm a hard girl, loving me is like chewing on pearls

You've got me wondering why I
I like it rough, I, I like it rough, I, I like it rough
You've got me wondering why I
I like it rough, I, I like it rough, I, I like it rough

Won't go without my fix tonight
It's a little too rough
Prom girl wipes her tears with silver lines
And she can't get enough

I'm in the bedroom with tissues, and when
I know you're outside banging, then I won't let you in
'Cause it's a hard life with love in the world
And I'm a hard girl, loving me is like straightening curls

You've got me wondering why I
I like it rough, I, I like it rough, I, I like it rough
You've got me wondering why I
I like it rough, I, I like it rough, I, I like it rough

I'm shiny and I know it
Don't know why you wanna blow it
Need a man who likes it rough, likes it rough
Likes it rough (baby, likes it rough)

I'm shiny and I know it
Don't know why you wanna blow it
Need a man who likes it rough, likes it rough
Likes it rough (baby, likes it rough)

(I'm shiny and...)
Is it 'cause you don't mean it?
Or because I don't feel it?
Unless it's rough (baby, likes it rough)

(I'm shiny and...)
Is it 'cause you don't mean it?
Or because I don't feel it?
Unless it's rough

You've got me wondering why I
I like it rough, I, I like it rough, I, I like it rough
You've got me wondering why I
I like it rough, I, I like it rough, I, I like it rough

You've got me wondering why I
I like it rough, I, I like it rough, I, I like it rough
You've got me wondering why I
I like it rough, I, I like it rough, I, I like it rough
