The roads are the dustiest
The winds are the gustiest
The gates are the rustiest
The pies are the crustiest
The songs the lustiest
The friends the trustiest
Way back home (Back home)

The trees are the sappiest
The days are the nappiest
The dogs are the yappiest
The kids are the scrappiest
The jokes the snappiest
The folks the happiest
Way back home

Don't know why I left the homestead
I really must confess
I'm a weary exile
Singing my song of loneliness

The grass is the springiest
The bees are the stingiest
The birds are the wingiest
The bells are the ringiest (The hearts?)
The hearts the singiest (The arms?)
The arms the clingiest
Way back home

(What about the sun?)
The sun's the blaziest (And the fields?)
Field's the daisiest (And the cows?)
Cows the graziest (And the help?)
The help's the laziest
The boys (are the wittiest)
The girls (are the prettiest)
Way back home

(The pigs are the snootiest)
(The owls are the hootiest)
The plants the fruitiest
Stars the shootiest
(The grins the funniest)
The smiles the sunniest
Way back home

Don't know why I left the homestead
I really must confess
I'm a weary exile
Singing my song of loneliness

The food is the spreadiest
The wine is the headiest
The pals are the readiest
The gals are the steadiest
The love the liveliest
The life the loveliest
Way back
Way back
Way back home (No place like home)
Sweet home
