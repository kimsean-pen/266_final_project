Open your mouth wide
The universal sigh
And while the ocean blooms
It's what keeps me alive

So I lose and start over
Don't blow your mind with why

I'm moving out of orbit
(Turning in somersaults)
Turning in somersaults

(I dive into those eyes)
I giant turtles eyes
(A jellyfish swims by)
A jellyfish go by

It's what keeps me alive
