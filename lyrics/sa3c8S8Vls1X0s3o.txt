You know I can't stay long where I don't belong, where I know it's wrong.
And I cannot believe what I don't believe—I don't believe.
And though the sky is long, I want to go on an aeroplane.
I want to go where I've never been.
I want to know of you everything.
Oh my darling, give me wings so I can up and leave.
There are other places meant for me.
And though the sky is long, there's somewhere I belong—I know I belong.
Can't keep moving on, because there's something wrong with it.
Can't keep moving on, but I want to go on an aeroplane.
I want to go where I've never been.
I want to know of you everything.
Oh my darling, give me wings.
