It always seems to be the same
I'm hating everything again
Your words get underneath my skin
These thoughts are tormenting my head
(By now) I thought I'd be stronger
(By now) I thought I'd be wiser
(By now) I thought I could be
Everything you wanted me to be
In too deep
If I could breathe in free me from the inside
I could hold on for one more day alive
If I could breathe in free me from the inside
I could hold on for one more day alive
I'm out of time and you're still wrong
My soul was there for the taking
You needed innocent blood
Lost between sleeping and waking
Nothing is ever enough
By now
I thought I'd be better
I thought I'd be farther
But now
I'm questioning my every move till I get there
You made me weak
If I could breathe in free me from the inside
I could hold on for one more day alive
If I could breathe in free me from the inside
I could hold on for one more day alive
I'm out of time and you're still wrong
(And you're still wrong)
(And you're still)
(And you're still wrong)
(And you're still wrong)
(And you're still)
The sun will rise again
If I get through the night (If I get through the night)
The sun will rise again
If I get through the night (Night)
So I'll fight tonight
I'll fight tonight
Go
If I could breathe in free me from the inside
I could hold on for one more day alive
If I could breathe in free me from the inside
I could hold on for one more day alive
I'm out of time and you're still wrong
And you're still wrong
And you're still wrong
I thought I'd be better
I thought I'd be farther
But now
You're wrong
You're wrong
You're still wrong
