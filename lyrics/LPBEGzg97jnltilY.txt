it's not this life, it's these dreams that bring down,
the me inside but maybe tonight I'll get the story right,
I saw you smiling with him,
hurt to watch but helped me understand,
this life isn't your friend

it's just I wish sometimes dreaming was as real,
as this feeling since i left you, I'll be back to new

you tell me that you're lonely, you tell me something isn't working out right,
I ask you to be honest, make a promise, tell me that we'll work this out right

excuse me miss, I read lips, you might want
to take a step on back and look at your tracks

because I wish sometimes dreaming was as real,
as this feeling since i left you, i'll be back to new

you tell me that you're lonely,
you tell me something isn't working out right,
I ask you to be honest, make a promise, tell me that we'll work this out right

there's not a day my weekend starts, no,
I've been on the run since I was five,
when the playground was all I had to discover life,
open your eyes

it's just I wish sometimes dreaming was as real,
as this feeling since i left you, I'll be back to new

you tell me that you're lonely, you tell me something isn't working out right,
I ask you to be honest, make a promise, tell me that we'll work this out
you tell me that you're lonely, you tell me something isn't working out right,
I ask you to be honest, make a promise, tell me that we'll work this out right
