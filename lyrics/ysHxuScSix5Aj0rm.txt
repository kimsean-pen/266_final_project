you settled into uneasy sleep, a subtle hint that things were changing
and every breath of labored rest brought new designs of old regrets.

and how they aged you! how they took your strength away!
(when they entered your body and pinned fear to weight)

pull out! pull out!
lead you weak cells to oxygen, and sew your skin to bone.
you can hold on! hold on!
lend dead weight to stronger hands.
you are not alone.
(you are not alone)
if you're weighed down, i'll lay your fears to rest
you are safe now.
(you are safe now)
