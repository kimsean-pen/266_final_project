Hold me, plain tee
Desert boots and white jeans, so clean

Old ways, long days
Lost inside my own maze, manmade

My own timezone
Life lived through some smartphone, full grown

Clean life, ex wife
Treats me like some dull knife
That ain't right

My privilege is done
I don't know that I can make a difference
My privilege is done
I don't know that I can make a difference

Old pain, no name
It's not hard to lay blame, blame game

Way back, white black
How'd we get so sidetracked?
There's no slack

Lives crush, your sweet touch
Ignorant of so much, as hates clutch

Unfair, my share
Is this just class warfare?
Our fare share?

White privilege is dark
I don't know that I can make a difference
White privilege is dark
I've always thought love can make a difference

My life, off white
Brought up by my own type, ain't right

First class, near passed
Life lived through some wine glass
That's so crass

New me, I'm so free
Free from all my history
There's no mystery

Sure love, no love
That's what we're in need of, real love
