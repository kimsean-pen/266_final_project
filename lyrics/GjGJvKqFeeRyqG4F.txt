We felt like one until you ran away
Now we're just like strangers
Our paths they have strayed
And here I wonder
Where it all went wrong
Cause we were gonna change the world
Why did we have to lose it all?
I'm waiting
I'll keep on waiting for you
(cause what we had was true)
I'm waiting, keep on waiting, only for you
(no matter what you do)
Run away
Should have stayed
Run away
Should have stayed
Run away, run away
Waiting, waiting for you
I keep on waiting, waiting for you
I still remember the things you would say
Like a bedtime story that time washed away
And now I wonder
Where it all went wrong
I'm trying just to find the rule
So I wanna let you know
I'm waiting
I'll keep on waiting for you
(cause what we had was true)
I'm waiting, keep on waiting, only for you
(no matter what you do)
Run away
Should have stayed
Run away
Should have stayed
Run away, run away
As I close my eyes I see
A dream of you and me
I wake up you disappear
I'm waiting
I'll keep on waiting for you
I'm waiting
I'll keep on waiting for you
(no matter what you do)
I'm waiting
I'll keep on waiting for you
(cause what we had was true)
I'm waiting, keep on waiting, only for you
(no matter what you do)
Run away
Should have stayed
Run away
Should have stayed
Run away, Run away
Run away
Should have stayed
Run away
Should have stayed
Run away, Run away
I'm waiting
I'm waiting
I'm waiting
I'm waiting
