Though you'll find me lost in the streets
winding through the ivy gates.
You might be the one to three,
gazing with solemnity.
Timely passing slips around,
soon you'll take me far from sound.
Bound but laying willingly,
deep in what could never be.

Now with evening darkening,
comes the truth with reckoning.
Over time you'll turn to me,
hoping for tranquility.
Wearied peace in what we saw,
hardly chastening at all.
Wayward wiles and the silent line,
with daylight you will be mine.

My imagination
is free
I'm taking tonight
for me
I'm pulling the knife
out on three
You'll see my rabid eyes
as you bleed

Whisper me with something sweet.
Comb your hair if you're at my feet.
Walk in time at an even pace.
Sit so still when you're near my face.
Feel me here when I tell you to.
Call me this when I speak to you.
Keep this straight and stay in line.
All of this will now be mine.

My imagination
is free
I'm taking tonight
for me
I'm pulling out the knife
on three
You'll see my rabid eyes
as you bleed
