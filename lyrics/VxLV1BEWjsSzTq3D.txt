I'll kiss you with my starblood
I'll kiss you with my starblood
I'll kiss you with my starblood
I'll kiss you with my starblood

My wound is deep and may never be mended
You never received the love that i sent

I'll kiss you with my starblood
I'll kiss you with my starblood
I'll kiss you with my starblood
I'll kiss you with my starblood

Our love is mortal and it seems so short
And it feels no dream
I could believe it's no dream
But it seems it's getting shorter
Still i could believe it's no dream
Cos it gleams on the water
Yeah it gleams, yeah it gleams

Oh ...
I'll kiss you with my starblood
I'll kiss you with my starblood
I'll kiss you with my starblood
I'll kiss you with my starblood
My wound is deep and may never be mended
But my love is deep
And i'll kiss you with my starblood.
