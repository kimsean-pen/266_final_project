There ain't no grave can hold my body down
There ain't no grave can hold my body down
When I hear that trumpet sound
I'm gonna rise right out of the ground

Ain't no grave can hold my body down
Well, look way down the river
What do you think I see?
I see a band of angels and they're coming after me

Ain't no grave can hold my body down
There ain't no grave can hold my body down
Well, look down yonder Gabriel
put your feet on the land and sea

But Gabriel don't you blow your trumpet 'til you hear it from me
There ain't no grave can hold my body down
Ain't no grave can hold my body down
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me, meet me in the middle of the air

And if these wings don't fail me
I will meet you anywhere
Ain't no grave can hold my body down
There ain't no grave can hold my body down
Well, meet me mother and father, meet me down the river road
And momma you know that I'll be there when I check in my load
Ain't no grave can hold my body down
There ain't no grave can hold my body down
There ain't no grave can hold my body down
