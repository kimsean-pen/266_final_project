Well I was sick and dangerous
I am the queen of bass
and I was suffering
but I was a regular

Bored to death
then i was luck i was arrested
I would make an arrest
I threw the blood spots
across the moon

I was just bones
yeah i barely tried
they always cut my head off

My life in blood
if you come on back
maybe i'd scream
I'd take one last shot
but my one and only
left me here to die
I was a goldmine
I was cult
I was too kind
I was too kind
I was a goldmine
