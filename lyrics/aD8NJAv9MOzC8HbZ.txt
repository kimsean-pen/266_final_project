My whole life
I would watch as you burn
That last drag, a storm fills your lungs
Rotting your core
As the ashes fall off your tounge
Too tough to feel the heat
This genocide stick you feed
Corrupting the minds
Of our Brothers
Our Mothers and our Fathers

It's times like these
That keep us alive
Building us up
While our world dies
It's days like these
We need to survive
Building up the world
With our own cries

Breathing in the bullet
Bleeding out the agony
Letting go is cold
When you're rotting away
Release these shackles
Binding your lips to the thought
That you can't live without
Your life never felt so selfless

It's times like these
That keep us alive
Building us up
While our world dies
It's days like these
We need to survive
Building up the world
With our own cries

Keep us alive
While our world dies

We can't blame you
We can see you
We know your intentions
We can see through the tension
We can see you fighting
We can see you trying

We all die
Maybe from our own volition
