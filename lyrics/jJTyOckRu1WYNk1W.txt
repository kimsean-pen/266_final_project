I know the light ain't always upon me
Sometimes the night takes me inside it
Destiny, destiny

Gimme something I've been wanting
Take my feelings to the sky
Gimme something, I've been wondering
Give my feelings wings to fly
Destiny, is to be by your side

You are the light shining beside me
I need you by all night and all day
Destiny, destiny

Gimme something I've been wanting
Take my feelings to the sky
Gimme something, I've been wondering
Give my feelings wings to fly
Destiny, is to be by your side
