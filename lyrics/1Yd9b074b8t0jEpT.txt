I know I've seen your face somewhere
Selling something, some big idea
I know I've seen that vacant stare
Selling sunsets for somebody else

You find yourself asking yourself
What is any of it worth
You find yourself looking up at night
From the bottom of the earth

And no, can this world not afford to sleep anymore?
And no, did your sheep start jumping?
They grow out their teeth
Did they need a little something more, than this?

The taste of trouble on your lips
'Cause now they're biting at your thoughts
You tell yourself just to turn away
But you know you've already lost

The smell of rain with the song of wind
Can never be paid in full
You try in vain to account fort this mess
And everything that you stole

(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
And oh, can this world not afford to sleep anymore?
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
And oh, did your sheep start jumping?
They grow out their teeth
Did they need little something more (ooh ooh ooh ooh) than this?

'Cause now they're biting at your feet
They got you running form this place
Now they're breathing down your neck
Your eyes look lonely in your face

I see you looking just out of frame
What is appalling you there?
'Cause things can never stay the same
So what is keeping you here?

(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
And oh, can this world not afford to sleep anymore?
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
And oh, did your sheep start jumping?
They grow out their teeth
Did they need little something now

Every time you think, well, they'll be biting at your thoughts
And every time you blink, well, you'll be so damn far
But you are more (ooh ooh ooh ooh) than this
I know I've seen your face somewhere
