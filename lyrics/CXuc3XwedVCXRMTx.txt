The window opens
I hear the toddling waves
I think about the soldiers
I think about the interstates

I would like to leave it all
Just for a week or two
Maybe I'd see it in clarity
Whatever I would see

It's all so confusing
I don't know where I stand
I could be anything
But not yours on demand

I would like to leave it all
If I only could
Maybe I'd see it in clarity
If I'd see anything at all

But the birds they are singing
That sweet and lonesome song
Oh, mother, oh, brother
Take me home today

You may call me irresponsible
Or even carefree
But it's not the way I
Intended to be

I would like to stay here
And not say a word
Maybe I'd see it in clarity
Or I'll see nothing at all

But the wolfs they are howling
That sweet but haunted song
Oh, father, oh, sister
Take me home today
