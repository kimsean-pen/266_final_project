You said that I wasn't pretty
So I just believed you
And you said that I wasn't special
So I lived that way
With critical gazes and brutal amazement
And how my reflection could be so imperfect
With all of my blemishes, how could somebody want me?

But God loves ugly
He doesn't see the way I see
Oh God takes ugly
And turns it into something that is beautiful
Apparently I'm beautiful
'Cause you love me
Whoa, oh

I tried to clean up the outside
All shiny and new
Worked over time to thin up and look right
But inside I knew
That deep in the bottom were secrets I thought I could try to ignore
Old ghosts in my corridors
Never get tired of haunting the past that's in me

But God loves ugly
He doesn't see the way I see
Oh God takes ugly
And turns it into something that is beautiful
Apparently I'm beautiful
'Cause you love me

Help me believe
Why you love me
When I know you see
You see everything
Help me believe
Why you love me

When I know you see
Inside and you still say I'm beautiful
You're telling me I'm beautiful
You're screaming out I'm so beautiful
And I'm finding out I'm beautiful
You're making me so beautiful
And I can see I'm beautiful
'Cause you love me
Whoa, oh
