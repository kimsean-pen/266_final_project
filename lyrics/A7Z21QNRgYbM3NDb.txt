(Get up on your feet and do the Funky Alfonzo)

Father Bivion O'Blivion
Was blending in his crock
Was whipping up the batter
For the pancakes of his flock
He was looking rather bleary
He forgot to watch the clock

But the night before
Behind the door
A leprechaun had stroked it

But the night before
Behind the door
A leprechaun had slowly storked it
He slowly stroked it

But the night before
Behind the door
A leprechaun had stroked his spot
He stroked his spot

It set him off in such a frenzy
He sang "Lock Around the Crock!"

And he topped it off with a ...
And he topped it off with a ...
And he topped it off with a ...

oo ooo ooo
oo ooo ooo
oo ooo ooo

As he stumbled on his ...
He was delighted as it stiffened
And ripped right through his sock

"Oh St. Alfonzo would be proud of me"
He shouted down the block

Dominus vobiscum
Et cum spiritu two oh
Don't you eat my sleazy pancakes
Just for Saintly Alphonzo

They're so light and fluffy white
We'll raise a fortune by tonight
They're so light and fluffy white
We'll raise a fortune by tonight
They're so light and fluffy brown
They're the finest in the town
They're so light and fluffy brown
They're the finest in the town

Good morning your highness
oo oo ooo
Good gosh, you're sumptuous
oo oo ooo

Good morning your highness
oo oo ooo
Good gosh, you're sumptuous
oo oo ooo
