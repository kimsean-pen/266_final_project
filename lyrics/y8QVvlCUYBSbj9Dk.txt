I'm just fifteen and here's my story
It ends too soon, for that I'm sorry
No warning sign, next thing
I'm lying in my blood in the rain

Just another TV show distracts me
They're laying flowers where they shot me
I don't know what it is I gotta do,
Got lost on the way

Oh yeah, it's chaos from the top down
It's just another lot of cop-outs
They're saying nothing,
Power tripping egos,
Yet there's no change

Oh yeah, it's chaos from the top down
And now I see I've just been shot down
I got no voice, I got no choice,
You don't hear one word I say

Gonna rob another home
And steal another phone
And lose my soul now,
Yeah lose my soul now
Get out of my brain to numb the pain
What's left to save now?
What's left to save now?

Too much too little, too much to stand it
Got nothing to prove,
Got nothing to lose,
Can't understand it
I take my time, next thing
I'm lying in my blood in the rain

Too much too little,
Too young to stand it
Got nothing to prove,
Nothing to lose,
I just can't stand it
Oh no

Have you got my number?
You don't know me
Have you got my number?
Yeah? But you don't own me

Oh yeah, it's chaos from the top down
It's just another lot of cop-outs
They're saying nothing, power tripping egos,
Yet there's no change

Oh yeah, it's chaos from the top down
And now I see
I've just been shot down
I got no voice,
I got no choice,
You don't hear one word I say
