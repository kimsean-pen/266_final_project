Ay yi yi yi yi yi...
Yeah yeah yeah...
Ay yi yi yi yi yi...
Yeah yeah yeah...

I was too afraid right from the start
To even let you, welcome in my heart
You cut it deep and left it bleeding hard
Will I ever heal these painful scars?

I just can't help it
I'm out of breath, I'm trying to find the words to say
Time passed by
Now it's broad daylight

I knew you will come with the speed of light
You're my everything, all that I need
You shut down my dreams, but I'm not gonna cry
You live within me, that's why I am alive

I am alive, 'cause you are my life
You are my sun
I am alive, 'cause you are my life

Ay yi yi yi yi yi...
Yeah yeah yeah yeah...
Ay yi yi yi yi yi...
Yeah yeah yeah...

You name is printed crystal clear on glass
From all the sighs coming out my breath
I'm blinded by this love, can't stop screaming out your name so loud
Where are you at? Baby, won't you come back?

(Baby, please come back)
(Baby, please come back)
(Baby, please come back)

I knew you will come with the speed of light
You're my everything, all that I need
You shut down my dreams, but I'm not gonna cry
You live within me, that's why I am alive

I am alive, 'cause you are my life
You are my sun
I am alive, 'cause you are my life
Yeah...

(I know you will come with the speed of light)
You're my everything, you're all that I need
You shut down my dreams, but I'm not gonna cry
You live within me, that's why I'm alive

I am alive, 'cause you are my life
You are my sun
I am alive, 'cause you are my life

(Ay yi yi yi yi yi...)
(Yeah yeah yeah...) You are my life
