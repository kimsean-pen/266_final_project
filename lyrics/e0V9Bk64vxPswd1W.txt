In the depths of my mind I laid sleepin'
Well, I had such a dream when I woke I was weepin'
The vision I saw danced around me
And my heart saw the things that my eyes couldn't see

Oh, the sun crashed down to the ground
The moon rose up to the sky, blood-red
All the dead climbed up out from their graves
They fell to their knees as the stars started screamin'

Come one - come all - come see it, believe it
The truth - will shine if you open you eyes
And you'll see - it move as it moves on the masses
The weak - will rise and give birth to the sky
... the sky

No, it didn't stop there, it consumed me
And it crushed me with joy as it's beauty swept through me
I was moved by the weight of it all
I'd been touched by the light, yes I know what I saw

Oh, the sun crashed down to the ground
The moon rose up to the sky, blood-red
All the dead climbed up out from their graves
They fell to their knees as the stars started screamin'

Come one - come all - come see it, believe it
The truth - will shine if you open you eyes
And you'll see - it move as it moves on the masses
The weak - will rise and give birth to the sky
... the sky

Ha, ha, ha

I saw the demons dreamin'
I heard people singin'
The dinosaurs are dyin'
The mind control's subsidin'
I saw a new path beatin'
Free thinkers freely thinkin'
Can't stop a thought from breathin'
It moves like fire

The sun crashed down to the ground
The moon rose up to the sky, blood-red
All the dead climbed up out from their graves
They fell to their knees as the stars started screamin'

Come one - come all - come see it, believe it
The truth - will shine if you open you eyes
And you'll see - it move as it moves on the masses
The weak - will rise and give birth to the sky

... the sky
