Get down, deeper and down
Down down, deeper and down
Down down, deeper and down
Get down, deeper and down
I want all the world to see
To see you're laughing
And you're laughing at me
I can take it all from you
Again, again, again, again, again, again, again
Deeper and down
Down down, deeper and down
Down down, deeper and down
Down down, deeper and down
Get down, deeper and down
I have all the ways you see
To keep you guessing
Stop your messing with me
You'll be back to find your way
Again, again, again, again, again, again, again
Deeper and down
Down down, deeper and down
Down down, deeper and down
Down down, deeper and down
Get down
Get down, deeper and down
Down down, deeper and down
Down down, deeper and down
Get down, deeper and down
I have found out you see
I know what you're doing
What you're doing to me
I'll keep on and say to you
Again, again, again, again, again, again, again
Deeper and down
Down down, deeper and down
Down down, deeper and down
Down down, deeper and down
Get down
