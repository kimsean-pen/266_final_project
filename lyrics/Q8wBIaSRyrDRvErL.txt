Let's go back, let's go back to the start
Let's begin at the end, when you tore me apart
You didn't try, didn't try, to make me cry
But I bawled like a baby when you said, "goodbye"
When you said, "goodbye"

And I've been replaying the same song for six
weeks trying to figure out what you're feeling
And I've been replaying the same song for six
weeks trying to find a piece of your heartbeat
Can we go back? Can we go back? Can we go back?
Can we go back? Can we go back? Can we go back?
Can we go back? Can we go back? Can we go back?

Sittin' back, sittin' back, in the backseat of your car
So when we went 'round corners
I could lean a little closer into your shoulder
I have a heart attack every time
you get up, get up, get up, get up, oh
'Cause you said you'll be back soon
But the other ones said that too

I've been replaying the same song for
six weeks trying to find a piece of you
I've been replaying the same song on
repeat trying to find a piece of you
Can we go back? Can we go back? Can we go back?
Can we go back? Can we go back? Can we go back?

I've been replaying the same song for six
weeks trying to find a piece of your heartbeat
I've been replaying the same song for
six weeks trying to find a piece of you
Can we go back? Can we go back? Can we go back?
Can we go back? Can we go back? Can we go back?
