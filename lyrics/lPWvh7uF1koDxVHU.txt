You're my knight in shining armour

Chase the devil and the dragons away.
From manana to manana do I am love you
Yes I do do.
Storm or sun - you're the only one
And this is how I feel.

Rain or shine - you'll always be one in a million

My fantasy come true.
Rain or shine - it's you and me

Cut me a heart on a tree and say
It's for ever
Not a year and a day.

Robin Hood and Major Tom -
All the super heroes rolled into one.
Kiss away my sad and lonelies
Do I am love you
Yes I do do.
Silk and steel
That's the way you feel

And how I love you now!

Rain or shine - you'll always be one in a million

My fantasy come true. . .
How I love you still!
How I love you now - how I love you now!

Rain or shine - you'll always be one in a million

My fantasy come true.
Rain or shine - it's you and me

Cut me a heart on a tree and say
From me to you -

Rain - shine - rain - shine -
Rain or shine - you'll always be one in a million

My fantasy come true.
Rain or shine - it's you and me -
Rain or shine - rain or shine - rain or shine - rain or shine.
