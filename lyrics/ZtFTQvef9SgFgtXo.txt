It was Cinco de Mayo
Pillow case on his head
No more breathing time
An ambulance sped
It sped 'round every corner
Calling out his name

Shot a rabbit from the back seat window
Sat and watched the summer corn grow
Ate icecream in a desert dream
Got lost in father's singing
Too hot inside, to hot outside
Lazy days when I said let's go for a ride
We'll sail on Spirit Lake
Me, my pappy, and his Lemonade

Tim and Tina were my parents' names
They got engaged, they were inflamed
Seduced by the light of butterflies
How they shimmer, how they glimmer
Those butterflies

We seven kids, we almost died
Nearly put to death
By lightning strike
Instead there was hot pink
flashes in the sky
We climbed the rocks in snow and rain
In search of magic power

To heal our mother's pain

Shot a rabbit from the back seat window
Sat and watched in the summer corn row
Ate icecream in a desert dream
Got lost in father's singing
Too hot inside, to hot outside
Lazy days when I said let's go for a ride
We'll sail on Spirit Lake
Me, my pappy, and his Lemonade
