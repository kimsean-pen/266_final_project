In a burning building
I was boiling over
With a head of ashes
On a bed of stone

Oh, can you hear me now?
Oh, don't hurt me now

In the velvet calm
Willling undone
I placed my heart on the table
When the fire comes

Oh, don't hurt me now
Oh, don't hurt me now

Have I become
Willing undone?
You put the temple
Into the ground

Oh, don't hurt me now
Oh, don't hurt, me, now

In the velvet calm
Had I known the hour
What I would have done their bidding
What would I have done?
Had I had a hundred fathers
Had I been a king
How would I have gone
