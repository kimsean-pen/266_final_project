So many plans we made were washed away
So many memories faded away
Honestly I didn't know it was ending

We count the calendar, checking off the days
We look ahead, they laugh at the plans we made
Honestly I didn't know it was ending

We don't know what the future holds

Wish I had a time machine
So you would never have to leave
And I would never have to say sorry
But now we're running on a picture-perfect memory
Of all the things I couldn't say
And I would never have to say sorry that I couldn't save you

Oh

Under the lights we sang all our favorite songs
We thought the days went dry, somehow we were wrong
Honestly I hope I never remember
(Under the lights we sang all our favorite songs)

We don't know (don't know, don't know)
What the future holds

Wish I had a time machine
(Just to wash away)
So you would never have to leave
And I would never have to say sorry
But now we're running on a picture-perfect memory
(We can run away)
Of all the things I couldn't say
And I would never have to say sorry that I couldn't save you

Oh

This life is taking forever
(Under the lights we sang all our favorite songs)
I never want to remember

Later in the dark with the shades pulled down
I wait for the part where you bleed me out again
I never want to remember (again, again, again)
(Again, again, again)

Later in the dark with the shades pulled down

And I would never have to say sorry
But now we're running on a picture-perfect memory
(We cant run away)
