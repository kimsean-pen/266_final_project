Fade in on a girl
With a hunger for fame
And a face and a name to remember
The past fades away
Because as of this day
Norma Jean's gone
She's moving on
Her smile and your fantasies play a duet
That will make you forget
Where you are
The music starts playing
It's the beat of her heart saying
"Let me be your star!"
Flash back to a girl
With a song in her heart
As she's waiting to start the adventure
The fire and drive
That make dreams come alive
They fill her soul
She's in control
The drama, the laughter
The tears just like pearls
Well they're all in this girls repertoire
It's all for the taking
And it's magic will be making
Let me be your star
I just have to forget the hurt that came before
Forget what use to be
The past is on the cutting room floor
The future is here, with me
Choose me!
Fade up on a star
With it all in her sights
All the love and the lights that surround her. Someday she'll think twice
Of the dues and the price
She'll have to pay (She'll have to pay)
But not today... (But not today...)
Then she'll do all she can
For the love of one man
And for millions who love from afar
I'm what you've been needing
It's all here and my heart's pleading
"Let me be your star!"
