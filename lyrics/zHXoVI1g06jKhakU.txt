You're not fair, telling me
You faked every orgasm, you've had with me
That's just fine, now it's over
And I'm out here banging my head

You're not fair, telling me
You faked every orgasm, you've had with me
That's just fine, now it's over
And I'm out here banging my head

After all the dancing
And spilling beer all over the place
I lie out here in disgrace

You've had your fun
Kissed some bloke you shouldn't have
Right in front of me
Punched him to the floor

I could have killed him there
But I got thrown out
I'll get him some other time
When he least expects it
