And I know you love me
Even when you can't say
it like you mean it
Even when your words fail,
I still can feel it

And I know you love me
Even when you can't say it
Like you mean it
Even when your words fail,
I still can feel it

And I'm laying at your feet again
I'm just laying at your feet again

They say that love is for the young,
Well I'm getting older
Brushed past your lips,
I'm barely sober
How could it be so, the world
Could stop spinning,
I wouldn't know?
You're crazy. Just turn
Around and carry on
But no one has ever seen my
Soul unfettered the way you are
I'll be tangled here forevermore

I'm laying at your feet again
I'm laying at your feet again
I'm just laying at your feet again

And I know you love me
Even when you can't say
it like you mean it
Even when your words fail,
I still can feel it

As above, so alone
So alone

As above, so alone
So alone

As above, so alone
So alone

It's crazy
I wake but layers of a dream
Lay over everyone I see
But how is it so, my world
Looks different now
But no one knows?

And I'm laying at your feet again
I'm laying at your feet again
I'm just laying at your feet again

(I'm laying at your feet again)
(I'm just laying at your feet again)

As above, so alone
So alone

As above, so alone
So alone

As above, so alone
So alone
