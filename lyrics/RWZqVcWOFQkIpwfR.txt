I could hear her breathing,
No one believed me,
No one believed me.
I could hear those voices,
So deceiving,
So deceiving.

Cool wind on my face
Cool wind on my face

Do you know how it feels to be afraid
Lying there frozen
With my eyes wide open?
Do you know how it feels to find a trace
Of words unspoken
With my eyes wide open?
I know your secret

I can feel you calling,
I know that you're there,
I know that you're there.
Tell me all your memories,
I'll keep them alive,
I'll keep them alive.

Cool wind on my face
Cool wind on my face

Do you know how it feels to be afraid
Lying there frozen
With my eyes wide open?
Do you know how it feels to find a trace
Of words unspoken
With my eyes wide open?
I know your secret

I heard you
I felt you
I know, so what do you want from me?

Cool wind on my face
Cool wind on my face
Cool wind on my face
Cool wind on my face

Do you know how it feels to be afraid
Lying there frozen
With my eyes wide open?
Do you know how it feels to find a trace
Of words unspoken
With my eyes wide open?
I know your secret
