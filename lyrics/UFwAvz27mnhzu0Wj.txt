Keep in absence of truth
My smile within this hollow
Trust in me like I trust this noose
You will never find out why

Fire bleeding from this picture of you
Hide from this unpleasant
I'd give you the ashes
Only I could find one reason to trust in you

Let me go now
Let go of my hand
Find your own place
I found my promised land

Sink if you will
I'll never comprehend
Sink if you will
I'll never come to your defence

Bury yourself
Inside your phantom pain
All the way down
See how much pity you'll gain

Fight your shadow
In this light you'll go blind
I have seen the face of
He who lurks behind
