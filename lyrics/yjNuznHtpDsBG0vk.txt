I don't like you anymore
Fallen for the phone again
Enticed me for a second time today
Only for me to realise the same

I don't like you anymore
You're cracked and your face is changing
You're going down the old route
But I can't let your repeat, repeat it again
The sound of your voice
Is piercing my patience
As you turn through the midnight corridors

Kindly keeping in your resent
Retire to the setting hate
Drying in an old familiar cast
Twitching as I fear it's far too late

'Cause I don't like you anymore
I don't like you anymore

I don't like you anymore
You're cracked and your face is changing
You're going down the old route
But I can't let you repeat, repeat it again
The sound of your voice
Is piercing my patience
As you turn through the midnight corridors

And there's nothing but corners
There is no escape from these
Walked into your trap and breathed your disease
We're nauseous as if in the seas
And you smirk as you think that you tease
But you pout pushed us about
And your final lie can't be described as fine
Will never be described as fine
