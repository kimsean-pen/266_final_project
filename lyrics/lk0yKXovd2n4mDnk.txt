Homely, thick in mind, never listen
Worn, tired, siren drawn, tunnel vision
Don't forget this chance only live once
Sprung, hypnotized by light, had to get some

Get it all
She said I forgive you
Don't regret our time
You've got to move on love

Angel eyes
Four years and still I dream
Agonize
Such beauty not since seen

Bow down, piper leading, you were one
Hungry, took the prize, then you got dumb
Don't live out your life like a sad song
Sprung, hypnotized by light, had to get some

Get it all
She said I forgive you
You must too or die
You've got to let me go

Angel eyes
Four years and still I dream
Agonize
Such beauty not since seen

Angel eyes
Your face is all I see
Agonize
Forever haunting me
