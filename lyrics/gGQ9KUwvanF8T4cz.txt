You're not in this alone
Let me break this awkward silence
Let me go, go on record, be the first to say I'm sorry, hear me out,
And if you take me down, or would you lay me out
And if the world needs something better, let's give them one more reason
Now, now, now

We walk in single file
We light our rails and punch our time
Ride escalators colder than a cell

This broken city sky like butane on my skin, stolen from my eyes
Hello Angel, tell me where are you
Tell me where we go from here

Tell me we go from...

And in this moment we can't close the lids on burning eyes
Our memories blanket us with friends we know like fallout vapors
Steel corpses stretch out towards an ending sun, scorched and black
It reaches in and tears your flesh apart, as ice cold hands rip into your heart

That's if you've still got one that's left inside that cave you call a chest
And after seeing what we saw, can we still reclaim our innocence
And if the world needs something better, let's give them one more reason now

This broken city sky like butane on my skin, stolen from my eyes
Hello Angel, tell me where are you
Tell me where we go from here

Tell me we go from here
