I met a doctor, he want to be a dancer
I met a mother, she want to be alone
I met a preacher, he want to be sinister
I met a kid, he want to be unknown

Nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong

Sometimes you don't want to live (want to live)
Sometimes you gotta do what you don't want to do

I met a teacher, he want to be a dreamer
I met a sister, she want to meet her maker
I met a poet, he want to be a joke
I met a dog, he just want a bone
