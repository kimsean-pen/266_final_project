I don't see me mad at situations; I see me turn and walk away.
I see a tattoo on my right thigh that I will probably regret one day.
Yeah, I will probably regret it one day.
But I am happy to be bonding in a kitchen with my friends.
A spool of thread, a few more good vibes, a safety pin, and a ball point pen.
A safety pin and a ball point pen.
A safety pin and a ball point pen; a ball point pen.

But there are answers here that I am trying to figure out.
Since all your questions got harder to dodge and dip around.
And there is nothing wrong with my lifestyle no matter how many times I tell myself
to breathe in
hold it, hold it, now let it out.

One day I will realize I don't need this because it is just not who I am.
Until that day comes, I'll keep my eyes closed, and I will try to feel all of the effects.
Yeah I will try to feel all of the effects.
Now I am talking way too fast, and a little louder than I should.
Trying to say thank you for understanding
my side of the story the best that you could.
My side of the story the best that you could.
My side of the story the best that you could. The best that you could.

(whoa oh oh)

And this how the cool boyfriend sits in the passenger seat of his girlfriends car.
He's looking at me.
Oh, I wish the light would turn green.
Set me free, oh, set me free. Oh, set me.
Teach my rolling veins where there's a will there is a way.
Just cut me open. Let me drain. Oh, let me drain. Oh let me drain.

I'll move to Florida.
I'll buy a brand new pick up truck.
I'll tint all the windows including the driver's side.

Now you can't see me
cause you can't touch me.
so I sit in love
and watch your boyfriend wonder if I'm inside.
