Waking up on a Sunday
I've been riding for a night or two
Looking out of the window
I'm so tired another drink will do
I'm just living a story
Like I heard it on a 45
There's no one here to rely on
It's the sign that makes me wonder why

Well I can't get up no more
Though I tried standing in a forest of reasons
Well I can't get up no more
Though I tried standing in a forest of reasons

Driving into the sun light
I've been thinking about a better life
There nothing left to delight in
It's a sign we ain't got it right
Fading out on the highway
California coming into sight
There's no one here to rely on
It's the sign that makes me wonder why

Well I can't get up no more
Though I tried standing in a forest of reasons
Well I can't get up no more
Though I tried standing in a forest of reasons

Like a moth to a candle
Driven to the naked flame
Murder on the news and blood on the streets again

Well I can't get up no more
Though I tried standing in a forest of reasons
Well I can't get up no more
Though I tried standing in a forest of reasons
Standing in a forest of reasons
Standing in a forest of reasons
Standing in a forest of reasons
Standing in a forest of reasons

Standing in a forest of reasons
Standing in a forest of reasons
Standing in a forest of reasons
