They ball-gagged Lady Justice
And blindfolded her so she can't see
The erosion of the people's trust
Of what will come to be an FDIC Assisted Suicide

The depression of a depression
Worldwide suicide for the economy
Caused by the dialectic chaos
When the Mob on Wall Street took "We the People" for a ride

When it's dog eat dog, you are what you eat
Just like the mad dog that bites the hand that feeds
(Like the mad dog that bites the hand that feeds)
Just like the mad dog that bites the hand that feeds

They took everything and anything
As long as it once belonged to me
The rats got all the money
The roaches licked the cupboards clean of TV dinners and beer

This never-ending nightmare
Of the dreams I'll never, ever get to see
And just one silver-bullet to your head
It will set me free from all the life I wasted trusting you

When it's dog eat dog, you are what you eat
Just like the mad dog that bites the hand that feeds
(Like the mad dog that bites the hand that feeds)
When it's dog eat dog, you are what you eat
(Just like the mad dog that bites the hand that feeds)
Just like the mad dog, you bites the hand that feeds
