War is overdue
The time has come for you
To shoot your leaders down
And join forces underground

Lose control
(Losing control)
At increasing pace

Wild and bereft
(Wild and bereft)
Assassin is born
(Assassin is born)

Shoot
Kill your leaders

Oppose and disagree
Destroy demonocracy

Lose control
(Losing control)
At increasing pace

Intend to erase
(Intend to erase)

Whatever they say
(Whatever they say)
These people are torn
(People are torn)
Wild and bereft
(Wild and bereft)
Assassin is born
