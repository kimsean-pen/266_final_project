Life is running past me
Days and hours flew
Like it had no color
Just different shades of blue
I heard about this love thing
But I still need to prove
'Cause I believed in nothing
'Til I believed in you

And I say.
Wo... ooh... wo... ooohh...
You left your fingerprints

All o o... ver my soul

And I caught you out red handed
Knee deep in my heart
When I was upside down
Spinning round and round and round in the dark

Act so sweet but you're guilty as charged
I caught you out red handed

Knee deep in my heart
I never saw it coming
You took me by surprise
'Cause you went undercover
Without an alibi

You done the perfect crime girl
Now I wanna do the time
'Cause I got no defense but hell

I'm gonna walk the line
And I say.
Wo... ooh... wo... ooohh...
You left your fingerprints

All o o... ver my soul
And I caught you out red handed
Knee deep in my heart
When I was upside down
Spinning round and round and round in the dark
Act so sweet but you're guilty as charged
I caught you out red handed
Knee deep in my heart

Now's the day to sweetest freedom
Now I found I believe in
And I say.
Wo... ooh... wo... ooohh
You left your fingerprints
All over my soul.
My soul.
And I caught you out red handed
Knee deep in my heart
When I was upside down
Spinning round and round and round
And I caught you act red handed
Knee deep in my heart
When I was upside down
Spinning round and round and round in the dark
Act so sweet but you're guilty as charged
I caught you out red handed
Knee deep in my heart
