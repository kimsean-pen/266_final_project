I've got blinded by the lights of the guys in the city
I could easily shut my eyes
I could easily find my sleep
Within less jazz around the block
Nothing to doubt nothing to hide
You were blinded by the lights
I've got blost in the city

Ouuuuuuu
We'll never go back to California
Ouuuuuuu
We'll never go back to California

I've been trying to find a smell
It's not in the country that I miss
I wanted to grab you hand
It was holding on to something
The woman stared into my eyes
I know there was nothing she could find
I thought it would be nice if you promise we'll be fine

Ouuuuuuu
We'll never go back to California
Ouuuuuuu
We'll never go back to California

We'll never go back to California
Ouuuuuuu
We'll never go back to California
Ouuuuuuu...

I'm a liar in a cheat
I know time is on my side
I've got plenty of years to waste
I've got plenty of love to give
Why do I care to spare another life time by the sea
If you're standing there with me then it's where I want to be
