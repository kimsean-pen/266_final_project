By then she'd sang in every bar
And when the world's a nope she'd ask the stars
If they'd ever thought of setting her up
And he was only half a man
He never really watched the news

I guess they fell in love, if you could call it that
And for a couple of years, all smooth things went
But desperate people, they go to desperate measures
But she so badly wanted kids
She said, "it's what I'm meant to do"

And he tells her, all I want to do is stand next to you
All I want to do is stand next to you
Well you need to get on top of me
And do this thing before I'm fifty
And dry as a bone
I may as well be alone
Oh, I hate you so

Oh then we were sitting there
When the doc came in
I gripped my chair, he said
"I'm afraid I have some bad news
Though he'll never be in your arms
He'll always be in your heart"

Oh, if I could only give my breath to you
Watch you crawl around and stand next to you
Oh, if I could only give my breath to you
Watch you crawl around and stand next to you
Oh, if I could only give my breath to you
Watch you crawl around and stand right there next to you

To you, oh da-da-da-da-da-da
Ohhhhhhh, da-da-da-da-da
Ohhhhhhh
Never in my arms, always in my heart
Never in my arms
