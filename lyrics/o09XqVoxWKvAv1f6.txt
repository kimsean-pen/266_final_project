Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
If you knew how many songs
I'd sing on the roof above my dad's garage,
I'd probably quit it,
Singin men in the parks till the sunset
It was Ramadan
Neighbor's rules, played hide and seek,
hid underneath the poly chairs downstairs
Had a swing set on the tree above my window
Don't know which way the wind blows
On the tree above my window
Don't know which way the wind blows anymore anymore
And on the seventh day God made me
On the seventh day maybe God was lazy
Think He had it off but He still called in
If you need a job call think they're hiring
If you not game to sing with gangsters
anxious drink, smoke, vote, or promote violence
Woke up to the sound of old mileage
Car broke down triple A dialed in
But that's when you drove by
Changed my whole life
Breakfast conversate for a whole while
Then we kissed and I haven't left your side since
Together forever, I'll always say goodnight it's love.
If you knew how many songs I'd sing on the roof above my dad's garage,

It was Ramadan,
Neighbor's rules, playin hide and seek,
hid underneath the poly chairs downstairs,
and the swing set on the tree above my window
Don't know which way the wind blows
On the tree above my window
Don't know which way the wind blows anymore anymore
If you pay me when I'm in line
Pay me when it's overtime
I might call you up
If you wait until I get aside
Wait until I come alive
I might call you bluff
If you pay me when I'm in line,
Pay me when it's overtime
I might call you up.
If you wait until I get aside,
Wait until I come alive,
I might call you bluff
On the tree above my window
Don't know which way the wind blows
On the tree above my window
Don't knows which way the wind blows anymore anymore
Do you think what I think?
Do you think what I think?
Don't know which way the wind blows
On the tree above my window
Do you think what I think?
Do you think what I think?
Don't know which way the wind blows anymore anymore.
