You terrify the land, you are pestle and mortar
Your first love's new order, mother nature's son
King of the Everglades, population 1
I write poetry for myself, I write poetry for myself

Oh, baby
Blue eyes

You're a permanent figure of jacked up sorrow
I want you to love me, you send me a coffin of roses
I guess that's the way that things go these days

Take pills, for instance, I heard they're no good for you
"I won't and I never will," she said
"I won't and I never will, I won't and I never will
I won't and I never will, I won't and I never will"
Blue eyes, blue eyes

Oh baby, can't you see they had it in for me?
They had it in for me, they had it in for me
Oh, baby can't you see they had it in for me
(I won't and I never will)
They had it in for me, blue eyes

Oh baby, you got those blue eyes

I sent a message in a bottle to the press
It said, "Don't be ashamed or disgusted with yourselves
Don't be ashamed or disgusted with yourselves
Don't be ashamed or disgusted with yourselves"

"I've thumbed through the books on your shelves
I've thumbed through the books on your shelves
I've thumbed through the books on your shelves
I've thumbed through the books on your shelves"

Blue eyes
