They say that Avalon's playing a dream
Sometimes love just isn't what it seems
(In the garden of love)
Garden of love
(In the garden of love)
Ah, Sunset Boulevard, nightmare dreams
Take this candle off the porcelain scene
(In the garden of love)
Avalon
(In the garden of love)

Grab your favorite sweater, we're in for nasty weather.

In the gardens of Avalon
It's in the garden of Avalon
Oh, in Avalon
It's in the garden of love with you
Oh, Avalon
It's in the garden of Avalon
Avalon, in the garden of love with you.

Grab your favorite sweater, we're in for nasty weather.

In the gardens of Avalon
It's in the garden of Avalon
The garden of love of Avalon
In the garden of love with you
Oh, Avalon
It's in the garden of Avalon
In Avalon
In the garden of love with you.
