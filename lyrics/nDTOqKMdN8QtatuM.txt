We melting ruby hard
Confused and tray
To burn the old
And to shake a blade
And then you swing it low
Begginers faith
To lose a skin
To just grow away

Like a rain to help a river
But a river is so hard
To please
But I've grown to see the diamond
Thrown in just for me

You spend so many nights
Just gathering stones
Silver tears
And old sapphire bones
And all the darker leaves
Them dreamt now true
Look how they find their path
To carve right through

With a rain to help a river
But a river is so hard
To please
But I've grown to see the diamond
Thrown in just for me

Look when you're hopeless
I would figure
There were moments when I was not
Only real a flag and fought out of rock
And with an awful broken air
Send away free for the boat
And your kid will lose a battle
But your ways will let him go

I lose my ways to drown
And aimless flee
And while you're thrown to lose
It's still right here
With me
