My highs are high, my lows are low
And I don't know which way to go
Everytime you leave this house
Everything falls apart

I can' get myself off the couch
I don't wanna talk to anyone else
Everytime you leave this house
Everything falls apart

I lost my job, I miss my mom
I wish my cat could talk
Everytime you leave this house
Everything falls apart

But I don't love you
I don't hate you
I don't know how I feel
But I don't love you
I don't hate you
I don't know how I feel
I don't know how I feel
I don't know how I feel

And nothing makes me happy
Not even TV or a bunch of weed
Everytime you leave this house
Everything falls apart

And everytime you go away I feel like I could cry
But I will never really cry, because
You're the worst at goodbyes
You're the worst at goodbyes
You're the worst at goodbyes

Goodbyes
At goodbyes
Goodbyes
At goodbyes
Goodbyes
At goodbyes
Goodbyes
At goodbyes
