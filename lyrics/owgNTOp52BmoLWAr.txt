If it looks broken
That's just the picture
That's how you know
If it's in focus
Then it's no fun for guys like me

These robots have it wired around here
They'll make slaves of us soon
Canvas the neighborhood

I mean it... watch

Step away
Don't look that close
They could be anywhere
Hid up in the ballast
Down in the basement
Camped out in the bunker
If it should come back
We'll set the tracers
Break it in easy

These robots have it wired around here
These robots have it wired around here
(these robots have it wired around here)
Circuits on babylon
Crackeed up on some lawn
Chasing these scenes
Given a fever
Retless manner
Is it worth your soul?
They might leave tomorrow
They might leave tomorrow
They might leave tomorrow
They might leave tomorrow
