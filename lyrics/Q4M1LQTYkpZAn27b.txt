Oh Nadine
woke up from a dream last night
where all the skies were green
you were the sun
down on the wave
came your daylight
Oh Nadine you were the sun
whistles
Oh Nadine
i can't help have a funny feeling
you'd be good to me
you were in my dream
ooooooaaaahhhh
Oh Nadine
you once had a lovely dream
and woke with pain of loss
you look at the sky
lost in the darkness round in the room
Oh Nadine I'll be there soon
Oh Nadine I'll be there
