I set my sail
Fly, the wind it will take me
Back to my home, sweet home

Lie on my back
Clouds are makin' way for me
I'm comin' home, sweet home

I see your star (Build that wall and)
You left it burning for me (Build it strong 'cause)
Mother, I'm here (We'll be there before too long)

Eyes open wide (I dig my hole, you build a wall)
Feel your heart and it's glowin' (I dig my hole, you build a wall)
I'm welcome home, sweet home (One day that wall is gonna fall)

I take your hand (Gon' build that wall up to the sky)
Now you'll never be lonely (Gon' build that wall up to the sky)
Not when I'm home, sweet home (One day your bird is gonna fly)

I see your star (Build that wall and)
You left it burning for me (Build it strong 'cause)
Mother, I'm here (We'll be there before too long)
