Ohh ohh ohh ohh
I know eventually there will be
True love for you and me

I can feel it in my bones as life on phones (?)
And I know your face is burden twisted memory (?)

So why do I wonder
Wonder
Wonder why

When everything is already
Perfectly aligned

You ain't his (?)
Why
Why
Oh my, oh my.

Perhaps that is why
Perhaps that is why
You're not mine

hmm
ahhh

So for now as I look at my reflection
I'm still holding my own hand
I love him no more than the love that could I ever understand
So it's not so bad
It's not so bad
It's not so bad

Have I ever seen in your eyes
How will I recognize you
Have I ever seen in your eyes
How will I recognize you

So still I wonder
wonder
wonder why

When everything is already
perfectly aligned

You ain't this (?)
Why
Why
Oh my
Oh my

Perhaps that is why
Perhaps that is why
You're not mine

Finally when you are face to face with me
You will say I'm skyfalled
I dive into your world
To then just watch it, how unfair (?)
