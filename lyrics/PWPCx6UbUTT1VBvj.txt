Don't you give up my young, young friends
Here's a story I think will please
How Sir Rastus Bear was in fact redeemed

Redeemed from the cell to which he'd been thrown
By men whose love was more
For the ice and cold

Goblins of surcease, villians of wise
They pranced his brain on through the long, long night
Sir Rastus Bear who'd ever believe
You'd be by a song
Redeemed

Up on the north forty
I'm sure it was Christmas day
When Sir Rastus Bear taught children how to play

Games of life and love
And songs, oh those songs
Oh those deep but true
Hill country songs

Goblins of surcease, villians of wise
They pranced his brain on through the long, long night
Sir Rastus Bear who'd ever believe
You'd be by a song
Redeemed

Redeemed good lord, from the ice and cold
Redeemed from the cell to which I've been thrown
Redeemed by virtue of a country song
And I believe good Lord, it won't be long
won't be long
It won't be
won't be long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-
long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long
