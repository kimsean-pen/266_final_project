Take a seat, right over there
Sat on the stairs, stay or leave
The cabinets are bare and I'm unaware
Of just how we got into this mess
Got so aggressive, I know we meant all good intentions

So pull me closer, Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go, oh baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle, Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle

Take a step, back for a minute
Into the kitchen, Floors are wet and taps are still running
Dishes are broken
How did we get into this mess?
Got so aggressive, I know we meant all good intentions

So pull me closer, why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go, oh Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle

Looking at you, I can't lie
Just pouring out admission
Regardless of my objection
Oh oh, and it's not about my pride
I need you on my skin just come over
Pull me in just, oh baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
Why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle, no Baby

Why don't you just meet me in the middle?
Oh Yeah, i'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
Oh, In the middle
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle baby?
I'm losing my mind just a little, baby
So why don't you just meet me in the middle, middle?
In the middle, middle
