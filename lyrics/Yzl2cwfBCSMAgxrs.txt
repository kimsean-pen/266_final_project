You give my tummy butterflies
You make my heart go wild
Oh, you're such a lovely sight
All mine, and locked up tight

NAKED IN MY CELLAR! NAKED IN MY CELLAR!
NAKED IN MY CELLAR!

You don't need the world outside
It's troubled, and it's boring
You're lucky you have met my kind
I'm caring and adoring

NAKED IN MY CELLAR! NAKED IN MY CELLAR!
NAKED IN MY CELLAR!

Now who's daddy's dirty girl?

Got you naked in my cellar, never let you leave!
You're my doll, and I'm your fella, got much love to give!
Got you naked in my cellar, the wolf so loves the sheep!
Here forever, dungeon dweller, you are mine to keep!

NAKED IN MY CELLAR! NAKED IN MY CELLAR!
NAKED IN MY CELLAR! NAKED IN MY CELLAR!

You were scheming last I came
I can't let you leave me
Why would you want to escape?
You'll be all you can be right here!

NAKED IN MY CELLAR! NAKED IN MY CELLAR!
NAKED IN MY CELLAR!

Oh, you're such a lovely girl!

Got you naked in my cellar, never let you leave!
You're my doll, and I'm your fella, got much love to give!
Got you naked in my cellar, the wolf so loves the sheep!
Here forever, dungeon dweller, you are mine to keep!

NAKED IN MY CELLAR! NAKED IN MY CELLAR!
NAKED IN MY CELLAR! NAKED IN MY CELLAR!

Got you naked in my cellar, never let you leave!
You're my doll, and I'm your fella, got much love to give!
Got you naked in my cellar, the wolf so loves the sheep!
Here forever, dungeon dweller, you are mine to keep!

NAKED IN MY CELLAR! NAKED IN MY CELLAR!
NAKED IN MY CELLAR! NAKED IN MY CELLAR!
