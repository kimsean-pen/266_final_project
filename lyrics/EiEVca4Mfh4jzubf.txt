Firecrackers burned into heaven on the floor
My attackers, it's me it's me it's me you're looking for
July Fourth of last year, we spilled all the blood
How'd you spend your summer days?
I know better now I don't call you up at night
'Cause baby your ghost and I have changed

I saw your face everywhere I looked, you sat across from me
Baby I'm a ghost when you're away
I told you all about my days, you told me where you lived
And we have drunk all our summers away
We have drunk our summers away
Firecrackers burned into heaven on the floor
My attackers, it's me it's me it's me you're looking for

Saturday, maybe you'll come down to see me, we'll walk around
I know better now I don't get as high
That I can't see the leaves turn from green to brown
Firecrackers burned into heaven on the floor
My attackers, it's me it's me it's me you're looking for
Firecrackers burned into heaven on the floor
My attackers, it's me it's me it's me you're looking for
