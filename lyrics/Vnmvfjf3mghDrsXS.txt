Fell in love with the summer
But I'm just blowing in the wind
Fell in love with the darkness
But the truth is hanging in the night
Hanging in the night

We're just having a good time honey
No need to apply, no pressure
We're just having a good time

Darling you give me shelter
From the niose that drowns out the love
And I want to discover
All the things that make you come alive
All the things that make you come alive

We're just having a good time honey
No need to apply, no pressure
We're just having a good time honey
No need to apply, no pressure
We're just having a good time

The truth is hanging in the night

We're just having a good time honey
No need to apply, no pressure
We're just having a good time honey
No need to apply, no pressure
We're just having such a good time

We're just having a good time honey
No need to apply, no pressure
We're just having a good time honey
No need to apply, no pressure
We're just having such a good time

We're having a good time honey
No need to apply, no pressure
We're just having a good time honey
No need to apply, no pressure
We're just having a good time honey
No need to apply, no pressure
We're just having a good time honey
