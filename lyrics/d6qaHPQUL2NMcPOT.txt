Take
Take in a deep breath
Get in a little rest
Yeah, you're safer here than you were out there

So feel those feelings that you used to have
Feel those feelings again or at least pretend

Shut it down
Get carried away
Solid ground
Is here to stay

Think
Think for a moment
Just don't analyze
Yeah, the smartest folks are the saddest I know

So feel those feelings that you used to have
Feel those feelings again or at least pretend

Shut it down
Get carried away
Solid ground
Is here to stay

Shut it down
Get carried away
Solid ground
Is here to stay

Yeah, the smartest folks are the saddest I know

Shut it down
Get carried away
Solid ground
Is here to stay

Shut it down
Get carried away
Solid ground
Is here to stay
