Would you die with me? (oh)
Would you die with me?
Would you die with me, baby?
Would you dance with me over there?
I'm addicted to all the shit that you do
I'm addicted, why you look so cute?
I'm pissed that you don't think you look cute, 'cause
You're my kryptonite, no phone at night, no bitch tonight
Just you, ayy
Rollin' up a [pie fruit?], what
I could die with you
No funeral full of heartaches, just a party with you
Know you been thinkin', know you been drinkin'
Filling this space you avoid
Filling this space you avoid
Now I'm just paintin' your curves, we can watch all these movies
Fall asleep in my arms, never thought I'd be losing
That pussy gone in my head
That pussy gone in my head
You know we both fucked up
Everybody fucked up
Touching base with these thoughts
Inside it's all love, inside you want love
Think I found myself in you
Know you found yourself in me
When we don't even need each other
Baby off of them shits, right?
Ridin' all in my ____, right?
I been all in my ego
She be strokin' my head, no
Talkin' 'bout what's evil, thank god that we evil

I'm bleedin', bleedin', bleedin' for you baby
I'm fiendin', fiendin', fiendin' for you baby
I'm bleedin', I'm bleedin', I'm bleedin'
I'm fiendin', I'm fiendin', I'm fiendin'
Aw, naw, naw, naw

Hold you as we lay in this bed
Let your mind be dead
Let your mind be dead
Dead, dead, dead, dead
Die with me
Die with me
Die with me
Die with me
