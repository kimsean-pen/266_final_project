Yeah yeah yeah
Um um

You are my starlight
Your shine can brighten up the darkness night
I'll follow you until the daylight
'Cause when you're close
I know it's alright, alright, alright, alright

See baby, you got it
I got it, I got it, I got it, we got it
No baby, no baby, no baby, don't stop it
We're taking off and the higher we go
The harder I fall

In love, in love
I feel like I just found the one, the one
Baby now look what you done, you done
You've lit up my life with your love, your love
(Your love, your love, your love)
I'm in love, I'm in love

You are my sunshine
Broke through the clouds and now I kissed the sky
Feels like I'm dreaming with open eyes
Long as I'm with you
I know I'm alright, alright, alright, alright

See baby, you got it
I got it, I got it, I got it, we got it
No baby, no baby, no baby, don't stop it
We're taking off and the higher we go
The harder I fall

In love, in love
I feel like I just found the one, the one
Baby now look what you done, you done
You've lit up my life with your love, your love
(Your love, your love, your love)
I'm in love, in love

(Starlight, starlight, starlight)
Starlight, starlight, starlight
(Starlight, starlight, starlight
Starlight, starlight, starlight)
