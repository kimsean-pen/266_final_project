I'm getting better in the worst way
Learning how to go on without you
When did it become so much easier?
I barely even thought about you today
I'm getting better in the worst way

Every time I close my eyes there you are
Some kind of hallucination
Every time I close my eyes
It used to be so vivid

Those bright dots that swim around my blue sky
Must have found a better place to hide
Why did they leave me here
Underground and overwhelmed by the fear
That one day I'll love someone who's not you?

Every time I close my eyes there you are
Some kind of hallucination
Every time I close my eyes
It used to be so vivid

As my eyes adjust there's a glow in the darkness
Bright white luminance
You never looked so pretty

Every time I close my eyes there you are
Some kind of hallucination
Every time I close my eyes
It used to be so, used to be so
Used to be so, used to be so vivid
