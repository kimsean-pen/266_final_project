Sweat is thick on hide
Setting sun alights
I've combed each hardened hair with crooked fingers and shed my share

Tameless, still I climb
Reinless beast is mine
And we ride to face the stark blank sky

Blood is in our eyes

Blood is in our eyes
Death is all we see
Catacombs arise
Destrier and me

Galloping through night
Devastation breathes
Cannot close our eyes
Destrier and me

Blood is in our eyes

Not a word we need
Numb is a world of speed
Wild wind leaves licks of steel
When it is whistling with racing love

We won't slow our haste
When there's blood to taste
Let us ride to face the stark blank sky

Blood is in our eyes
Death is all we see
Catacombs arise
Destrier and me
