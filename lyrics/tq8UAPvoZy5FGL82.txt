Lately I find I've been walking on tightropes
That stretch through my mind in the spaces I don't know
I've walked and I've fallen
So many times I don't notice now

Writing equations for solving the problems
there's always an answer I hadn't considered
Sometimes I just blindly
Knowing later I'll count it wrong

And the rope I touch
As I'm walking in a dream
Is a mystery to me
And it won't take much
For the nightmare that I see
To become reality

And the rope I touch
As I'm walking in a dream
Is a mystery to me
And it won't take much
For the nightmare that I see
To become reality

Mountains I find in this fragile existence
I step by the side and I'm lost in the distance
I've walked and I've fallen so many times I don't notice now

Lately I find I've been walking on tightropes
That stretch through my mind
I've walked and I've fallen so many times

And the rope I touch
As I'm walking in a dream
Is a mystery to me
And it won't take much
For the nightmare that I see
To become reality

And the rope I touch
As I'm walking in a dream
Is a mystery to me
And it won't take much
For the nightmare that I see
To become reality
