They'll cut tax for crooked and corporate
They'll buy your pride and make you
want what they don't know how to sell
The kickback is all talk and no throws
'Cause education only taught you what they want you to know

Yeah, sure
Yeah, sure

The cash grabs and boomer semantics
Our dreams are murdered by the mortgage every first of the month
So sit back and tune out the false flags
The consolation is something you'll never get back

Everyone, everyone around me slipped blindly into the molds they made
Everyone, everyone lies to me, lies to me

They'll mark every outlier as an enemy of the state
If they don't look just like me
Do you even stop to think?

Everyone, everyone around me slipped blindly into the molds they made
Everyone, everyone lies to me, lies to me

That Harry Bailey is a monster
He squandered everything
Every penny that his brother had to offer
He squandered everything
He squandered everything

And I would let it all out
But you prefer the fiction
And I would let it all out
And I would let it all out
But you prefer the bullshit

Everyone, everyone around me slipped blindly into the molds they made
Everyone, everyone lies to me, lies to me
Everyone, everyone around me slipped blindly into the molds they made
Everyone, everyone lies to me, lies to me

Yeah, sure
Yeah, sure
