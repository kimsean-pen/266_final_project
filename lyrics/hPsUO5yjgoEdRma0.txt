When we're alone together
Carved angels in our hands
Beside the river
Looking out
On the badlands
We'll share our solitude
Sacrifice ourselves
To the chorus of our truth
A choir of spells

When we're alone together
In the vaulted corridor
The hall of forever
With mercy at our door
We'll build an altar of sage, bones and feathers
Prayers of decay
We recite together

When we're alone together
Dancing portraits of our lives
In robes of leather
Wielding sacred knives
You carved your mask
In fear you flourish
You are my joan of arc
My temple of courage

When we're alone together

When we're alone together
