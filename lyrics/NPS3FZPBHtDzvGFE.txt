I remember going
Out to see the big rocks
went without you knowing
Hope you're not too mad
I go a lot - i go a lot

I remember weekends
before we got too cool for them
And I remember thinking
maybe we could just pretend tonight
For just tonight

I wanna wake up with you
I wanna wake up feeling tired
I wanna wake up with you
I wanna lay there for awhile

But that don't change that you're a
Liar, a liar
Hold yourself up higher and higher
'Cause I'm not buying the things you wanna say
I've heard 'em all now anyway
You're such a liar
My favorite liar

I remember weekends
Fighting over everything
I can almost taste it
The bloody lip you left me with that night
Kiss me one last time

I wanna wake up with you
I wanna show you what it's like
I wanna be the one to show you what
You're missing every night
Oh every night

It's too bad that you're a
Liar, a liar
Hold yourself up higher and higher
'Cause I'm not buying the things you wanna say
I've heard 'em all now anyway
You're such a liar
My favorite liar

I've got room to grow
I know I'm missing home
But you think I'm alone
And I think you should know
That I've got pretty girls
Yeah, I've got pretty girls taking me home

I wanna wake up with you
I wanna lay there for awhile
I wanna wake up with you
I wanna wake up feel alive

It's just too bad that you're a
Liar, a liar
Cast me into your fire, your fire
'Cause I will never be less than what you want
I've got good news I'm heading off
To start a fire, a fire
Liar, a liar
Hold yourself up higher and higher
'Case I'm not buying the things you wanna say
I've heard 'em all now anyway
You're such a liar
My favorite liar

I remember waking up in Colorado
You said that it was raining
I tried to hide away, but you said no
You made me love the rain
