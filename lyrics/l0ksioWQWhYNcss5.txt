Self-medicate
While they sleep, we let the night chase
Evil things away
And we're like animals homesick from shows
We've got to kill everything before the night gets wasted

Maybe it seems so strange
But we don't even stress at all
'Cause we've got poison in our well
(Poison in our well)

Come at me with everything you've got.

Burst into flames
Scream in the dark
I'm gonna light up this place
And die in beautiful stars tonight

Does it even make a difference?
When I'm sober, I feel pain
'Cause we run under the stars through cemetery backyards,
Celebrate the way the night hides scars.

So dance!
If it moves you
Jump in the fire!
If it burns you
I'll throw my arms around you darling
And we'll turn to ashes drowning in the flame

(Burst into flames!)
Scream in the dark!
I'm gonna light up this place
And die in beautiful stars!

what if these demons keep falling from the sky, it's alright
'Cause sometimes I love the way you swing the blade and everything in sight

Separate me from my own two hands, I've killed so many times,
But I can't save the world from the creatures that don't die.

Kinda like the way you tell me, "Baby, please come home,
I need you here right now,
I'm crying underwater so you don't hear the sound."

Burst into flames
Scream in the dark
I'm gonna light up this place, oh oh oh
(No one else will burn!) Yeah!

And I will be the only light
I'll be the only light!
