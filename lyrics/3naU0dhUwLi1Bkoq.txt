Can't remember anything at all
Flamed trees lie in the streets
Can't remember anything at all
But I'm driving my car down to Geneva

I've been sitting in my basement patio
Aye, it was hot
Up above, girls walk past, roses all in bloom
Have you ever heard about the Higgs Boson blues
I'm goin' down to Geneva baby, gonna teach it to you

Who cares, who cares what the future brings?
Black road long and I drove and drove
Came upon a crossroad
The night was hot and black
I see Robert Johnson
With a ten dollar guitar strapped to his back
Lookin' for a tune

Well here comes Lucifer
With his cannon law
And a hundred black babies runnin' from his genocidal Joe
He got the real killer groove
Robert Johnson and the devil man
Don't know who's gonna rip off who

Driving my car, flame trees on fire
Sitting and singin' the Higgs Boson blues
I'm tired, I'm lookin' for a spot to drop
All the clocks have stopped in Memphis now
And in the rain motel it's hot, it's hot
That's why they call it the Hot Spot
I take a room with a view
Hear a man preaching in a language that's completely new, yeah
Making the hot cocks in the flop house bleed
While the cleaning ladies sob into their mops
And the bell ho-hops and bops
A shot rings out to a spiritual groove
Everybody bleeding, to the Higgs Boson blues
And if I die now
Bury me in my favorite yellow patent leather shoes
With a mummified cat, and a hat
That the Caliphate forced on the Jews
Can you feel my heartbeat, can you feel my heartbeat

Hannah Montana, does the African savannah, as the simulated rainy season begins
She curses the cue with the Zulu
And moves onto Amazonia, cries with the dolphins
Mau mau ate the pygmy, the pygmy ate the monkey
The monkey has a gift that keeps sending back to you
Look, here comes the missionary, with his smallpox and flu
He's saving them savages, with his Higgs Boson blues

I'm driving my car down to Geneva
I'm driving my car down to Geneva
Aw, let the damn day break
Rainy days always make me sad
Miley Cyrus floats in a swimming pool in Taluka Lake
And you're the best girl I ever had
Can't remember anything at all
