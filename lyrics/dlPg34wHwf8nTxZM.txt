You wait with blood-shot eyes
And it's so obvious to see
You're not quite who you used to be
So let me make this clear...
You're too deep into the whole you've found
(You've found) Yourself buried six feet underground
And we won't be there when it all comes around
So find your own way out...

Don't try and point the blame
It's your own fault that everything was taken away

We're not alike, you see
You hold no face to me
You're living life on hold
When will you let this go?
We're not alike, you see
You're more than fake to me
You put on quite a show
Why can't you let this go?

Your words fleet so carelessly
That's not the way it's supposed to be
Well, your poison, it lacks substance
But it's enough to get you high
There's too little time in this precious life
To waste mending the halls of your shattered mind
So you go your way, and I'll go mine
You can point the blame, but God knows I tried...

We're not alike, you see
You hold no face to me
You're living life on hold
When will you let this go?
We're not alike, you see
You're more than fake to me
You put on quite a show
Why can't you let this go?

You wait with blood-shot eyes
And it's so obvious to see
You're not quite who you used to be
So let me make this clear...
You're too deep into the whole you've found
(You've found) Yourself buried six feet underground
And we won't be there when it all comes around
So find your own way out.
