I realise the best part of love
Is the thinnest slice
And you don't care for much
But I'm not letting go
I believe there's still much to believe in

So lift your eyes if you feel you can
Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan
I've figured it out what I needed was someone to show me

You know you can't fool me
I've been lovin you too long
It started so easy
You'll want to carry on (carry on)

Lost in love and I don't know much
'Cause I'm thinkin' aloud and I fell out of touch
But I'm back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted

So lift your eyes if you feel you can
Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan
I've figured it out what I needed was someone to show me

You know you can't fool me
I've been lovin you too long
It started so easy, You'll want to carry on (carry on)

Lost in love and I don't know much
Cos I'm thinkin aloud and I fell out of touch
But I'm back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted

You know you can't fool me
I've been lovin' you too long
It started so easy
You'll want to carry on (carry on)
Lost in love and I don't know much
'Cause I'm thinkin' aloud and I fell out of touch
But I'm back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted
Now I'm lost
Lost in love
Lost in love
Lost in love
