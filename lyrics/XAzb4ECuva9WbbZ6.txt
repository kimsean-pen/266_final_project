Time
Is the reason why we fight to stay alive
Until the morning comes

It's a strife
But the shimmer in your eyes just makes me know
That you and I belong

And you can light the dark all by your own
So let us show the world our love is strong

Like a sign
Like a dream
You're my amaranthine
You are all I needed, believe me

Like we drift in a stream
Your beauty serene
There's nothing else
In life I ever need
My dream, amaranthine

Time
Goes by as day and nights are turning into years
But I'm lying in your arms
It's the place
Where I know that I am closest to your heart
Where the dark is torn apart

I know you feel the same as I inside
It feels like in a dream where we can fly

Like a sign
Like a dream
You're my amaranthine
You are all I needed, believe me

Like we drift in a stream
Your beauty serene
There's nothing else
In life I ever need
My dream, amaranthine

It's a strife
But the shimmer in your eyes just makes me know
You're my amaranthine

Like a sign
Like a dream
You're my amaranthine
You are all I needed, believe me

Like a sign
Like a dream
You're my amaranthine
You are all I needed, believe me

Like we drift in a stream
Your beauty serene
There's nothing else
In life I ever need
My dream, amaranthine
