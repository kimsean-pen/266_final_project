I don't ever wanna pick a slice
One is pretty but the other lies
Chewing on a fat smoke
No filter but you're puffing
Suckin' on a slim vogue
Dark fingernail polish
I'm the treasure baby I'm the prize
Cut me rails of that fresh cherry pie
Shitty old pistola
Shot a bullet thru my wallet
Gonna go to Pensacola
Gonna fuck my way through college
You've gone with the thick rims
Big look with the lip ring and things
Wake me when the bell rings
I'm gonna sleep 'cause you live in my day dreams
You've gone with the thick rims
Big look with the lip ring and things
Wake me when the bell rings
I'm gonna sleep 'cause you live in my day dreams
Sitting pretty in the prime of life
I'm so tasty and the price is right
Stewing in the black dope
I'm filthy and I love it
Studebacker all gold
Got a shotgun in my pocket
You've gone with the thick rims
Big look with the lip ring and things
Wake me when the bell rings
I'm gonna sleep 'cause you live in my day dreams.
