I want you to stay, never go away from me
Stay forever
But now, now that you're gone
All I can do is pray for you
To be here beside me again

Why did you have to leave me?
When you said that love will conquer all?
Why did you have to leave me?
When you said that dreaming was as good as reality?

And now I must move on
Trying to forget all the memories of you and me
But I can't let go of your love that has taught me
To hold on

I want you to stay, never go away from me
Stay forever
But now, now that you're gone
All I can do is pray for you
To be here beside me again

Why did you have to leave me?
When you said that love will conquer all?
Why did you have to leave me?
When you said that dreaming was as good as reality?

And now I must move on
Trying to forget all the memories of you and me
But I can't let go of your love that has taught me
To hold on

Why did you have to leave me?
When you said that love will conquer all?
Why did you have to leave me?
When you said that dreaming was as good as staying with me?

Why did you have to leave me?
When you said that love will conquer all?
Why did you have to leave me?
When you said that dreaming was as good as reality?

I want you to stay, never go away from me
Stay forever
I want you to stay, never go away from me
Stay forever
