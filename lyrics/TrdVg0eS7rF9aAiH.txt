Those who can make you believe absurdities
Can make you commit atrocities

Blazing up the fire, burn my sacred sins in rain
My beloved desires, die out and lost in pain
Wealth dreams andpyres dissapearedin foggy day
Marbled old Messiahs betrayed me hardand loudly I pray

Gloria-Patri

Burning hopes and voices, calling loudly my name
Silent words and noises whisper loudly and say

Gloria-Patri

Kyrie eleison
Kyrie eleison
Kyrie eleison
Kyrie eleison

Gloria-Patri
