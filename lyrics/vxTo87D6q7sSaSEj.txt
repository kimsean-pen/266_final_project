I miss you Berlin
The taste still lingers on
I hope we meet again
I hope it won't be long
I'm bored with using technology
Let's go back to the way it used to be
No need for all this psychology
I can't pretend no more
Berlin Berlin
Don't want another one night stand
Berlin Berlin
I just want to be your man

Our lips touched beneath the stars
The lights flashed from passing cars
Your face melted in my heart
And it showed me who you are
Berlin Berlin
Don't want another one night stand
Berlin Berlin
I just want to be your man

I feel my heart explode I can't explain the sky is falling down
I can not calm it down it's like a rage inside my skin and bones
It's eating me alive

Berlin Berlin
Don't want another one night stand
Berlin Berlin
I just want to be your man

Berlin Berlin Berlin
Don't want another one night stand
Berlin Berlin Berlin
I just want to be your man
