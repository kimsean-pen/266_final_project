Behold, the moon is hiding in the clouds
The night is silent, a world in fear
A million days since he was buried in the sea
He will rise again, his demon spirit will be free

We summon thee oh mighty one
Master can you hear our calls
We'll die for you oh lord of death
We await the day when the curtain of night
Will fall and never rise

The dead shall rise again
Pleasure turn to pain, the ascension
Nothing will survive
Hell shall come alive, the ascension

Demise, the sun is dying in the sky
The ground is shaking, the end is near
All the restless souls
From the universe below will rise again
Let the misery begin

We summon thee oh mighty one
Master can you hear our calls
We'll die for you oh lord of death
We await the day when the curtain of night
Will fall and never rise

The dead shall rise again
Pleasure turn to pain, the ascension
Nothing will survive
Hell shall come alive, the ascension

Resurrection through carnage
Breeding death
In eternal darkness
Death shall live forevermore
