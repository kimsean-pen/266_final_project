I figured I'd go
At the least to check in cause
I just miss her grin
And
To show
That i didnt really never wanna see you again ...

And my heart
Caves in when i look at you.

This is so hard

And my heart
Caves in when i look at you.

This is so hard
Do you take
pictures
Off the walls
When you know im coming to your room
Do you hide all the
Stuffed animals the other boys bought for you.

I wasnt suprised
She was
Chillen lookin hot in her bed smoking pot.and I kept my distance i was a "good
Boy"
