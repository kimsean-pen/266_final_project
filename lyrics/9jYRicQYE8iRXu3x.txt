all my life i have travelled in needs
now i've found what i crave
you've got to be brave
i know it's hard when you feel i'm sleeping
friend in rain i'm awake
let's shake
we'll shake
and whether you would or you won't isn't traced across every word
the place and the smell will instantly place your evident crime
rotten replaced regrown and renamed
a bottomless game
and if you're unsure just look in his face
you'll see he's alright
he's fine
the same as all man
in time i'll have to ask him
i just want to see you happy
man i know that you try
your high
always fine
you've got to get
and when you're awake your eyes shine bright
you're so fine
my pride lifts me up into places so right
and i know on my mark
we'll trespass again and again it's all mine
and i'm all fine
i'll always tear up when i see how you shine
in your unwary nights
you're fine
i'm rolling over
this time
no run for cover
he's shaking it
