I was shorter than my dad's dining table
You were taller than my bedroom door frame
Hit me hard when I found height don't make a man no
You grew smaller to me that Saturday when
You came crashing crawling down through the back brush
Eyes were bloodshot and your leaden voice thin
Said I won't blame you now but I caught your cold somehow
then you jumped right in
Oh I wanna give you all of my love
But I watched you sink as they swam above
You are the land and I am the dove
My heart is heavy when you're high
So for me why won't you try
Said you're sorry you were drinking through the day then
Only stopped to let your lungs take the hit
Said I won't blame you now but you lost my love somehow
Then you jumped right in
Oh I wanna give you all of my love
But I watched you sink as they swam above
You are the land and I am the dove
My heart is heavy when you're high
So for me why won't you try
