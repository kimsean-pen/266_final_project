Lonely in this white room
There are pads everywhere
Chafing strait jacket
I won't die in there
Save me smiling Jesus
Get off that cross
Hate me screaming masses
I don't care if I' m lost
Don't tell me that you're all better

I don't care if you are
Don't tell me that you're trend setters
I don't care if you are
Lowly with my head bowed
There are rats everywhere
Feed me bread and water
I won't die in there

Save me smiling Jesus
Get off that cross
Hate me screaming masses
I don't care if I'm lost

Don't tell me that you're all better
I don't care if you are

Don't tell me that you're trend setters
I don't care if you are
Say, you will take my pills
Say, you will faking ill
Don't tell me that you're all better
I don't care if you are
Don't tell me that you're trend setters
I don't care if you are
Say, you will take my pills
Say, you will faking ill
Say, you will take my pills
(Say, you will take my pills)
Say, you will faking ill
(Say, you will)
