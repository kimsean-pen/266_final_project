A fate that we deserve
There's no escape, we're walking backwards
I'm on your side but life's a selfish thing
Like broken promises
A thousand times, try to fake it
Just another liar
It's the wall that we are building, all the things that we made wrong
Don't blame yourself if you walk away
You reach but nothing's there
Time and time again, colours fade from black to grey
How come we walk a mile just to shatter what we love?
Eyes wide open, reflections of an unfamiliar face saying
You know you are heading
The lost dream of what could have been
It makes no difference
'Cause it's the wall that we are building, all the things that we made wrong
Don't blame yourself if you walk away
You reach but nothing's there
Time and time again, colours fade from black to grey
It's the wall that we are building, all the things that we made wrong
Don't blame yourself if you walk away
You reach but nothing's there
Time and time again, colours fade from black to grey
