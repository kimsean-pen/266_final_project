fuck you you you you you x 8

driving in a convertible on the boulevard
meanwhile i'm sitting here on the dlr
feeling like your consolation prize
scrolling through your twitter looking at your puppy dog eyes
going hey? wheres he gone?
hes fucked off back to where he came from
forgotten all about me
settled on a new project in los angeles

if you wanna teach
if you wanna preach
if you wanna leech
if you wanna fuck with me x2

i hope she gives you love x3
like the groupies do
i hope she gives you love
kinda like you were dreamin of
i hope she gives you love
now i'm thinking

fuck you you you you you x 8

let me tell you one thing about this
theres a new girl on the block that you dismissed
let me tell one thing about this
the new girl's me and here's my hypothesis

does she even realise that i exist
did you mean to turn away from my hot kiss
i kinda liked you lil you tried to take the piss
you fucked up just wait till you reminisce

if you wanna teach
if you wanna preach
if you wanna leech
if you wanna fuck with me x2

i hope she gives you love x3
like the groupies do
i hope she gives you love
kinda like you were dreamin of
i hope she gives you love
now i'm thinking
fuck you you you you you x 8

tried not to find her instagram
but accidentally landed on it
what a gorgeous babe she is
and i can see what you love about her
in those gorgeous eyes of wonder
they're not ever like mine were
now you've got me creasin

i can see that she likes you like you liked me, you liked me
and i
i can see that she likes you like you liked me, you liked me

it was never my intention to laugh at jokes about your new ex-girlfriend
