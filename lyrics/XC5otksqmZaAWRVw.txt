When love becomes less sacred
Your mouth keeps me interested
You're sweet like a little kid
Whose family's well-adjusted

Ooh, ooh, uh
Ooh, ooh, uh
Ooh, ooh, uh
Ooh, ooh

There's nothing you want to say
I'm just with you every day
I know it's better than before
So why, why do I need more?

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

If you don't know
I'll leave it alone
You don't let it show
So how would I know?
