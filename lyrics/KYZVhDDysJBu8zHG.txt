She said I feel stranded and I can't tell anymore
If we coming or I'm going
It's not how I planed it, I've got the key to the door
But it just won't open

And I know, I know, I know part of me says let it go
That life happens for a reason
I don't, I don't, I don't, it goes, I never went before
But this time, this time

I'm gonna try anything that just feel better
Tell me what to do yeah
You know I can't see through the haze around me
And I do anything that just feel better

And I can't find my way
God I need a change
And I do anything that just feel better
Any little thing that just feel better

She said I need you to hold me, I'm a little far from the shore
And I'm afraid of sinking
You're the only one who knows me and who doesn't ignore
That my soul is weeping

I know, I know, I know part of me says, let it go
Everything must have it seasons
Round and round it goes and every day's a one before
But this time, this time

I'm gonna try anything that just feels better
Tell me what to do
You know I can't see through the haze around me
And I do anything that just feel better

I can't find my way
God I need a change
And I do anything that just feel better
Any little thing that just feel better

I'm tired of holding on
To all things I ought to leave behind, yeah
It's really getting no where
I think I need a little help this time
Yeah

I'm gonna try anything that just feel better
Tell me what to do
You know I can't see through the haze around me
And I do anything that just feel better

I can't find my way
Girl I need a change
And I do anything that just feel better
Any little thing that just feel better
