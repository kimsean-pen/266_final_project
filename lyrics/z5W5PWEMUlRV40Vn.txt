Move shake move shake and hide (alright)
Stop trying to pressure me (alright)
Everything is gonna be (alright)
I know it doesn't say vacancy but I hope you don't mind.
I hope you don't mind us.

Can you really see everything? Like my fingers and in between?
A lonely heart equals a lonely mind.
But that means nothing, nothing to me.

Easy on the eyes my friend, you don't wanna mess with this.
Sometimes the bleeding sun bleeds red and thick, colour in my only way to find it.
So come at me son, and pull the trigger on the gun.
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive (and it's alright)

Now I've got you where you need to be and the dark has left your eyes.
Move shake move shake and hide.
Move shake move shake and hide.
Move shake move shake and hide.

Easy on the eyes my friend, you don't wanna mess with this.
Sometimes the bleeding sun bleeds red and thick, colour in my only way to find it.
So come at me son, and pull the trigger on the gun.

I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive (and it's alright)
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive (and it's alright)
Move shake move shake and hide.
Move shake move shake and hide.
Move shake move shake and hide.

Move shake hide, move shake hide, move shake hide.

Easy on the eyes my friend you don't wanna mess with this.
Sometimes the bleeding sun bleeds red and thick, colour in my only way to find it.
So come at me son, and pull the trigger on the gun.
