Drop me off at 66, emerging from the wilderness
The feel of freedom overwhelmed me
I wandered lonely, looking up
Thinking of the space that I took up
In my relationship with all apparent dimensions
I cut across the Central Park, 45 hours of light and dark
I had to make the most of them and
The problem's just like in the films with frozen
Given in a glaze of haze of snow and smog and my bad eyesight so
I killed an hour by going to see John Lennon's house
And where he got away from me and you and nothing's real
I took a cab from west to east and men did wrong
I walked and slipped and slide across the ice and feel the trees then
I bumped into a girl I knew, wearing black and singing songs
We both knew were about me and a deeper found regret
The time is wrong, I'd set it fast,
She said she knew I left her up in Harlem after crushing cigarettes
OK

I want to be alone with you
I want to do the things you do
You always do

Feeling deeply shaken and then breaking my own rule
I went into a tiki bar on 1st Avenue
Writing in a notebook and being very English
I attracted the attentions of a real couple
They asked me if I'd join them to society engagements
So I answered that I would and then we split
They lived around the corner,
I heard something about a dress and plastic costumes and then something about a Duchess
The shop was such a trip, I spent an hour flipping taxis
Got big shout with a man called Captain Bodybag
OK

I want to be alone with you
I want to do the things you do
You always do

Comedians, comedians, comedians, comedians
Comedians try and making me laugh
But I've never been to see one
And I don't think that I will again
I'd rather drink or dance and try and laugh
Taking in another bar and feeling very fragile
I had visions in the house from Eyes Wide Shut
But like a lost bike penny in a city where there's many
We met up and sang and talked about the fugs so
I figured I was in and we'd move on and we'd take on the Bowery
Many close collisions, we got a cab
We drove into the darkness, New York City in the distance
I bet ghosts had started peeling back the layers
OK

I want to be alone with you
I want to do the things you do
You always do

Sank into the seat and felt the fabric tried to eat
My body and my head and seem that I'd been schooled
And then, I thought whatever
That I'd I had a healthy inning
I just lied there thinking to myself it looked cool so
I wish I had the nerve, I said I wish I had the nerve
To shake this ambient 'n appreciate this bridge but
Peace on you I said
I hope you get some when you're dead
And you just sand said it is what it is
I want to be alone with you
I want to do the things you do
You always do
