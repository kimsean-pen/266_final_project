Mean world syndrome
Of absolute zero
Idle archaic indifferent
Oh what if you care

Hurricane's always coming
So take over or run

Spiralling into silence
You'll always belong
You'lo make love to cold bodies
Fresh after they gone

Hurricane's always coming
So take over or run
Hanging onto obsession
I cant never let go
