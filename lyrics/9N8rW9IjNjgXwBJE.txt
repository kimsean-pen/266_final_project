I can't stop the moon
Can't stop the tides
Can't stop the rain

I can't stop the moon
Can't stop the time
Can't stop the rain

I can't stop the moon
Can't stop the tides
Can't stop the rain

I can't stop the moon
Can't stop the time
Can't stop the rain

I can't stop the moon
Can't stop the tides
Can't stop the rain

I can't stop the moon
Can't stop the time
Can't stop the rain

Weeping may last through the night
But joy comes with the morning
Weeping may last through the night
But joy comes with the morning

Weeping may last through the night
But joy comes with the morning
Weeping may last through the night
But joy comes with the morning

I can't stop the moon
Can't stop the tides
Can't stop the rain

I can't stop the moon
Can't stop the time
Can't stop the rain

I can't stop the moon
Can't stop the tides
Can't stop the rain

I can't stop the moon
Can't stop the time
Can't stop the rain
