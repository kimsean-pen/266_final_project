3 in the morning and the rain is pouring
its so boring cindy's on my mind
i catch a fever around the disbelievers
in a world of silhouettes, that keeps me alright

cindy call me up (x4)

can't find the meaning in all this late night scheming
turning so many lies
6 in the morning and the rain stopped pouring
cindy's got strawberry skies (?)

you can hit me up all you want
you can give me everything you got
you know it's just a front till strawberry skies
you can hit me up all you want
you can give me everything you got
you know it's just a front till strawberry skies

cindy call me up (x2)

deep trouble awake in the night under the strawberry skies
how long will you wait in the night knowing there's so many lies (x3)
