I want to be dead with my friends, x2
Wide-eyed, brilliant, dynamic rest
I want to be dead with my friends. x2
Where the iron sharpens the iron, x3
Sharpens the iron.
I want to be dead with my friends, x2
A vulgar, loud, unforgettable end
I want to be dead with my friends.
Let boredom cease the beating of our purple hearts
Against this even gods fight violently in vain what chance could we have stood.
We're the last of the lost, but now we are the first of the fashionably late.

The loved ones decompose
You'll dance around the bones,
But most of us are wholly ghost
All of us were wholly ghost.
(I know no other way)
x2

We made the scene when we made a scene
And though it was brief, it meant everything
Oh, what a pity, now they're bound to make us saints. x2
Against this even boys fight violently in vain what chance would we have stood.
We're the last of the lost, but now we are the first of the fashionably late.
I refuse to be the only man put to rest in a mass grave. x3
You were all there with me. x3
