Maybe I should not be drinkin', before you ask me just how I feel
Maybe I should not be drinkin',
'fore I speak my mind, that's not ideal
You're not a girlfriend, yeah I should be faithful
I think of you like Wi-Fi, and I think of her like cable

Last night I got a offer for a 100G's
No lie, they tryna' play me just to run and breath
I remember Mickey D's for the number three's
And I remember T.J. MAXX, for the summer tees
I remember when dunks in the dungarees
And I got boxer-brief nigga, underneath
Countin' on my name, brand clothes one of these
Nah' I need those Gucci sneaks, at least one a piece

She's on my dick,
she knows me from somewhere on TV, and she saw me on the internet
I only let her give me brain, what can I say, I love her intellect
She understands that I am on the come up, so she sees the benefit
She wants to hold on tight,
I say see let's go of my waist, for a better grip
Please don't, please don't
Two or no less in a threesome
Let me know if you need some
Drop it low unless your knees don't, er

Maybe I should not be drinkin', before you ask me just how I feel
Maybe I should not be drinkin',
'fore I speak my mind, that's not ideal
You're not a girlfriend, yeah I should be faithful
I think of you like Wi-Fi, and I think of her like cable

I met a girl on the plane, and I don't even pretend to know her name
And I told I ain't alone in this lane
And she told me the sex is sorta like a Novacane
And she likes to overtrain, woah
Then I told her "Slow the lane"
Then I told her "Baby you might wanna show restraint"
Then I told her "Fuck it, whatchu' know, it's all the same"
You got some shit to overcome, so I really hope you came, wait
White lies, baby white lies
This is my time, know me well from my timeline

She's on my dick,
she knows me from somewhere on TV, and she saw me on the internet
I only let her give me brain, what can I say, I love her intellect
She understands that I am on the come up, so she sees the benefit
She wants to hold on tight,
I say see let's go of my waist, for a better grip
Please don't, please don't
Two or no less in a threesome
Let me know if you need some
Drop it low unless your knees don't, er

Maybe I should not be drinkin', before you ask me just how I feel
Maybe I should not be drinkin',
'fore I speak my mind, that's not ideal
You're not a girlfriend, yeah I should be faithful
I think of you like Wi-Fi, and I think of her like cable, woo

Baby, Baby Brenda got a baby
And you came for the A-list
And they call a nigga wavy
