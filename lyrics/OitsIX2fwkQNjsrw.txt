Worry walks beside me every day
They say I should run but It's comin my way
I'll be doin fine if you just leave me behind

Coming all over and under my skin
Say if I follow I will die like a king
I'll be doin fine if you just leave me behind

What will it take to believe I can run
What will it take? When will I be done?
I've been trying
I find him standing here all the time

I find him trying to steal all that's mine

I'll be doin fine if you just leave me behind

What will it take to believe I can run
What will it take? When will I be done?
I've been trying

What will it take to be free again
I wanna leave this behind
What will it take just to see again
All this is making me blind
What will it take to believe I can run
What will it take? When will I be done?
I've been trying
How does it feel to be flying away
How does it feel to believe today
I've been trying
Worry walks beside me everyday
