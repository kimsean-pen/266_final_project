Wonder if you know
Wonder if I let you down
I watched you go
I once took you around

For me
I'll wait
For me

I'll be fine in due time
You'll be fine in due time

Don't have to text
We could do it over again
And it'll be alright
Keeping you in one damn night

I'll wait
for me
I'll wait
for me

And I'll be fine in due time
And you'll be fine in due time

For me
I'll wait
For me

(You'll be fine in due time)
(You'll be fine in due time)
