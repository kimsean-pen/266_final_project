Brain death, blind desk, school damage, straight A's

Sixteen, on the honor roll, I wish that I was dead
Hate my parents, I got zits and bruises round my head
Pressure's on to get good grades so I can be like them
I do my homework all the time I can't go out just then

People they ain't friends at all, they tease and suck me dry
They yell at me when I fuck up and party while I cry
I look so big on paper, I feel so very small
Wanna die and you don't care, just stride on down the hall

Suicide, suicide
Read the paper, wonder why
Turn the light out then you cry
It's you fault you made me die

Touch me, won't you touch me now? So frozen I can't love
When I was born my mama cried and picked me up with gloves
Girls, they kick me in the eye, want answers to the tests
When they get them they drive off and leave me home to rest

Hold my head
Make me warm, tell me I am loved
Give me hope, let me cry
Make me feel, give me touch

The window's broken, bleeding, screaming, lying in the hall
I'm gone no one remembers me, a picture on the wall
"He was such a bright boy, the future in his hands"
Or a spineless human pinball shot around by your demands

Suicide, suicide, going to sleep and when I die
You'll look up and realize
Then look down and wipe your eyes
Then go back to your stupid lives
Aw shit!
