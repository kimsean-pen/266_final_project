it's some kind of lottery
spinning the globe all night
choosing places where we gonna die
on a drunk night
put your finger to stop
that plastic globe
pacific ocean lovers
bottoms up good luck
I'm not here I'm not here
rocky mountains will bury me
half awake in a haze in a drunken haze
I'm not here I'm not here
Let him fall from the edge
Let her drown in the ocean
Let him fall from the edge
And what will be then
endless whiteness infinite blackness
and where we will be then'
in infinite blackness
