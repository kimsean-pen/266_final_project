Don't you ever feel
You're sorry
Don't you ever wish
The sky could open up
All I do is going nowhere
And I want to go back home

Don't you know
That you're so special
Don't you ever cloud
Your thoughts like falling rain
Wonder if I'm going somewhere
Still I gotta get back home

Temptation
Leading me astray
Frustration
A time will come to pay

Don't you want to know my story
Guess I could explain it if I tried
I don't want to keep expanding
And I'm sorry that I lied

Temptation
Leading me astray
Frustration
A time will come to pay

Temptation
Leading me astray
Frustration

Don't you want
To make me over
Don't you feel
That everything's a test
Want to disappear inside you
Because that's the home
I feel the best

Temptation
Leading me astray
Frustration
A time will come to pay
Temptation
Leading me astray
Frustration
Temptation.
