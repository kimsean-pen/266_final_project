Have you seen the well-to-do
Up and down Park Avenue?
On that famous thoroughfare
With their noses in the air.

High hats and arrow collars,
White spats and lots of dollars,
Spending every dime
For a wonderful time.

If you're blue and you don't where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits?
Puttin' on the ritz.
Different types who wear a day coat
Pants with stripes and cut-a-way coats,
Perfect fits...
Puttin' on the Ritz.

Strollin' up the avenue so happy
All dressed up just like an English chappy
Very snappy.

Come let's mix where Rockefellers walk with sticks and um-ber-ellas
In their mitts...
Puttin' on the Ritz.

If you're blue and you don't where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits?
Puttin' on the ritz.
Different types who wear a day coat
Pants with stripes and cut-a-way coats,
Perfect fits...
Puttin' on the Ritz.

Dressed up like a million dollar trouper
Trying hard to be like Gary Cooper
Super-Duper.

Come let's mix where Rockefellers walk with sticks and um-ber-ellas
In their mitts...
Puttin' on the Ritz.
Puttin' on the Ritz.
Puttin' on the Ritz.
PUTTIN' ON THE RITZ!
