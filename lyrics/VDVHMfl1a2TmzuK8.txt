Baby, I've been holdin' on to you
Lately I've been runnin' from the truth
But when I'm with you

There's no escapin' the way you're makin' me feel
You say you love me
How come it never seems real?
All the excuses
They keep me here by your side
I'll always love you

So hard to say that we might be better off
Moving on without each other
You won't admit that we might be better off
Because if you're gone I'll find another
We might be better off
We might be better off
We might be better off
We might be better off

Catch myself looking back to the start
Thread by thread we slowly fell apart
Just like back then

There's no escapin' the way you're makin' me feel
You say you love me
How come it never seems real?
All the excuses
They keep me here by your side
I'll always love you

So hard to say that we might be better off
Moving on without each other
You won't admit that we might be better off
Because if you're gone I'll find another
We might be better off
We might be better off
We might be better off
We might be

Maybe we should just give up and start on moving on
Makes me think that we've been growing apart all along
Maybe we, maybe we're better, better, better off
Even so, I'll always love you

I just can't say that we might be better off
Moving on without each other
You won't admit that we might be better off
Because if you're gone I'll find another
We might be better off
We might be better off
We might be better off
We might be
