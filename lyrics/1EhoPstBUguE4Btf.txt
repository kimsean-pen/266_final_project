Some day,
when I'm awfully low,
when the world is cold,
I will feel a glow just thinking of you...
and the way you look tonight.
Oh but you're lovely,
with your smile so warm
and your cheeks so soft,

there is nothing for me
but to love you,
just the way you look tonight.
With each word your tenderness grows,
tearing my fear apart...
and that laugh
that wrinkles your nose,
touches my foolish heart.
Lovely
never, never change.
keep that breathless charm.
won't you please arrange it?
'cause I love you
just the way you look tonight.
'cause I love you
just the way you look tonight.
