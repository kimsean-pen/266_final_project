The world seems not the same
Though I know nothing has changed
It's all my state of mind
I can't leave it all behind
I have to stand up to be stronger

I have to try
To break free
From the thoughts in my mind
Use the time that I have
I can't say goodbye
Have to make it right

I have to fight
'Cause I know in the end it's worthwhile
That the pain that I feel slowly fades away
It will be alright

I know
Should realize
Time is precious
It is worthwhile
Despite how I feel inside
Have to trust it will be alright
Have to stand up to be stronger

I have to try
To break free
From the thoughts in my mind
Use the time that I have
I can't say goodbye
Have to make it right

I have to fight
'Cause I know in the end it's worthwhile
That the pain that I feel slowly fades away
It will be alright

Oh, this night is too long
Have no strength to go on
No more pain, I'm floating away
Through the mist I see the face
Of an Angel, who calls my name
I remember you're the reason I have to stay

I have to try
To break free
From the thoughts in my mind
Use the time that I have
I can say goodbye
Have to make it right

I have to fight
Cause I know in the end it's worthwhile
That the pain that I feel slowly fades away
It will be alright
