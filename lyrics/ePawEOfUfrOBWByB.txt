So what have we done?
With X and O's to mark our way home
(Home)
It seems as though we've forgotten
The way we move
Can we save ourselves?
From the one we're becoming

Please monsieur, remember
Don't tell me how you get somewhere better

Why write with confidence?
Why try to save them?
We try to not forget
It's so much better there
Did you think you could make it on your own?
It was so much better there

So what have you done
To make yourself a little bit happier
I can feel the vibrations
When you said I'd feel nothing
I'm giving up, so give it up

Please monsieur, remember
Don't tell me how you get somewhere better

Why write with confidence?
Why try to save them?
We try to not forget
It's so much better there
Did you think you could make it on your own?
It was so much better there

((This won't mean anything.))
((This won't mean anything...))

This won't mean anything
This won't mean anything tonight
This won't mean anything
This won't mean anything tonight

Why write with confidence?
Why try to save them?
We try to not forget
It's so much better there
Did you think you could make it on your own?
It was so much better

((This won't mean anything))
((This won't mean anything tonight...))
