Somewhere off in outerspace
There's a world no wars, no hate
Where all the broken hearts are safe
I don't know where it is
I just imagine it

We are all gathered here right now
I can feel it, it's about to go down
There's a time and place for a face in the crowd
and today is the day, stand out
Stand up, stand your ground
Be the who that you wanna be proud
and when you feel like you can't make a sound
Right there is the time we're supposed to get loud
You don't like those rules, remake 'em
'Cause we're living a snow globe, shake 'em
You don't like what it was, then change what it is
'Cause stories are what you make them
Wake up, get up and do something
You gotta wake up, get up and do something
Yeah, you don't take much but a simple equation
You plus your imagination

Somewhere off in outerspace
There's a world no wars, no hate
Where all the broken hearts are safe
I don't know where it is
I just imagine it

Right here I can almost touch it, so near
We can live in a world no fear
If you're with me say yeah!
Right here I can see it all crystal clear

We can flip the whole atmosphere
If you're with me say yeah!
I just imagine it
I live in a world that's in pain

You too where the streets have no name
'Cause an untreated vet with a mental defect
Is about to get a Glock, that's insane
Man we sit at the brink with a drink in our hand
and the other with the grip on an IPhone
Never looking in each others' eyes
Let alone the stars one day wonder where the time gone
Time beats waking up when the ball drops
Too many hearts stop beating when hearts stop
Can't wait for the world to change
I swear I wait for the end of days
We gotta wake up, get up and do something
We gotta wake up, get up and do something
Yeah it ain't gonna be perfect
Nothing ever has, but we could try
Just imagine that
Somewhere off in outerspace
There's a world no wars, no hate

Where all the broken hearts are safe
I don't know where it is
I just imagine it
Somewhere, far off pass the stars
Where the lights shines in the dark

Where you could be just who you are
I don't know where it is
I just imagine it
Right here I can almost touch it, so near
We can live in a world no fear

If you're with me say yeah!
Right here I can see it all crystal clear
We can flip the whole atmosphere
If you're with me say yeah!

(I just imagine it
I hope you can see it
I hope you can see it now
Just imagine it)

Somewhere off in outerspace
There's a world no wars, no hate
Where all the broken hearts are safe
I don't know where it is

I just imagine it
Somewhere, far off pass the stars
Where the lights shines in the dark
Where you could be just who you are
I don't know where it is
I just imagine it
I wanna believe
Yes I do
Yes I do
So I just imagine it
Somewhere off in outerspace
There's a world no wars, no hate
Where all the broken hearts are safe
I dont know where it is
I just imagine it
