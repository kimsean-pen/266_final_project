Many nights we pray with no proof anyone could hear
And our heart's a hopeful song we barely understood
Now we are not afraid although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains long before we knew we could

Oh yes, there can be miracles when you believe
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracle you can achieve, when you believe
Somehow you will, you will when you believe

In this time of fear when prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer birds, too swiftly flown away
And now I am standing here, my heart's so full I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words, I never thought I'd say

There can be miracles when you believe
When you believe
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will, you will when you believe

They don't always happen when you ask and
And it's easy to give in to your fear
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see your way safe through the rain
Thought of a still resilient voice, says love is very near

There can be miracles
Miracles
When you believe
When you believe
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will
Somehow, somehow, somehow
Somehow you will, you will, when you believe

You will when you believe
You will when you believe
Just believe
You will, you will
Just believe
You will, when you believe
