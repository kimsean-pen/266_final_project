Where will you go my darling daughter?
I'm gonna live down by the water
If I ever could find the time, never no reason or rhyme
I'm gonna live down by the water

I'm gonna send a dozen roses
Down the river like baby Moses
And I'll wash my tears away when I'm down in the river today
I'm gonna a dozen roses, a dozen roses

And who will be your one and only
When the days are lost and lonely
And the little blue birds of spring go down to the river to sing
Who will hear their testimony?

Sing a little song, darling
Sing it like a little blue starling
In the country or the town and for miles all around
Sing a little song darling

Now the days are getting hotter
I'm gonna live down by the water
If I ever could find the time, never no reason nor rhyme
I'm gonna live down by the water
Down by the water, gonna live down by the water
Down by the water
