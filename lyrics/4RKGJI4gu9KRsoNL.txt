Alway five steps between me and him
From a desk I have view to his chin
If I had the code to his grin
The loss of traction could sink in
It's pullin' me out of my skin
Get so warn down wishing for him
To bring me to a
And play me like a soft violin
How soon will I get to know
If dreaming of you is wasting my time
Don't you know while my body is growing
I'm spending my days watching you time

Each friday when he's not on my bus
I miss him like an addict needs her drugs
No one tells a believer to give up
Scribble his name with a pen he's struck
If for one day I could be any bug
I'd let him kill me for a taste of his blood
And maybe some day he'll notice me
If I keep a close proximity

How soon will I get to know
If dreaming of you is wasting my time
Don't you know while my body is growing
I'm spending my days watching you time

Who says that your taken
If that's true then what did I miss
I don't believe it no
But soon I'll have you comin
I just need to get my first kiss

Give you my kiss
How soon will I get to know
If dreaming of you is wasting my time
Don't you know while my body is growing
But I can't
I'm spending my days watching you time
Spend all my days

How soon will I get to know
If dreaming of you is wasting my time
Don't you know while my body is growing
I'm spending my days watching you time
