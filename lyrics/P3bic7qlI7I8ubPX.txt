Poor little rich boy
All the couples have gone
You wish that they hadn't
You don't wanna be alone

But they wanna kiss
And they got homes of their own
Poor little rich boy
All the couples have gone, they've gone, they've gone

And you don't love your girlfriend
You don't love your girlfriend
And you think that you should, but she thinks that she's fat
But she isn't, but you don't love her anyway

And you don't love your mother
And you know that you should
And you wish that you would
But you don't anyway

Poor little rich boy
Ah, the world is okay
The water runs off your skin
And down into the drain

You're reading Fitzgerald
You're reading Hemmingway
They're both super-smart
And drinking in the caf√©s

And you don't love your girlfriend
You don't love your girlfriend
And you think that you should, but she thinks that she's fat
But she isn't, but you don't love her anyway

And you don't love your mother
And you know that you should
And you wish that you would
But you don't anyway

You're so young, you're so goddamn young
You're so young, you're so goddamn young
You're so young, you're so goddamn young
You're so goddamn young
You're so goddamn young

You're so young, you're so goddamn young
You're so young, you're so goddamn young
You're so goddamn young
You're so goddamn young
You're so goddamn young
You're so goddamn young

You're so goddamn young
You're so goddamn young
You're so goddamn young
You're so goddamn young

And you don't love your girlfriend
And you don't love your girlfriend
And you don't love your girlfriend
And you don't love your girlfriend
