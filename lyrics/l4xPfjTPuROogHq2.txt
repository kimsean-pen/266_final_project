I'm asking you to stay, the words are finally here
Let's rewind and rewind
You see, you're the only star in the film I've never made
Would you rewind it all the time, rewind it all the time

In the driveway I see you pull in
And my heart stops when you're stalling
As if the phone rang and he's calling and you're backing up
And it's a long way out

I'm asking you to stay, the words are finally here
Let's rewind, would you rewind it all the time
See, you're the only star in the film I've never made
Would you rewind it all the time, rewind it all the time

Do we make it to the sequel?
A second chance for our survival
We all need a hallmark ending
And a change of heart, but it's a long way back, back to what you said

It's weighing on my mind
It's weighing on my mind
It's weighing on my mind
Would you rewind it all the time, rewind it all the time
I'm asking you to stay, the words are finally here
Let's rewind, would you rewind it all the time
You're the only star in the film I've never made
Would you rewind
Would you rewind it all the time...
