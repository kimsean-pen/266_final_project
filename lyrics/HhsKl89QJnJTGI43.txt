L.A. give me some of you
L.A. L.A. come to me
I've come to you
reduce it to dust
all that was a promise
reduce it to dust
oh disintegrate

secrets
its best you not know
I'll never tell
push me, I'll never tell
stupid
it's best I don't say
I won't recall
choke me I won't recall

OH
I must be insane
OhiO
duncical
is the refrain
the genius off all the chumps
ding dong
chastity has faded away
du du du du du du du du du

sweetheart
its best you not know
I'll never tell
face it, I'll never tell
hush hush
it's best I don't say
kill me, I won't recall

J.S. what is wrong with you
J.S.N.M. come to me I'll ruin you

secrets
it's best you not know
I'll never tell
swearing I'll never tell
