Rolling away with my good intentions
Trying to go with my mind
Said I'm walking the line
Flying away with my same desire, yeah
Oh, I'm trying to get to the heart of what's bringing me down
Moving alone I feed the fire
And with the temptation all around just laughing at me

So I try my hardest to keep my hands clean
And I stop from looking for the things that I can't find
If I'm ever gonna walk the line

So let me take you back to the start
When you gave me a piece of your heart
And I will do my best, oh yeah I'll do my best
Gonna make it all right now
Cause gone is the day when I would wander
When I would wander through the night with the light on me

So I try my hardest to keep my hands clean
And I stop from looking for the things that I can't find
If I'm ever gonna walk the line

To your emotions
(I walk the line)
To your desire
(I walk the line)
For our devotion is gonna feed the fire
Yeah, I walk the line
