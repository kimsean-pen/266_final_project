I love you, confuse you
-Maybe push you too far
Don't worry, unleash me
Thats song... that song

Come near me, relieve me
Protecting my heart
How crazy? ... completely.
But that's all, thats all.

... that song

Calm down, I'm falling apart at the seams

(Hold your head up and go your own way...)

Calm down, I'm falling apart at the seams
