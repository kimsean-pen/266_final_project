Creepin' out the cut with my yams, now I want some hay
Serve on, se-serve on, now you know I'm out it hard
Creepin' out the cut with my yams, now I want some hay
Serve on, se-serve on, now you know I'm out it hard
Creepin' out the cut with my yams, now I want some hay
Serve on, se-serve on, now you know I'm out it hard

(Ay, Yung Mutt)
Creepin' out the cut with my yams, now I want some hay
(Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya)
Serve on, se-serve on, now you know I'm out it hard

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who the fuck was that ugly ass boy I saw?
Yung Mutt with the dumbfuck
Dirty like a dump truck
Such a fucking bum, uh
Slash guts
I'm disgusted; I'm busted on what the fuck did I just put up my nose?
I'm buggin' out these people
I'm ducking out
I'm in trouble now
I can see the clouds, lights out

Now I lay myself to sleep
Now that I can rest in peace
I'm questioning my misery
My deathwish granted peaceful sleep
My body turns to worms for the birds to eat
Eternal decay for eternity

Creepin' out the cut with my yams, now I want some hay
Serve on, se-serve on, now you know I'm out it hard
Creepin' out the cut with my yams, now I want some hay
Serve on, se-serve on, now you know I'm out it hard
Creepin' out the cut with my yams, now I want some hay
Serve on, se-serve on, now you know I'm out it hard
Creepin' out the cut with my yams, now I want some hay
Serve on, se-serve on, now you know I'm out it hard

I can't lie, lately, I've been on the fucking edge
Pistol gripped up in my left
Xanax, heron, bunch of meds
Fantasizing about death, just need one in my temple
Put the gun up to my head
Fuck this shit, I shot the lead, and now I'm dead
Descended through hell, nothing but burnin' flesh smell
I scream, and scream, and scream, and hear the others yell as well
Oh well, just my luck
Devil opens up to devour me
That was my old life, Antichrist, he has empowered me

Our water main broke, leaving New Orleans without drinking water,
and the flooding here is getting worse after
waters from Lake Pontchartrain broke through a levee
