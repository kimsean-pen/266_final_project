And got a couple dollars in your pocket
it's six o'clock in the morning
well, you remember what you're talking?
well alright, no problem (yeah)
when it goes flying on by (yeah)
I remember back when I - when I had dropped you off my mind
wouldn't let 'em go
back when we were trying to find somewhere
we could rest our bones
back when I was seeing no hope
yeah, i've been laying low
whatever kept me up those nights, I'll never know
yeah, it's how it goes
I don't want no stories
coming at me like you always
you've been looking kind of lonely
well alright, I'm sorry (yeah)
moving all around in my mind (yeah)
and back when I, yeah back when I - when I had dropped you off my mind
wouldn't let 'em go
back when we were trying to find somewhere
we could rest our bones
back when I was seeing no hope
yeah, i've been laying low
whatever kept me up those nights, I'll never know
this is how it goes
(What time is it?
It's a little after six.
After six? Oh, I missed my bus again.
Oh, what's one more day?
Nothing to you.
You know, I've got a funny feeling I'm going around and around.
Maybe I'm on a merry-go-round.
Climb on down.)
