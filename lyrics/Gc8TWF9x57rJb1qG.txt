Aquarius, was born the night
The shining stars, needed brighter shining light
Aquarius, was my savior
It came along, like a blast from out of sight
When I was weak, you came along
Enlightened me, covered the sun
You seduced me, I can never ever run
Cause I...
Can only lose
When I'm...
Aquarius
You're the power that I need
To make it all succeed, can hear me call?
Aquarius, is the stardust
It kills the faith, and the only one I trust
It calls your name, and you listen
It steals your soul, and your hunger and your lust
For life, and being free (it's killing me, it's killing me)
Its dragging you, it's killing me (it's killing me, it's killing me)
You seduced me, I can never ever run
Cause I...
Can only lose (the words I can't refuse)
When I'm...
Aquarius (the words, the words)
You're the power that I need
To make it all succeed, can you hear me call?
Can you hear me call?
I wish the stars would turn you in, and leave me standing in the wind
I wish the devil gave you up, and all the snow would melt and stop
This is it, I can't run away
You're controlling my life, and I can hear me say
Cause I...
Can only lose (the words, the words)
When I'm...
Aquarius
You're the power that I need
To make it all succeed
I wish the stars would turn you in, and leave me standing in the wind
I wish the devil gave you up, and all the snow would melt and stop
