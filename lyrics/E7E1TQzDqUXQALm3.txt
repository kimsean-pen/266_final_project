Show on!

If you squeeze my lizard
I'll put my snake on you
I'm a romantic adventure
And I'm a reptile too

But it don't make no difference
'Cause I ain't gonna be, easy, easy
The only time I'm gonna be easy's when I'm

Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by death, someone

I'm a lone wolf ligger
But I ain't no pretty boy
I'm a backbone shiver
And I'm a bundle of joy

But it don't make no difference
'Cause I ain't gonna be, easy, easy
The only time I'm easy's when I'm

Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by death
Someone

Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by death
Someone's gonna killed by death
Someone, someone

Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by death

Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by death

Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by a bunch of death

Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by death
Shut out your mouth, shut out your mouth

Come on!
Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by death

I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead
Killed by death, killed by death
