She doesn't believe in sand and numbers
She doesn't believe in days and hours

No more time, no more years
Her life is an open space,
No more hours, no more days
Her life is an open space,
The body dies, the spirit stays

Only sunrises and sunsets, the shadows dance
She watches them come and fade away

No more time, no more years
Her life is an open space,
No more hours, no more days
Her life is an open space,
The body dies, the spirit stays
In eternity haze
The spirit stays
In eternity waves
