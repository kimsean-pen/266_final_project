In a steamed, wet window of a public house,
I'm using it like a mirror and eyeing myself up.

And somewhere in the corner
He's telling her a joke
And I had to stick the boot in
Because that's not how it goes.

She's drinking down his laughter
And she don't half love a drink.
For someone I never gave half a thought to
He don't have make me think.

And somewhere in the corner
He's telling her a joke
And I had to stick the boot in
Because that's not how it goes.

You've got it wrong,
You've got it wrong,
Don't make me tell you girl.

She's crying when I tell her
He won't bother us no more
And it'll give us time to wonder
If he's ever lied before.

And somewhere in the corner
I'm telling her a joke
And she was crying laughing
Because that's exactly how it goes.
