Everybody's fucked up off the beat
The words are in our mouths, but we don't speak
Boarded up the windows in the house

Another generation bleeding out

Don't want no part of this
It's none of the above
Don't want no part of this
It's none of the above
Don't want no

Take me to church
Cause I've been blessed with a curse
Are you wrapped in a limo and then left in a hearse?
They're speaking in tongues
Feels like we're coming undone

Don't want no part of this
It's none of the above

(N.O. N. E. of the A.B.O.V.E.)

Blocking out the static in our heads
We are still alive and playing dead
We don't need a reason for our doubts
Another generation screaming out

Don't want no part of this
It's none of the above
None of the above

Take me to church
Cause I've been blessed with a curse
Are you wrapped in a limo and then left in a hearse?
They're speaking in tongues

Feels like we're coming undone
Don't want no part of this
It's none of the above

(N.O. N. E. of the A.B.O.V.E.)

Don't want no part of this it's none of the above

Take me to church
Cause I've been blessed with a curse
Are you wrapped in a limo and then left in a hearse?
They're speaking in tongues

Feels like we're coming undone
Don't want no part of this
It's none of the above

None of the above
