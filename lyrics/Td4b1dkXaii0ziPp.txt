Burn the books they've got too many names and psychoses
All this incriminating evidence would surely haunt me
If someone broke into my house

Suits in the living room
Do you realize guys I was born in 1974
We've got someone here to explain your publishing
We know how much you love to be in front of audiences

Hopeful you are
Schoolbound you are
Naive you are
Driven you are

Take a trip to new york with your guardian
And your fake identification
When they say "is there something anything
You'd like to know young lady?"
You said "yes I'd like to know what kind of people
I'll be dealing with"

Precocious you are
Headstrong you are
Terrified you are
Ahead of your time you are

Don't mind our staring but
We're surprised you're not in - in a far-gone asylum
We're surprised you didn't crack up
Lord knows that we would've
We would've liked to have been there
But you keep pushing us away
Resilient you are
Big time you are
Ruthless you are
Precious you are
