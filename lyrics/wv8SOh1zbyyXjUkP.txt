Stay, least I won't be on my own to fight it
Go, least I know there won't be fights if I'm alone
Playing everything we had like dominoes
Playing everything we had

I don't wanna let you go
So why'd you go and burn this thing?
I pretend that you're my home
But you never let me in
Trying to beat you to the shore
Even though I know you'll win
Why we even keeping score?
Guess it's your favourite game

I know, I know where this will end
You'll let me bleed and tell all your friends
I won't, I won't let you again
Let you again
Let you again

Not again
Not again
Not again
Not again
Not again
Not again

I won't, I won't let you again

Throw
Throwing all your words around they're just for show

Did it take you by surprise that I'm worth more?
And now the only thing you have is what you owe
Guess that's the only thing you have

I don't wanna let you go
So why'd you go and burn this thing?
I pretend that you're my home
But you never let me in
Trying to beat you to the shore
Even though I know you'll win
Why we even keeping score?
When I don't wanna play this game

I know, I know where this will end
You'll let me bleed and tell all your friends
But I won't, I won't let you again
Let you again
Let you again

Not again
Not again
Not again
Not again
Not again
Not again

I won't, I won't let you again

You tell me I'm not worth the fight
Even though you stay the night
When you know that I'm dying
(whoa-whoa-whoa)

I keep jumping from this height
Why'd I even board the flight?
Why am I even trying?
(whoa-whoa-whoa)

I know I need to let you go

Can't pretend that you're my home

We keep running for the shore

And I don't even know what for

I know, I know where this will end
You'll let me bleed and tell all your friends
(Tell your friends I)
I won't, I won't let you again
Let you again
Let you again

Not again
Not again
Not again
Not again
Not again
Not again

I won't, I won't let you again
