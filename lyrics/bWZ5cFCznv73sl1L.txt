When I think of
Fates worse than death
All I can think of
Is something you said
You said we were golden
Bright like the sun
And now I am stranded
Knowing I'm not the one

An ocean of anger
Flowing through me
Bloodstained and broken
From what I failed to see
And just like a snake charmer
You led me astray
Living in distress
Hoping help was on the way

In the midst of the storm
Searching for shelter
I came upon
One single feather
A half-hearted wish
For something better
Gracefully cursed
I thirst

Attached to the soil
I'm dyed in the wool
There's iron in my blood
Yet so vulnerable
But after I'm gone
Once I finally leave
You will be left alone
To the wolves and the thieves

In the midst of the storm
Searching for shelter
I came upon
One single feather
A half-hearted wish
For something better
Gracefully cursed
I thirst

Gracefully cursed
I thirst
Gracefully cursed
I thirst
I thirst
