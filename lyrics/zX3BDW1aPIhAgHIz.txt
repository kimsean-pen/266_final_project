Sundown it's time to feed it
Your demons come to life
You try but can't defeat them
It's over say goodnight
I see you shiver
We're running out of time
It's now or never
I'm reaching for the knife

And I see a new day rising
As we divide

Separate my soul
Watch as you expose
All this violence
Out of control
Cancer in my bones
You wont let me go
So it's you I sever

Wake up the moon is rising
You feel the other side
Tonight you face the dying
There's nowhere left to hide
The taste so bitter
But it will wash away
I will deliver
The sickness to the grave

And I see a new day rising
As we divide

Separate my soul
Watch as you expose
All this violence
Out of control
Cancer in my bones
You wont let me go
So it's you I sever

I cut the ties
I've been betrayed
My flesh and soul are still at war

I shed the skin underneath
I feel the light
Set me free

Separate my soul
Watch as you expose
All this violence
Out of control
Cancer in my bones
You wont let me go
So it's you I sever
I see a new day rising!
All this violence
So it's you I sever!
I see a new day rising!
All this violence.
It's you I sever
It's you I sever!
It's you I sever.
