Left and right, they're calling me back home
And I've heard their cuts, I've felt it in my bones
Left and right, they choke me tight, I over war and outta sight
And I've heard their cuts, I've felt it in my bones

Been searching for a long time in this town
But looking for a gold mine so we can get out
To finer days, we'll waste away
Another day that goes by, another car
We know we should be grateful but sometimes it's hard
We're so alone, but it's not for long

Well maybe will be dissolve
Careful what you wish for now
Nothing lasts forever, time will always take its toll
And if a broken home is on the shelf
We know what we should ask ourselves
Were we ever happy acting in a family role?

Been dreaming of those bright lights in the city
Wake up with a cold fright, oh what a pity
A bad night's sleep, the force is weak
You're longing for a partner to get you through
Wishing that in time, you'll find someone
To hold onto

But maybe will be dissolve
Careful what you wish for now
Nothing lasts forever, time will always take its toll
And if a broken home is on the shelf
We know what we should ask ourselves
Were we ever happy acting in a family role?

Heavens have you seen, the news that's on the screen?
It's all violence, heart ache and misery
Heavens have you seen, what they have done to me?
I'm a hallow shell from the grim 90's

Maybe will be dissolve
Careful what you wish for now
Nothing lasts forever, time will always take its toll
And if a broken home is on the shelf
We know what we should ask ourselves
Were we ever happy acting in a family role?
