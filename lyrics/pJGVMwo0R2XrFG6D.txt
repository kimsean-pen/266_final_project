Put on the skin I borrowed
Colours that I kept
Follow the rhythms heartbeat
Into the wild
Beast upon the stage now
Driven by the flesh
Bringing out the future
Into the wild

And you search a way
Worth to loose
And you search your way
Pick it out
Into the wild

Turning my head and see you
Glances that we left
Resting the fading hours
Into the wild
Beast upon the stage now
Driven by the flesh
Digging out beginnings
Into the wild

And you know a way
Worth to loose
And you know your way
Bring it out
Into the wild

Put on the skin I borrowed
Colours that I kept
Follow the rhythms heartbeat
Turning my head and see you
Glances that we left
Resting the fading hours
Into the wild

And you search your way
Worth to loose
And you search your way

And you found your way
Worth to loose
And you found your way
