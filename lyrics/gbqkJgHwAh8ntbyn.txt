And nothing is written in the book, reality is made by you
And every lie that you pursue, eventually turns true
And I was told that your eyes would shine, a light up into space
And infinity would then consume this ordinary place
You know nothing, you know nothing at all
How could you know, you'll never know anything at all
You'll never know, you'll never know anything at all
You know nothing, you know nothing at all
I saw you standing in the fire, beneath a crimson moon
The ocean whispered on the sore, and echoed in the ruins
Inside your body is a clear blue light
And time was made from this
Your shadows swallow everything it feels
You punish us with bliss
You know nothing, you know nothing at all
How could you know, you'll never know anything at all
You'll never know, you'll never know anything at all
You know nothing, you know nothing at all
