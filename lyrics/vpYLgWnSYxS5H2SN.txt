Played it over in my mind
Repeat it like my favourite song
On and on as if I'm haunted
You kept me holding on
Leave the city glow behind
Leave it there where they belong
Getting close to what I wanted
I wanted for so long

Feeling the colours as they flow now
Brilliant splendor, overload now
Was losing myself here in this moment
When it came to me

I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here

I made it here on my own
Sometimes alone is all I feel
So far from where I started
And now it feels so clear

Chasing this for so long
Follow close when they appear
So close to what I wanted
I wanted all these years

Feeling the colours as they flow now
Brilliant splendor, overload now
Was losing myself here in this moment
When it came to me

I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here

And then this moment feels so clear
So clear to me
I wish you were here
And then this moment feels so clear

I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here

I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
