I was in the shower so I could not tell my nose was bleeding
Dripped down my body to the floor right below my feet and
Looked in the mirror at my face, I thought I had a disease

And there's a woman with her fingers in my ice box
She peeked around the corner and asked me if I'm okay
She put the ice up on my tongue and then it melted away

Alright
Oak floor, soft pine bedroom door, yeah
Speak easy, make her mine if she's bored, yeah
And there's dry pine ceiling that is out of my reach

I woke up and my hands were gone, yeah
I looked down and my legs were long gone
I fell for her with my shoulder, but there was nobody there

I thought she left a note, just the tag of the pillow there
And then I noticed there's a rag next to my ear
The clock was ringing, but it wasn't nothing that I could hear

Alright
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

Sometimes someone controls everything about you
And when they tell you that they just can't live without you
They ain't lyin', they'll take pieces of you
And they'll stand above you and walk away
That's right and take a part of you with them
