I got a little bird, I'm gonna take her home.
Put her in a cage and disconnect the phone.

If you give me a look, I'm gonna get the book.
I'm gonna preach the word, I wanna preach to birds as I walk the floor.
Yeah, this I know.

When I get you home, this is how it goes.
I got nothing to lose, I'll never let you go.
