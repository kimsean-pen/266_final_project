I am not the first one
Of the huntin of the prey
Can I get motion
Can I live another day
I dont want pressure
I dont need everyone to fall
I just want to be there
Want to be there when you call
Take your time
Take your time
To decide if you are mine
Yeah I know that its hard and your eyes are full of dark
Take your time
Take your time
To decide if you are mine
Theres a price to evolve and you're not forever young
'Cause its a lonely lonely lonely life
its a lonely lonely lonely life
its a lonely lonely lonely life
its a lonely lonely lonely life
You seem so nervous
all your feelings in your face
I wish I could help you
To not feel so out of place
I am under pressure
Will I miss you when you're gone
and all of your pleasures
Hope to kneel before the dawn
yeah
Take your time
Take your time
To decide if you are mine
Yeah I know that its hard and your eyes are full of dark
Take your time
Take your time
To decide if you are mine
Theres a price to evolve and you're not forever young
'Cause its a lonely lonely lonely life
its a lonely lonely lonely life
its a lonely lonely lonely life
its a lonely lonely lonely life
'Cause its a lonely lonely lonely life
its a lonely lonely lonely life
its a lonely lonely lonely life
