"bang!" goes another kanga
On the bonnet of the van
"see the light ram through the gaps in the land."
Many an aborigine's mistaken for a tree
'til you near him on the motorway
And the tree begin to breathe
"see the light ram through the gaps in the land."
("ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha")
Coming in with the golden light
In the morning
Coming in with the golden light
Is the new man
Coming in with the golden light
Is my dented van

The civilised keep alive
The territorial war
"see the light ram through the gaps in the land."
Erase the race that claim the place
And say we dig for ore
Or dangle devils in a bottle
And push them from the
Pull of the bush
"see the light ram through the gaps in the land."
You find them in the road
"see the light bounce off the rocks to the sand."
In the road
Coming in with the golden light
In the morning
Coming in with the golden light
With no warning
Coming in with the golden light
We bring in the rigging
Dig, dig, dig, dig away
"dree-ee-ee-ee-ee-

Ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-

Ma-ma-many an aborigine's mistaken for a tree
("la, la, oo-ooh!")
"see the light ram through the gaps in the land."
You near him on the motorway
And the tree begin to breathe
Erase the race that claim the place
And say we dig for ore
"see the light ram through the gaps in the land."
Dangle devils in a bottle
And push them from the pull of the bush
"see the sun set in the hand of the man."
"bang!" goes another kanga
On the bonnet of the van
"see the light bounce off the rocks to the sand."
You find them in the road
"see the light ram through the gaps in the land."
In the road
"see the light."
("push 'em from the")
Pull of the bush
"see the light bounce off the rocks to the sand."
("push 'em from the")
Pull of the bush
"see the sunset in the hand of the man."
("oh, re mikayina!")
