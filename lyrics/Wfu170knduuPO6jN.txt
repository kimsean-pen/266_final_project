this is hard to say, I wanna make sure I go about this in the right way
cause lately I been busy a lot
and I know you don't feel appreciated and what not
I use to tell you that your hair look fly
kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
now I talk real foul and slick
every other sentence is you make me sick
back in the days I was your number one pick
now your heart's half broken and that's hard to fix
I had to dig deep inside myself
cause I can't see you bouncin with somebody else
it's a long journey back to the place we was
when I was too embarassed to admit I was in love
and you was a good girl that wouldn't give it up

I can't let her self destruct, uh uh

when I think about the things we did
and I think about you havin my kids
and I think about us sharin a crib, losin all that god forbid
you deserve flowers and candy the simple things
in addiction to the sl's, baguettes and rings
instead I walk around line I'm a king
and havin you ain't nothin but a thing (only a thing)
I need to stop tellin you the lovin was good
too busy frontin in the hood
baby girl, hold me tight don't ever let go
I'm a do it real gentle baby nice and slow
one more chance baby and don't say no
cause I got another side to show
some say love is painful it helps you grow
well it's time for the pain to go you know

this a brand new me, a brand new you
a brand new day, sky so blue
hold my hand while I walk with you
sit on my lap let me talk to you
no more games callin you foul names
actin like females is all the same
I'm gon love you better my mentality changed
from this day forward I'll never be the same
I'm a rub your lower back, share my dreams
I love you let me show you what I mean
give you the deepest love a girl ever seen
watch you sleep so peaceful and serene
a toast to the queen your back in my life
but this time I'm a do it right
trust me, from the bottom of my heart
nothin's gonna tear us apart I promise
