I wanna be a great one
I wanna be a great one
I wanna make a million dollars
Making all my days count
Clowning with my day ones
Before, I hid the grey sun
Louis V, don't chase none
I wanna make a billion dollars
Bring it to my pops
Say, "Daddy what you prayed for"

What is life? What is love?
What are lies? What is trust?
What is everything?
Everything is nothing without you
What is life? What is love?
What are lies? What is trust?
What is everything?
Everything is nothing without you

Nothing, nothing, nothing
Everything is nothing without you
Without you, without you
Running, I'm running

I'm running outta patience
I wanna be a great one
And when the spirit calls me
I wanna throw my hands up
Ready to be saved, yeah
And when my day's done
I hope I die faded
Wanna take me way up
I hope I fly faded

What is life? What is love?
What is time? What is choice?
What is everything?
Everything is nothing without you
What is life? What is love?
I hope I am enough
What is everything?
Everything is nothing without you

Nothing without, nothing without you
Nothing without you (Everything is nothing without you)
