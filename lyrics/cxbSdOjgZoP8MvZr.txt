I know your name but I won't tell
We must keep this secret well
Privacy's hard to find
Eyes are watching all the time

Everybody wants to know our love
Everybody talks about our love
Everybody wants to know your name
To know your name

Everybody needs to criticize
But none of them are even in our lives
Everybody wants to know your name
To know your name

Can't get out, can't get through
Need to be alone with you
Must escape or are we allowed
No part of privacy

Everybody wants to know our love
Everybody talks about our love
Everybody wants to know your name
To know your name

Everybody needs to criticize
But none of them are even in our lives
Everybody wants to know your name
To know your name

Can't the boys with the zooms give this girl just a second
See the man that I love needs a little sweet attention
I don't want to seem harsh but this girl's under pressure
I can't go through losing you again

I need to breathe just one breath
Walls are closing in so fast
Privacy's hard to find
Eyes are watching all the time

Everybody wants to know our love
Everybody talks about our love
Everybody wants to know your name
To know your name

Everybody needs to criticize
But none of them are even in our lives
Everybody wants to know your name
To know your name

Everybody wants to know our love
Everybody talks about our love
Everybody wants to know your name
To know your name

Everybody needs to criticize
But none of them are even in our lives
Everybody wants to know your name
To know your name

Everybody wants to know
Everybody wants to know
Everybody wants to know
