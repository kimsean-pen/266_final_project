It's not as if New York City
Burnt down to the ground
Once you drove away
It's not as if the sun won't shine
When clouds up above
Wash the blues away

Are we breakin' up? (Breakin' up)
Are we breakin' up? (Breakin' up)
Is there trouble between you and I?
Did my heart break enough? (Break enough)
Did it break enough (Break enough)
This time?

Here's to all the pretty words
We will never speak
Here's to all the pretty girls
You're gonna meet

Am I breakin' up? (Breakin' up)
Am I breakin' up? (Breakin' up)
Is there trouble on the line?
Did your heart break enough? (Break enough)
Did it break enough (Break enough)
This time?

Ooh, it feels good to be free
Ooh, it feels good to be free
Ooh, it feels good to be free

Betrayal is a thorny crown
You wear it well
Just like a king
Revenge is the saddest thing
Honey, I'm afraid to say
You deserve everything

Am I breakin' up? (Breakin' up)
Are we breakin' up? (Breakin' up)
Is there trouble between the lines?
Did your heart break enough? (Break enough)
Did it break enough (Break enough)
This time?

Ooh, it feels good to be free
Ooh, it feels good to be free
Ooh, it feels good to be free

Ooh, it feels good to be free
Ooh, it feels good to be free
Ooh, it feels good to be free
Ooh, it feels good to be free
Ooh, it feels good to be free
Ooh, it feels good to be free
Ooh, it feels good to be free
Ooh, it feels good to be free
Ooh, it feels good to be free
Ooh, it feels good to be free
