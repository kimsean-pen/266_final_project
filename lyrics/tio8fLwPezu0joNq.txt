Do you think that you know me?
Do you think that I'm alive and doing well?
You must know me better than myself
It's not hard to listen
And take for granted that you know what you're talking about
And that you know me better than myself
People want to know, but i'm not talking
People want to know, but I'm not talking
I know that you're talking
Put em up put em up put em up
I know that you're talking because i got your phone call
