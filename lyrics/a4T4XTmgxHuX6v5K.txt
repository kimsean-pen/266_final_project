Another rude awakening
The hard life that's been our school
More of a cruel day's reckonings
Our prime time used up too soon

There is no kindness to waste
Why help those crying for more?
It spins you around, takes you for a ride
What is the point to even try?
Somehow got to learn to accept the rejection

The tired thoughts from troubling
A weary mind from worrying
Your constant fears upon wakening
Your real life left in your dreams

There is no kindness to waste
Why help those crying for more?
It spins you around, takes you for a ride
What is the point to even try?
Somehow got to learn to accept the rejection

Accept the rejection
Accept the rejection
(Yeah)

Another
Another

Another rude awakening
The hard life that's been our school
More of a cruel day's reckonings
Our prime time used up too soon

There is no kindness to waste
Why help those crying for more?
It spins you around, takes you for a ride
What is the point to even try?
Somehow, some way, got to learn to accept the rejection

Accept the rejection
