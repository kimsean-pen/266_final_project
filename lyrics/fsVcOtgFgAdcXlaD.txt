Here come the mornin' and I'll say goodbye to you
Here come the mornin' and I'll say goodbye
But I don't turn around 'cause the reason is treason

See the stones comin' at my window
See they left me no protection
Tell his family that he won't be okay
K I L L

Check the angles from both forces
Overcome by the need to fight it
Fight it, fight it, fight it
Fight it, fight it, fight it
Fight it, fight it, fight it
Fight it, fight it, fight it, fight it

Here come the mornin' and I'll say goodbye to you
Here come the mornin' and I'll say goodbye
But I don't turn around 'cause the reason is treason

Here come the mornin' and I'll say goodbye to you
Here come the mornin' and I'll say goodbye
But I don't turn around 'cause the reason is treason

I hear the sounds of, oh oh woo
I hear the sounds of, oh oh woo
I hear the sounds of, oh oh woo
I hear the sounds of, oh oh woo

I hear the sounds of, oh oh woo
I hear the sounds of, oh oh woo
I hear the sounds of, oh oh woo
I hear the sounds of, oh oh woo ah

Here come the mornin' and I'll say goodbye to you
Here come the mornin' and I'll say goodbye
But I don't turn around 'cause the reason is treason

Here come the mornin' and I'll say goodbye to you
