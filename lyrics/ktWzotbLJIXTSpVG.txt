I wish that we were both somebody else
So you wouldn't be somebody else's
I don't wanna lay here by myself
Ain't afraid to say I'm selfish

Don't wanna lie to you, I don't wanna promise something
Knowin' I can come through, touch over this discussion
Knowin' the rules

Too close, and then we're touching
Now we're both confused, well I am

Something in the way you smell
Something in the way you touch me
Maybe it's the way you wrap your arms around
Makes me wanna' lay you down, and tell you all the things we could be
Tell me that you need me now, even though it's not allowed

I wish that we were both somebody else
So you wouldn't be somebody else's
I don't wanna lay here by myself
Hope you forgive me about it, I'm selfish
I wish that we were both somebody else
So you wouldn't be somebody else's
I don't wanna lay here by myself
Ain't afraid to say I'm selfish

Window to my soul and now you know my weakness
Arms fallin', both eyes closed, I'll tell no one your secrets
Something we can't control, you leave me with no defense
Only I think I know, is I'm lost

Something in the way you smell
Something in the way you touch me
Maybe it's the way you wrap your arms around
Makes me wanna lay you down, and tell you all the things we could be
Tell me that you need me now, even though it's not allowed

I wish that we were both somebody else
So you wouldn't be somebody else's
I don't wanna lay here by myself
Hope you forgive me about it, I'm selfish
I wish that we were both somebody else
So you wouldn't be somebody else's
I don't wanna lay here by myself

Til I'm yours, I'm in too deep now
Don't let me breathe, your love won't be found
My everything, you're all I need now
Someone else is without you, and no one else waiting around
Til I'm yours, I'm in too deep now
Don't let me breathe, my love won't be found
My everything, you're all I need now
Someone else is without you, and no one else waiting around

I wish that we were both somebody else
So you wouldn't be somebody else's
I don't wanna lay here by myself
Ain't afraid to say I'm selfish
