I see you changing girl
From Day to Day
Impressed by and trying to imitate
Those who are older
Those who are colder
Suddenly embarrassed by your age

Our bigger blessing, girl
Is being young
The power of not knowing
Where you belong

I try so hard to keep it
Not to lose that secret
Waiting for someone like you
To come along

Maybe it was me
That made you old
Stole whatever it was that
Made you glow
A little touch of something
A lot of work for nothing
And now our heart, once open,
Will be closed
