Got a problem giving people what they want
Can't seem to tell them no anymore
And as crazy; crazy as it sounds
Happiness abounds when I'm told

When to sit
How to eat
When to live
When to sleep
How to walk
When to talk
Somebody Please
Tell me

Yeah I know, pathetic as it is
I can't really help being like this
Mostly it's hazy
There's a reason I should quit
It's medically unfit or so I'm told

When to speak
How to walk
What to eat
Where to sleep
How to resist
The urgent response
When to kiss
When I come home
