All at the top
He's a legend by my head
Tell me what is good and I'll sure leave out the rest

And when the freaks are calling in monotone
Need to tell everyone because I'm so unsure
Yeah I'm so unsure

Started up again
Taboo indeed
I don't have a will
Such a pollyanna

Being positive
And forget about myself
Thought that love is dull
But it doesn't mean it's different
And I'm not fucking around
Yeah, I'm blocking you out
Yeah, I'm blocking you out

Started up again
Taboo indeed
I don't have a will
Such a pollyanna
Started up again
Taboo
Indeed
I don't have a will
Such a pollyanna
Such a pollyanna
