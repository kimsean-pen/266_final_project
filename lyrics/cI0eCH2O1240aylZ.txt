She knew she was able to fly
Because when she came down
She had dust on her hands from the sky
She said I touched a cloud
She felt so high
The dust made her cry
She knew she could fly like a bird
But when she said
'Please raise the roof higher' nobody heard
They never noticed a word
The light bulbs burn
Her fingertips will learn
Why should it feel like a crime?
If I want to be
With you all the time
Why is it measured in hours?
You should make your own time
You're welcome in mine
She knew she was able to fly
Because when she came down
She had dust from her hands on the sky
She said I touched a cloud
Her fingers will learn
The lightbulbs burn
