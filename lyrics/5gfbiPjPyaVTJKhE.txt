Knock knock, here we go.
She wanna play again, but a nigga ain't gone go.
She go from the safe house to the trap house, then back to my front door.
She on the same old shit, wanna see a nigga fall.
Now here we go again.
But I like it though
(yeah, yeah)
Every man love a good thang, hard to let it go (yeah, yeah)
Forget what they say, they know how the game go
(yeah, yeah)
And i aint that nigga that's gone be chasing no, i know how the game go.
(yeah, yeah)

(Chorus Ã—2)
Roses pretty red, she love to keep me going, playing with my head.
She know a nigga ain't got time for it.
Roses pretty red, she love to keep me going, playing with my head.
But a nigga in love with it.

She wanna go left, i wanna go right
And I don't know; if she really down, or just for the hype.
And I be going through her pictures; double tapping, showing i like.
Whats the use of having venom baby if you never gone bite, she never reply.
But I like it though
(yeah, yeah)
Every man love a good thang, hard to let it go (yeah, yeah)
Forget what they say, they know how the game go
(yeah, yeah)
And i aint that nigga that's gone be chasing no, i know how the game go.
(yeah, yeah)

Roses pretty red, she love to keep me going, playing with my head.
She know a nigga ain't got time for it.
Roses pretty red, she love to keep me going, playing with my head.
But a nigga in love with it.

But everytime that shes gone, feeling some way all alone. Its like when i call she never call back, but she at every one of my shows.

Roses pretty red, she love to keep me going, playing with my head.
She know a nigga ain't got time for it.
Roses pretty red, she love to keep me going, playing with my head.
But a nigga in love with it.
Roses pretty red, she love to keep me going, playing with my head.

Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na,
Na, na, na, na, na.
