I show the scars
of every fear and doubt
I hurt myself
to let the darkness out
out...

the days go by
and nothing brings me joy
the glow was strong
when I was a boy
but it's gone

and the glow
it goes
so slow
it goes

cracks appear
and passion slips away
colors fade
and turn to shades of grey
fade away

and the glow...

if you knew the man I used to be
please hold me under the sea
or scratch my arms till they bleed
save me
will you help me to feel the glow?
