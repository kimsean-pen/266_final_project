Sometimes I see something that, you know
And I'm compelled, you know, to write about it
Other times are just pure fantasy, fantasy, fantasy, fantasy

Yes, oh, I can't wait 'til I see you too, baby
Uh, huh
Yeah, I think I want you

I'mma put your hands up, touch your body
Love it when I electrify ya
I'mma put your hands up, touch your body
Love it when I electrify ya

Electrify me, electrify me
Electrify me, electrify me
Electrify me, electrify me
Electrify me, electrify me

You electrify me, I just can't get over you, baby (electrify ya)
You electrify me, I just can't get over you, baby (electrify ya)

You electrify me, I just can't get over you, baby
You electrify me, I just can't get over you, baby

You electrify me, I just can't get over you, baby
You electrify me, I just can't get over you, baby
