From the sorrow we created
A fragile state of blood and whim
Made for rich men in their white skin
People bolder than I
Stood up to the lie
That equality has left! My! My!
But it leaves no doubt in my mind
I've been reading the news and you'll surely regret
If you don't give us the ballot, expect the bayonet!
Well, expect the bayonet! Yeah! Yeah!
Expect the bayonet!

Don't say I didn't warn ya
Cos for every man high upon the hog
There's a dogwood forest buried in the fog
How naked is your eye?
Do you ever wonder why
You're being asked to recompense
When it's the last sign of your defence?
So you better resolve or you'll surely regret
If you don't give us the ballot, expect the bayonet!
Well, expect the bayonet! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

When the name came down
I covered my ears afraid of the sound
But we got the power to take back our nights
Give up our silence and give up our time alone...

We're not on out own!
Though violent minds hatch violent plans
For many it's the only thing they understand
When the dog whistle is ringing
It's the currency that they deal in
So before the world's been reduced to soot
Solidarity for those underfoot
And I better remind you or you'll surely regret
If you don't give us the ballot, expect the bayonet!
Oh well, expect the bayonet! Yeah! Yeah!
Expect the bayonet!
Oh well, expect the bayonet! Yeah! Yeah!
Expect the bayonet!
Oh well, expect the bayonet! Yeah! Yeah!
Expect the bayonet!
