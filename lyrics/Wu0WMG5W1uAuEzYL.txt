Keep it to myself
No way
He knows
What I know
He feels
What I feel
I'll tell the world
About the love that I found
Keep it to myself
No way
He sees
What I see
He feels
What I feel
I'll tell the world
About the love that I found
Keep it to myself
No way
He has
What no one else has
He knows
What no one else knows
I'll tell the world
About the love
The love
The love
That I found
