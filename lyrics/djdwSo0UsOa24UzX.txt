Oh my god
You my kin, you my blood
We smokin', it's been good
A-T-L neighborhood
Oh my god
You my kin, you my blood
We smokin', it's been good
A-T-L neighborhood
My fucking god, these niggas sleepy or what?
We'll go and smoke out your spot
Tonight is cool if you want
She seen the video, she want to fuck
Your girl won't stop calling me, that's just a part of it
Do what I want with it, spend what I want on it
Give me face and weed, practice what you preach
Keep that blade on me, don't run from police
Catch you in my streets, Southside where I sleep
I been living in Atlanta for free
Dreaming 'bout FADER when I was 15
2001 got it tatted on me
Girl what you mean?
I can't fuck with you unless you fuck with Yung Lean
I been smoking in Atlanta for free
Fuck what you think, Danger Inc
Damn
This ain't what it's like to be in real life
This is Danger Inc
Oh my god
You my kin, you my blood
We smokin', it's been good
A-T-L neighborhood
Oh my god
You my kin, you my blood
We smokin', it's been good
A-T-L neighborhood
Oh my god
