I sorta like deceiving
And all this tragic loss
I wanna find some patience
But kill the feelings off
I wanna drown in praise
But never really deliver
I wanna feel insane, insane

So long to go, you know

No matter how I cling to life
I'm not fooling anyone
I'm not original anymore
I'm not original anymore
And when the well is dead and dry
I'll keep begging you to start a war
Oh, I'm not original anymore
I'm not original anymore

Do I start it over
Before I self-destruct?
What's the perfect way to say I'm lost? I just give up
Yeah, I wanna try and change (I wanna try and change)
The vanity in the mirror
I know you feel the same, insane

So long to go, you know

No matter how I cling to life
I'm not fooling anyone
I'm not original anymore
I'm not original anymore
And when the well is dead and dry
I'll keep begging you to start a war
Oh, I'm not original anymore
I'm not original anymore

I'm not original anymore

One by one, they fall
Use your words for war
Chasing open doors
For what it's worth

No matter how I cling to life
I'm not fooling anyone
I'm not original anymore
I'm not original anymore
And when the well is dead and dry
I'll keep begging you to start a war
I'm not original anymore
I'm not original anymore
