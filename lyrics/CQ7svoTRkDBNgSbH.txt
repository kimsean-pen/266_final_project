Yeah!

Yeah, you've heard that I was dead
And now you can't get me out of your head
Yeah, you thought that I was gone
But I've been waiting to say this for so long

You know you really make me sick
We used that line because the truth is
While you dug your pit and built a bridge
Walked across and now you're over it

I hope it keeps you up at night

You hate for sake
There's no stopping me you're getting in my way
One day you will realize that you're to blame
And I'm begging every stop to sync
What's heading you is built strafing me
Strafing me

Oh, bring the heat
I'm forcing fame

Every stick and stone you threw at me
Must convict me as you're growing weak
I'll fade a lesson in each one you cast
It'll turn your house into a pile of glass

I hope it keeps you up at night
Yeah, yeah I hope it never leaves your mind

You hate for sake
There's no stopping me you're getting in my way
One day you will realize that you're to blame
You hate for sake
There's no stopping me you're getting in my way
One day you will realize that you're to blame
And I'm begging every stop to sync
What's heading you is built strafing me

I hope it keeps you up at night
Yeah, yeah I hope it never leaves your mind
I hope it keeps you up at night
Yeah, yeah I hope it never leaves your mind

Bring the heat
Bring the heat
