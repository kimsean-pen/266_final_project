Oh-woah, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-woah, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

B-b-be careful making wishes in the dark, dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark, mark
And besides in the mean-meantime
I'm just dreaming of tearin' you apart
I'm in the deep details with the devil
So now the world can never get me on my level
I just gotta get you off the cage
I'm a young lover's rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite

My songs know what you did in the dark
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
Oh-woah, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I-In the dark, dark
Oh-woah, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I-In the dark, dark

Writers keep writing what they (Write)
Somewhere another pretty vein just (Died, died)
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me (For me)
A constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love, then burn the ashes
In the end everythin' collides
My childhood spat back out the monster that you see

My songs know what you did in the dark
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
Oh-woah, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I-In the dark, dark
Oh-woah, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I-In the dark, dark

My songs know what you did in the dark (Oh-woah, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
My songs know what you did in the dark (Oh-woah, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire

Oh-woah, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I-In the dark, dark
Oh-woah, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I-In the dark, dark
Oh-woah, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
