Tortured self worth, abstracts of wrath, released from attachment human reaction. Muted unable to
realize images of your designs soul sacrifice a blessing to me, carve me from your memories. Deep
impressions my depths, worthless as each breath, worlds within words of half truth my fears of losing
you. I'll pour scorn from the lowest place colour fades from your face. Annihilation acceptance.
Paradox of self existence.
