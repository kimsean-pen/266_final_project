set you heart at a pace no one could follow
until its right in the face no one would swallow

we the subtle damned, refuse to follow
and we are determined to control

so many hours in the day in which you'll suffer
the saviour you delegate just basks in power

we the subtle damned, refuse to follow
and we are determined to control

we've lost it all
we breed contempt
with years to go a wealth of debt
a simple retreat
