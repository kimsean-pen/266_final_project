Love the peace when I feel alone
It's a part of me that I never run from
Black and white, playing clean surround
Feet on the ground, but I hate it down there

Hot and cold, young and old
All the more I know, the less I feel right
Hot and cold, young and old
All the more I know, the less I feel

I'm high and I'm low, no control
But everything's looking peach
I'm high and I'm low, no control
But everything's looking peach

So I don't need it all when it feels like old
'Cause everything's looking peach now
No I don't need it all when it feels like old
'Cause everything's looking peach now

Hate the feel when I'm in the crowd
It's a part of me, I can never run from
The colour's bright, playing in surround
Pull me off the ground where the air is so clear

Hot and cold, young and old
All the more I know, the less I feel right

I'm high and I'm low, no control
But everything's looking peach
I'm high and I'm low, no control
But everything's looking peach now

So I don't need it all when it feels like old
'Cause everything's looking peach now
No I don't need it all when it feels like old
'Cause everything's looking peach now

I know it's hard to see me down
I cry and cry upon the ground
A simple price I pay for all the love I feel when I'm okay
I know it's hard to see me down
I cry and cry upon the ground
A simple price I pay for all the love I feel

I'm high and I'm low, no control
But everything's looking peach now

So I don't need it all when it feels like old
'Cause everything's looking peach now
No I don't need it all when it feels like old
'Cause everything's looking peach now

Now, now, now, now, now
Everything's looking peach now, now
Everything's looking peach now, now
