Absence makes the heart grow fonder
But it's taking me under
Since you're not here
Oh, and I feel so all alone tonight

It's better when it's harder to get
But this hide and go seek
Is making me weep
Oh, we call over now

I promise to stop boxing you round
So don't scratch my face
End of the eight
Oh, the fight is all over now

We need to get our act together
Take it off the street
Bring it on home and drop them guns on the floor

Love wars (No, we don't need)

The talks we have don't change a thing
They only bring rain
On top of pain
Oh, it's raining in my heart now

Flashbacks and uncovered tracks
From when you left
With my best friend

We need to get our act together
Take it off the street
Bring it on home and drop them guns on the floor

Make love and peace
And, baby, never cheat
Vow to be strong and let the band roll on
And stop these

Love wars (We don't need)
Love wars (Love wars)
Love wars (And be strong now)
Love wars (Ow!)

Love wars (We don't need)
Love wars (Love wars)
Love wars (Could it be all over now?)
Love wars (Come on back home, darling)

Love bombs explodin' in air
Until the last one
I don't care

I remember losing my head
And calling you things
Like dirty names
Oh, and I feel bad about it, baby

We need to get our act together
Take it off the street
Bring it on home and drop them guns on the floor

Make love and peace
And, baby, never cheat
Vow to be strong and let the band roll on

Love wars (No!)
Love wars (We can't stand, no)
Love wars (Just come on out)
Love wars (I don't want no love wars)
