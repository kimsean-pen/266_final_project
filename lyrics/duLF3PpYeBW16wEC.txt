won't get too quaint
you'll build this town
when morning comes
you won't slow it down
like stars so bright, you burn all night
stay calm, stay cold
and you'll fly so high
yeah, you'll burn bright
yeah, you'll live free
and you fight all when you believe

oh, you're climbing straight to the top, straight to the top
nobody gonna stop you
you're climbing straight to the top, straight to the top
nobody gonna stop you
nothing holding you down, you're still up in the clouds
you're climbing straight to the top, straight to the top (no)

you fight, you flow, did you let it all go?
kick down, through 'em out, trying to shine like gold
trying to shine like gold
like stars so bright, you're burning up all night
stay calm, stay calm 'cause you're flying so high
('cause you're flying so high and never coming down)
yeah, you'll burn bright
yeah, you'll live free
and you fight all when you believe

oh, you're climbing straight to the top, straight to the top
nobody gonna stop you
you're climbing straight to the top, straight to the top
nobody gonna stop you
nothing holding you down, you're still up in the clouds
you're climbing straight to the top, straight to the top (no)

(cold, ooh)
slow down, that's what people tell you
slow down, but they never gonna stop you, no
'cause you're never gonna take it slow, take it slow
slow it down, that's what people tell you
slow it down, but they never gonna stop you, no
'cause you're never gonna take it slow

oh, you're climbing straight to the top, straight to the top
nobody gonna stop you
you're climbing straight to the top, straight to the top
nobody gonna stop you
nothing holding you down, you're still up in your clouds
you're climbing straight to the top, straight to the top (no)

oh, you're climbing straight to the top, la-la-la-la-la-la
nobody gonna stop you
you're climbing straight to the stop, straight to the top
nobody gonna stop you
nothing holding you down, you're still up in your clouds
you're climbing straight to the top, straight to the top (no)
are you ever coming down?
