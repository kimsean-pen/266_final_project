What's another burned bridge? Does it matter?
You weren't there, why do you care? End the chapter
Loose talk is the enemy of laughter
Light up my cigarette and wait for disaster

I wish there was a way to give it all away
From the hole where my heart used to be, just believe me

Don't go play by the water
They say you won't come back, don't go, you won't come back
Don't go looking for answers
They say you won't come back, don't go, you won't come back

Tried to warn you, you didn't listen
They say you won't come back, don't go, you won't come back
Don't go looking for answers
They say you won't come back, don't go, you won't come back

Back to the lake where I disposed of my body
Parts of me, she is resurfacing
And I, I just don't understand why's she got to talk so much, yeah
And I'm so tired of telling lies, oh, I want to go back, rewind, oh

I wish there was a way to give it all away
From the hole where my heart used to be, just believe me

Don't go play by the water
They say you won't come back, don't go, you won't come back
Don't go looking for answers
They say you won't come back, don't go, you won't come back

Tried to warn you, you didn't listen
They say you won't come back, don't go, you won't come back
Don't go looking for answers
They say you won't come back, don't go, you won't come back

There's no use in bringing up the past
No need to see where I've been
We can find a silver lining, see the best in all the worst things
We can find a silver lining, see the best in all the worst things

Don't go play by the water
Don't go looking for answers

Don't go play by the water
They say you won't come back, don't go, you won't come back
Don't go looking for answers
They say you won't come back, don't go, you won't come back

Tried to warn you, you didn't listen
They say you won't come back, don't go, you won't come back
Don't go looking for answers
They say you won't come back, don't go, you won't come back
