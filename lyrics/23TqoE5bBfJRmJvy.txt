What's wrong with me?
I get lonely in a crowd
Everyone is smiling
But I made myself left out

I got an imaginary shield around me
But nobody's ever really gotten through
I keep thinking that they're gonna break me free
But they never do
No

When somebody's knockin'
When somebody wants me
When somebody's tryin'
To love me completely
I get scared
Don't know how it works
Will somebody save me?
Or will I get burned?
Don't wanna get burned

Is there thickness in the air
Or are you heavy on my heart?
Why can't I just fit in?
Why can't I do what everyone else does?

People come around like a storm
When you least expect them to
For me, I run for cover
When I should really face the truth

When somebody's knockin'
When somebody wants me
When somebody's tryin'
To love me completely
I get scared
Don't know how it works
Will somebody save me?
Or will I get burned?
Don't wanna get burned

What's wrong with me?
I get lonely in a crowd
Everyone is smiling
But I made myself left out

When somebody's knockin'
When somebody wants me
When somebody's tryin'
To love me completely
I get scared
Don't know how it works
Will somebody save me?
Or will I get burned?
Don't wanna get burned

When somebody's knockin'
When somebody wants me
When somebody's tryin'
To love me completely
I get scared
Don't know how it works
Will somebody save me?
Or will I get burned?
Don't wanna get burned

I get scared
Don't know how it works
Will somebody save me?
Or will I get burned?
I get scared
Don't know how it works
Will somebody save me?
Or will I get burned?
I get scared
Don't know how it works
Will somebody save me?
Or will I get burned?
