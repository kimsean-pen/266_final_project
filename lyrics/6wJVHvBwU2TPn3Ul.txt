There's a story
I would like to tell
My problem is
It's one you know too well
It's one you know too well

Miss Suzy Lee
The one I'm speakin' of
The question is:
Is she the one I love?
Is she the one I love? (All right)

Is she the one I love?
Is she the one I love?

She'll send me flowers
With her tears burned inside
And you know what I'd do
I would run and hide
I would run and hide

And the paper
On it was my name
With the question:
"Do you feel the same?"
Do you feel the same?

To end this tale
The one I'm speakin' of
I wish I had an answer, but I just don't know
Is this really love?
Is this really love? (Yeah)

Is this really love?
Is this really love?
