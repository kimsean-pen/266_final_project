See them dancing in the night, in the night
Circle around a bright bonfire
Behold the scenes of witchery, witchery
Unravel before me
I can hear their endless screams, endless screams
Calling in my wildest dreams
Their calls remain a mystery, mystery unknown to me
Unfolding signs send shivers down my spine

There's a summoning at night
Around a bonfire, fierce and burning bright
I feel deranged with strange affright
I can hear them every night
With every dream they come alive

Falling down to the waking hours, waking hours
I can still hear distant howls
The perspiration on my brow, on my brow
All dawns on me now
And so the hours pass on by, pass on by
Another day long gone somehow
And in the hours of twilight, twilight it's all coming back
Unfolding signs send shivers down my spine

There's a summoning at night
Around a bonfire, fierce and burning bright
I feel deranged with strange affright
I can hear them every night
With every dream they come alive

There's a summoning at night
Around a bonfire, fierce and burning bright
I feel deranged with strange affright
I can hear them every night
With every dream they come alive

There's a summoning at night
Around a bonfire, fierce and burning bright
I feel deranged with strange affright
I can hear them every night
With every dream they come alive
I can hear them night after night
