I'm not thinking about if you're home alone
Walking around in my old t-shirt
I'm not thinking about if you're out with friends
Tryna act you when you flirt
I'm not thinking 'bout if when I walk out
You'll be standing at my door
And, out of all the things I do

I don't think about you, no, no
I don't think about you, oh no
I don't think about all the things that we've been through
Don't remember who broke up with who
Don't think about you, ohh
But I know you do
Yeah, I know you do

I don't care about all the promises
That eventually you broke
I don't care about all the words that you never say
Stuck in your throne
I don't care about if you're sorry now
And you're waiting by the phone
And, out of all the things I do

I don't think about you, no-oh
I don't think about you, oh no
I don't think about all the things that we've been through
Don't remember who broke up with who
Don't think about you, ohh
But I know you do

Oh-ohh
Yeah, I know you do
I know you do
Oh-oh

Yeah, I don't think about you
I don't think about you, ohh
I don't think about all the things that we've been through
Don't remember who broke up with who
Don't think about you, ohh
But I know you do

Ahh, yeah, I know you do
I know you do
Yeah, I know you do
But I still love you
