I have never been too bold
Keeping in the quiet and shade
I could run away with all my time
Wouldn't it feel the same

Oh, this is lonely territory
I've got miles and miles ahead
How I wish that I was lionhearted
And if you talk to me and I don't reply
I am way over here on the other side

I am going to find my head
Even if it takes all night
Even though I try my hardest
How I try with all my might

Oh, I'll be waiting on this hillside
I see miles and miles ahead
How I wish that I was lionhearted
And if you talk to me and I don't reply
I am way over here on the other side

What would life be like
With a lionheart inside
Instead of mine
Give me another

What would life be like
With a lionheart inside
Instead of mine
Give me another

What would life be like
(what would life be like)
With a lionheart inside
(lionheart inside)
Instead of mine
(instead of mine)
Give me another
