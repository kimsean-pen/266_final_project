Love child, how could anyone be mad at you?
Love child, how can someone put the blame on you?
To set them free?

Away from the pain, away from it all
Away from reality
Into the night, under the flood
Wet stain on history

Love child, why would someone put the shame on you?
Love child, why would anyone put hate on you?
Put blame on you

'Cause of the light, because of the shade
Love train in the summer rain
White as a dove, white as the snow
The stretch marks from the afterglow

Love child, how could be anyone mad at you?
Love child, how can someone put the blame on you?
The shame on you?

Love child, love child
Love child, love child

Away from the pain, away from it all
Away from reality
Into the night, under the flood
Wet stain on history

Love child, why would someone put the shame on you?
Love child, why would anyone put hate on you?
Put blame on you

Love child, love child
Love child, love child
