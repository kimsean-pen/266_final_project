London in the low tide of the night
And not a taxi cab in sight.
Anesthetized I start the journey home.
I've been living months alone.
I've been avoiding things -
the phone rings,
I use the answerphone.

Inside out in the daytime,
Outside in in the night time.
Inside out in the daytime,
Outside in in the night time.

When you're down and troubled
You don't tell your friends,
You don't tell your family.
I won't let them talk about me.
I'm gonna let nobody down.

Soho in the high tide of the day
And for a while I'm swept away -
I just forget it.
I use my walkman when I walk,
And I don't talk,
But later on the moment's gone and I don't get it.

Inside out in the daytime,
Outside in in the night time.
Inside out in the daytime,
Wrong at the right time.

When you're down and troubled
You don't tell your friends,
You don't tell your family.
I won't let them talk about me.
I'm gonna let nobody down.

Who shall I be tonight?
Who's gonna see tonight?
Who shall I be tonight?

Inside out in the daytime,
Wrong at the right time.
I wanna know I'm good for you.
Outside in in the night time,
Right at the wrong time.
I wanna know I'm good to you.

When you're down and troubled
You don't tell your friends,
You don't tell your family.
I won't let them talk about me.
I'm gonna let nobody down.

No, no, no, no
I won't let them talk about me.
I'm gonna let nobody down down down down.
