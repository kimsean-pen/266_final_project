If you get too worried
what you ought to do is sing
If you get worried
what you ought to do is sing
If you get worried

what you ought to do is sing
sing about your troubles, it just might pass
'nd if you get lost
what you ought to do is sing
'nd if you get lost

what you ought to do is sing

'nd if you get lost
what you ought to do is sing
Sing about your troubles, it just might pass
Sing about your troubles, it just might pass
Sing about your
sing about love and hoping it lasts
sing about your trouble
and it just might pass
just might pass
And if you get broken
what you ought to do is sing
And if you get broken
what you ought to do is sing
And if you get broken
what you ought to do is sing
Sing about your troubles, 'nd it just might pass
Sing about your
sing about love and hoping it lasts
sing about your trouble
it just might pass
just might pass (repeat)
