You just appeared
A sweet apparition
While I was so sure
What I had become

We just turn black
Went out on the water
Sky was on fire
And I was undone

I'll be waiting downtown hoping you do me in
Sirens singing with me while I lose you again
I may be tired all these years lost in love
But I'll be waiting downtown while you leave just enough
Leave to much more
And I'll stay up north

Walking you home
Stacked on the corner
Reached out your arms
Fill off in the night

I've got some smoke
And mirrors around me
And never been lost
I got kidding your eyes
Got kidding your eyes

I'll be waiting downtown hoping you do me in
Sirens singing with me while I lose you again
I may be tired all these years lost in love
But I'll be waiting downtown while you leave just enough
Leave to much more
And I'll stay up north

I'll be waiting downtown hoping you do me in
Sirens singing with me while I lose you again
I may be tired all these years lost in love
But I'll be waiting downtown while you leave just enough
I'll be waiting downtown while you leave just enough
I'll be waiting downtown while you leave just enough
Leave to much more
And I'll stay up north
