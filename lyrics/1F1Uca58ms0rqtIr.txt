We have no time to talk
About the things that bind us
Lost in a haze
I pull and push you away
Can I drown in your lips one last time?
Pure hearts colour night skies
My real eyes can see through your lies
Tear me down, I'll watch you fall
Blind hearts won't catch you
No-one to catch you
Like atoms smash into your smile
Let me drown in your lips and hold you in
Pull you in
