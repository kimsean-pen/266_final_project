At some point
Let my mind fall
Feel my lungs breathe
Feel my heart slow

Stop the scars in my head
Just for a moment hold my breath
No more heart on my sleeve
Just leave it alone

'Cause I can't bleed anymore
I just don't need anymore

Shifting eyes, puncture wounds
Lock myself up away in my room
I never thought it would hurt like this
It is what it is

'Cause I can't bleed anymore
I just don't need anymore
I feel my heart break my soul
Cause this all to feel so calloused and numb
'Cause I can't bleed anymore
Anymore
Anymore
Anymore

I'm done with the world
When you feel so cold
Done with the world
I'm breaking through
Breaking through

'Cause I can't bleed anymore
I just don't need anymore
I feel my heart break my soul
Cause this all to feel so calloused and numb
'Cause I can't bleed anymore
Anymore
Anymore
Anymore
