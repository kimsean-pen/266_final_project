Battle, battle, battle, battle, battle
Battle someone, who
Battle, battle, battle
Battle someone, who

Completion search
Here I love the bow
See it all come down to

Adorn myself
It's a new song glory
Doesn't seem, what you think of now

Battle, battle, battle, battle, battle
Battle someone, who
Battle, battle, battle
Battle someone, who

You turn you sights
Kill until sub zero
See, oh, it turns you out

All my awe
It's the end of your
To take your last one now

Battle, battle, battle, battle
Battle someone, who
Battle, battle, battle, battle

Battle someone, who
Battle, battle, battle, battle
Battle someone, who

Keep sounds
Keep love about
See me overcome
