I am standing strong,
I've overcome the sadness in my life
Now I look up and see the brightest sky above me
And it's reflecting in your eyes

Je ne sais quoi,
I know you have a special something
Je ne sais quoi,
something I just can't explain
And when I see your face,
I wanna follow my emotions
Je ne sais pas pourquoi

When the clouds are gone
the stars come out around us, shining
And all that we see is the love,
our hearts aligned together
Tell me, do you feel the same?

Je ne sais quoi,
I know you have a special something
Je ne sais quoi,
something I just can't explain
And when I see your face,
I wanna follow my emotions
Je ne sais pas pourquoi

I just love this crazy feeling
It's like I've known you all my life
Je ne sais quoi

Je ne sais quoi,
I know you have a special something
Je ne sais quoi,
something I just can't explain
And when I see your face,
I wanna follow my emotions
Je ne sais pas pourquoi
