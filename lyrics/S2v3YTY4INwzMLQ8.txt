Luck
Runs
Out
Crawl from the wreckage one more time

Horrific memory twists the mind
Dark, rutted, cold and hard to turn
Path of destruction,
Feel it burn
Still life...
Incarnation

Still life...
Infamy
Hallucination
Heresy
Still you run,
What's to come?
What's to be?
. . .
'Cause we hunt you down without mercy

Hunt you down all nightmare long

Feel us breathe upon your face

Feel us shift, every move we trace

Hunt you down without mercy

Hunt you down all nightmare long
Yeah
Luck
Runs

And you crawl back in... but your luck runs out
. . .
One
Two
. . .
Luck

Runs
Out
The light that is not light is here
To flush you out with your own fear
You hide,
You hide,
But will be found
Release your grip without a sound
Still life...
Immolation
Still life...
Infamy
Hallucination
Heresy
Still you run,
What's to come?
What's to be?
. . .
'Cause we hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift, every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Yeah
Luck
Runs
And you crawl back in...
But your luck runs out
. . .
One
Two
Three
Four
. . .
Then you crawl back in
Into your obsession
Never to return
This is your confession
. . .
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift, every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Yeah
Luck
Runs
And you crawl back in...
But your luck runs out
Your luck runs out!!!
