I'm panicking baby, don't let them take me
Don't let them take me from everything I know
That move would kill me, or what's left of me
It feels like I've been cut off from my home

Where will I go if I end up all alone?
How will I know when the time has come to go?
It's now or never, so let's go
Now or never, so let's go

So here's my pep talk, you got this on lock
So get up there and show us how hard you can fight
If I'm being truthful I'm not that useful
Except I got that 20-20 hindsight

Where will I go if I end up all alone?
How will I know when the time has come to go?
It's now or never, so let's go

It's now or never, so let's go

Where will I go if I end up all alone?
How will I know when the time has come to go?
It's now or never, so let's go
Now or never, so let's go
Now or never, so let's go
