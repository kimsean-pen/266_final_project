Miss Mysterious, who are you?
Who's the girl behind those eyes? Just a stranger in disguise?
Miss Mysterious, who could you be?
Where's the ghost of what we had? Did you erase it from your past?
Oh, so I pointed in every direction,
Oh well, looking for answers I'll never know.
I said go, run for your life, and tell me I'm right,
or let me know when your heart went numb.
I said go, run for your life, and tell me I'm right,
the saying goes "if you love someone let them go".
Miss Mysterious, may I ask:
Is your sunshine like my rain? Is your pleasure like my pain?
So delirious, casting your stones
With the blood fall to my face,
hoping that you'll lose your aim.
Oh, well it looks so bright with the lights out,
Oh well, I guess our stars forgot how to glow.
I said go, run for your life, and tell me I'm right,
or let me know when your heart went numb.
I said go, run for your life, and tell me I'm right,
the saying goes "if you love someone let them go".
No baby you, you broke my heart
Now how do I get closure when you're only ever closed off
Tell me who gets in your place?
When these memories are telling me
That we were not always
Now don't even try to tell me that I should just relax
And we're not strangled and over the tracks
I tried to reach, I stuck out my hand but you turned around instead
So many nights living inside just to connect with you
Now I'm trying hard to win this but we've lost all we can lose.
I said go, run for your life, and tell me I'm right,
or let me know when your heart went numb.
I said go, run for your life, and tell me I'm right,
the saying goes "if you love someone let them go".
I said go, run for your life, and tell me I'm right,
or let me know when your heart went numb.
I said go, run for your life, and tell me I'm right,
the saying goes "if you love someone"
said if you love someone
now if you love someone
let them go
let them go.
