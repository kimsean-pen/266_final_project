Your lies, rather like the sirens calling
Your eyes, ever shine a light guiding the way
To darkness and astray
To leave me in the night

You're here and you shut me up with kisses
Cold fear, never did I push you like I should
I knew then that I could
But no, I didn't fight

Hysteria
I'm bound in the fire
Hysteria
I'm trapped in your mind
I didn't see the demon eyes
I got caught within your lies
Hysteria
I'm yours to admire

I'm all alone
Alone in your heart
I'm all alone
Alone in the dark

Your hands never failed to wake my wishes
Your glance ever led me deeper in your web
I stayed within your trap
And never left your side

Cold fear and you shut me up with kisses
No tear, never did I scream to make you go
It could have stopped, but no
'Cause still I didn't fight

Hysteria
I'm bound in the fire
Hysteria
I'm trapped in your mind
I didn't see the demon eyes
I got caught within your lies
Hysteria
I'm yours to admire

Hysteria
I'm bound in the fire
Hysteria
I'm trapped in your mind
I didn't see the demon eyes
I got caught within your lies
Hysteria
I'm yours to admire

I'm all alone
Alone in your heart
I'm all alone
Alone in the dark
