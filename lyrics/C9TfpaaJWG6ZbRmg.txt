I will love you better
Better when I'm old
I will love you better when I'm old
I will wrap my arms around you
And keep you from the cold
I will love you better when I'm old

I will love you better
Better when I'm blind
I will love you better when I'm blind
'Cause you'll always be a beauty
Living in my mind
I will love you better when I'm blind

When the rain is falling on the roof
And the stars are hid from view
When the moon is just a scar of light
And the sky, a purple bruise
I will wait here in the window
'Til you come back again
I will love you better then

I will love you better
Better when I'm gone
I will love you better when I'm gone
You'll be filling out the quiet
Playing like a song
I will love you better when I'm gone

When the world is frozen over
And the oceans are on fire
When the darkness overpowers light
And the angels muted choir
I will hide here in the meadows
'Til you find me again
I will love you better then

I will love you best
Best when I forgive
I will love you best when I forgive
Cause you made your promises
Not a one of them you kept
I will love you best when I forget, when I forget
I will love you better then
