Oh, I know you're still with me.
You, my compass and my sea.

And I know you're still with me.
You, my compass and my sea.

Oh, I hope you can hear me.
Follows billion miles away!
You stay.

Cause I love you dearly.
Follows billion miles away!

Cause I've been around two times and found
That you're the only thing I need!
Cause I've been around two times and found
That you're the only thing I need!
Cause I've been around two times and found
That you're the only thing I need!
Cause I've been around two times and found
That you're my only friend indeed!

Green, broken glass ocean.
You break me in slow motion.

No map, no message.
It's the deep, blue screen I know.

Cause I know you're still with me,
You, my compass and my sea.

Cause I've been around two times and found
That you're the only thing I need!
Cause I've been around two times and found
That you're the only thing I need!
Cause I've been around two times and found
That you're the only thing I need!
Cause I've been around two times and found
That you're my only friend indeed!
