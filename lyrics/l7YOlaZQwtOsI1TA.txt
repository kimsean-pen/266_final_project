Try to take it from me,
This is my throne
Is it fleeting?
Cast your one and only heavy stone
Try defeating the only one you know with the gift that i bestow.
On and on it goes
The kingdom never folds

They can't call it amazing always, my reign is here for the taking.
Pry it from hands already, take away all I've started.
They can't call it amazing always

Blood keeps on flowing with chemicals and I'm peaking
Only thing i know is giving up control
On and on it goes, until it takes it's toll

Letting go of what I held close
Stepping down i lost it a little
Fame is in the way of all growth
They all say i lost it a little

They can't call it amazing always, my reign is here for the taking.
Pry it from hands already, take away all I've started.
They can't call it amazing always
