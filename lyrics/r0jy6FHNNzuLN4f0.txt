Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Pretty thing you're making me go back
Looking like a Shania Twain throwback
Picture perfect girl I gotta post that
Sippin' 7 and 7 in your 7 jeans

Put on a string, a little rip on the seam
A southern boys dream, like a movie scene
So go on shake your thing like a leaf
Nobody gonna see it but the moon and me
Come on

You know you got that fire right
Girl you my good good
Giving me a chance to make your night
You know that I would would
You wanna dance girl
I'll get you spinning
You wanna see the world
I'll be your ticket
I'll put your hand in my hand
I'm winning, I'm winning
You like that way that diamond shines
You know you got that fire right
Girl you my good good
You know you got that fire right
(That fire right)

Another shot of them blue eyes
Won't need anymore of that moonshine
You're lighting me up my little firefly
I can feel the heat, heat
Blazing to the beat, beat
Backseat GG baby when you do your thing

You know you got that fire right
Girl you my good good
Giving me a chance to make your night
You know that I would would
You wanna dance girl
I'll get you spinning
You wanna see the world
I'll be your ticket
I'll put your hand in my hand
I'm winning, I'm winning
You like that way that diamond shines
You know you got that fire right
Girl you my good good
You know you got that fire right
Girl you my good good
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, I can feel the heat heat
Blazing to the beat beat
Backseat GG, talking no sleep sleep
Baby when you do your thing

You know you got that fire right
Girl you my good good
Giving me a chance to make your night
You know that I would would
You wanna dance girl
I'll get you spinning
You wanna see the world
I'll be your ticket
I'll put your hand in my hand
I'm winning, I'm winning
You like that way that diamond shines
You know you got that fire right
Girl you my good good
You know you got that fire right
What do you say girl
You got that fire that fire
Girl you my good good
You got that fire, that fire
