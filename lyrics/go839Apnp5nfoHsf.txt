A winged man, a fitting plan
Promising to bring the light again
He said "I see your pain
And I think it's beautiful"
But I have not prayed to be saved
Am I fast asleep or wide awake?
Was it all just a dream?
When I was unmovable?
I was unmovable

Crack my heart open
With your bare hands
Watch me bloom
Set my soul on fire
And I will unfold for you
I wanna feel
Wanna heal
Wanna break
Wanna change
Wanna live
Wanna feel
Wanna heal
Wanna break
Wanna change
Wanna live

So take my hand and understand
I have come to help your light expand
It's only growing pain
Nothing is permanent
With surrender, I fill up
As I taste the ecstasy of love
I promise that you'll be safe
But it may be turbulent
It may be turbulent

Crack my heart open
With your bare hands
Watch me bloom
Set my soul on fire
And I will unfold for you
I wanna feel
Wanna heal
Wanna break
Wanna change
Wanna live
Wanna feel
Wanna heal
Wanna break
Wanna change
Wanna live

Crack my heart open
With your bare hands
Watch me bloom
Set my soul on fire
And I will unfold for you
I wanna feel
Wanna heal
Wanna break
Wanna change
Wanna live
Wanna feel
Wanna heal
Wanna break
Wanna change
Wanna live
Wanna live
Wanna live
