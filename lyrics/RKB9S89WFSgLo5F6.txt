I've got a bad case of turnin' it up
It's getting cold in here so Fire It Up
I've got a bad case of turnin' it up
It's getting cold in here
So somebody fire it up!

Come on and fire it up!

I'm in love with the feeling
Of pressure to the ceiling
Wake up with intention
To face my opposition
Get raw when it's time
To lay it on the line
To the wall's where we're taking it
Let your light shine, like

Let your light shine, like
Let your light shine...

I've got a bad case of turnin' it up
It's getting cold in here so Fire It Up
I've got a bad case of turnin' it up
It's getting cold in here
So somebody fire it up!

Take it higher, take it higher
'Til the roof is on fire
Take it higher, take it higher
Let's burn it up

Take it higher, take it higher
'Til the roof is on fire
Take it higher, take it higher
Let's burn it up

I throw down when it's time
For the action, make it happen
And the sound got you feelin'
Like "man, what just happened?"
When it's on, you might not
Get a warning or a sign
To the wall's where we're taking it
Let your light shine, like

Let your light shine, like
Let your light shine...

I've got a bad case of turnin' it up
It's getting cold in here so Fire It Up
I've got a bad case of turnin' it up
It's getting cold in here
So somebody fire it up!
