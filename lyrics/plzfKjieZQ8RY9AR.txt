so if you call me and ask for his name
or if you thought this number
was part of my existence
cause your best friends forever
you've only been together
And Im not getting better
Im just feelin' the same
So much time went on, and Im just finding out about this

and if you see me looking back
or if you see me better
the worst part of my existence
Is you can call whenever
but I can't wait forever
