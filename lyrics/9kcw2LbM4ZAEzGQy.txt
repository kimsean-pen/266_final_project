Filled with something
That will set me free today
I feel I'm falling in my sleep
With no word to say

And as I'm driving
With the angels by my side
They tell me my friend
Ain't your window open wide

Please wake me
I wanna catch the liberty ship
Please wake me
I wanna breathe the air so deep

Don't lock the door now
I'm coming home for sure
Don't throw us out now
And don't leave us alone

Tell me something
Are you lost when you've found your way?
I've been there man
So beware of what i say

Feel no sorrow
Feel no hate
Feel nothing at all
Hold me baby
