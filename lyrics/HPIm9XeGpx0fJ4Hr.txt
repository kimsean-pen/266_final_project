How the hell does a broken heart get back together when it's torn apart?
Teach itself to start beating again?

This little bluebird came looking for you
I said that I hadn't seen you in quite some time
And this little bluebird came looking again
I said we weren't even friends, she could have you

Don't you think it was hard?
I didn't even say that you died
But it wouldn't have been such a lie, 'cause then I started to cry

This little bluebird sure won't give it a rest
She swears that you may be better than all the rest
I said, "No, you've got it all wrong.
If he was something special, I wouldn't have this song."

And don't you think it was hard?
I didn't even say that you died
But it wouldn't have been such a lie, 'cause then I started to cry

How the hell does a broken heart get back together when it's torn apart?
And teach itself to start beating again?

What if when she comes over, I am in your arms, taking all I want from you again?

How the hell does a broken heart get back together when it's torn apart?
Teach itself to start beating again?
How the hell does a broken heart get back together when it's torn apart?
Teach itself to start beating again?
Beating again

This little bluebird won't come here anymore
So I went looking for her, and I found you
