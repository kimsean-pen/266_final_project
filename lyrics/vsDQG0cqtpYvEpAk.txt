Rumors, they don't mean nothing
Whispers, they don't mean nothing

They're just rumors, whispers
Rumors, whispers

You think I'm shallow
But I don't think you've seen enough to know
I wish you knew me
Way back when, the way it was before

I wish the old me
Could show you all the things I've done
So I told you
I hope the future holds a place where everything's exactly as it was

Substance, it's gotta count for something
Expectations, they don't mean anything

They're just rumors, whispers
Rumors, whispers

You think I'm shallow
But I don't think you've seen enough to know
I wish you knew me
Way back when, the way it was before

I wish the old me
Could show you all the things I've done
So I told you
I hope the future holds a place where everything's exactly as it was

I wish the old me
Could show you all the things I've done
So I told you
I hope the future holds a place where everything's exactly as it was
