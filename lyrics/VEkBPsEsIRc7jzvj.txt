Coming up beyond belief
On this coronary thief
More than just a leitmotif
More chaotic, no relief

I'll describe the way I feel
Weeping wounds that never heal
Can this saviour be for real?
Or are you just my seventh seal?

No hesitation, no delay
You come on just like special K
Just like I swallowed half my stash
I never ever want to crash
No hesitation, no delay
You come on just like special K
Now you're back with dope demand
I'm on sinking sand

Gravity, no escaping
Gravity
Gravity
No escaping
Not for free
I fall down
Hit the ground
Make a heavy sound
Every time
You seem to come around

I'll describe the way I feel
You're my new Achilles heel

Can the saviour be for real?
Or are you just my seventh seal?

No hesitation
No delay
You come on just like special K
Just like I swallowed half my stash
I never ever want to crash
No hesitation
No delay
You come on just like special K
Now you're back in dope demand
I'm on sinking sand

Gravity
No escaping gravity
Gravity
No escaping
Not for free
I fall down
Hit the ground
Make a heavy sound
Every time
You seem to come around
No escaping gravity
No escaping gravity
No escaping gravity
No escaping gravity
Gravity
Gravity
Gravity
