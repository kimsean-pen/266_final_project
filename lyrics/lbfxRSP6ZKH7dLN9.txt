Useless words useless vision
I don't need it no more
impractical advice unnecessary conflict
impractical advice unnecessary conflict
I don't want to shake your hand
I want a privilege to say no
useless thoughts useless movements
I don't need it no more

who has the keys for this door
do you have keys for this door
no no no no no
