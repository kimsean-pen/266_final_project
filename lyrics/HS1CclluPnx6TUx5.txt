I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't go
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't

I've been lookin' at the stars tonight
And I think, "Oh, how I miss the bright sun"
I'll be a dreamer 'til the day I die
And they say, "Oh, how the good die young?"

But we're all strange
And maybe we don't want to change

I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't go
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't go

But the gun still rattles, the gun still rattles, oh
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't go

I spend a lot of nights on the run
And I think, "Oh, like I'm lost and can't be found"
I'm just waiting for my day to come
And I think, "Oh, I don't wanna let you down"

'Cause something inside has changed
And maybe we don't wanna stay the same

I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't go
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't go

But the gun still rattles, the gun still rattles, oh
But the gun still rattles, the gun still rattles, oh

And I don't want a never-ending life
I just want to be alive
While I'm here

And I don't want a never-ending life
I just want to be alive
While I'm here

And I don't want to see another night
Lost inside of our own life
While I'm here

I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't go
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't go

But the gun still rattles, the gun still rattles, oh
But the gun still rattles, the gun still rattles, oh
