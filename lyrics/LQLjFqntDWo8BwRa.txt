Everyone of us is lost against ourselves
And pushing through the constant
Struggle of forward thought
This thing we call humanity
Has brought us down and has us caught

Is this what I've become?
A callous, uncaring soul
That allows the will of flesh
To dominate and control

This is my counter attack
This is my counter
Starve the self and empower the soul
This path I chose, once again made whole

Torn between, torn between
Torn between, torn between
Self and soul, self and soul
Self and soul

With this first step forward
I've become a new creation
Free from self and thinking clearly
My soul chokes the last impurities
From my flesh, from my flesh

And I'm given a second chance
But this time let myself die
This time I let myself die
This time I let myself die
This time I let myself die
This time I let myself die
