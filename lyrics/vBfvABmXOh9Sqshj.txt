You're so beautiful
But you only knew
I see you there
But I don't know where you've been
But you're holding back
Just holding on
You say you're fine
Going to America

You made a plan
You can't stay with me
America
Take me to the place you love
Take me to America, America

Take me now
Take me now

You said before
Now I don't know anymore
Say a word
Take me to America
And I'll let you know
You can take it slow
Just pack me up
Take me to the place you love
Take me to America
