You tried to sneak by me now, didn't ya, uh-huh, huh
Now gimme what you promised me, give it here, come on

Hey
Good God
Hey
Hey

You promised me the day that you quit your boyfriend
I'd be the next one to ease on in
You promised me it would be just us two, yeah
And I'd be the only man kissin' on you, yeah

Now, kiss me, hold it a long time, now hold it
Don't turn it a-loose, now hold it
A little bit longer, now hold it, come on
Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it
Now ease up on me now, hey

Hey
The girl's alright, y'all, ha-ha
Good God

You made me a promise and you're gonna stick to it
You shouldn't have promised if you weren't gonna do it
You saw me and ran in another direction
I'll teach you to play with my affection

Now, give it here
You never should've promised to me, give it here
Don't hold back, now give it here
Don't say nothin', just give it here
Come on, give it here

Give it here
Give it here
Give it here
Give it to me
Good God

Give it on here, I gotcha
You tried to sneak by me, now didn't ya, ha-ha
