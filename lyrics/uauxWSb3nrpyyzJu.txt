She only comes out at night
The lean and hungry type
Nothing is new
I've seen her here before
Watching and waiting
She is sittin' with you
But her eyes are on the door

So many have paid to see
What you think you're gettin' for free
The woman is wild
A she-cat tamed by the purr of a Jaguar
Money's the matter
If you're in it for love
You ain't gonna get too far

Oh-oh, here she comes
Watch out boy
She'll chew you up
Oh-oh, here she comes
She's a maneater
Oh-oh, here she comes
Watch out boy
She'll chew you up
Oh-oh, here she comes
She's a maneater

I wouldn't if I were you
I know what she can do
She's barely man
And she could really rip your world apart
Mind over matter
A beauty is there
But a beast is in her heart

Oh-oh, here she comes
Watch out boy
She'll chew you up
Oh-oh, here she comes
She's a maneater
Oh-oh, here she comes
Watch out boy
She'll chew you up
Oh-oh, here she comes
She's a maneater

Oh-oh, here she comes
Watch out boy
She'll chew you up
Oh-oh, here she comes
She's a maneater
Oh-oh, here she comes
Watch out boy
She'll chew you up
Oh-oh, here she comes
She's a maneater (she's a maneater)

(Oh, oh)
Oh-oh, here she comes
Watch out boy
She'll chew you up
Oh-oh, here she comes
She's a maneater (she's a maneater)
Oh-oh, here she comes
Watch out boy
She'll chew you up
Oh-oh, here she comes
She's a maneater
