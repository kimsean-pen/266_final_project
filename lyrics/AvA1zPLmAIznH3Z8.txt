When the road gets dark
And you can no longer see
Let my love throw a spark
And have a little faith in me

And when the tears you cry
Are all you can believe
Just give these loving arms a try baby
And have a little faith, faith in me

Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith, faith in me

And when your secret heart
Cannot speak so easily
Come here baby
From a whisper start
To have a little faith in me

And when your back's against the wall
Just turn around and you, you will see
I will catch your, I will catch your fall baby
Just have a little faith, faith in me

Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith, faith in me

Well I've been loving you for such a long, long time
Expecting nothing in return just for you to have a little faith in me
'Cause see time, time is our friend
'Cause for us there is no end
And all you gotta do is a have a little faith in me
I will hold you up
I will hold you up
And your love gives me strength enough to have a little faith in me
oh, heeeeey, oh darlin'
have a little faith in me
