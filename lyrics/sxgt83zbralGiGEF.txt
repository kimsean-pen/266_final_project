Sailing sailing on the sea
Won't you baby sail to me
You told me my name was the sea
So baby, baby sail to me
Oh baby, baby sail to me

(I) miss those eyes so blue and green
Those eyes that seemed to save me
Baby, baby sail the sea
(I) need you darling, sail to me

Swimming, swimming, make my arms
Become so strong to carry yours
And may you also carry me
Oh baby, baby, swim to me

How I miss you baby, baby
Swim the sea and talk to me
Oh I'm drowning out here without you
My arms won't last so long
Without your touch, oh baby, baby
Sail to me, oh sail the sea

Baby, baby you're so sweet
(I) need your heart inside of me
(I) need your heart inside of me
(I) need your heart inside of me
