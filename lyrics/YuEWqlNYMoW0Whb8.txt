Trees will make a forest
Trees will make a boat
These are all the harder
Words you have to know
If everyone's a structure
Where their own saviour sits
Then I'm a little red house
But no one's living in it

Cars are little blood cells
We are oxygen
City is the airways
Suburbs appendages
She was feeling lonely
Tired of the hive
Rented out a family
He bought a bride
Bought a bride
Bought a bride
Bought a bride

Little cities names labeled along the map
They tied her up and laid her on the train tracks

Where are all the seedlings
We grew from violence
Down in Jersey lumber
Stealing prosthetic limbs
Should've been a soldier
I could've fought and died
There's no revolution
So I bought a bride
Bought a bride
Bought a bride
Bought a bride

Coming down the aisle while the horns play "Taps"
They tied her up and laid her on the train tracks

Somehow I always knew when everything was unsaid
Go and buy a hammer, never sing again
