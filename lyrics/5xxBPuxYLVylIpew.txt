Let's make a toast to glory days
When you were 8 and I was only 41
I dedicate this selfie to the little guy
Who will outlast me when I'm done

Look into my camera lens
And straight through me I see that you're a lot like me
You never get attention
And you never get a pension
Or your dad's money

Picture me gone
Picture me gone
Picture me gone
Picture me gone

Picture me gone
Picture me gone
Picture me gone
Picture me gone

I backed up all my pictures on my iCloud
so you can't see me when I die
I left my body somewhere down in Mexico
Go find my iPhone, have a try

Let's make a toast to glory days
When you were 8 and I was only 45
I dedicate to this selfie to the little guy
Who will outlast me when I'm done

Picture me gone
Picture me gone
Picture me gone
Picture me gone

Picture me gone
Picture me gone
Picture me gone
Picture me gone

Picture me gone
Picture me gone
Picture me gone
Picture me gone

Picture me gone
Picture me gone
Picture me gone
Picture me gone
