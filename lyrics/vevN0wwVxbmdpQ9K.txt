We move for all mankind
A million miles from everything we've ever known
We're on their hearts and minds
A million heads are bowed to bring us safely home
Hemmed in by emptiness
A million ways that everything could be undone
This hollow in my chest
Is filled with reasons not to sing but I found one
I know

We are not alone
We feel an unseen love
We are sons and heirs of grace
We are children of
A light that never dims
A love that never dies
Keep your chin up, child
And wipe the tears from your eyes

In sleep we saw ourselves
A million years we had been waiting there it seems
While someone weaves a spell
A million stars look on in witness to our dreams
I know

We are not alone
We feel an unseen love
We are sons and heirs of grace
We are children of
A light that never dims
A love that never dies
Keep your chin up, child
And wipe the tears from your eyes

We feel an unseen love
And we are children of light

We are not alone
We feel an unseen love
We are sons and heirs of grace
We are children of
A light that never dims
A love that never dies
Keep your chin up, child
And wipe the tears from your eyes

Stand ready and tall
Reflect the light.
