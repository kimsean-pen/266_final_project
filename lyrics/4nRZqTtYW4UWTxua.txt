i feel so weird around u
i've never really been in love i keep my words and my problems
i'd rather keep it bottled up and even though i know i miss
youi'd rather keep it all inside and now
I know I will regret it
I'd rather keep it all inside
confessing seems just a little bit pointless with a guy like you
i'd rather sit and stare at the water with you
i feel so weird around u
i've never really felt like this
you're a friend and a good one
i'd rather keep it bottled up
