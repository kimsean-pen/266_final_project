Leather jacket alone in the bar
Still you don't leave my mind
And it's too late to tell me you're wrong
I only wanna dream tonight

Something went wrong, am I wrong?
And it's hard to be livin' this all on my own
Never chose to be something for you to control
Something went wrong, am I wrong?
Cover you up 'til I'm gone
Something went wrong, am I wrong?

I go ego
I go
I go ego
I go
So I let go, I
I will let go, I
Imma let go, I

The reserving is bringing me down
Tired of being fooled around
Yeah it's too late to tell me you're wrong
Hope you follow me tonight

Something went wrong, am I wrong?
And it's hard to believe in this all on my own
Never chose to be something for you to control
Something went wrong, am I wrong?
Cover you up 'til I'm gone
Something went wrong, am I wrong?

I go ego
I go
I go ego
I go
So I let go, I
Imma let go, I
I go ego
I go
I go ego
I go
So I let go, I
Imma let go, I

I
Imma let go, I
I
Imma let go, I
Imma let go, I
Imma let go, I
