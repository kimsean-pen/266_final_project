I see how y'all be trying to front, man y'all be fronting, man

Been a bit since Mu died
Been a lot more lost than awake
I recall thinking someday someone's gonna say it's all from the same cause and effect
And I just couldn't fathom
Blaming a whole new page on a made-up chain reaction
Each claim individual peaks and pockets
Pains in a slew of unique nuances
Nah' mean?
When you wake up eight years non responsive
It's a lot to process
Gone from a happier jack in a box
To a package of clogged up chakras
Oh shazbat
Not the everafter we wanted from the once upon a time
Dot-dot-dot
Once upon a time he was so much more than a punchline for his own potshots
Ah! Watch the Impossible Kid
Everything that he touch turns promptly to shit
If I zoom on out I can finally admit
It's all been a blur since Mu got sick
None of the subsequent years stood a chance
Whether he was mom's or his man's
Whether he was pop's or his girl that was poison
Heart full of canines
Head full of voices
Whole life trying to quiet them down
Like a suicide king with a knife in his crown
Hounds at bay, but they just won't stay
True friendship in a tugboat way
"A" go dark in the face of the fucked when the fucked was a friend that was basically done
Into the woods go his alien tongue
It was that or a textbook fake and a funk
And I can't
Here go to hindsight
8 years been one long blindside
I could pinpoint seven more turns that occurred cause he never really healed from the first
Oh what a world
Any hack is a myth
Any dap is a joke, any map is a trick
Any graph is a hoax
Ease on down, I'm burning up
I'm bleeding out
Knowing ain't half the battle
That's a bullshit quip written by some asshole
You can own what you are
And still sit around stoned in your car
Not doing shit, halfway to nil
Cranky and waiting for a boss key and hat full of bills
Get out the car, Aes
