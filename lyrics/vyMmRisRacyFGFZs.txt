I spent the last few years
Pouring gasoline on every bridge
Don't waste your time on me,
I keep on losing my self esteem
Don't try to hold me down,
You know we're not the ones
We can't just lose forever
I need to lift this town,
I'll feel I'll cherish my time
Forgive me now, but I've been [?]

I'm burning all these bridges
Killing my mind and burning my memories
So please don't wait for me

Everyday I see my own life unwritten
I won't let anyone see you
First I bridged I bridged you [?]

Our last time
Let me start over just keep my name behind
And rewrite
All the days both my life with that bed of mine

Don't try to hold me down
You're the angry one [?] I used to be
I'm fired from this town
I should done my best, you threw away the key
I feel I will never be the same

I'm leaving for a long time
Losing myself and hoping to hear my good side [?]
Before I lose my mind

Everyday I see my own life unwritten
I won't let anyone see you
First I bridged I bridged you [?]

Our last time
Let me start over just keep my name behind
And rewrite
All the days both my life with that bed of mine
It's mine, tonight
And I know cherish you lie, know it's my time

Our time's running fast, the best is yet to come
Don't stick to the past, 'cause nobody moves on
Time's running fast, the best is yet to come
Don't stick to the past, 'cause nobody moves on
Time's running fast, the best is yet to come
Don't stick to the past, 'cause nobody moves on
Time's running fast, the best is yet to come
Don't stick to the past, 'cause nobody moves on
