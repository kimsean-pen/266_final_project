You're just too good to be true
can't take my eyes off of you
you feel like heaven to touch
i wanna hold you so much
at long last love has arrived
and i thank god i'm alive
you're just too good to be true
can't take my eyes off of you
Pardon the way that i stare
there's nothing else to compare
the sight of you makes me weak
there are no words left to speak
so if you feel like i feel
please let me know that it's real
you're just to good to be true
can't take my eyes off of you
I love you baby
and if it's quite alright
i need you baby
to warm the lonely nights
i love you baby
trust in me when i say
oh pretty baby
don't bring me down i pray
oh pretty baby
now that i've found you
let me love you baby, let me love you
You're just too good to be true
can't take my eyes off of you
you feel like heaven to touch
i wanna hold you so much
at long last love has arrived
and i thank god i'm alive
you're just too good to be true
can't take my eyes off of you
I love you baby
and if it's quite alright
i need you baby
to warm the lonely nights
i love you baby
trust in me when i say
oh pretty baby
don't bring me down i pray
oh pretty baby
now that i've found you
let me love you baby, let me love you
