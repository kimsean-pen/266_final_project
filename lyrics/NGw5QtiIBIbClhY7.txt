Find it hard to believe tonight
In a curiously well-kept house built before I was born
This year we're gonna stamp out the sorry feeling
Rain on summer vacation
Five blocks from Tasker-Morris station
Fuck the ride home
If I can't find two bills to rub together before
Midnight rolls around
I thought you heard me
Sing your spirit sound
You turned in early
Left the TV flickering
It staged
Romance across your face
Said goodbye from the front porch
I always wonder if you're smiling at us or if you're looking away
I'd ask but either way I'd feel sorry for ya'
Locked your love in a screenshot
They don't work that way
But I'd been wishing I could say that I don't
The selfish side likes to think my execution's more
of an honest one
These artists all cut clock with underscored
Conviction
Blacked out friction
Flies me back to Baltimore
To wait for you
And I'm stuck here too
Until midnight rolls around
I thought you heard me
Sing your spirit sound
You turned in early
Left the TV flickering
It staged
Romance across your face
