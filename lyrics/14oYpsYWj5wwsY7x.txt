Stuck in the middle, I burrow inside
Back to the cradle
Away from the burdens of all my crimes
Before it's fatal
The past has found me, the truth's come out
All is remembered
With no place to fall, but straight down
I must surrender

Well it seems I've finally thought of everything
I wanna love, I wanna feel
Find peace, find the real

There's a face I put on all my life
The face of an angel
I look in the mirror only to find
The face of a stranger
And with all I've taken I hunger for more
'Cause I'm selfish
And all I'm left with is a crown of thorns
And I'm helpless

Well it seems I've finally thought of everything
I wanna love, I wanna feel
Find peace, find the real

Well I'll trade these lies for something right
I will kill what hurts with something pure
I will be redeemed so I can breathe again

Well it seems I've finally thought of everything
I wanna love, I wanna feel
Find peace, find the real

Well it seems I've finally thought of everything
I wanna love, I wanna feel
Find peace, find the real
