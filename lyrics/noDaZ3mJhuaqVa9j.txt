Teardrops in my eyes
Running down like a river
Feel you when you're gone
Even if I know
That you are with her
You are with her

Promises you gave
But took back
Is my addiction
Love you never gave
Is my obsession
Promises you gave were
All I have in my mind
When you closed the door
Totally eclipsed my soul

Rivers drying out
The sun will never shine
Without a reason
Make me understand
No matter how I cry
You still be with her
And I'll be all alone

Promises you gave
But took back
Is my addiction
Love you never gave
Is my obsession
Promises you gave were
All I have in my mind
When you closed the door
Totally eclipsed my soul

Never gonna feel
Never gonna heal
Always gonna run
Always try to ride
Never gonna feel
Never gonna heal
Always gonna run
Always try to ride
And I'll be all alone

Promises you gave
But took back
Is my addiction
Love you never gave
Is my obsession
Promises you gave were
All I have in my mind
When you closed the door
Totally eclipsed my soul
