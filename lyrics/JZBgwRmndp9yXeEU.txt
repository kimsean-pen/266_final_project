Yea
Oh Baby
Hmm hmm

It's two eleven and I'm stressin'
Watching TV in my hotel suite
I check my service every second
At two ten you still hadn't called me
(No no no no no)

So I'm gonna leave my cell phone
Turned on in my purse by the bed
And before I fall asleep
I guess I'll just check my machine
(Check it one one time)
Again and again because I'm
Obsessin' on you

I wanna be your baby doll
(I just wanna be your)
Wrap me up nice and tight
(Wrap me up nice and tight)
Love me all through the night

Come on lay me down
(Lay me down)
Enfold me in your arms
(Arms)
(Ohh)
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on
And whisper softly to me
You wanna be my baby doll

(Ohh yea)
Zonin' out thinkin' about
You and me between the sheets
(Ohh ohh)
I want to get intimate
But you're not within my reach
(No no no no)
So I'll have a little more wine
And I'll try to drink you
Out of my head
(Try try try try try try try try)

And I'll lay awake awhile
'Til I'm high enough
I can forget all about you
(All about)
Until I wake up again

I wanna be your baby doll
(Baby, baby, baby)
Wrap me up nice and tight
(Wrap me up nice and tight)
Love me all through the night
(Ohh)

Come lay me down
(Ohh)
Enfold me in your arms
(Babe's)
Cover me with velvet kisses
(Hmm oh my yea)
Rock me on and on
And whisper softly to me
You wanna be my baby doll
(Be my baby doll)

Slipping into dreams
(Slipping into dreams)
I feel my love surround you
My subconscious seems
(My subconscious seems)
To weave itself around you

Do you care for me?
(Do you care for me?)
Beyond idolization
Tell me how you feel
But don't keep me at bay
'Cause I won't be waitin' long
(Aah)

I wanna be your babydoll
(I wanna be, wanna be your)
(I want to)
Wrap me up nice and tight
(Suicide baby)
Love me all through the night
(All through the night)

Come lay me down
(Come lay)
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
(Cover me)
Rock me on and on
(Rock me on and on)
And whisper softly to me
You wanna be my baby doll
(And be my)
On and on and on and on and on
(Baby doll)

(I just wanna be the one, your wanna
Rock it till the morning lie)
I wanna be your baby doll
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me through the night

Come on lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
(Ohh)
Rock me on and on
And whisper softly to me
Don't you wanna be my baby doll
(You wanna be my baby doll)

(Ohh)
Can you rock me on
And on and on
(Hmm hmm hmm hmm)
