Find myself singing the same songs everyday
Ones that make me feel good
When things behind the smiles ain't ok

Around and over and in-between the seas
I need to be on top of a mountain
Where I can be see everything
Cause this paranoia's getting old

Now as I open my eyes to start another day
I'm in a pile of puke
Empty bag of excuses
My love for friends and family
you know I need them

And under a sun that's seen it all before
My feet are so cold
And I can't believe that I have to bang my
Head against this wall again
But the blows they have just a little more
Space in-between them

Gonna take a breath and try again.
