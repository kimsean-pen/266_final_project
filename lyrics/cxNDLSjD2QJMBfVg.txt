If my heart bruises, everybody loses
Oh!
I can't stress enough
And on the weekend, everyone's my best friend

Oh!
I don't believe them
If I can't see the end, I can't see the beginnin'
There's no crystal ball to see the happy endin'

I know I can't say
That this will last forever
But I need you to know, I don't want you to go
If my hand loses, everybody bruises
Oh, you gotta believe me
And if the house wins, everybody else sins
Oh, thats just the city
If I can't see the end, I can't see the beginnin'

There's no crystal ball to see the happy endin'
I know I can't say
That this will last forever
But I need you to know, I don't want you to go

It's not in the cards
There's no crystal ball
There's no way to predict who will take it all
Can't always have what you want

You know it's fun to try
I see you gettin' turned on
I know the reason why
If my heart bruises, everybody loses
Oh, you gotta believe me
And on the weekend, everyone's your best friend
Oh, I don't believe them
