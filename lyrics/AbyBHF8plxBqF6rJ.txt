Like I said, I'm ready to go
Ease my pain desire
Last night I begged to god
Light my heart to fire

Let me pour some taste down
See my last silent pain desire
Let me take a last breath
Before I saw, blind my eyes

Triple corpse hammerblow
Triple corpse hammerblow

Don't push me...
Don't push me...
Don't push me!

Let it trust my great vow
Life goes away faster
Let it trust the meaning
Like life it was way before
Move away the blow out
Like it was by silent Bodom
The way it feels, like it feel before
How you feel, feel before!

Triple corpse hammerblow

Don't push me...
Don't push me...
Don't push me!
