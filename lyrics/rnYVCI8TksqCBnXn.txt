We love the pretty eyes and smile
We took a ship across to the isle
Nothing against your old trees
Nothing against your busy streets

The pints, the pubs, its in the palms
We even took some drugs inside the clubs But we
miss the golden sun Shines so bright where we come from
Its California that we love

Its California that we love
And nothing else will ever do
No drug can keep me from the sun
One gives you life
And one makes you blue

Ocean calls when were away
He wants to know if were okay
We always will love the USA
No matter where we go and play

Its California that we love
California is the drug
Californias all we want
Nobody else can take our love

Ocean calls when were away
He wants to know if were okay
We always will love the USA
No matter where we go and play

Its California that we love
California is the drug
Californias all we want
California is the drug

The pints, the pubs, its in the palms
We even took some drugs inside the clubs But we miss the golden sun
That shines down on everyone
Its California that we love
