It rained on the day that she went away
She never returned
Searching for something she'd lost on her way
She never came back

To me

It rained on the day that I fell asleep
I never returned
Searching for something I'd lost on my way
I never came back

To life

I dreamt of a mountain that I could not seize
I dreamt of a flower that I could not smell
I dreamt of treasures that I could not possess
I dreamt of dreams that were not true

She found a mountain, but would not seize
She found a flower, but would not smell
She found treasures, but would not possess
She found a life, but would not live

To where she went I don't know
But what I felt, she was close

She found a mountain, but would not seize
She found a flower, but would not smell
She found treasures, but would not possess
She found a life, but would not live
