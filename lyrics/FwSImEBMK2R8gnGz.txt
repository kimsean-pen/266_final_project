I'd cross a desert and an ocean
To get away from the pain of your storm
But chase the sun light, been running from your shadow
So that I could heal and I didn't feel

That zig-zag shooting through my heart
That zig-zag hit me like a dart
Electricity, electricity
Oh, this love's tearing me apart
I've been running like the light from the dark
Electricity keeps on hitting me

Oh lightning strikes twice
And it burns like ice
I wish I didn't love you again
Lightning strikes twice
And it burns so nice
I wish I didn't love you
(But I do)
(But I do)

Those eyes, one look and I'm enchanted
Your voice a serenade,
And it sings to my heart
One kiss turned the skies to grey
I'll never get away,
No shelter from the rain, oh

That zig-zag shooting through my heart
That zig-zag hit me like a dart
Electricity, electricity
Oh, this love's tearing me apart
I've been running like the light from the dark
Electricity keeps on hitting me

Oh lightning strikes twice
And it burns like ice
I wish I didn't love you again
Lightning strikes twice
And it burns so nice
I wish I didn't love you
(But I do)
(But I do)

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

O Fortuna
Velut luna
Statu variabilis
Semper crescis
Aut decrescis
Vita detestabilis

Every time that I hear your name, oh
Baby you're the pleasure, the pain

Lightning strikes twice
And it burns like ice
I wish I didn't love you again
(But I do)
(But I do)

O Fortuna
Velut luna
Statu variabilis
Semper crescis
Aut decrescis
Vita detestabilis
(But I do)
