Boyfriend,
be careful
'cause women are poisonous animals
boyfriend, oh boyfriend,
be careful if you can

There's glory coming out
I can hear it on our mouths
there is a stranded heart
swimming on careful air

Boyfriend,
oh boyfriend
be careful
cause women are poisonous animals
be careful if you can

There's glory coming out
I can taste it on our mouths
there is a stranger's heart
beating inside my chest

You call this passion
but I call it a cancer
