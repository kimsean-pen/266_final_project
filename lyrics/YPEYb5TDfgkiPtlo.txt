Tell me just how deep you would dig
If you could bury me
I'd claw my way back through hell to bring you to your knees
I want to see your face as you watch world fall apart at the seems

I know all your secrets
I know all your lies
You should know
What goes around comes around

You get what you came for
This time you've gone too far
I think you should know what you've done
You got what you deserve

You think you can sit back and act like everything's ok
Stripped of your crown, knocked off your throne,
It's the price you pay
I want to see your face as you watch the world fall apart at the seams

I know all your secrets
I know all your lies
You should know
What goes around comes around

You get what you came for
This time you've gone too far
I think you should know what you've done
You get what you deserve

You get what you came for
This time you've gone too far
I think you should know what you've done
You get what you deserve

You crossed the line
The wrong the right
The dark the night
You cry wolf
I've heard it a thousand times

You get what you came for
This time you've gone too far
I think you should know what you've done
You get what you deserve

You get what you came for
This time you've gone too far
I think you should know what you've done
You get what you deserve

You get what you deserve.
You get what you deserve.
