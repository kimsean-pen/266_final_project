So it's sad this doesn't suit you now,
And me fresh out of rope,
Please ignore the lisp,
I never meant to sound like this.
So take me and break me,
And make me strong like you,
I'll be forever grateful to, this and you.

It's only you, beautiful.
Or I don't want anyone.
If I can choose, It's only you.

Fix me to a chain around your neck,
Wear me like a nickel
Even new wine served in old skins cheapens the taste,
I shot the pilot,
I'm begging you to fly this for me,
I'm here for you to use, broken and bruised,
Do you understand?

It's only you, beautiful,
or I don't want anyone.
If I can choose, it's only you.
But how could I miscalculate?
Perfect eyes will have perfect aim.
If I can choose, its only you.

"We're wrecking and I'm dry like a drum...
When you scream,
So fine, I'll leave, we're spending, take our time and trials,
measured in miles, we slave for days and weeks.

It's only you, beautiful,
Or I don't want anyone.
If I can choose, it's only you.
But how could I miscalculate?
Perfect lies from a perfect dame.
If I could choose, it's only you.
