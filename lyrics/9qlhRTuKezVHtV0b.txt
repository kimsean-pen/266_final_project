Felt too much, did she feel a thing?
Long, dark hair, never saw her cry
In two halves I was torn
My maybe love who wouldn't even try

She loves me, she loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not

I saw you only yesterday
We shared a smile, then went our separate ways
Perhaps one day, never mind
All the nights we shared, were we just killing time?

She loves me, she loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not

For all the things I said to her
And all the ways I tried
And all the things I did for her
They're lost with one goodbye

She loves me, she love me not

She loves me, she loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not

For all the things I said to her
And all the ways I tried
And all the things I did for her
Were lost with one goodbye

She loves me, she love me not

She loves me, she loves me not
