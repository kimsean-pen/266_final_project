This mind is tired of war
Of misery and pain
A spirit wasting away
Like rivers to the sea

A spirit wasting away

In this agony
Unable to breathe
Calm rivals fear
On this earth beneath

A spirit wasting away

In this misery
The weariness of days
A life turned relict
Nothing else remains

A spirit wasting away

These bones have been burned
And hatred shall not last
The tools of sorrow cast
Have become the past

A spirit wasting away
A spirit wasting away
A spirit wasting away
