Bring it!

My life is perfect, so you believe
Are you that stupid? 'Cause I strongly disagree
I'm not a martyr, more like a thief
Your rules are twisted and they don't affect me

You saw me coming, so why you running?
What's the matter, it's just little old me
I know your kind, you're fucking blind
I give a shit, don't give a shit about anything

There aint nothing in this world for free
There's not a man, not a man I believe
Give a rat's ass what you think about me
I'll dots your eyes and cross your fucking teeth

Bring it!

You're just a trip, It's got to end
I stand in place while you motherfuckers bend
You own a clock, your time is up
You bottom feeders, it's just time to give up

Ready to throw down, this is a show down
You get the memo, 'cause it's all about to go down
I know I'm twisted, I can't resist it
I give a shit, don't give a shit about anything

There aint nothing in this world for free
There's not a man, not a man I believe
Give a rat's ass what you think about me
I'll dots your eyes and cross your fucking teeth

Bring it!

There's nothing in this world for me
I gave away, gave away fucking everything
This is the man that I'm choosing to be
I'll dots your eyes and cross your fucking teeth

Bring it!

Pressure's building breaking down
Suffocating TILL I DROWN

You know how the saying goes?
It's not the size of the dog in the fight
It's the size of the fight in the dog

YEAH
Bring it!

There aint nothing in this world for free
There's not a man, not a man I believe
Give a rat's ass what you think about me
I'll dots your eyes and cross your fucking teeth

Bring it!

There's nothing in this world for me
I gave away, gave away fucking everything
This is the man that I'm choosing to be
I'll dots your eyes and cross your fucking teeth

Bring it!
