I wanna get out, I wanna get out
I'm sick of giving in to these demons
I wanna get out, I wanna get out
I'm sick of giving in to these demons

With eyes wide open, all I see is the dark
Another hit, another mark
A small pinch and my whole world starts to spark
If I had another chance, I can't say what I'd do
The minds a tricky thing when it comes to the loss of you

Sometimes I hear her cries, silence is the dirtiest trick in life
If I'm so empty, then why do I feel alive?
Let's go back for the last time, when you breathe you lie
Pretty thing keep your mouth closed, and those legs tangled close

Dear shame, are you forever?
I'll never know what it's like to keep my head from spinning
I'll carry the flame for you, I'll carry the weight for you
In that moment I don't need to think twice, the end of a shattered life.

Sometimes I hear her cries, silence is the dirtiest trick in life
If I'm so empty, then why do I feel alive?
Let's go back for the last time, when you breathe you lie
Pretty thing keep your mouth closed, and those legs tangled close

I feel her body break under the weight My selfish lies, selfish lies, I can't do it any other way
Sometimes I hear her cries, I hear her cries
Under, under, under the weight of my love

Sometimes I hear her cries, silence is the dirtiest trick in life
If I'm so empty, then why do I feel alive?
Let's go back for the last time, when you breathe you lie
Pretty thing keep your mouth closed, and those legs tangled close
