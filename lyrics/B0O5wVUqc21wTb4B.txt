I'm in love with the sunshine
I'm in love with the falling rain
Everything
Seems to call your name

Yesterday
You were leaving
Leaving life and all the pain
Everything
Wants you back again
Wants you back again
Wants you back again

I've found myself through you
And there was love in my life
I felt always naturally high
And my love had a home
But now my mind has started to roam
You're my life giving fire
And you carried all my love
Through you I was so inspired
You're engraved deep in my
Heart
Heart
Heart
Heart

My dreams recall us being one
I've searched for you to be free
My force of life you have always been

I Feel blue
Since you've gone
Your breath of love surrounded me
When can I
Rejoin you to be free
Rejoin you to be free
Rejoin you to be free

Wait, can this be a dream
There is a voice in my head
It belongs to you, it says
"Don't cry, no need to be sad!"
There's a way to stay with you again
It's more than you ever had
And no death brings us apart
Our timeless love always grows
Because you are my other
Heart

I know we've never been apart
Your love sets fire to on my heart
We'll burn the sky
When it's time for me to die

We'll burn the sky
Oh, yeah!
We'll burn the sky
Oh, yeah!
We'll burn the sky
We'll burn the sky
We'll burn the sky
Oh, yeah!
