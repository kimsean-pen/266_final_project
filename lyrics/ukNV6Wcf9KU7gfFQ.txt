The same, always the same
Bitter words are all that remain
Of the dream that had taken you in
But all her words were dust in the wind

It's time to draw the line
To draw the fire
Why'd you never know?
The time to let go
The time to move aside
To let it slide

Say, what's that you say?
Time to move on
And you're in the way
Let's get to the end
And not turn around
She built you up, so she could knock you down

It's time to draw the line
To draw the fire
Why'd you never know?
The time to let go
It's time to move aside
To let it slide

Friend, there's nothing there
You're clinging on to air
You're reaching back
To something that
You never had

It's time to draw the line
To draw the fire
Why'd you never know?
The time to let go
The time to move aside
To let it slide
To let it slide
Why'd you never know?
It's time to let go
It's time to move aside
To let it slide
