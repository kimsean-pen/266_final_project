Is it OK if I speak to you today?
You've been pissed off for a week now
But nothing I could say could make you look up
Or crack up
Is there anything that I can do
Anything to show you

You're a bitch
But I love you anyway
Oh you can't sing
But you still put me to sleep
Baby
You're a bitch
Hey hey
Hey hey
You make me sick

But don't ever go away

So you tell me that there's nothing left to say
I'd rather you face the window
Then you're in my face telling me to grow up
I wish you'd grow up

I can't wait until you fall asleep
I wonder if you know that

You're a bitch
But I love you anyway
Oh you can't sing
But you still put me to sleep
Baby
You're a bitch
Hey hey

Hey hey
You make me sick
But don't ever go away

La
La la la
La la la
La la la
La la la
La la la

La la la
La la la
Whoa!
Uh!

You're a bitch
But I love you anyway
Oh you can't sing
But you still put me to sleep
Baby

You're a bitch
Hey hey
Hey hey
You make me sick
But don't ever go away
Yeah you're a bitch but I love you anyway
So why don't you...
Stay
