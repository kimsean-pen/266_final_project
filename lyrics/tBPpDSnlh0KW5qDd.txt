This is a shelter
They are sheltering you
From what is buried
Buried deep inside of you
'Cause you gave everything you could
You gave everything you could know
What was about to tear yourself apart
So I find you under the cover of
Everything you've loved so much
So I find you under the cover of night
I thought I'd lost you
I thought I'd lost you to
Everything you've lost your broken heart
I thought I'd lost you
Under the cover of night
'Cause you gave everything you could
You gave everything you could
You gave everything you could
You gave everything you could
You gave everything you could
You gave everything you could know
What was about to tear yourself apart
So I find you under the cover of
Everything you've loved so much
So I find you under the cover of night
I thought I'd lost you
I thought I'd lost you to
Everything you've loved your broken heart
I thought I'd lost you
Under the cover of night
I thought I'd lost you
Under the cover...
