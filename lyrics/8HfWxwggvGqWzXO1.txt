To install the notion that I divided by I
replace the occasion to speak
I'm not the only lonely boy...

Until I decide to take my watch off, I'll still believe that we
we're just a matter of time, still getting older everyday
(shout for shout sake)

Siren siren, don't do this dance in my ear,
In fact I've already lost him once
I do a deadly dance and all I've asked for so little
I've already lost him

If I decide to sever the plates below
the shore would separate and find only seven placed again.

Until I decide to take my watch off, I'll still believe that we
we're just a matter of time, still getting older everyday
(shout for shout sake)

Siren siren, don't do this dance in my ear,
In fact I've already lost him once
I do a deadly dance and all I've asked for so little
In fact I've already lost him

Before commemorating this anniversary
(ten feet tall and I still have the right to say, I hope you still believe)
