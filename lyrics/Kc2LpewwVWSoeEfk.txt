It was an evening I shared with the sun
To find out where we belong
From the earliest days
We were dancing in the shadows

More wine
Cuz I got to have it
More skin
Cuz I got to eat it

Inside the outside
By the river
Used to be so calm
Used to be so sane
I rushed the lady's room
Took the water from the toilet
Washed her feet and blessed her name

More peace
Is such a dirty habit

Slow down,
we're too afraid

Let me ride
Let me ride
Burn my eyes
Let me ride

It was an evening I shared with the sun
To find out where we belong
From the earliest days
We were dancing in the shadows

Slow down,
we're too afraid

Let me ride
Let me ride
Burn my eyes
Let me ride
Let me ride
Let me ride
Let me ride
Let me ride
Let me ride
Let me ride
Let me ride
