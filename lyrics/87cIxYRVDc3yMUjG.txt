I'm the one who leaves shadows
In your room at night
I'm the reason you're listening
Enlightening your eyes

When Pan meets Apollo
Down with the sin
They will send tears of angels
Though kindness won't win

Lost Northern star
Buried in sorrow
I'll guard your mind
Let demons howl outside

Where the calm fields of snow
Become one with the sky
I am there, I am waiting
As time passes by

I set up the weather
To suit how you feel
Drop rain down with wishes
Build grace out of steel

Lost Northern star
Buried in sorrow
I'll guard your mind
Let demons howl outside

My soul burns
My soul burns

Sending dream flakes your way
Painting pictures
To help you each day
Yet, you don't know I'm there

Lost Northern star
Buried in sorrow
I'll guard your mind
Let demons howl outside

My soul burns
