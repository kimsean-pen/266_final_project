Breathe deep
A couple of words that I tend to repeat
Nervous what's coming so I try to run away
But off in the distance I can hear you say
Like marrow in your bones you need me

I don't understand the pain inside my chest
It's all in my head you said
If I expire would you be a liar by feeling sorrow?

Nothing lasts forever both you and me know this
No one lasts forever both you and me

Just let me go bury myself in the snow
Maybe it's best to stay cold and be alone
Let the warm breeze become a song
That comfort sings in the front lawn
If I sink deep into promising arms
Will you think of me when I'm gone?

Sometimes I wonder if I'll last through the summer
Or if I will melt just like everyone else
Each day I stand tall with twigs in my skin
Begging they will never snap

I don't understand the pain inside my chest
Never remember, always forget
