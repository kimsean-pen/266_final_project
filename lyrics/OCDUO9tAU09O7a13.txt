Got to step back
Got to give it up
It's a long fall
From the high up
You've been gone too long
And I want you back
Got a soft back
Got to step it up

Ooh-a-ooh
Ooh-a-ooh

Got to know yourself
So scared of life
Never feel insane
But never feel right
Fell down the stairs
At your mom's house
Got to step back
Got to give it up

Ooh-a-ooh
Ooh-a-ooh
Ooh-a-ooh
Ooh-a-ooh

Ooh-a-ooh
Ooh-a-ooh
Ooh-a-ooh
Ooh-a-ooh
