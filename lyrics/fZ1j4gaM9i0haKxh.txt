She's a friend of mine
The kind you find in the night
When she's out for love
She's got sensual appetite
She jumps in the jeans
She's like a dream
Behind a broken rainbow
She walks on the seashells
She's looking out for love
She walks on the seashells
She's looking out for love
The boys are after her
And she don't want no nerds
You better give a s
Cause she can make you hurt
And with her hands
She plays with the sad
But I look like a rainbow
She walks on the seashells
She's looking out for love
She walks on the seashells
She's lookin' out for love
She walks on the seashells
She's looking out for love
She walks on the seashells
She's lookin' out for love
My love is not a dream
But it's not for you and me
My love is like an avalanche
Of thousand falling seas
Underneath the moon
My heart is very far
She's got high religion
I tell you she's my lucky star
It leads her behind
She walks on the seashells
She's looking out for love
She walks on the seashells
She's lookin' out for love...
