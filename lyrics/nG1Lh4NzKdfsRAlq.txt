Two, three, four
I drank all my fuckin' brew and I ain't got no more

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Feeling so damn tired
Running on desperate fumes
For the end is always near, now
Empty handed it's always soon

Psychocise me, terrify me
Jeopardizing all that's mine
Megolamize me, certify me
On my knees until I cry

Lord only knows where I've gone
Lord only knows where I've been

In a world of trouble again (yeah, yeah)
Worries streaming 'round the bend (yeah, yeah)
In a world of trouble again (yeah, yeah)
Worries streaming 'round the bend (yeah, yeah)

Treat me like a dog, now
Knowing I won't turn
Blind me like a slave, now
Cast down no concern

Psychocise me, terrify me
Jeopardizing all that's mine
Megolamize me, certify me
On my knees until I cry

Lord only knows where I've gone
Lord only knows where I've been

In a world of trouble again (yeah, yeah)
Worries streaming 'round the bend (yeah, yeah)
In a world of trouble again (yeah, yeah)
Worries streaming 'round the bend (yeah, yeah)
