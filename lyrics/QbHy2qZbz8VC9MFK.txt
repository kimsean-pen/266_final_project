This track, it won't be the end
It won't be a part of something that it wasn't meant to be
Hurt by the people, heard by the crowd
Recognized by a business made of fraud
I swear to God that this is the only thing I want for us
And I swear that I will hold on
Give it all
All day long

(I swear to God that it isn't over
This won't be my supernova)

I swear to God that it isn't over (Isn't over, no)
This won't be my supernova (Supernova)
I swear to God that it isn't over (Isn't over, no)
This won't be my supernova (Supernova)

This song is a monument
A dedication to those souls who never made it at all
Unheard by the prophets, padded with doubt
Damned to go under while they're screaming loud
I hope that everyone will see the fire in their eyes
I hope that someone will see that I was made for this and recognize

I swear to God that it isn't over (Isn't over, no)
This won't be my supernova (Supernova)
I swear to God that it isn't over (Isn't over, no)
This won't be my supernova (Supernova)

(I swear to God that it isn't over
This won't be my supernova)

It is so close
And yet so far
The only thing that I can say is
Nothing ventured, nothing gained

I swear to God that it isn't over (Isn't over, no)
This won't be my supernova (Supernova)
I swear to God that it isn't over (Isn't over, no)
This won't be my supernova (Supernova)
