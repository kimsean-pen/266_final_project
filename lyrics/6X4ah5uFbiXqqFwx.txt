See her in blue eyes
Numb and shining
In the face of strangers
In the city lights
Where he's climbing
Cupid's diving
And I know that she's come
To spend the night

I see her in every place I go
Sunday love is so cold
Even though I'm falling apart
I want Sunday love in my heart

I see her in blue eyes
Still and shining
And lonely lovers
On bed sheets white
Great ships slighting
I've been parting
She is in my bedroom
Now I can't fight

I see her in every place I go
Sunday love is so cold
Even though I'm falling apart
I want Sunday love in my heart
I see her in every place I go
Sunday love is so cold
Even though I'm falling apart
I want Sunday love in my heart

I see her in every place I go
Sunday love is so cold
Even though I'm falling apart
I want Sunday love in my heart
