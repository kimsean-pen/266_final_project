I never forgot how you inflamed my life
Holding up your pride
I've tried to ignore the pain
But it sounds confortable again
I never forgot when you threw away
My arms once side
I need you around me, but you're so far away

So far away from heaven
Sometimes so near me

Observant all over the years
Seems safe at all
Wishes and secret messages
Looks like a personal issue
If everything will makes you feel
At home sweet home
I got some news for you this morning
And I want to say it louder
I want to say it louder
So far away from heaven
Sometimes, so near to me

So far AWAY!
So far AWAY!

So far away from heaven...
