My thoughts are getting jaded
Along with my whole mind
And anything but apathy is hard to find
My soul is disconnected from all that I used to
know It's getting hard to know where I'm supposed to go

Now I am so far gone, I don't know where I belong
I find hard to carry on with all these curses
Why can't I ever seem to get things right
And closure is too far out of sight for me
For me

My brain is under pressure, it's buried underground
I try to find a place where I am safe and sound
Life keeps passing by and I spent every day trying to figure out why
Life keeps passing by and I just don't know why

Now I am so far gone, I don't know where I belong
I find hard to carry on with all these curses
Why can't I ever seem to get things right
And closure is too far out of sight for me

Collapse and relapse into my old ways
(My old ways)
I feel like I am drifting, like I've been gone for days

So far gone, I don't know where I belong
I find hard to carry on with all these curses
Now I am so far gone, I don't know where I belong
I find hard to carry on with all these curses
Why can't I ever seem to get things right
And closure is too far out of sight for me
For me, for me, for me
