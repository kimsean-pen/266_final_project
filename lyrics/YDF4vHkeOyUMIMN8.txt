If there was a plan to fail I would've found another way
To start over again and reset
I realized that if they told us to change
Then we would always stay the same
You can steal the sun but there's a light you can't replace
How does it feel to have everything you'll ever need
And know it's never gonna be, never gonna be enough?

Reforming
We're all terminal
Yeah, reforming

Did you sell your soul to the headlines?
We'll never let you take this away from us
There's no bribe I'd take to betray this trust
Teach our young why we can't survive?
Bow down to the hypocrites
Or the great deceivers of our innocence
Did you bite your tongue, live another lie?
The new wave of realistic minds
What's broken can be fixed
Me and my brothers know we'll never hide
We're living in a system on the brink of sacrifice
And still...

Why are we dying to live?
A sickness we're living in
From here to here
We're like a flickering flame
Never once the same
From here to here

You can steal the sun
It wouldn't be enough

If there was a plan to fail I would've found another way
To start over again and reset
I realized that if they told us to change
Then we would always stay the same
You can steal the sun but there's a light you can't replace
How does it feel to have everything you'll ever need
And know it's never gonna be, never gonna be enough?

We're all terminal
Can you feel it?
We're all terminal
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Reforming

From here to here

Why are we dying to live?
A sickness we're living in
From here to here
We're like a flickering flame
Never once the same
From here to here
Let go!
The grip as you struggle for this
Like the carrion crows
It's another vicious cycle
From here to hell
