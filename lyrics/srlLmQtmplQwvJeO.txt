Sometimes late
When things are real
And people share the gift of gab
Between themselves

Some are quick
To take the bait
And catch the perfect prize
That waits among the shells

But Oz never did give nothing to the Tin Man
That he didn't, didn't already have
And cause never was the reason for the evening
Or the tropic of Sir Galahad

So please believe in me
When I say I'm spinning round, round, round, round
Smoke glass stain'd bright colors
Image going down, down, down, down
Soaps a green like bubble

Oh Oz never did give nothing to the Tin Man
That he didn't, didn't already have
And cause never was the reason for the evening
Or the tropic of Sir Galahad

So please
Believe in me

When I say I'm spinning round, round, round, round
Smoke glass stain'd bright colors
Image going down, down, down, down
Soaps a green like bubble

No, Oz never did give nothing to the Tin Man
That he didn't, didn't already have
And cause never was the reason for the evening
Or the tropic of Sir Galahad

So please
Believe in me

Oooh ooh ooh ooh-uh
Oooh ooh ooh ooh

Oooh ooh (dab dabad dab)
Oooh ooh (dab dabad dab)
Oooh ooh (dab dabad dab)
Oooh ooh (dab dabad dab)
Oooh ooh (dab dabad dab)
Dab dab daah, Ooooh
