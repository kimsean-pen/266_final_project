These days they get older
And the darkness turns to blue
Yeah I will be the one you keep
When I come back to you
So generate the real
In everything you do
Yeah I will be the one you keep
When I come back to you
Just take me
Embrace me
And don't let go
This feeling inside me is all I know
Just take me
Embrace me
Just don't let go
This feeling inside me is all I know
These days they get older
And the darkness turns to blue
Yeah I will be the one you keep
When I come back to you
So generate the real
In everything you do
Yeah I will be the one you keep
When I come back to you
