I'm gonna etch my name in your heart,
Go, go, go,
I'll sit back, watch your world fall apart,
No, no, no,
You'll wish you'd never met me then,
I'm gonna break you down,
You underestimated me my friend,
So come on, come on, reach out

Oh, it's never gonna let you go,
Oh, it's gonna hit you blow by blow,
Woah, woah, it's waiting in your shadow,
Woah, woah, it's coming like an animal

I'm gonna smash the light in your,
Soul, soul, soul,
You'll suffer like I suffered for you,
You'll burn, burn, burn,
You'll wish you'd never met me then,
I'm gonna tear you down,
You underestimated me my friend,
So come on, come on, reach out
Woah,
So come on, come on, reach out,
Woah,
So come on, come on, reach out

Oh, it's never gonna let you go,
Oh, it's gonna hit you blow by blow,
Woah, woah, it's waiting in your shadow,
Woah, woah, it's coming like an animal,
It's coming like an animal,
It's coming like an animal,
It's coming like an animal,
It's coming like an animal

A-N-I-M-A-L
Animal

Oh, it's never gonna let you go,
Oh, it's gonna hit you blow by blow,
Woah, woah, it's waiting in your shadow,
Woah, woah, it's coming like an animal,
Oh, it's never gonna let you go,
Oh, it's gonna hit you blow by blow,
Woah, woah, it's waiting in your shadow,
Woah, woah, it's coming like an animal
