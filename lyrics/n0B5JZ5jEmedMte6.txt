Welcome to the Resistance

I've been a victim
I've been a coward hiding underneath my pain
I've been immobilized and watched the system destroy everything I loved
We cannot take this, we must resist this

Who will you follow when the world fades to the grey?
Where can I turn when the world gives up on me?

I keep waiting in the dark for someone to come and save me
And I've been holding on to something I can never change
We all search for higher ground when the world comes crashing down, but I know
Nobody will come in to the dark and save me

With iron claws and casted hearts
I feel my fear just fall apart
I'm melted down to clear my past
And then forged from fire so that I may ask:

Who will you follow when the world fades to the grey?
Where can I turn when the world gives up on me?

I keep waiting in the dark for someone to come and save me
And I've been holding on to something I can never change
We all search for higher ground when the world comes crashing down, but I know
Nobody will come in to the dark and save me

All new recruits, we have been surrounded by scarecrows
This is not a drill, I repeat this is not a drill
Runaway status is active to all new recruits effective immediately
System failure

Look what they've done to us
Look what they've done to us
Look what they've done to us

I've grown so sick of hiding
It's time we reclaim what's ours
They try to say what we'll become
And rearrange the stars

I know I'm sick and fucking tired of this mess they've made
So let their arrows block the sun
We will fight under the shade
