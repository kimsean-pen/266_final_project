We got Ringo and Ronnie Wood gonna help us out on this one, too.

They say everything can be replaced
They say every distance is not near
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here

I see my light come shinin'
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

They say ev'ry man needs protection
They say that every man must fall
But I swear I see my reflection
Somewhere so high above this wall

I see my light come shinin'
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

Down here in this lonely crowd
There's a man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear him shouting
So loud just crying out that he's been framed

I see my light come shinin'
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
