Something still comes over me
Just a chill in a winter breeze
Standing in the cold debris
Left behind a memory

Every word that left your lips
Left behind your fingerprints
Every crime that love commits
Brings you right back here to this

I only want to be remembered
For being the one who'd always say
That I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you endlessly
I'll never be one to yell surrender
As long as you're standing next to me
Cause I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you endlessly

No escaping this embrace
Everytime I see your face
Around the love I can't erase
Wouldn't want to anyway

I only want to be remembered
Being the one who'd always say
That I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you endlessly
I'll never be one to yell surrender
As long as you're standing next to me
Cause I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you endlessly

Ooooh

I only want to be remembered
Being the one who'd always say
That I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you endlessly
I'll never be one to yell surrender
As long as you're standing next to me
Cause I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you endlessly
