You just keep tuggin, pushin, pullin, all my little heart strings
Got me all tied up in knots, anytime I see your face
Oh, it brings out, it brings out the girl in me
Don't know just how you did it, but you got me real good
line and sinker like I knew you could,
But you don't even notice, boy I wish you would
I can't help myself

I can't help but smile, every time I see your face
If we never met, I bet you don't know my name
Am I outta my mind, I think that I might be goin crazy
Cause my heart is yours to have and hold or break
How do you get to be so close and be so far away

I think you might be close to perfect, cause you know what I mean
He's got a face straight out of a magazine,
Gotta pinch myself to prove he ain't a dream, (oh oh oh)
I can't help myself, now my secrets out

I can't help but smile, every time I see your face
If we never met, I bet you don't know my name
Am I outta my mind, I think that I might be goin crazy
Cause my heart is yours to have hold or break
How do you get to be so close and be so far away

I wish you were mine,
All mine, mine all mine,
I wish you mine, all mine,
I wish you were mine

I can't help but smile, every time I see your face
If we never met, I bet you don't know my name
Am I outta my mind, I think that I might be goin crazy
Cause my heart is yours to have and hold or break
How do you get to be so close and be so far away (oh, oh, oh)
How do you get to be so close and be so far away
