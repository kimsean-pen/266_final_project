If I keep holding out will the light shine through?
Under this broken roof, it's only rain that I feel
I've been wishing out the days. come back

I have been planning out all that I'd say to you
Since you slipped away. Know that I still remain true
I've been wishing out the days.

Please say, that if you hadn't of gone now
I wouldn't have lost you another way
From wherever you are. come back

And these days, they linger on
And in the night I've been waiting for
The real possibility I may meet you in my dream
I go to sleep

If I don't fall apart will my memories stay clear
So you had to go and I had to remain here

But the strangest thing to date
So far away
And yet you feel so close
And I'm not gonna question it any other way

There must be an open door
For you to come back

And the days, they linger on
And every night, what I'm waiting for
Is the real possibility I may meet you in my dreams

And sometimes you're here and you're talking back to me
Come the morning I could swear you're next to me
And it's okay.
It's okay
It's okay
I'll be here
Come back
Come back
I'll be here
Come back
Come back
I'll be here
Come back
Come back
