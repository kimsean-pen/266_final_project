We got lifted on a Monday
Then we floated away and it was Sunday
All we want is to forget
All we want is to forget
We get high up on the low down
Every day spinning like a merry-go-round
All we want is to forget
All we want is to forget

Wake up every morning, we got troubles at our door
We get lifted right away, no we don't touch the floor
We want to see in color
We want to feel each other lifted
Drifting through the day, no I don't make my mama proud
She keep trying to talk to me, but I am in the clouds
No, we don't feel the pressure
Up here the air is fresher, lifted

We got lifted on a Monday
Then we floated away and it was Sunday
All we want is to forget
All we want is to forget
We get high up on the low down
Every day spinning like a merry-go-round
All we want is to forget
All we want is to forget

We got lifted on a Monday
Then we floated away and it was Sunday
All we want is to forget
All we want is to forget
We get high up on the low down
Every day spinning like a merry-go-round
All we want is to forget
All we want is to forget
