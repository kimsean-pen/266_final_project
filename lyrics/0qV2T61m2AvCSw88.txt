I was so lost, didnt know what to do with myself
I was my own worst enemy
I was lost and know I needed help

Then you came along and saw the state I was in
You picked me up, when I was down
Showed me how to live again

I say thank you for pulling me through
Im a lucky man
I didnt know what life was but now I understand

This is precious love, precious love
No, I cant let it go
This is precious love and its teaching me
Everything I need to know

This is precious love, oh its precious love
No, I cant get enough
Oh, Im down on my knees, begging you please
Give me some more of that stuff

Oh, its love, love, love, love, love, precious love
Oh, its love, love, love, love, love, precious love

Oh, I got so distracted by people all around
Whispering sweet nothings
Filling my head with doubt

So I gave up, it didnt take long
For me to see the one thing that I was missing
Was standing in front of me

I took you for granted, thought the grass
Was greener on the other side
I was wrong and its taken so long for me to finally realize

This is precious love, precious love
No, I cant let it go
This is precious love and its teaching me
Everything I need to know

Oh this precious love, oh its precious love
No, I cant get enough
Oh, Im down on my knees, begging you please
To give me some more of that stuff

I say a prayer and send it to you
That my heart will always be true
Life wont be the same without you

So I say thank you
Im a lucky man
I didnt know what life was but now I, now I understand
Understand, understand

Oh, this is love, love, love, love, precious love
This is precious love and its teaching me to be a better man

This is precious love, precious love
No, I cant get enough
Oh, Im down of my knees
Its there that I see, it must be from heaven above

Yeah, its is love, love, love, love, precious love
Its is love, love, love, love, precious love
Love, love, love, give me love, give me love
Love, love, love, love, precious love
