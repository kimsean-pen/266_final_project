Red and yellow and green,
Twisting and blurring,
Twisting and blurring,

Red and yellow and green,
Twisting and blurring,
Twisting and blurring,

Clouds are billowing from you,
I dip my hand into the swirling mist,
What about the life you had hoped?
Say you will keep on hoping,

Red and yellow and green
Twisting and blurring
Twisting and blurring
Red and yellow and green
Twisting and blurring
Twisting and blurring

You said we're all snow
We're all snow
We're all snow
And I am a damson
I am a damson
I am a damson
But I feel so small

The lives gone and lives to come,
The lives gone and lives to come,
The lives gone and lives to come,
The lives gone and lives to come,
Tangerine lights droplets refracting,
Tangerine lights droplets refracting,
Tangerine lights droplets refracting,
Tangerine lights droplets refracting,

Refracting,
Refracting,

The lives gone and lives to come,
The lives gone and lives to come,
The lives gone and lives to come,
The lives gone and lives to come.
