Oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm in recovery
Can't you see?
I just need time all by myself
No I don't need your remedy
I just need to find new kinds of health
I'm in recovery
I thought I'd be
Officially over you by now
I'm discovering
How much you've been
A part of me
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

Speak up if you know what I mean
Love is like a biding disease
Memory marks are debris
So everywhere I look, it's you that I'll see

I'm trying to distract
Come on, try and make me laugh
Help me not have to work through this
That bumper sticker's right
Only you can change a life
Somewhere I lost my confidence
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

I'm in recovery
Can't you see?
I just need time all by myself
No I don't need your remedy
I just need to find new kinds of health
Active recovery
I thought I'd be
Officially over you by now
I'm discovering
How much you've been
A part of me
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

We were riding cool and high (high)
The grass was green from every side
But I dropped right out, I felt fine
When you said, "I just need some time"
Huh

I try not to react
But I keep on going back
'Cause a hand that beats don't fill me up
We got to taste of us
Got me losing all my trust
God, just let me be anonymous

I'm in recovery
Can't you see?
I just need time all by myself
No, no I don't need your sympathy
I just need your photo off the shelf
Active recovery
I thought I'd be
Artificially over you by now
But I'm discovering
How much you've been
A part of me
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

I'm in recovery
Can't you see?
No, I don't need your remedy
Recovery
I thought I'd be
Officially
Time all by myself
I'm discovering
How you've been
A part of me
Recovery
Time all by myself
Time all by myself
Time all by myself
