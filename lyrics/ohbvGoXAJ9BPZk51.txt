Time stops for no one and moves on unaware
It's easy not to notice, it's easy not to care
Conversation circles, there's money changin' hands
I've been standin' in the middle, I've been caught up in the spin

Out of the confusion, the static and the noise
You got my attention, it made me wanna

Live like it's the last moon rise and
Scream just like no one's there, lose all of my defenses
Hold you, touch you, love you like it's
A very last moment in time

It seems like I woke up beneath a different sky
And I'm drunk' I want I'm seein' through these open eyes
All the little ways you move me, all the places you expose
The illusion I held on to, you've got me lettin' go

Fallin' out around me watch the world away

Live like it's the last moon rise and
Scream just like no one's there, lose all of my defenses
Hold you, touch you, love you like it's
A very last moment in time

Let me feel you next to me, let me taste the breath you breathe
Open up the space between us

Live like it's the last moon rise and
Scream just like no one's there, lose all of my defenses
Hold you, touch you, love you like it's
A very last moment in time

Live like it's the last moon rise and
Scream just like no one's there, lose all of my defenses
Hold you, touch you, love you like it's
A very last moment in time
