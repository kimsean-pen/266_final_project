They call her smokey taboo
I got your name tattooed
High like a helium balloon
Midnight to noon
I'm a desert child
And mountains make me nauseous

I like to look up wild at an infinite sky
Twinkling with diamonds
It's true I get depressed in fancy hotel rooms
Undressed with nothing to flaunt but my loneliness
Thinking of the night song of your hair
Premature as evening falls it calls to me
Interrupted by the sirens in the street

Cristal heaven, cristal heaven
Cristal heaven, cristal heaven

Somedays you're like an anchor on my heart
They say that stolen water tastes sweet
More like rotten milk and rancid meat to me
I prefers when it is free
Like looking at the stars
Don't need no fancy cars
When we first
Our kisses sparked
Yeah I'm afraid of sharks
But not the dark

High like helium balloons
In an infinite sky
Twinkling with our diamonds
When first our kisses sparked
Crystal heaven
This was crystal heaven
Heaven
