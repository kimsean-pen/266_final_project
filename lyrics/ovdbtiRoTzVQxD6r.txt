Shame, such a shame
I think, I kind of lost myself again
Day, yesterday
Really should be leaving, but I stay

Say, say my name
I need a little love, to ease the pain
Need a little love, to ease the pain
It's easy to remember, when it came

'Cause it feels, like I've been, I've been here before
You are not my savior, but I still don't go
Feels like something that, I've done before
I could fake it, but I still want more

Fade, made to fade
Passion's overrated anyway
Say, say my name
Need a little love to ease the pain
I need a little love to ease the pain
It's easy to remember, when it came

'Cause it feels, like I've been, I've been here before
You are not my savior, but I still don't go
I feel live something that, I've done before
I could fake it, but I still want more
