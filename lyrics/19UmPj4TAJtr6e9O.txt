I was just a wanderin' soul
working through the highs and lows
I heard a spirit whisper slow
drift into a great unknown
will anybody see my ghost?

Ooooooh
I can see light
Ooooooh
so let me off at the end of the night
Cause all my friends are givin' up
and I've had enough
Oooooooh
I can feel the weight of a thousand eyes on me...

I began to hear my name
and silence in a hurricane
the dust was leaving from my veins
like some forgotten border train
carried to my home again

Oooooh
I can see the light
Ooooooh
So let me off at the end of the night
cause all my friends are givin' up
and I've had enough
Oooooh
I can feel the weight of a thousand eyes on me.
Oohh, ooooh...

I wait in darkness
but I can feel calling
hear callin'
As I shut my wanting eyes
I sat longing to lie down...

I can see the light
Ooooh
so let me off at the end of the night
cause all my friends are givin up
and I've had enough
oooooh
I can feel the weight of a thousand eyes on me.
Ooohhh, oooo...
Ohh, oooo...
Ohhhhh...
