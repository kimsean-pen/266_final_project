Far beyond the desert road
Where everything ends up
So good the empty space
Mental erase, forgive, forgot

Heal them, like fire from a gun
Kneeling, my god is the sun
Heal them, with fire from above
Kneeling, my god is the sun

I don't know what time it was
I don't wear a watch
So good to be an ant who crawls
Atop a spinning rock
(Beyond...)

Heal them, like fire from a gun
Kneeling, my god is the sun
Heal them, with fire from above
Kneeling, my god is the sun

Heal them, like fire from a gun
Kneeling, my god is the sun
Healing, kneeling
Godless heathens

Godless heathens always want from the sky...
