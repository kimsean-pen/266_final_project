I was feeling nostalgic for the days when
My thoughts dripped on to my head from the ceiling.
I remember the feeling of the museless existence
Of the drunk, bored and listless,
Endless waiting for something that I knew wasn't coming.

And it seems these days I'm captive in this borrowed time.
Seems these days I'm captive in this borrowed time.
Seems these days I'm captive in this borrowed time.
Seems these days I'm captive in this-

I was up to my neck in motivation neglect when
I felt soft waves of purpose crashing onto the surface.
I was feeling nostalgic for the days when
My thoughts dripped on to my head from the ceiling.
I remember the feeling

And it seems these days I'm captive in this borrowed time.
Seems these days I'm captive in this borrowed time.
Seems these days I'm captive in this borrowed time.
Seems these days I'm captive in this-
