Take me to the other side
'Cause my hands are as cold as ice
Leave a heart-shaped hole in my chest
As the thoughts of you leave my head

Oh and it's the only way
It's the, it's the only way
Oh it's the only way
It's the, it's the only way
Oh it's the only way
It's the, it's the only way
Out

And you're my storm
I can't compete
And I'm forlorn now, moving only on your breeze
I'll never be free
And I'll never be free

When I've got nothing left to lose
I wonder what I'll find
Without the simple sight of you
To give me peace in mind

But you're my storm
I can't compete
And I'm forlorn, moving only on your breeze
I'll never be free
And I'll never be free
