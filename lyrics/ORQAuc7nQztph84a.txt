Ain't the pictures enough?
Why do you go through so much
To get the story you need,
So you can bury me?
You've got the people confused
You tell the stories you choose
You try to get me to lose
The man I really am.
You keep on stalking me
Invading my privacy
Won't you just let me be?
'Cause your cameras can't control
The minds of those who know
That you'll even sell your soul just to get a story sold
I need my privacy
I need my privacy
So paparazzi
Get away from me
Some of you still wonder why
One of my friends had to die
To get a message across
That yet you haven't heard
My friend was chased and confused
Like many others I knew
But on that cold winter night
My pride was snatched away
She get no second chance
She just ridiculed and harassed
Please tell my why
Now there's a lesson to learn
Respect's not given, it's earned
Stop maliciously attacking my integrity
I need my privacy
I need my privacy
So paparazzi
Get away from me
Now there's a lesson to learn
Stories are twisted and turned
Stop maliciously attacking my integrity
I need my privacy
I need my privacy
So paparazzi
Get away from me
I need my privacy
I need my privacy
So paparazzi
Get away from me
I need my privacy
I need my privacy
So paparazzi
Get away from me
