Wanna be here, dancing on the floor
Don't know really what you're waiting for

'Cause we live that life

We on that all night, get it right

I might love you forever
We on that first time love high
Just keep on moving
'Cause I just might love you forever

So love the way we going back and forth
Dance until we can't do it no more
Every night, stop it so speed it up, slow it down
