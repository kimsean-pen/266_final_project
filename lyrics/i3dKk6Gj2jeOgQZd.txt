Gotta slow up, gotta shake this high
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
'Cause if I don't walk then I'll get caught out
And I'll be falling all the way down

(Hundred, hundred, hundred) hundred headlights making me blind
All of your pleasures catching my eye
If I jump once then I never think twice
But your temptations make me stay another night

And my senses only lie to me, lie to me
I don't know how I feel so raw to me, raw to me
I gotta check myself before I get what I want
Find out it's not what I thought it was
And you know I

Gotta slow up, gotta shake this high
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
'Cause if I don't walk then I'll get caught out
And I'll be falling all the way down
Turn my head and shut my eyes
Doesn't even matter if I'm wrong or right
'Cause if I don't walk I'll keep myself around
And I'll be falling all the way down

Tell myself leave, while I'm still strong
Going on back till I'm 10 miles gone
And when the road stops I'm gonna keep on
Until I end up in the place that I belong

But the pressure's pushing me back again
Telling me not to pretend
There's any use even trying to get you out my head
So I lift my feet off the ground
And I'm gonna walk right up

Gotta slow up, gotta shake this high
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
'Cause if I don't walk then I'll get caught out
And I'll be falling all the way down
Turn my head and shut my eyes
Doesn't even matter if I'm wrong or right
'Cause if I don't walk I'll keep myself around
And I'll be falling all the way down

Won't get caught in the old fly trap
Run away, run away, never come back
No way I'm going down like that
No, no, run away, run away
Won't get caught in the old fly trap
(I can't get caught up again)
Run away, run away, never come back
No way I'm going down like that
(No way, no way)
No, no, run away, run away

Gotta slow up, gotta shake this high
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
'Cause if I don't walk then I'll get caught out
And I'll be falling all the way down
Turn my head and shut my eyes
Doesn't even matter if I'm wrong or right
'Cause if I don't walk I'll keep myself around
And I'll be falling all the way down

I'm better walk now
I'm better walk now, yeah
No, no, no
Better walk, yeah
Yeah.
No, no, no, no, no
