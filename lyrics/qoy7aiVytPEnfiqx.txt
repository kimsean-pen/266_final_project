I saw red
For the first time
And it soon became
The only color
That I seemed to recognize
But I had to say

Goodbye
Nice to know you
Goodbye
Hope to see you soon.

Then I turned blue
When I left her
I was only passing through for the day
Then I had to go away
Will I ever
See that color?

Goodbye
Nice to know you
Goodbye
Hope to see you soon.

Then I turned white when I found
That this certain shade that I used to see
As grey would fade

Goodbye
Nice to know you
Goodbye
Hope to see you soon

Goodbye
Nice to know you
Bye
Hope to see you soon
Goodbye
