Walk you to the counter
What you got to offer?
Pick you out a solder
Look at you forever
Walk you to the water
Your eyes like a casino
We ain't born typical

Find a piece of silver
Pretty as a diagram
And go down to the rio
Put it in my left hand
Put it in a fruit machine
Everyone's a winner

Laughin' like a seagull

You are a fever
You are a fever
Ya ain't born typical
You are a fever

You are a fever
Ya ain't born typical

Livin' in a suitcase
Meet a clown, fall in love
Went down to have you over
Goin' round and break up
Take you to a jukebox
That's the situation
Pick you out a number
And that's our arrangement
Dancing on the legs of a new-born pony
Left right left right
Keep it up son
Go ahead and have her
Go ahead and leave her
You only ever had her
When you were a fever
I am a fever
I am a fever
I ain't born typical
I am a fever
I am a fever
I ain't born typical
We are a fever
We are a fever
We ain't born typical
We are a fever
We are a fever
We ain't born typical
We are a fever
We are a fever
We ain't born typical
We are a fever
We are a fever
We ain't born typical
