If you're blue and you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits?
Puttin' on the ritz

Different types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes
And cutaway coat, perfect fits
Puttin' on the ritz

Dressed up like a million dollar trooper
Tryin' hard to look like Gary Cooper (super duper)

Come, let's mix where Rockefellers walk with sticks
Or umbrellas in their mitts
Puttin' on the ritz

Have you seen the well-to-do?
Up and down Park Avenue
On that famous thoroughfare
With their noses in the air
High hats and arrow collars
White spats and lots of dollars
Spending every dime for a wonderful time

If you're blue and you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits?
Puttin' on the ritz

Different types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes
And cutaway coat, perfect fits
Puttin' on the ritz

If you're blue and you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits?
Puttin' on the ritz
Puttin' on the ritz
Puttin' on the ritz
Puttin' on the ritz

Downtown
Uptown
Get your kicks
At the ritz
Dine and wine, but not till nine
The time is right for us tonight
We can move
Move to the rhythm
We can
Move

Dance to the rhythm
Nice and easy
I want you to move
Puttin' it on, puttin' it on
Puttin' it on, puttin' it on
The R-I-T-Z
How about you and me, says

Got to dance
Got to dance

If you're blue and you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits?
Puttin' on the ritz
