I know my uses, I have my pride
But my heart is still untamed
I learned my lessons, I've conquered death
I go on, and I'm unashamed
I'll paint your bones to match my eyes
They're the darkest I have ever seen
Until I'm lucid, I can't be told
I know my voices, they tell me to believe
Another fucking accident out of control
All the attitudes will never change
My imitations are leading the way
I can't accept that I still don't find this strange

In light of my ability to feel denial
I walk away from everything with just a smile
The agony of coming home has gone away
It's everywhere, it's everyone, it's every day

Are you ready for the time of your life?
Are you ready for the time of your life?

I beg your pardon, I'm out of the way
A new conspiracy has taken my place
So over and over, I smell the decay
Believe what you want to, the cycle stays the same

In light of my ability to undermine
I walk away from apathy, I'm feeling fine
The agony of cynicism beckons me
It's everywhere, it's everyone, it's everything

Are you ready for the time of your life?
Are you ready for the time of your life?
Are you ready for the time of your life?
Are you ready for the time of your life?

Let's pretend we're not at the end
Pretend that we have nothing left
Let's pretend we're not at the end
Pretend that we have nothing left
Let's pretend we're not at the end
Pretend that we have nothing left
Let's pretend we're not at the end
Pretend that we have nothing left

Are you ready for the time of your life?
Are you ready for the time of your life?
Are you ready for the time of your life?
Are you ready for the time of your life?
Are you ready for the time of your life?

Let's pretend we're not at the end
Pretend that we have nothing left
Let's pretend we're not at the end
Pretend that we have nothing left
