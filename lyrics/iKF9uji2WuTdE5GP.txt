Don't you mind people grinnin' in your face
Don't you mind people grinnin' in your face
Oh, bear this in mind a truthful end is hard to find
So don't you mind people grinnin' in your face

You know your mother would talk about you
Your own sisters and your brothers too
They don't care how you're tryna' live
They talk about you still
Oh, bear this in mind a truthful end is hard to find
So don't you mind people grinnin' in your face

You know they jump you up and down
They'll carry you around and 'round
Just as soon as your back is turned, they try to crush you down
But bear this in mind a truthful end is hard to find
So don't you mind people grinnin' in your face

Don't you mind people grinnin' in your face
Don't you mind people grinnin' in your face
Oh, bear this in mind a truthful end is hard to find
So don't you mind people grinnin' in your face
