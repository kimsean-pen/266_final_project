Don't wanna be a broken record
Don't wanna see the same refrain
That I can't stop, I can't stop feel it again
I don't wanna fight the feeling
But it keeps fighting me
I can't stop, I can't stop of us frighting
I know I got you going in circles
And been proven money through my mind
I think I've finally found the nerve this time
To say, baby

I want nobody but you
Ain't nobody who can take all my doubts
And turn 'em upside down
Baby, not gon' get me confused
I'll come running with my heart open wide
I'm gonna give it all to you this time

And maybe I'm a little hasty
A little bit ahead of myself
But I can't stop, I can't stop
I need your help
My mind is like a rollercoaster
And baby you should ride with me
No I can't stop, I can't stop, so exciting
I know I had you goin' in circles
I'd be swinging you from side to side
I think I've finally found the nerve this time
To say, baby

I want nobody but you
Ain't nobody who can take all my doubts
And turn 'em upside down
Baby, not gon' get me confused
I'll come running with my heart open wide,
I'm gonna give it all to you this time

Listen, I stumble and I fall
I get so emotional
The voices in my head
They made me scared
But I needed some time
Just to make up my mind
But now your voice is clear to me
It's Saying in my ears

Baby, I want nobody but you
Cause there ain't nobody who can take all my doubts
And turn 'em upside down
Baby, not gon' get me confused
I'll come running with my heart open wide,
I'm gonna give it all to you this time

I want nobody but you
Ain't nobody who can take all my doubts
And turn 'em upside down
Baby, not gon' get me confused
I'll come running with my heart open wide,
I'm gonna give it all to you this time

I'm gonna give it all to you baby

Baby, I want nobody but you
Ain't nobody but you
Upside down, baby
I want nobody but you
'Cause it ain't nobody but you
Baby, I want nobody but you
Upside down, baby
I want nobody but you
