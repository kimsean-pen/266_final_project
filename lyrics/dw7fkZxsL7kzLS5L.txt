Steal my sight and then
Fill my mind with foreign words
to keep me wanting

And speak now child
And chill my heart
with all the hurt and keep me suffering
All these promises
Lectures and bold face lies
All these promises
Born of a shameless mind

Leave me to heal on my own
With those empty cool promises
You stole my dreams
Yeah all my dreams I'm dead inside
Please let me feel my way home without reason or compromise
You stole my dreams
Now all I believe is dead inside

Be quick now child
And soil my bed with all your dirt
Just keep me suffering
All these promises
Lectures and bold face lies
All these promises
Born of a shameless mind

Leave me to heal on my own
With those empty cool promises
You stole my dreams
Yeah all my dreams I'm dead inside
Please let me feel my way home without reason or compromise
You stole my dreams
Now all I believe is dead inside

Don't let me sleep
Take me back
But don't let me be comfortable
If you get too weak
Cut no slack
But don't me be comfortable

Don't let me sleep
Take me back
But don't let me be comfortable

Leave me to heal on my own
With those empty cool promises
You stole my dreams
Yeah all my dreams I'm dead inside
Please let me feel my way home without reason or compromise
You stole my dreams
Now all I believe is dead inside
If you say you're alive
When you pray you're a liar
Oh you'll hate when I'm right
And you lay in the fire
