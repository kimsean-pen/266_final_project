Wretched faces, faces, faces, this is nothing new to me
But still, enraptured, don't keep grabbing the wind
This is a loaded gun, this is a loaded question
When can you stop? When is perfection?

Maybe I'm already the one out
Consolidate all of your fears
I, I can't take it, nothing sacred
This is of course as told from the knife

You painted your eyes to make them wide again
I tip my hat to the great, to the classics

This is not my face, this is this week's fear
This is not my voice, they tell you to speak the hesitation
This is not my fate, they can't take it, take it away, take it away
This is not mine anymore

Take hold, bring it all back down to, to the first love
This is not my fate

All in vain, all in vain, all in vain, all in vain
All in vain, all in vain, all in vain, all in vain
