Take all you know
And you let it go
Inside the snow
Begins to fall

Step to the edge
You and I
And we fall below
Take a breath
Hold my hand
And now you're not alone

Calling now
It terrifies me
And I don't know why
There you go
You're paralyzing me
And I don't know why

Everything
Is black and white and grey
The walls are shaking
When you're touching me
Change is everything
When you're close to me

Back to back
Hand to hand
Face to face again
Lover and
Enemies
Then we're back to friends

Something left
Holding us
Pulls me closer in
Take a breath
And the color will return again

Calling now
It terrifies me
And I don't know why
There you go
You're paralyzing me
And I don't know why

Everything
Is black and white and grey
The walls are shaking
When you're touching me
Change is everything
Change is everything
The walls are shaking
Change is everything
When you're close to me
