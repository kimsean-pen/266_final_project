Dilgi-ta gia-he My life is gone
App meri jan-le giye Because you take my soul (breath) away
Dilgi-ta gia-he My life is gone
App meri jan-le giye Because you take my soul (breath) away

We saw the holy men
come in from Sanchi
We touched their souls
and heard the Martyrs crying
Among the fields of red
We took the strange brew
The windless sky diwali
Moon were calling to me
The deeper I go
The higher I fly with you

You take my breath away
Ooho you...

?
Mera Raja My king
Mera Raja My king

You take my breath away...

You take my breath away
Ooho you...
