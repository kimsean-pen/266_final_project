Feeling the time peel away at my life again.
As memories combine, not sure where I've ever been.
'Cause it's the D in Detroit which scares me to no end. I'll count to ten.
When living this down makes so much sense.

We collide - and onward we do fly
We collide - and onward we do fly
Onward - until we hit again.

I kept your picture just behind the eye those weeks when our distance grew.
Drove north where I found you waiting in Des Moines - thank God I'm not losing
you
And girl I hope you're not alone - and sleep through this weather
And girl I hope you're whole again - back home we'll sleep better.

We collide - and onward we do fly
