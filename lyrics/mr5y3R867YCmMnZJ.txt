When all of us turn to dust
Will you teach me how to love
We'll no longer whisper the tongue of lies
You ate my heart out, I am stone

Your damaged skin on top of mine
I buried the mind that clenched too tight
Teach me the comfort of denial
You ate my heart out, I am stone
I've grown indifferent to desire
Stop running through my eyes
Tie me up and feed me lies
You ate my heart out, I am stone

The world drained me of kindness
Drift words can only mean as much
I was nothing, I didn't matter
You ate my heart out, I am stone

I'm hungry, but I'm losing taste
Let me turn my back on home
Seeking love without boundaries
You ate my heart out, I am stone

I blame the barren sky
For drying out my filthy mouth
Who will decide if I care enough
You ate my heart out, I am stone
