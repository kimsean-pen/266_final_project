She wears a white dress
She sees the light and it's saying 'Come back'
She's out the door but she hasn't left yet
And I start believing her when she says that

The city's gonna save her love
Don't leave her, I know just what she's looking for
Oh, but all she knows is a picture that keeps fading on
But I can't let her go that's why I'm telling her

I wanna love you more
Than all of the things you wanted
Than all of the things you're not

You want to have it all
But you found it in the city
But the city doesn't talk, oh

She wears a gold cross
She sheds her skin but it never comes off
She hears the angels out on the streets tonight
As she walks right by, oh, they sing so softly

They sing, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Love's right behind you, oh whoa

I wanna love you more
Than all of the things you wanted
Than all of the things you're not

You want to have it all
But you found it in the city
But the city doesn't talk

Than all of the things you wanted
Than all of the things you've got
But you found it in the city
But the city doesn't talk

Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Oh, she floats off through a crowded room
She remembers the rows and rows of houses
And the street lights going on, that's why I'm telling her

I wanna love you more
Than all of the things you wanted
Than all of the things your not

And you want to have it all
But you found it in the city
But the city doesn't talk

I wanna love you more
Than all of the things you wanted
Than all of the things you've got

And you want to have it all
But you found it in the city
But the city doesn't talk

Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Love's right behind you
