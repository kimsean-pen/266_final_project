I, I, I, I can't explain a thing and
I, I, I, I want everything
To change and stay the same
Oh time doesn't care about anyone or anything

Come together
Come apart
Only get lonely when you read the charts

Oh baby, when they made me
They broke the mold
Girls used to follow me around
Then I got cold

Throw your cameras in the air
And wave them like you just don't care

I will never believe in anything again!
I will never believe in anything again!
Oh, change will come
Oh, change will come
I will never believe in anything again

We will never believe again
Kick drum beating in my chest again
We will never believe again
Preach electric to a microphone stand, oh

I'm a mascot for what you've become
I, I, I love the mayhem more than the love

Oh baby, when they made me
They broke the mold
Girls used to follow me around
Then I got cold

Throw your cameras in the air
And wave them like you just don't care

I will never believe in anything again!
I will never believe in anything again!
Oh, change will come
Oh, change will come
I will never believe in anything again

We will never believe again!
Kick drum beating in my chest again
We will never believe again
Preach electric to a microphone stand

Throw your cameras in the air
And wave them 'cause I just don't care
Throw your cameras in the air
And wave them 'cause I just don't care

I will never believe in anything again!
I will never believe in anything again!

Oh, change will come
Oh, change will come
I will never believe in anything again
I will never believe in anything again

Oh, change will come
Oh, change will come
I will never believe in anything again

We will never believe again
Kick drum beating in my chest again
We will never believe again
Preach electric to a microphone stand

We will never believe again
Kick drum beating in my chest again
We will never believe again
Preach electric to a microphone stand
