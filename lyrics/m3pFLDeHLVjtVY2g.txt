I wonder how you looked the day you were erased
To look down at your heart and watch it fade
Did you disappear or were you just misplaced
Left behind with no one else to blame

It's all gone but something lingers on
a place i used to call home
Now me, you, and the ghost
Looking for thing we lost
Laughing at the way it was,
Looking for the one we lost
(are you letting go?
Thinking clearer now that it's over
There's no one to blame

As we walk away
Why is it I just feel so heavy
What do I take away?)

When you're in a room
it's all that i can feel
Get so used to loving
what's not real
There's nothing I can hold,
No real tears to cry
You can't breath life back into lie
