Into the light
Blood in your eyes
A vicious cycle
Come to your room
Old times are gone
The way you tie it off
Your body shakes
A violent move
It's gonna find you
Don't look back
You won't like who you meet when you get there
You'll see
Don't turn back, it's all burning
Don't go back
There is nothing waiting for you
I fell asleep with a vision and it all went black
Now I can handle both of you
