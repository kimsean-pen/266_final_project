When I was a little girl the world was small to me
All the light in my life filtered softly through the trees
The shadows in the photographs
Five ghosts who followed me
I was only truly frightened once
They called my name and said they wanted me
Oh, what a beautiful day to try to die
Oh, for one sweet second without the eye

When I grew in age and fame and traveled through the world
All the rives of the city like flags of blue unfurled
Me pressed against the railing
Me taken to a room
Me breaking in the morning
Dark with a sense of coming doom
Oh, what a beautiful day to try to die
Oh, for one sweet second without the eye

Now I have grown old and all my grace and beauty gone
Five ghosts surround my garden, I don't tell them to move on
I walk deeper into shade now
That dappled light again
I see you standing at the gate
My one and only friend
Oh, what a beautiful day to try to die
Oh, for one sweet second without the eye
