Oh, baby, it's cryin' time
Oh, baby, I got to fly
Got to try to find a way
Got to try to get away
'Cause you know I gotta get away from you, babe
Oh, baby, the river's red
Oh, baby, in my head
There's a funny feelin' goin' on
I don't think I can hold out long

And when the owls cry in the night
Oh, baby, baby, when the pines begin to cry
Baby, baby, baby, how do you feel?
If the rivers runs dry, baby, how do you feel?

Craze, baby, the rainbow's end
Mmm, baby, it's just a den for those who hide
Who hide their love to depths of life
And ruin dreams that we all knew so, babe

And when the owls cry in the night
And baby, when the pines begin to cry
Oh, baby, baby, how do you feel?
If the rivers runs dry, baby, how do you feel?

(Baby, how do you feel?)

Oh yeah, the brave I endure
Oh yeah, strong shields and lore
And they can't hold the wrath of those who walk
And the boots of those who march
Baby, though the roads of time so long ago
