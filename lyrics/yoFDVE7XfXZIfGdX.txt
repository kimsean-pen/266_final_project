Follow lead point to my head
We got Dresden solid dead
I ain't gonna stand leaking from my hand
Don't like the front of me on a mand
Be still the messagly
Distending a modern tale
By phone line
Might have seen
On read by rhyme
The violence stirke and spare
Seems fortified down square
What is the quality reaching low fo side
My tears intendedly bonified
You still motor high
Reach sending a modern tease
Right phone line
High voice tone
Forty lee and four a why
