Sam M. Lewis / J. Fred Coots

For all we know
We may never meet again
Before you go make this moment sweet again
We won't say goodnight until the last minute
I'll hold out my hand and my heart will be in it
For all we know this may be only a dream
We come and go like a ripple on a stream
So love me tonight
Tomorrow was made for some
Tomorrow may never come
For all we know
