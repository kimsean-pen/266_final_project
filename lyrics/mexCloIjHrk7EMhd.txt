Don't make me wait, another day
I'm awake now, and I can see
That the heart, it knows what it wants
And takes what it needs, won't you take me please?

Hey, what a shame
Can you take me to a higher plane
I can think think of nothing
That ever seemed to keep you down

Yeah, so it seems
That I'm beggin' for your company
You're the only peace of mind
I think I've ever found

They might set me up
Just to beat me down
They might wish me luck
Before they kick me out

Let me stand
Down in your shade
Just give me the word
I'll be your runaway

Hey, what a shame
Can you take me to a higher plane
I can think think of nothing
That ever seemed to keep you down

Yeah, so it seems
That I'm beggin' for your company
You're the only peace of mind
I think I've ever found

Hey, what a shame
Can you take me to a higher plane
I can think think of nothing
That ever seemed to keep you down

Yeah, so it seems
That I'm beggin' for your company
You're the only peace of mind
I think I've ever found

Hey, what a shame
Can you take me to a higher plane
I can think think of nothing
That ever seemed to keep you down

Yeah, so it seems
That I'm beggin' for your company
You're the only peace of mind
I think I've ever found

And I can think of nothing
That ever seemed to keep you down
No I can think of nothing
That ever seemed to keep you down
