I've come so close, it's almost hard to believe
When you're up close, it blinds you brilliantly
Just one rush can change your life forever
Just one push can end it all together

Why can't we learn from the plague that surrounds us
I gotta answer you an' me
Learn from my mistakes
Learn from this mistake
Learn from our mistake
Learn from their mistakes

There's no shoulder to cry on when you have no shame
There's no finger to point when you are to blame
Open book, in my eyes shows you rain, then storming
I can't look, when covered by the nothing and the suffering

Learn from my mistakes
Learn from this mistake
Learn from our mistakes
Learn from their mistakes yea

Learn from my mistake
Learn from my mistake
Learn from my mistake
Learn from my mistake
Ooh aah aah

Believe me, all my friends, in the ending of the story
There's no junkie out there with a happy ending
It consumes you, and haunts you like the devil
It's the art of the process that kills off all the rebels, it's me

Learn from this mistakes
Learn from my mistake
Learn from this mistake
Learn from my mistake

Learn, learn
Learn mistake
Learn from my mistake
My mistake, my mistake
My mistake
