Been tryin' for all my life
But I can't add up your subtraction
Work, eat, play then go to sleep
Is gonna give me no satisfaction

Gotta find a way out, yeah
A way out of this mess
So sick of tryin' to end my time last
And ending up with less

Know your way of doing things
And it lost it's attraction
My supply is 24
And I can add a hundred fractions

Who'd knew I'd be the one
Pulling off the perfect crime
So here's my new line
I'll change your mind and the metric system of time

Caused trouble all over town
And it's bound to start a reaction
Metric time will come around
It's gonna overtake your contraction

I'll find a way out, yeah
A way out of this mess
I made my time last
And it's, total success

Got my way of doing things
And it's bound to gain your attraction
100 hours of my supply
Is gonna give us all satisfaction

No doubt I'll be the one
Pulling off the perfect crime
So here's my new line
I'll change my mind and the metric system of time
