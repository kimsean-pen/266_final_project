I think of you when
I'm feeling down
When my whole damn
Thing crashes to the ground

With a dancing blaze
Seen in your eyes
And a razor sharp tongue
Cuts through the lies

Everybody wants some
But only few believe
I won't be the first to overdose
On what I want, not what I need

Turn me up and play me loud
I won't back down
And will be proud to say
Gimme what I want now
Distortion

I was born on the
Crest of a sonic wave
And you always made
The best of my chronic rage
Distortion
Turbo, blast, jet fuel
And sucking your power
Like the atomic clock
Strike on the hour
Distortion

Everybody wants some
But only few believe
I won't be the first to overdose
On what I want, not what I need

Turn me up and play me loud
I won't back down and
Will be proud to say
Gimme what I want now

Play what you feel,
Devil in the deal
A heart of stone
And a soul of steel
Push it to the left,
Pull to the right
Add a little dark,
Add a little bright
He has put his finger
On the blessed stack
And beckons you to linger,
Before you attack

Play what you feel, devil in the deal
A heart of stone and a soul of steel
Play what you feel, devil in the deal
A heart of stone and a soul of steel

Distortion

Everybody wants some
But only few believe
I won't be the first to overdose
On what I want, not what I need

Turn me up and play me loud
I won't back down and
Will be proud to say
Gimme what I want, gimme what I want

Distortion
Everybody wants some
Distortion
Distortion
Everybody needs some
