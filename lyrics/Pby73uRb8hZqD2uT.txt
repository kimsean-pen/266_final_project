It's time to rise again couse
I'm gasping for air, life still lingers here
Time, I wasted too much time lying in the grime and ocean streams

Along the waves of death, in the midst of the dead,
I drifted here
The island in the mist calls for me
I dare not to resist

Rise, like a queen, to be seen not forgotten
and to thrive, claim your
right for your life in the Eyes of Death!

These souls that whisper in the mist
tell me tales of long gone tragedies
The statues in a row play a final role in their memories

Rise, like a queen, to be seen not forgotten
and to thrive, claim your right for
your life in the Eyes of Death!

Waves wash the shore,
there's no way back from an eerie track
And here among the dead the empty eyes are watching your back
