When the day is done and there's nowhere to run
And the people of the city have all lost and won
In your city dress, you stand and stare
And you smoke another cigarette and comb your hair
And the light that shines
Paints a trace of sadness on the street, I wait
I can't seem to get to you

Oh, you start to sway, check your Cartier
'Cause it's gettin' late, you can't afford to wait
So you move along where it's goin' on
And the people of the night are playin' 'till the dawn
And the sun that shines
Paints a trace of sadness in your eyes that cry
Wishin' and hopin'

Sweet, sweet is the night
Now you are near
Dark, dark were the days
They disappear
Sweet, sweet is the night
Now you are near

Well, you did your thing and you lost your wings
And you hurt so bad, you lost everything
And the tears that fall on the city wall
Will fade away with the rays of morning light that shines
Paints a smile across your pretty face, I know
Everything is alright, alright

Sweet, sweet is the night
Now you are near
Dark, dark were the days
They disappear
Sweet, sweet is the night
Now you are near

(Sweet is the night)

Sweet, sweet is the night
Now you are near
Dark, dark were the days
They disappear
Sweet, sweet is the night
Now you are near

(Now you are near)
