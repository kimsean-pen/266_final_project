I woke up in the morning,
Felt so far away,
Marks on my calendar,
Don't hurry up the days
I wish I could speed up time,
'till that moment you are mine,
Subtract the distance,
Fly in the speed of light,
Crazy how I miss you,
I'm hurting deep inside,
I know you can feel this pain,
But don't worry,
I'll be back again

Pretty soon I'll be coming home
Home, home, home
30 days to us, oh,
30 days to love, oh,
Each second I'm here thinking what I wanna do,
What I wanna do, when I get to you
1 month,
4 weeks,
Too many hours,
Sunrise, sun fall,
I'm growing tired,
30 days to love, oh,
30 days to love
Each day you're not here,
Feels like a thousand year,
Need a magician,
To make time disappear
Once you're near,

I won't let go,
You're what I need,
And all I know
I can't wait to say I'm coming home
Home, home, home
30 days to us, oh,
30 days to love, oh,
Each second I'm here thinking what I wanna do,
What I wanna do, when I get to you
1 month,
4 weeks,
Too many hours,
Sunrise, sun fall,
I'm growing tired,
30 days to love, oh,
30 days, days, days

How it feels on day one
I doesn't get better 'till I
Have your love here forever,
There's nothing I want more than you right now

30 days to us, oh,
30 days to love, oh,
Each second I'm here thinking what I wanna do,
What I wanna do, when I get to you
1 month,
4 weeks,
Too many hours,
Sunrise, sun fall,
I'm growing tired,
30 days to love, oh,
30 days to love
