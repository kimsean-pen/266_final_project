Looks like we made it
Look how far we've come, my baby
Might've took the long way
We knew we'd get there someday

They said, "I bet they'll never make it."
But just look at us holding on
We're still together, still going strong

You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(You're still the, still, still, you're still the one)
You're still the one that I love
The only one that I dream of
You're still the one I kiss goodnight
(You're still the one)

Ain't nothing better
We beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen
Look at what we would be missing

They said, "I bet they'll never make it."
But just look at us holding on
We're still together, still going strong

You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(You're still the, still, still, you're still the one)
You're still the one that I love
The only one that I dream of
You're still the one I kiss goodnight
(You're still the one)

...
(You're still the one)
