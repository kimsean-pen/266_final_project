TIME.
Needs another minute
(At least).

Take your TIME.
But you've got a limit.

That girl looks forward To another meetin'.
Just like everydaypeoplelknow Look forward to another simple greetin'.
TIME.
A bear in the woods looks Forward to hibernatin'.
Just any ol' player you know All he needs is a ratin'.

TIME is education,
Even when they tell you It's sophistication.

You know that TIME
Needs to be a little longer.
Oh TIME!

The universe needs to be a little stronger.

TIME they say is
The answer

But I don't believe it
TIME
