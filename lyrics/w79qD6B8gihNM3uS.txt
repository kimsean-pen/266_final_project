Aah

Saturday
Afternoon, the sunshine
Pours like wine
Through your window

And I know
Golden June can turn
An empty gray
Against your window

And I feel like
I'm on the outside
Of the circle

If I walk
(If I walk, if I walk)
By the trees
I'll catch the falling leaves
If the wind blows

But I know
(But I know, but I know)
All this means
Is whiling on the hours
Watching side shows

And I feel like
I'm on the outside
Of the circle

Will I turn my coat to the rain
I don't know
But I'm goin'
Somewhere I can
Warm my bones

Fare you well
(Fare you, fare you well)
Carry me away
And sing for those
I know upon their birthdays

I won't feel like
I'm on the outside
I won't feel like
I'm on the outside

I won't feel like
I'm on the outside
Of the circle
