We've been working all week,
And now we're not gonna sleep.
We wanna go somewhere,
And I hope you'll be there.
We're saying nothing competes,
(When we're in the streets).
I wanna go somewhere,
And I hope you'll be there.

Just for tonight no one else will be telling you,
Where to go, who to be -
You can be who you want to be.
There's a beat and a voice and it's calling you,
No one feels, feels the way -
The way you do.

Just tell all the universe,
(Everything it stands on us).
No matter where we go,
Yeah you know.

(This is when) the whole world stops,
Everyone is watching us.
Dancing with me just because -
Nobody does it better.
(Get up, get up onto your feet,
Put some rhythm into the beat).
Apart from us it's only me
And nobody does it better.

Nobody does it better,
Nobody does it.
N-n-n-n-n nobody does it better,
Nobody does it better.

Smiling faces erase every trace of you,
See the boys watching there -
As we start to groove.
The feelings clear as being here with the ones you love;
Nothing more that we can do -
(We let the bodies thirst).

Just tell all the universe,
(Everything it stands on us).
No matter where we go,
Yeah you know.

(This is when) the whole world stops,
Everyone is watching us.
Dancing with me just because -
Nobody does it better.
(Get up, get up onto your feet,
Put some rhythm into the beat).
Apart from us it's only me
And nobody does it better.

Nobody does it better,
Nobody does it.
N-n-n-n-n nobody does it better,
Nobody does it better.

Everybody's here,
Put your hands up in the air.
Where we're going no one cares,
Just as long as you'll be there.
And I'll always have the time,
(Yeah, let's leave the mess behind).
Oh, I wish we could rewind,
Bring it back one more time.

(This is when) the whole world stops,
Everyone is watching us.
Dancing with me just because -
Nobody does it better.
(Get up, get up onto your feet,
Put some rhythm into the beat).
Apart from us it's only me
And nobody does it better.

Nobody does it better,
Nobody does it.
N-n-n-n-n nobody does it better,
Nobody does it better. [x2]
