Yeah

The locusts took over my brain
I'm not living for you, I'm just living
So chill with your guilt
You hope for sun I want rain

We just tear down the walls
In the home that our jealousy built
You're not as pretty
As you maybe think that you are

It's been watching you
Your slips and slurs and play on words
All fall from your mouth
Each mutter rolling, dripping from your tongue
My plagues begun

This thin man is starting to fade
You won't be living for long
So just fly with me, die with me
Then I'll swim while I drown

They just dig up the dirt
And bury us into the ground
You're not as special
As you maybe think that you are

It's been watching you
Your slips and slurs and play on words
All fall from your mouth
Each mutter rolling, dripping from your tongue
My plagues begun

Why is it I love you so much
And all you do is hate
Hate, hate everything
You've become?

Why is it I love you so much
And all you do is hate
Hate, hate everything
You've become?

It's been watching you
Your slips in slurs and play on words
All fall from your mouth
Each mutter rolling, dripping from your tongue
It's been watching you
Your slips in slurs and play on words
All fall from your mouth
Each mutter rolling, dripping from your tongue
My break's begun
