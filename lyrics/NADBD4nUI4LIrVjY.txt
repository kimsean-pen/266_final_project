It's not like I made my self a list
Of new and different ways to murder your heart
I'm just painting that's still wet
If you touch me I'll be smeared
You'll be stained

Stained for the rest of your life
So turn around, walk away
Before you confuse the way we abuse each other
You're not afraid of getting hurt

And I'm not afraid of how much I hurt you
I'm well aware I'm a Danger to my self
Are you aware I'm a danger to others?
There's a crack in my soul

You thought it was a smile
Whatever doesn't kill you...

It's gonna leave a scar
Whatever doesn't kill you...
It's gonna leave a scar

I'm more like a silver bullet
And I'm like a gun, not easy to hold
I'm moving fast and if I stay inside your heart
I'm certain that this will be

The end of your life
So turn around, walk away
Before you confuse the way we abuse each other
You're not afraid of getting hurt

And I'm not afraid of how much I hurt you
I'm well aware I'm a Danger to my self
Are you aware I'm a danger to others?
There's a crack in my soul

You thought it was a smile
Whatever doesn't kill you...

It's gonna leave a scar
Whatever doesn't kill you...
It's gonna leave a scar
Leave a scar
Leave a scar
Whatever doesn't kill you, it's gonna leave a scar

She warned you that she may fuck me
But the chances are I'm gonna fuck you over
Whatever doesn't kill you, it's gonna leave a scar
Whatever doesn't kill you, it's gonna leave a scar
Leave a scar
Leave a scar
Whatever doesn't kill you, it's gonna leave a scar
