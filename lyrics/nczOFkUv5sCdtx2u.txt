How many times must they fall
Making convictions they can't back up at all
Spoiling a culture and excuse it with lies
The deeper they go there's nothing inside

You don't have to impress us at all
It's exhausting to focus on petty flaws
The only advice that I think would help
Don't compare yourself to what you've never felt

Spoiling a culture and excuse it with lies
Mistakes you can't shoulder with a past denied
Spoiling a culture and excuse it with lies

Bastardized
Sinking their teeth just to get a taste
Bastardized
The same ugly face living through a jading phase
Bastardized
Corrupting every element
Bastardized
Pissing for their pride
They'll do whatever it takes

Why would you come and waste your time
Know your worth and draw a line
Make up morals but treat it like shit
Leave it to people who have real hardships
Sellouts and fakes will do what it takes
To benefit their image for entitlement
The only truth that will surely help
Is that your worthless opinions will never sell

Spoiling a culture and excuse it with lies
Mistakes you cant shoulder with a past denied
Spoiling a culture and excuse it with lies
With a past denied

Past denied
Bring em down

Bastardized
Sinking their teeth just to get a taste
Bastardized
The same ugly face living through a jading phase
Bastardized
Corrupting every element
Bastardized
Pissing for their pride
They'll do whatever it takes

Bastardized
Bastardized
Yeah, bastardized
Yeah, bring em down motherfucker
