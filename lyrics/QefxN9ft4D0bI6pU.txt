I just wanna be
With you
Every day
Every day you see
Is something new

Come along with me
And do
Anything cause
Nothing's what it seems
To be with you

Baby don't you hide
From me
Your pretty heart
No, I will always find
The love inside

Baby, don't you go
Anywhere
No, not alone
Inside of a dream
We'll make a home

Angel
I would steal a rainbow
Soak up all your sorrows
Anything you borrow
You own

Angel
You're my pot of gold
Dewdrop in the meadow
Prism in a halo
You glow

You are so pristine
My girl
You little pear, you
Watch me like TV
I see you too

Color in the sky
And take
A comet ride
With me day and night
In green and blue

Angel
I would steal a rainbow
Soak up all your sorrows
Anything you borrow
You own

Angel
You're my pot of gold
Dewdrop in the meadow
Prism in a halo
You glow

When I'm on my knees
So down
My broken crown
No more dirty deeds
Turn me around

Angel
I would steal a rainbow
Soak up all your sorrows
Anything you borrow
You own

Angel
You're my pot of gold
Dewdrop in the meadow
Prism in a halo
You glow

Angel
I would steal a rainbow
Angel
Soak up all your sorrows
Angel
I would steal a rainbow
Angel
Soak up all your sorrows
