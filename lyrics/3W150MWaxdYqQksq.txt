Yeah!

Born into this world of hatred
We are born free from the restraints of this society
Helpless to what is instilled
Yeah, to all those who raise us, mold us and shape us
There is a time to separate from this

A reason why, a state of mind, there's a disconnection
A judgement made
Fueled by hate, it's your mistake, it's a choice you made
It's tearing us apart!

Hate! Hate by design
Is destroying our lives
Seek to find some understanding
Redefine your life!

Consequence affected in a life that is rejected
Anger misplaced,
A burden on our hearts, that's keeping us apart
No love, no understanding!

What we design is hate inside, a misconception
A judgement made (A judgement made!)
It's our mistake, we create when we lose compassion
It's tearing us apart!

Hate! Hate by design (Hate by design!)
Is destroying our lives
Seek to find (we seek to find!) some understanding
Redefine your life!

Redefine your understanding!
Redefine your own life!

Is destroying our lives (our lives)
Seek to find some understanding
Redefine your life!
