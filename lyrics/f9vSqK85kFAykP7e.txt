I fell in love and I needed a road map
To find out where you lived so excited, now

Sleepwalking
'Cause I'm sleepwalking

The white trash boys listen to the headphones
Blasting white noise in the convenience store parking lot
I hung around there wasting my time hoping you'll stop by

'Cause I'm sleepwalking
I'm sleepwalking

A mutual friend's parents left town for a week
So we raided their liquor stash, walked down to the riverside

Sleepwalking
'Cause I'm sleepwalking
