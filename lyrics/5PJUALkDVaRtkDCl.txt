Walking and walking
Thinking on my feet
Anything can happen in the city but you
Can't sit down

Building to building
Shelt'ring from the sky
Knowing there's somebody in this street
Who could change my life

You can try on anything for free
Pick up anything you need
And I'm wishing you were here with me
Walking on a city street

Window to window
Filling in the hours
Catching my reflection in a place I've
Never been before

Crossing the bridges
Leap the river-wide
Knowing that in time I'll arrive on the
Other side

You can try on anything for free
Pick up anything you need
And I'm wishing you were here with me
Walking on a city street
