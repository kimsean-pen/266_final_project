Don't wanna be here
I feel alone with everyone
this is the first year
but still I play the second son
falling in a line
I waited
in a line
I waited
the season's in a crawl
I'm waiting for the final leaf to fall
go get your bags packed
I'll probably see you on the run
I'm right behind you
fast as a bullet leaves a gun
am I here again
with an empty hand?
