Air Waves beam from the light
On the tower
Get my kicks
From your 11th hour
Won't you give me some more

Riot on the radio

Burn it up
Set my mind on fire
Talk Talk speaker
On the end of the wire
You know I can't turn it off
Riot on the radio
You know it's turning me on
Riot on the radio

Air Waves beam from the light
On the tower
Get my kicks
From your 11th hour
Won't you give me some more

Riot on the radio

You know it's turning me on
A riot-a riot
Won't you give me some more
A riot-a riot
