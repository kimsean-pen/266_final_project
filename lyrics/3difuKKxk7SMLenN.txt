Woke up this morning
after another one of those crazy dreams
oh nothing is going right this morning
the whole world is wrong it seems
oh I guess it磗 the chain that bind me
I can磘 shake it loose these chains and things

Got to work this morning
seems like everything is lost
I got a cold hearted wrong doing woman
and a slave driving ball
I can磘 loose these chains that bind me
can磘 shake them loose these chains and things
just can磘 loose these chains and things

Well you talk about hard luck and trouble
seems to be my middle name
all the odds are against me
yes I can only play a losing game
these chains that bind me
can磘 lose these chains and things
just can磘 loose these chains and things
Oh I would pack up and leave today people
but I ain磘 got nowhere to go
ain磘 got money to buy a ticket
and I don磘 feel like walking anymore
these chains that bind me
I can磘 lose
I can磘 lose these chains and things
