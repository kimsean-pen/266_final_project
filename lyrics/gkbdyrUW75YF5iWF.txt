You Could Be Happy
And I won't know
But you weren't happy the day I
Watched you go

And all the things that I wished I
Had not said
Are played on loops 'til it's madness
In my head

Is it too late to remind you
How we were
But not our last days of silence
Screaming, blur

Most of what I remember
Makes me sure
I should have stopped you from walking
Out the door

You Could Be Happy
I hope you are
You made me happier than I'd
Been by far

Somehow everything I own
Smells of you
And for the tiniest moment
It's all not true

Do the things that you always
Wanted to
Without me there to hold you back
Don't think, just do

More than anything I want to
See you, grow
Take a glorious bite out
Of the whole world
