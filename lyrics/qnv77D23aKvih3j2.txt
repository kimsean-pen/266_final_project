Steel that sleeps with the morningstar
Would that I could sin once more
[(Steel that sleeps the eye)]

Blades will sing over stone and field
That their song might grace our fall
[(Steel that sleeps the eye)]

Pallid limbs in the raven's thrall
Fracture sulphur honey skin

Waves are screaming abraxan hymns
So that shoreline virgins cry

Reel in place
Till the bastards take me away
Sober taste of the eyes

[(Steel that sleeps the eye)(Steel that sleeps the eye)(Steel that sleeps the eye)(Steel that sleeps the eye)]
