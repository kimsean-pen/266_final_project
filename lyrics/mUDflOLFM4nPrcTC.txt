Can I be of any help to you, baby?
She says."Help me, help her, help him too."
Well I made up my mind... I won't be calling
I think about you and...
I think about the heartbroken ones...

It's a real long way to go... to say goodbye
I thought we already did that
Have fun... tell the world
Well it's a real long way to go... to say goodbye
I thought we already did that
Have fun... tell the world

High in my life... obsessive was my love
Worth it was my time... Oh no, you are fading out
Well I can do it...
Well I can make it one more time

It's a real long way to go... to say goodbye
I thought we already did that
Have fun... tell the world
Well it's a real long way to go... to say goodbye
I thought we already did that
Have fun... tell the world

Can I be of any help to you?
She says,"Help him, help her, help him too, baby"
Well I can do it...
Well I can make it one more time

Well it's a real long way to go... to say goodbye
I thought we already did that
Have fun... tell the world
Well it's a real long way to go... to say goodbye
I thought we already said that
So have fun... tell the world

You were high in my life... obsessive was my love
So have fun... tell the world
