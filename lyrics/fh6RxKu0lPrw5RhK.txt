Did I hurt you?
Did I ever make you bleed inside?
Did I kill you?
I didn't mean to make you hide yourself
Find you in you, beautiful
Do not grow the seeds of pain in you
Goodbye

Let the butterflies cry
Let them cry for you
You just dry your eyes
Because the world is wonderful
Let the butterflies cry
Let them cry for you
You just dry your eyes
Because the world is wonderful
Oh, cause the world is wonderful

I have been there
I used to believe there was no light
But I found out
Oh, life is far too short to fight
Lose yourself
Let go of your pain
Taste the air you breath
And kiss the sky
Goodbye

Let the butterflies cry
Let them cry for you
You just dry your eyes
Because the world is wonderful
Let the butterflies cry
Let them cry for you
You just dry your eyes
Because the world is wonderful
Oh, cause the world is wonderful
(repeat)

And yeah, because the world is wonderful
