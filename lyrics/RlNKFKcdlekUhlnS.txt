I did what I do best
Forgot myself
Got overdressed like everybody else
A glance and a half smile
Black heels on the white tile
It took seven years for your path to realign
But I'll still think of you
On the fifth of June
Cause when I saw you I lost you all over again

(Gone)
Doesn't it feel good to be invisible
(Gone)
Just like the way I used to be
(Gone)
Have I been fading away?
Yeah I'm so gone

And I can feel your stare like dynamite
Breaking silence with Irish goodbyes
But I'm not who you remember
Just who do you remember?
Since you stole it all away
You stole it all away

You need a change of pace without my ghost
But you're better off when I go
A painful anecdote sure to stunt your growth
You're better off when I'm gone

(Gone)
Doesn't it feel good to be invisible
(Gone)
Just like the way I used to be
(Gone)
Have I been fading away?
Yeah I'm so gone

Shapeshifter
There's no way back
Shapeshifter
There's no way back

Doesn't it feel good to be invisible
Just like the way I used to be
(Gone)
Have I been fading away?
Yeah I'm so gone

You're a shapeshifter you're never gonna get the girl
There's no way back
You're a shapeshifter you're never gonna change the world
There's no way back
