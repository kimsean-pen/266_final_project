Bound to the 9 to 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9
Feels like a mandatory struggle to just stay alive
Bound to the business plan for a roof over our heads
A fairly decent paycheck and a life without protests

And so we walk the line until it's gone
In accordance to the norm
A thousand reasons to conform
The tragic life of a corporate sloth
And so we walk the line until it's gone
In accordance to the norm
A thousand reasons to conform
The tragic life of a corporate sloth

Lighting up my Winstons now is like a test
I let the embers burn my fingertips, I'm such a mess
Because sometimes the pain feels so much better than the stress
That's why I need you for the wake up calls to keep me in check

'Cause in a blink of an eye, I'm starting to die
And in a blink of an eye, I'm barely alive
'Cause in a blink of an eye, the markets tracked a gain
And in a blink of an eye, I'm nearly insane

Listen close, this is far from what's a dream
Hold still, would you like to take a peek into another sorry life?
A product of the corporate hive mind
Listen close, this is far from what's a dream
Hold still, would you like to take a peek into another sorry life?

What did I leave behind, thanks to this 9 to 5?
What did I leave behind, thanks to this 9 to 5?

Well, we've been working all our lives away
The finish line seems far ahead
To earn that pay or come what may
Go through the motions day by day
Working all our lives away
The finish line seems far ahead
To earn that pay or come what may
Go through the motions day by day

What did I leave behind, thanks to this 9 to 5?
What did I leave behind, thanks to this 9 to 5?

Life is like a roller coaster
The ups and downs, I can't decide
My life is like a roller coaster ride
