When you drink a lot of
Wine you think everything's right...
But soon you'll realize.

Something's burning inside-
-outside your ass and believe
Us you won't feeling fine.

Faster!
Faster!
Faster!
Faster!

I can bet that now you're
Suffering 'cause your honour
And your hole are very stretched.

Sorry but red wine has no mercy:
Now you cannot take another step.

Faster!
Faster!
Faster!
Faster!

This chorus got no sense and it's so '80s.
We could change these lyrics once or twice!
But I know...
Anyway this chours' really really nice!

Well my friend you'd better
Drink some water
To refresh your body and soul.
Now you've realized that...
Now you've realized that...
Now you've realized that...
... your ass is on fire baby!

This chorus got no sense and it's so '80s.
We could change these lyrics once or twice!

Anyway this chours' really really nice!

Faster!
Faster!
Faster!
Faster!

Drink wine = Ass Flames!
Drink wine = Ass Flames!
