Waking in the rubble
Walking over glass
Neighbours say we're trouble
Well their time has passed
Peering from the mirror
No, that isn't me
A stranger getting nearer
Who can this person be?

You wouldn't know me at all
Today
From the fading light I'll fly

Rise like a phoenix
Out of the ashes
Seeking rather than vengeance
Retribution
You were warned
Once I'm transformed
Once I'm reborn
You know I will rise like a phoenix
But you're my flame

Go about your business
Act as if you're free
No one could have witnessed
What you did to me

Cause you wouldn't know me today
And you have got to see
To believe
From the fading light I fly

Rise like a phoenix
Out of the ashes
Seeking rather than vengeance
Retribution
You were warned
Once I'm transformed
Once I'm reborn

I rise up to the sky
You threw me down but
I'm gonna fly

And rise like a phoenix
Out of the ashes
Seeking rather than vengeance
Retribution
You were warned
Once I'm transformed
Once I'm reborn
You know I will rise like a phoenix
But you're my flame
