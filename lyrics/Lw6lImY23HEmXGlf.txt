What brought us here?
Living life inside the lines
Vision impaired
We can be so short sighted
I would rather watch us fall
Than be so passive
I would rather watch us fail
Than be stuck at the start

What happened to our heart?
Are you happy now?
Watching your feet
Sink into the ground
The silence
Was it worth it?
To show them
You are nothing

Would you tell me about your heart?
Won't you tell me just what that means?
I've been living in shadows
And hearing these echoes
As they follow me

Walk the line
Or society will swallow us whole
Fall behind
And let the hate
Consume you

The strong
They stand up for their sons and daughters
The weak
They flee from the sights of martyrs

We are the fire that won't burn out, oh

Breaking through the veil
Placed over weaker minds
We live in a time where vultures feast and logic dies

Would you tell me about your heart?
Won't you tell me just what that means?
I've been living in the shadows
And hearing these echoes
As they follow me

Would you tell me about your heart?
Won't you tell me just what that means?
I've been living in shadows
And hearing these echoes
As they follow me

Would you tell me about your heart?
Won't you tell me just what that means?
I've been living in shadows
And hearing these echoes
As they follow me

I've been living in shadows
And hearing these echoes
As they follow me
