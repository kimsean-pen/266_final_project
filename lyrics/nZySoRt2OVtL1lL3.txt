As I walk through the valley of the shadow of LA
The footsteps that were next to me have gone their separate ways
I've seen enough now
To know that beautiful things don't always stay that way
I've done enough now
To know this beautiful place isn't everything they say

I heard that evil comes disguised
Like the city of angels
I'm walking towards the light

Baptized in the river
I've seen a vision of my life and I wanna be delivered
In the city was a sinner
I've done a lot of things wrong but I swear I'm a believer
Like the prodigal son I was out on my own
Now I'm trying to find my way back home
Baptized in the river
I'm delivered
I'm delivered

You're from a small town, you're gonna grow up fast
Underneath these lights
Down in Hollywood on the boulevard
The dead come back to life
To the praying mother, and the worried father
Let your children go
If they'll come back they'll come home stronger
And if they don't you'll know

They say evil comes disguised
Like the city of angels
I'm walking towards the light

Baptized in the river
I've seen a vision of my life and I wanna be delivered
In the city was a sinner
I've done a lot of things wrong but I swear I'm a believer
Like the prodigal son I was out on my own
Now I'm trying to find my way back home
Baptized in the river
I'm delivered
I'm delivered
Baptized in the river (on my own)
Baptized in the river (on my own)
I wanna be delivered
On my own
On my own

Baptized in the river (on my own)
I wanna be delivered
Baptized in the river (on my own)
I wanna be delivered
Baptized in the river (on my own)
I wanna be delivered
I confess I'm a sinner
I've seen a vision of my life and I wanna be delivered
