Storm clouds gather on a moonlit night
Wind blows through his hair
Just like it does to shake the leaves
And bring them down
Pushing the unavoidable decline
Both his feet placed on the ground
But his legs, fragile and weak
Roots, once they grounded
A base that's going numb

A lethal parasite
Through all these years
It hid inside
A life threat
Unnoticed symptoms
The truth will be unearthed
It beset an aberrant host

The moon above
Blinding his weary eyes
He feels his scars, his resin blood, his splintered bark
All of them hurt
Like they were inflicted just now

His tired arms and the aching limbs
All his strength withers away
Ungracious cycle of nature
All things come to an end

A lethal parasite
Through all these years
It hid inside
A life threat
Unnoticed symptoms
At least it will die too
It beset an aberrant host

A lethal parasite
Through all these years
It hid inside
A life threat
This is the swan song
For vermin and host
This lethal parasite
A death warrant
Already signed
Both die
A strong dependence
Mortal, ill-disposed
The aberrant host
