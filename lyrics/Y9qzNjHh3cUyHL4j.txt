I am the beast, I am the earth
I am the blood that fills the sky
I am the feast of famine, thirst
And every will to justify

(Come on, come on)
(C-c-come on)
(Come on, come on)

It's every day and every night
My own war to take it head on
With every wrong and every right
Back for more, it's Armageddon

Armageddon, come, come and get it
Armageddon baby
Armageddon, come, come and get it
Armageddon

I am the flesh, I am the flame
A temple to carnality
We are enmeshed, sacred, profane
Reflected through brutality

(Come on, come on)
(C-c-come on)
(Come on, come on)

It's every day and every night
My own war to take it head on
With every wrong and every right
Back for more, it's Armageddon

Armageddon, come, come and get it
Armageddon baby
Armageddon, come, come and get it
Armageddon

(Come on)
(Come on)
(Come on)

It's every day and every night
My own war to take it head on
With every wrong and every right
Back for more, it's Armageddon

It's every day and every night
My own war to take it head on
With every wrong and every right
Back for more, it's Armageddon

Armageddon, come, come and get it
Armageddon baby
Armageddon, come, come and get it
Armageddon
