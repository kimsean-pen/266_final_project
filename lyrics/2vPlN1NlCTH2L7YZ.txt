Take a breath
Rest your head
Close your eyes
You're alright
Just lay down
Turn my side
Do you feel my heat on your skin?

Take off your clothes
Blow out the fire
Don't be so shy
You're right
You're right

Take off my clothes
Oh, bless me, father
Don't ask me why
You're right
You're right

Home I stay
I'm in, come in
Can you feel my hips in your hands?
And I'm laying down by your side
I taste the sweet of your skin

Take off your clothes
Blow out the fire
Don't be so shy
You're right
You're right

Take off my clothes
Oh, bless me, father
Don't ask me why
You're right
You're right

In my heart dress
Raise so much faster
I drowned myself in your holy water
And both my eyes just got so much brighter
And I saw God
Oh, yeah so much closer

In the dark I see your smile
Do you feel my heat on my skin?

Take off your clothes
Blow out the fire
Don't be so shy
You're right
You're right

Take off my clothes
Oh, bless me, father
Don't ask me why
You're right
You're right

Take off my clothes
Blow out the fire
Don't be so shy
You're right
You're right

Take off my clothes
And bless me further
Don't ask me why
Don't ask me why
Don't ask me why
