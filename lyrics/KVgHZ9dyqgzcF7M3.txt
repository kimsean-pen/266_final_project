Outrageous, when I move my body
Outrageous, when I'm at a party
Outrageous, in my sexy jeans
Outrageous, when I'm on the scene
Outrageous, my sex drive
Outrageous, my shopping spree
Outrageous, we're on a world tour
Outrageous, that's B-girl

I'm sexy as I wanna be
Got these fellas chasin' me
It's about time I hit the streets
All my girls still feelin' me
B girl ain't lost the beat
Jumped over drama and I landed on my feet
Gotta keep goin' no stoppin' me
And if you don't like it then

Media over here
Come through like a world premiere
Trench coat and my underwear
Let's go with this freak show it's

Outrageous, when I move my body
Outrageous, when I'm at a party

Outrageous, when I'm on the scene
Outrageous, my sex drive
Outrageous, my shopping spree
Outrageous, we're on a world tour
Outrageous, that's B-girl

I'm about to bring the heat
Lockin' down the industry
I'm dress up and glamorous
Red carpet and cameras
Take trips around the globe
Tints on my Jeep so nobody knows
It's so hot that you're comin' out your clothes
Now I'm about to give it to ya
La la la

In a place where love is free
Can you take me there?
Somebody, ooh
And when you mention my name
Make sure you know the truth, yea
Until I vow to keep it forever
