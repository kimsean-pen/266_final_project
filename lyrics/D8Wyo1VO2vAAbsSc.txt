Your words alone
could drive me to
A thousand tears

All the same words
that kept me here
For all the years

I'm lost again
it's happening
When you're around I just go away
All I wanna know
is it mutual?
Then I never want to leave
Then I'm ready to run
ready to fall
Think I'm ready to loose it all
Then I'm ready to run
ready to fall
Think I'm ready to loose it all

Keep me running
you keep me running
Keep me running
you keep me running
Keep me running
you keep me running
Keep me running
you keep me running
you keep me

Whoa
would you hold my hand like the air it's so gently here?
Never give up, never give up
Whoa
would you pull me closer and nobody knows we're there
No one can find us

I'm lost again, it's happening
When you're around I just go away
All I wanna know
is it mutual?
Then I never want to leave
Then I'm ready to run
ready to fall
Think I'm ready to loose it all
Then I'm ready to run
ready to fall
Think I'm ready to loose it all

Keep me running
you keep me running
(for your love)
Keep me running
you keep me running
(for your love)
Keep me running
you keep me running
(for your love)
Keep me running
you keep me running
You keep me
keep me running
keep me running

And I'm lost again
it's happening
Whao when I'm around you, when I'm around you I just go away
All I wanna know
is it mutual?
Am I ready to run?
Am I ready to fall?
Think I'm ready just to loose it all

Keep me running
you keep me running
Keep me running
you keep me running
Keep me running
you keep me running
Keep me running
you keep me running
you keep me running

Never give up
Never give up

Keep me running
you keep me running
('cause you never give up)
Keep me running
you keep me running
Keep me running
you keep me running
('cause you never give up)
Keep me running
you keep me running
you keep me
