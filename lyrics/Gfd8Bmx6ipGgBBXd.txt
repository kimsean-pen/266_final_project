It's cold and dark I think I'm going insane
The end is coming it's true
I'm all alone and I am screaming your name
It seems that's all I can do

But it's too late to turn back now
It's too loud to hear a sound
I'm so lost I can't be found
It's too late to turn back now

It's hard to focus when your life is a blur
It's hard to see the truth
How can I move on when there's so much to learn
And every road comes back to you

But it's too late to turn back now
It's too loud to hear a sound
I'm so lost I can't be found
It's too late to turn back now

But it's too late to turn back now
It's too loud to hear a sound
I'm so lost I can't be found
It's too late to turn back now

I'm so lost I can't be found
It's too late to turn back now
