Under the door there's a pulse vibration
In motion
I worry not for the thief, I know you gave up
On us

Your back slides, so peaceful for you
With so much further to bend
Defect in my face
I never thought there would be so many diseased
Asleep

Your instincts so ever sequent
How many other would move

Defend our beautiful form
Your indecent pushing me to stay
You couldn't save your breath
In time

Under the gun and the waves start pulling you in
In my head
I worry not for the thief, I know who you are
To us

Your bullshit, so easy for you
And everybody can tell
And I can see perfectly clear
Just how the story will end

Defend our beautiful form
Your indecent pushing me to stay
You couldn't save your breath
In time, a glorious rose
You elevate forcing me to change
You couldn't save yourself
Surrender

Your bullshit, so easy for you
And everybody can tell
And I can't see perfectly clear
Just how the story will end
