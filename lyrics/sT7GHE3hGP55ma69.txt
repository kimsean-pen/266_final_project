There comes a time in everyone's life
when all of the parties every night
they're not enough
You want something more
I want you
I want you

I find you when I want you
and lose you late at night
The woman in me shouts out
the man in me just smiles
I may not always love you
you may not care
but if we should live together
there's something we could share
if we dare
Why don't we?

Baby, why don't we live together?
You won't believe in love until the day you try
Baby, why don't we live together?
With all the love we had and all the love we hide

We'll find a home together
and sleep there every night
There's a time and place for most things
This time we'll get it right
You may not always love me
I may not care
but intuition tells me, baby
there's something we could share
if we dare
Why don't we?

Baby, why don't we live together?
You won't believe in love until the day you try
Baby, why don't we live together?
With all the love we had and all the love we hide

Why don't we live together? Together?
Why don't we live together? Together?
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah

You may not always love me
I may not care
but intuition tells me, baby
there's something we could share
if we dare
Why don't we?

Baby, why don't we live together?
You won't believe in love until the day you try
Baby, why don't we live together?
With all the love we had and all the love we hide

Why don't we live together?
Together? Together?
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah
Baby
You won't believe until the day you try
Baby, why don't we live together?
Why don't we live together?
Baby, why don't we live together?
You won't believe in love until the day you try
Baby
Without the love, love you feel inside
