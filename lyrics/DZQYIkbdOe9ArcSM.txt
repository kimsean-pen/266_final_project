I am a beast, I won't give you the tricks
I may look big but I crawl through the bricks
I walk the wheel but I'm walking to nowhere
While I'm afraid of your clock because it ticks

Sneak away, I will

I am a rat, I'm a pest or a pet
I can eat dirt, but I favor the bread
You keep me warm while I'm planning to break out
Yes I will eat all the love I can get

Sneak away, I will

I will eat all the love I can get
I know the streets, but I'm loving the bed
I walk the wheel till I get where I was babe
You keep me here but I belong with the dead

Sneak away, I will

I'm a rat, I'm a pest or a pet
I will eat all the love I can get
