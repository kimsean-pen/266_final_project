Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
If only he knew
If only he knew
If only he knewâ€”

About the world without the bullshit and the lies
We could've saved him, they could've saved me
But instead, I'm here drowning in my own fucking mind
And I'll be damned if you're the death of me
Blood and ink stain the walls
Silently with bloodied knuckles, I carry on
Hoping it's not too wrong
You said the nights were far too long
(Honey, it's just the start of it)

Oh, my God!
If only he knew
Oh, my God!
If only he knew
If only he knew
If only he knew

Just stand up and scream
The tainted clock is counting down
(Faster and fast!)
You gave in to me
Would you say the nights are far too long now?
(Faster, faster and fast!)

Oh, my God!
Oh, my fucking God!
The tears that stain my cheek must make me look weak!
I wear them proudly!
I wear them proud!

Just stand up and scream
The tainted clock is counting down
(Faster and fast!)
You gave in to me
Would you say the nights are far too long now?
(Faster, faster and fast!)

Your knife, my back!
My gun, your head!
Your knife, my back!
My gun, your head!

You need a doctor, baby
You scared?
You need a doctor, baby
You scared?
You need a doctor, baby
You scared?
You need a doctor, baby
You, scared!?
You scared!?
You scared!?
Yeah!
You need a doctor, baby
You scared!?
You need a doctor, baby
You scared!?
You need a doctor, baby!
You need a doctor, baby!
You scared!?
