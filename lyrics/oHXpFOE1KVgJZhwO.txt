Warm inside...
Mmm! Yeah!

I'd like to direct your attention
To something that needs
Directing to
A lot of people talk about
Dining in and eating out...
I guess that's what this song's about

I know this is not a dining room conversation
And you don't have to listen if you... don't have the time
But let me remind you in case you don't already know
Dining out can happen...
Down below!

Everybody's talking 'bout
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want
To learn a...
Different
Kind of kiss
So won't you...

Go down!
Where it's warm inside
Go down!
Where I cannot hide
Go down!
Where all life begins
Go down!
That's where my love is

Now, what could be better than a home cooked meal?
How you want to eat it depends on how you feel
You can eat all you want, and you don't get fat!
Now, where else can you go for a meal like that?

It's not fair to be selfish or stingy
Every girl should experience...
Eating out!
Sometimes when I come home from a hard day at work...
I swear it's all I can think about!

Everybody's talking 'bout
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want
To learn a...
Different
Way to kiss
So won't you...

Go down!
Where it's warm inside
Go down!
Where I cannot hide
Go down!
Where all life begins
Go down!
That's where my love is

Colonel Sanders says it best
"Finger good, licking good"
Let's put what you've learned to the test:
Can you make a fire without using wood?
Are you still hungry?
Aren't you glad we came?
I'm glad you brought your raincoat
I think it's beginning to rain!

Everybody's talking 'bout
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want
To learn a...
Different
Way to kiss
So won't you...

Go down!
Where it's warm inside
Go down!
Where I cannot hide
Go down!
Where all life begins
Go down!
That's where my love is...
Where it's warm inside!

Go down!
Where I cannot hide
Go down!
Where all life begins
Go down!
That's where my love... is
That's where my love... is!

Come inside!
That's where all life begins, it's...
Warm inside!
