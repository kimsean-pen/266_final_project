Nothing left to say
And all I've left to do
Is run away from you
She led me on, down
Secrets I can't keep

Close your eyes and sleep
Don't wait up for me
Hush now don't you speak
To me

Wrapped my hurt in you
And took my shelter in that pain
The opiate of blame
Your broken heart, heart, your heart

So now I'm all by myself
As I've always felt
I'll betray my tears
To anyone caught in our ruse of fools

One last kiss for me, yeah
One last kiss good night

Didn't want to lose you once again
Didn't want to be your friend
Fulfilled a promise made of tin
Crawled back to you

I'm all by myself
As I've always felt
I'll betray myself
To anyone lost, anyone but you

So let the sadness come again
On that you can depend on me, yeah
Until the bitter, bitter end of the world, yeah
When God sleeps in bliss

And I'm all by myself
As I've always felt
I'll betray myself
To anyone
