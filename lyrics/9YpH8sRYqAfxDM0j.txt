My life, you know, it's boring
I've just been busy, sort of
And bummed out, sort of
It's been a long day and I'm not in a good mood
I was going to work and I'm gonna be stuck inside

But other than that everything else is
Still boring and the same
But I like music
If it sounds good I'll listen to it
Music plays a big part in keeping me happy or
Keeping me just
From not flipping out...
