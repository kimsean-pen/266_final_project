from here we can see into the hollow sky
the thought of falling down keeps me alive
and your hot lips print words into my skin
all revolt is imaginary
our castle reaches far into the clouds
so close to space and so superior
on top of that tower you can't withstand
and love me until the worst storm ever ends
oh once imagination was revolt
honey are we 150 years old?
