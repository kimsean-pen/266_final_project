Put me in the ocean
I want to scratch my fingernails there, there
Can't hear the words you say down here
About all the ways us girls can die

Find me
Any, any old way you want me
Find me find me
Any old way you want me

If I were dead you would love me more
Then all my words would become like gold
The angels you've created they would swarm towards my grave
And lie about the way we really live

I tend to your wounds as I bleed
You just keep talk talking at me
I tend to your wounds as I bleed
You cover your ears, don't wanna hear me scream

Never wanna hear me scream
Don't wanna hear me scream
