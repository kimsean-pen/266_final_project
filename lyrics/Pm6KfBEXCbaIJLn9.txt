Last time I saw you I played it cool
No someone's been nice to you
Is it all you have to do?

I know it isn't easy
But surely it's hard enough
And I keep messing
Talking about your love

Talking a little bit action
I don't care

All the kids' songs and poems are about you
And all the ____
I just get confused

A boy could live in the city where you don't live
The things that I will keep
