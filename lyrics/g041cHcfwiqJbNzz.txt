It started on that night
I never left your side,
Oh have you known
Always ends up in a fight

So careless, that's you
That's you
And it's always you
You're telling me what not to do
So careless

Oh why her?
You want only eyes to find her
Oh why her?
You want only eyes to find her

Won't you let me vanish now?
Won't you let me vanish now?

Now keep you on my side
I never won a fight
Oh have you known?
With you eyes are all uptight

So careless, that's you
That's you
And it's always you
You're telling me what not to do
So careless

Oh why her?
You want only eyes to find her
Oh why her?
You want only eyes to find her

Won't you let me vanish now?
Won't you let me vanish now?
