(Who does she think she is)
(I dunno)
(Do you reckon they're real?)
(Nah)
(Hi, girls)
(Hi, Louise, you look great)

Ow, ow, twisted and deceitful
All those two-faced people
Taking me for some kind of fool
Ow, ow, pretending to be so nice
Let me give you my advice
I don't need you, ooh
Friends in disguise
Dressed up in lies
It's an act that you're playing
Ow, ow, first you recognise me
Then you criticise me, what's goin on

Stop your bitchin'
'Coz you're so sad
Bitchin' behind my back
Honey, I don't need that
So kick it to the curb
Because I heard you're two-faced
Tryin' to get in my place
Work too hard to make mistakes
So stop your bitchin' on me

Ow, ow, they're so narrow-minded
Truth is so one-sided
They're just counterfeits
Ow, ow, hot and cold you're blowing
Keep them walls closed
And who are you trying to kid, eh
Two-faced people are so shallow
Put yourself in my place
Ow, ow, the fairy tales you're spinning
Sounding so convincing
But I'm at a loss

Stop your bitchin'
'Coz you're so sad
Bitchin' behind my back
Honey, I don't need that
So kick it to the curb
Because I heard you're two-faced

Tryin' to get in my place
Work too hard to make mistakes
So stop your bitchin' on me

Poison words are spoken
My faith in you is broken
But I'll make it on my own

Ow, ow, twisted and deceitful
All those two-faced people
Taking me for some kind of fool
Ow, ow, they're so narrow-minded
Truth is so one-sided
But honey you're wrong

Stop your bitchin'
'Coz you're so sad
Bitchin' behind my back
Honey, I don't need that
So kick it to the curb
Because I heard you're two-faced
Tryin' to get in my place
Work too hard to make mistakes
So stop your bitchin' on me

Stop your bitchin'
'Coz you're so sad
Bitchin' behind my back
Honey, I don't need that
So kick it to the curb
Because I heard you're two-faced
Tryin' to get in my place
Work too hard to make mistakes
So stop your bitchin' on me

Stop this hipocracy
You're criticising me
'Coz I don't wanna be
With two-faced people, yeah
(Ya know, she's probably talking behind our backs right now)
(She probably is, she's like that)
(She's two-faced)
(You never know what she's gonna say, hahaha)
(I cant' believe you said that about me)
(Believe it, honey)
