Look out, everyone,
I've been pushed hard for surround.
Take back they loved,
It's a lockdown.

Touch out if we want,
Home is the city, it's gone, I be lose it
And we took back what I want,
Another lockdown.

Freeze out if we want
Love is the city, a war and imma lose it
Can I get back what I want
In a lost town?

I know I was born just be near these streets and entry speecing
Someone's situation there's nobody's hope
An education that I still don't know.

Coast line and beyond it's the look out to what's gone
Right now there's no better in this town.

Coast out tonight, help me put out of life
In this town's define me in this town.

I know I was born just be near these streets and entry speecing
Someone's situation there's nobody's hope
An education that I still don't know.

Look out, everyone,
Freezed out and we was
Give back, come on, lockdown.

Touch out, everyone,
Be fast, cause we're gone
Come back, it's on, I never lock down,
Lock down, lock down.
