Hands raised full of sin
This is where the story began
As my halo
I'm scarred by where I've been

This ain't over, till it's over
This ain't over, till it's over, yeah

The hell I've been through
I saw my face in the bottom of a bottle
The hell I've gone through
To be reborn, reborn, again

The hell I've been through
Shot down, ran through, dragged through
The hell I've gone through
To be reborn, reborn, again, again

Tear away, redefine
Bring me down, this life
Take what's wrong and make it right
Crucified every time I tried

This ain't over, roll me over
This ain't over, till it's, till it's over

The hell I've been through
I saw my face in the bottom of a bottle
The hell I've gone through
To be reborn, reborn, again

The hell I've been through
Shot down, ran through, dragged through
The hell I've gone through
To be reborn, reborn, again

This love, hate, this game
Don't want to remember
Made numb, mute, unreal
I can't forget, I can't forget
No, I won't, I can't forget

Yeah, good goddamn
The hell I've been through
I saw my face in the bottom of a bottle
The hell I've gone through
To be reborn, reborn, again

The hell I've been through
Shot down, ran through, dragged through
The hell I've gone through
To be reborn, reborn, again

Reborn, reborn, I'm reborn again
I won't forget, no
