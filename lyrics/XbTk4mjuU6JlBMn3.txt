Come my love
Kick the line
Afield lies nothing but squalor to turn on
A song asale

Should have said so much
Makes it harder
The more you love

Gladdening eyes
Through slur
Emerge crucified

So frail

Should have said so much
Makes it harder
The more you love

A song asale
Sold heart

Should have said so much
Makes it harder
The more you love

A song asale

For the good has bled to dust
Departed
The morning sun

For the good has bled to dust
Departed
The morning sun
