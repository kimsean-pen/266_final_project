Do you know what to do?
Would you know where to touch me if I want you to?
Do you feel what I feel?
Could you handle me now?
Now this moment is real?

I know, you know
Everything will be ok
If you treat me right
Green light all night
Are you gonna get it
your way today?

CHORUS
I aint foolin around
Now that you see
Whats about to go down
Now that it's time
Boy, to let yourself in
You've got to prove to me boy
That you've got what it takes
Now I bet you can't wait
For me to be your fantasy
For me to be your fantasy
For me to be your fantasy

Do you like what you see?
Do you feel that your closer to reality?
Boy, this isn't a dream
(Can I put it any clearer to you?)
Can you be everything that I want you to be?

I'm better than anyone
Anyone you've ever had
So come on, give up, give in to me
Show me how I drive you mad
How you want to be,
Be so bad

CHORUS
I aint foolin around
Now that you see
Whats about to go down
Now that it's time
Boy, to let yourself in
You've got to prove to me boy
That you've got what it takes
Now I bet you can't wait
For me to be your fantasy

Now that you know I aint foolin around
Now that you see what's about to go down
Now that you know I aint foolin around
Now that you see what's about to go down

I can be anyone, any time, any place
Any game you wanna play
Anything you wanna do
You can have it anywhere, any time, any place
Show me what you wanna do
Anything you want me to

I'm better than anyone
Anyone you've ever had
So come on, give up, give in to me
Show me how I drive you mad
How you want to be,
Be so bad
