Walking through this strange and crowded place
Imagining your face, fighting my way through
Oh I feel you getting close with every step
With all that I have left
I'm reaching out for you

If I was blindfolded
If my memory was erased
If every sign pointed to another place
I'd still find you
I will still find you
I'd still find you
If I was blindfolded

My fingers trace the outline of your shape
and recognize the way you pull me into you
oh you're calling out to me
not saying a thing
you're everything I need
and all that I could never, ever lose

If I was blindfolded
If my memory was erased
If every sign pointed to another place
I'd still find you
I will still find you
I'd still find you

You're the gravity that's taken hold of me
every time I lose my way
it's the chemistry
more than eyes can see
and no matter where I am
I will still find you
I will still find you

If I was blindfolded
If my memory was erased
If every sign pointed to another place
I'd still find you
I will still find you
I'd still find you

If I was blindfolded
If my memory was erased
If every sign pointed to another place
I'd still find you
I will still find you
I'd still find you

If I was blindfolded
