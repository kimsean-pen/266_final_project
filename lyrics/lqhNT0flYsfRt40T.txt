I'm her yesterday man
well my friends that's what I am
I'm her yesterday man
well my friends that's what I am
that's what I am her yesterday man

Please tell me something have you met an angel
someone too lovely to live on earth
well yesterday I thought I met an angel
but she wasn't worth all she seemed to be worth
and oh what a fool I have been
I was sure taken in

I'm her yesterday man
well my friends that's what I am
I'm her yesterday man
well my friends that's what I am
that's what I am her yesterday man

There's some of the good
and then some of the bad kind
some of the others are in between
but all that I can say is
she is the worst kind
well I think you know just what I mean
and yet in spite all that I say
I'd take her back any day

I'm her yesterday man
well my friends that's what I am
I'm her yesterday man
well my friends that's what I am
that's what I am her yesterday man
