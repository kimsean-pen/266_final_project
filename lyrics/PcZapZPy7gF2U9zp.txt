Insania
Will trap you there
Insania
Meet the dead

I was just a normal guy in this crazy world
Strange like most everyone around me
Struggling to survive my senseless days
Till I found this curious gateway

Dragged inside I thought I'd go insane
I tried to reach the doors, but I knew it was too late

Insania
Insania will trap you there
Reality is torn apart
The living ones will meet the dead
Insania
Where gravity won't hold you down
And everyone is free to fly
When passing through the open gates

It's a sight you can't conceive, in a dream reality
It's a space that blows your mind when you enter
Once you're there you'll know there is no return
And the walls keep falling down in front of me

Terrified my feet had no control
Try your way out, there's nowhere to run

Insania
Insania will trap you there
Reality is torn apart
The living ones will meet the dead
Insania
Where gravity won't hold you down
And everyone is free to fly
When passing through the open gates

Imagine a world where we walk
High above the ground
You'll find all the cities floating in the clouds
Where people are transparent
Our minds are transcendent
We all will be blessed until the end

Insania, Insania
Please let me in
Behind your walls

Insania
Insania will trap you there
Reality is torn apart
The living ones will meet the dead
Insania
Where gravity won't hold you down
And everyone is free to fly
When passing through the open gates
