Want to be the one that calls the boys over
Want to be the bitch, the heartbreaker
Want to be the chick who rocks a bodycon
Be the bond spy who holds the gun
Want to be your diamond girl, your number one
The one you hang with, the most fun
I want to be like a modern day Debbie fucking Harry
I want to be someone's love
I want to be someone's other half
I want to be the slut, the hoe, the tart
I want to be the one you say to "Don't start"
I want to have grace and I want to have flare
I want to be that girl who's never scared
I want to have skinny hips and perfect hair
Want to be the chick who doesn't care

I don't give a damn, it's fine
I'm not checking what time they were online
Back off, he's mine, I do this all the time
Seriously though, why hasn't he called?
When he was on his phone at half past four
I'm out of ideas, let's do something outrageous
You'll be calling me a douche and a racist
When I feel down, this is how it goes
Get a call, do a line, life goes slow
Big smile so your face looks fab
Do you ever check how many likes your life has?

I don't give a damn, it's fine
I'm not checking what time they were online
Back off, he's mine, I do this all the time
I don't give a damn, it's fine
I'm not checking what time they were online
Back off, he's mine, I do this all the time

Please baby, call me crazy
Or fun or spacey or amazing
Bake brownies that'll make you hazy
Any substance to make you want me
Invite you back to my Instagram life
Want the real one?
Take a hike
It's caged up right inside my mind
And it's not coming out for awhile

I don't give a damn, it's fine
I'm not checking what time they were online
Back off, he's mine, I do this all the time
I write songs that'll stick in your head
To get Spotify plays even after I'm dead
Buns of steel and a heart made of lead
One day I'll be talking on TED
About how my youth is dead
And I hated myself, I should've loved me instead

I don't give a damn, it's fine
I'm not checking what time they were online
Back off, he's mine, I do this all the time
I don't give a damn, it's fine
I'm not checking what time they were online
Back off, he's mine, I do this all the time

I don't give a damn, it's fine
I spend my life online
Clicking through the photos
All I want to know though
Can I have friends like Dorothy and Toto
I don't give a damn, it's fine
I live my life a lie
All about the makeup, the eye
Sorry I apologize all the time

I don't give a damn, it's fine
I'm not checking what time they were online
Back off, he's mine, I do this all the time
I don't give a damn, it's fine
I'm not checking what time they were online
Back off, he's mine, I do this all the time

I do this all the time
I do this all the time
I do this all the time
I do this all the time
