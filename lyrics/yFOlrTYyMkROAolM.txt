You are the sun, I am the moon
Chase you around like a bitter fool
Sometimes I go dark
Blocked by the world
You shine so bright on the other side
Giving light to the earth

In the morning comes to soon
'Cause I am the moon

You are so far
The distance unkind
But I'll keep on staring until I go blind

In the morning comes to soon
'Cause I am the moon

But every once in a while
We lock in the sky like lovers
Just for a moment I cover up
And we're intertwined

But I'll hold you tight
Just for the time, then it's done
Just for the time, we were one
Kiss and we say goodbye

You are the sun and I am the moon
Chase you around like a bitter fool
