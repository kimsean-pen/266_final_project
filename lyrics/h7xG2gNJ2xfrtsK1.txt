Evil warriors, fight till death
Sons of war, kill with wrath
Born in a village, he's learn to fight
Grew up with strength, his pleasure is to kill

Son of evil, he is insane
Maniac butcher, he is feared
He doesn't have religion, killing is what he wants to
False and fools, he is here to torture

Gods of the storm, Infernal death
Blood of victims gushes on my hands
Show me the wrath

On the frozen lands he is born
Living among the barbarian, violence is his business
He's forged his sword on the fire of Pandemonium
Blessed by Hell, feared by Christians

Gods of the storm, Infernal death
Blood of victims gushes on my hands
Show me the wrath

His destiny is to keep killing
Wild life, malign creature
The holy temple he will destroy
He'll dethrone Gods, he'll be emperor of death

Gods of the storm, Infernal death
Blood of victims gushes on my hands
Show me the wrath
