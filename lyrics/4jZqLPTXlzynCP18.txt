If I was a dif-ferent man,
if I had blood in my-ay-ay-ay, eyes -
I could have read of your heart,
I could have read of your eyes -
but now I'm lonely as that,
I put up a fi-i-i-i-ight -
so pick up your battering ram -
lo-o-o-o-o-ove, I wanna see it:

[chorus]
there's too much riding on that,
there's too much, too much, too much love.
there's too much riding on that,
there's too much, too much, too much love.
there's too much riding on that,
there's too much, too much, too much love.
there's too much riding on that anyway-eyay-ay
[end chorus]

and maybe I talk too fast,
maybe I talk too-o mu-u-uch -
give me the sensitive laugh,
or give me the sensiti-ive to-o-ouch -
even if I could have kissed,
even if I couldn't apply,
I'm so sorry I tried lo-o-o-o-o-ove, I wanna see it -

[chorus]
(words in background during this chorus:
too much love
too much lo-o-o-ove
too much love
too much lo-o-o-ove
too much love
too much lo-o-o-ove
too much love
too much love)
(background, also: 'love' faintly)

[chorus again, in the same way as above]

[this is background, at x2 Sufjan comes in with 'There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that'x4]
na, na na, na, na, na, na[x6]
meanwhile, another singer is singing:
'La-aaia-a-aaia'[x6]

(music interlude)

[there's background singers singing 'La' over and over in descending keys a few beats before singing, and it continues until a few beats before he ends]
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that word ...

(music interlude)

[this is semi-in the background]
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that.
