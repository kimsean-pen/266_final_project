"I am God, and all other gods are my imagery.
I gave birth to myself. I am millions of forms excreating;
eternal; and nothing exists except through me; yet
I am not them - they serve me."
Austin Osman Spare

grant me profane kiss
oh Isis mother ov all
thy lips like morphine
teasing my slumbering heart
release me!
this cosmos is way to small
come down on earth, evangelize!

ravishing muse
abduct my spirit
and bury my will
in spacious beyond
that human thought can never reach
alight upon the earth
and consecrate my engines ov life!

and so I chant that triumph ov might
trampling kingdoms ov conscience
I, the archangel ov wrath
with one word, the unholy sword
I overmastered every image ov god

I come in splendor and golden glory
seeking war trophies
and sacred spoils
to purify this heart ov mine
to cast away rotten rood
defile morality ov the blind god

defiling morality ov black god
