You and...
I are... like oil and water
And we've been trying, trying, trying

Ohhhhhhh... to mix it up.
We've been...
Dancing... on a volcano.

And we've been crying, crying, crying
Over blackened souls.
Babe, this wouldn't be the first time.

It will not be the last time.
There is no parasol that could shelter this weather.
I've been...

Smiling... with anchors on my shoulders
And I've been dying, dying, dying
Ohhhhhhh... to let them go

Babe, this wouldn't be the first time.
It will not be the last time.
There is no parasol that could shelter this weather.

Babe, this wouldn't be the first time.
It will not be the last time.
We've been trying to believe everything would get better!
We've been...
Lying... to each other.
Hey! Babe! Let's just call it, call it, call it
Ohhhhhhhh... what it is...
Oil and water!
Oil and water!
Oil and water!
Ohh...
