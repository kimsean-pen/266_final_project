You come alive
when there's a break in the rain
But you feel that in the morning clouds will come again
In desolation we're empty and apart
We keep searching for a haven
In our restless hearts
Ooh
24 hours sun
and wake up before the dark
We could hide away our problems
Til the winter starts
We pull up walls
And we build them up again
We don't think they come between us
What do you end??
Yeah we did it again
Will we ever find a home out there?
Yeah we did it again
Will we ever find a home out there?
Oohh
Transatlantic trains
Coming hopes in the sky
Do you think you'll find your happiness
And next to mine
We've come so far
But we creatures are the same
We're at a high with our emotions
But we feel the pain
Yeah we did it again
Will we ever find a home out there?
Yeah we did it again
Will we ever find a home out there?
Oooh
Yeah we did it again
Will we ever find a home out there?
Yeah we did it again
Will we ever find a home out there?
Yeah we did it again
Will we ever find a home out there?
Yeah we did it again
Will we ever find a home out there?
Ooh
