Fuoco, Pianto, Sangue, Cancro
Morte nera dentro me

Sacra, Lotta, Dura, Cruda
Di ideali senza eta'
Quando corpus morietur
Fac ut animae donetur

Sad dark angel write the poem's evil page
DIES IRAE
REGNA NELL' OSCURITA'

Guardians of the moonlight bringt the spell alive
through the sphere of sorrow lead my holy ride
Titans of the desert face the warlord's pride
fighters from the near lakes join the tragic night

War of the ghostland take your souls
but give us freedom once and for all
...firestorm
UNDER THE RAIN OF A THOUSAND FLAMES
WE FACE THE REAL PAIN FALLING IN VAIN
WHILE THE DARK ANGEL SCREAMS FOR VENGANCE
IN THE DEAD SHADOW OF FALLING STARS

Silent cries of virgins touch the heart of night
raped by the demons under painful sights
Sperm and blood and terror chaos in my head
Is the law of evil triumph for the damned

War of the ghostland take your souls
but give us freedom once and for all
...firestorm
UNDER THE RAIN OF A THOUSAND FLAMES

WE FACE THE REAL PAIN FALLING IN VAIN
WHILE THE DARK ANGEL SCREAMS FOR VENGANCE
IN THE DEAD SHADOW OF FALLING STARS
...moonlight is the witness of the most tragic day for our lands...
nothing seems possible to change the destiny of war...

Lament of heroes reach the deep skies
fill the wide cosmos and free my pain... my pain!
UNDER THE RAIN OF A THOUSAND FLAMES
WE FACE THE REAL PAIN FALLING IN VAIN
WHILE THE DARK ANGEL SCREAMS FOR VENGANCE
IN THE DEAD SHADOW
OF FALLING STARS
DIES IRAE
REGNA NELL' OSCURITA
