I barely get to the graveyard shift on time
After pulling another gruelling nine to five
I live from credit card to check
The paper money's whirling by
And I hardly just, just barely, only just survive

I'm living on the edge
Reality is teetering
My mind is on the brink

How will I face the day tomorrow
If I can't make it through today?
I've got nothing left to lose, but my sanity
And the right to go insane

I got nothing left to lose
But my mind
I got nothing left to choose
So I think I'll go insane

My stomach aches from insufficient funds
My cheeks are gaunt, my guts are overdrawn
My head pounds
Starvation's given me the shakes
Too much squalor, too much pressure, and now I'm getting pissed

I'm living on the edge
Reality is teetering
My mind is on the brink

How will I face the day tomorrow
If I can't make it through today?
I've got nothing left to lose, but my sanity
And the right to go insane

I got nothing left to lose
But my mind
I got nothing left to choose
So I think I'll go insane
