Walk away from the sun, come slowly undone
I can see in your eyes, I have already won
I could bleed for a smile, I could cry for some fun
Walk away from the sun and tell everyone, yeah

There's so much left in the air
So much to tell from a stare
There's so much left to defend
But I am no fun

So turn away from the ones, you hurt everyone
I can tell by your smile, you're coming undone
I could bleed for a smile, could die for a gun
Walk away from the sun and kill everyone, yeah

So tiny dancer beware
When medicated and scared
This smile is so hard to wear
But I have no gun

So turn away from the ones, you hurt everyone
I can tell by your smile, you're coming undone
I could bleed for a smile, could die for a gun
Walk away from the sun and kill everyone

And you're fading with everyday
(You could've been the next one, should've been the next one)
And you're fading with everyday
(You could've been the next one, should've been the next one)
And you're fading with everyday
(You could've been the next one, should've been the next one)
And you're fading with everyday

(Whoa)

There's so much left in the air
So much to tell from your stare
There's so much left to defend
But I am no fun

And you're fading with everyday
(You could've been the next one, should've been the next one)
And you're fading with everyday
(You could've been the next one, should've been the next one)
And you're fading with everyday
(You could've been the next one, should've been the next one)

And you're fading with everyday
(Whoa)
(Walk away from the sun)
Fading with everyday
(Walk away from the sun)
Fading with everyday
(Walk away from the sun)
Fading with everyday
(Walk away from the sun)
Fading with everyday
