I feel it sinking in
It's underneath my skin
Straight through my blood into my bones
I taste it on my tongue
This poison fills my lungs
But I won't let it fill my soul
Because I know

When I fight
I remember why I'm still alive
I'm holding onto what is left inside
Cause you're just a virus and I didn't come here to die

Virus!

Your make me question if
I want it to exist
You were the venom in my veins
But now I see the truth
The enemy was you
That time will come but not today
Because I know

When I fight
I remember why I'm still alive
I'm holding onto what is left inside
Cause you're just a virus and I didn't come here to die

With open eyes, I see the light
My spirit comes alive
I'm holding on, my will is strong
I know I will survive
The end is near, I will not fear
No reasons left to hide
The venoms gone, I'm moving on
I'm taking back my life

When I fight
I remember why I'm still alive
I'm holding onto what is left inside
Cause you're just a virus and I didn't come here to die

You're just a virus
You're just a virus
You're just a virus and I didn't come here to die
Virus! Virus!
