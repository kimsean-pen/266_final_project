You'll never hold me again,
You don't care about it.
You never called me a friend.
You, forget about it.

I love this,
You love no.
Stare blankly
Stumble through the praise,
Lead it slow.
At least its not a tether though,
Strings attached to stone.

You'll never hold me again.
You'll never know
What I've been staring down it.
Why dont you care about it?
You'll never hold be again.
Why dont you care about it?

Cause we can be together, locked safely.
Together, locked safely.

{ooo, hold on tight, yeah}

I loved this,
You love no.
And its broken
Tell me all the things I dont know.
I hope its regretable,
That you've got in your bones:

You'll never hold me again
You'll never know
What I've been staring down it
Why dont you care about it?
You'll never hold be again.
Why dont you care about it?

Cause we can be together, locked safely.
together locked safely.

You'll never hold me again.
You'll never know,
What I've been staring down it.
Why dont you care about it?

You'll never hold be again.
Why don't you care about it?

You'll never hold me again.
You'll never know,
What I've been staring down it.
Why dont you care about it?

You'll never hold be again.
Why dont you care about it?
