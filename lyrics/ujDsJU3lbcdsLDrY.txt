Yeah, nobody's watching us, keep
Holding my hand
I spent fourteen weeks with fourteen lovers

Yeah, anything's possible and
Love's not an obstacle
I spend fourteen weeks with fourteen lovers

I've got an appetite
And seeing the feeling's right
Down to my fingertips
I'll take you away from this, but

Everything's so complicated
I don't understand, translate it
Thought you'd be the one to save me
Love and understanding, baby

Yeah, anything's possible
When love's not an obstacle

Yeah, anything's possible
When love's not an obstacle

Everything's so complicated
I don't understand, translate it
Thought you'd be the one to save me
Love and understand me, baby

Everything's so complicated
I don't understand, translate it
Thought you'd be the one to save me
Love and understand me, baby
