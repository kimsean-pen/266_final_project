Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh

Knock me down
All the demons creeping in, no
Another round changing shots with my ego
Runnin' can't tell me now
Your chains only drive me down
I've battled hard with the face in the mirror
Every scar makes me dig down deeper
I push it 'til there's nothing more
'Cause I'm stronger then I was before

It's time to stand up, stand up
Show me with your made of
Hands up, hands up
Fight the fear
Fight the fear
Rise up from the ground
Gonna make you a believer
Fight the fear
Fight the fear
Blood, sweat, tears make the pain taste sweeter
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh

Fight the fear
Fight the fear
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Rise up from the ground
Gonna make you a believer

Feel the pulse in my veins like a fighter
I'm the rush like the heat from the fire
Nothing can stop my now
I'm screaming 'til my lungs give out

Oh, it's time to stand up, stand up
Show me with your made of
Hands up, hands up
Fight the fear
Fight the fear
Rise up from the ground
Gonna make you a believer
Fight the fear
Fight the fear
Blood, sweat, tears make the pain taste sweeter
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Fight the fear
Fight the fear
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Rise up from the ground
Gonna make you a believer

Stand up, stand up
Show me what you're made of
Hands up, hands up
Show me what you're made of
Stand up, stand up
Show me what you're made of
Hands up, hands up
Show me what you're made of
It's time to
Stand up, stand up
Show me what you're made of
Hands up, hands up
Show me what you're made of
It's time to
Stand up, stand up
Show me what you'r made of
Hands up, hands up

Whoa-oh-oh

Fight the fear
Fight the fear
Rise up from the ground
Gonna make you a believer
Fight the fear
Fight the fear
Blood, sweat, tears make the pain taste sweeter
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Fight the fear
Fight the fear
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Rise up from the ground
Gonna make you a believer
