I come alive
Inside the light of the unexpected
Maybe I thrive
Outside the comfort zone
What is a prize without a fight
Yeah I got addicted
To what I thought I wanted
And all along

I've been walking asleep
Dreaming awake
Finding I bend but I don't break
Almost a sinner
Nearly a saint
Finding with every breath I take
I'm not afraid
Of making mistakes
Sometimes it's wrong before it's right
That's what you call a perfect life

Gathering thorns from the stems of a thousand roses
Weathering storms on the long way home
I look for the sweet in every bitter moment tasted
In every last mistake I see the other side

I've been walking asleep
Dreaming awake
Finding I bend but I don't break
Almost a sinner
Nearly a saint
Finding with every breath I take
I'm not afraid
Of making mistakes
Sometimes it's wrong before it's right
That's what you call a perfect life

Don't need a resolution
To know I'll be alright
I'll be alright

I've been walking asleep
Dreaming awake
Finding I bend but I don't break
Almost a sinner
Nearly a saint
Finding with every breath I take
I'm not afraid
Of making mistakes
Sometimes it's wrong before it's right
That's what you call a perfect
That's what you call a perfect life

I come alive
Inside the light of the unexpected
