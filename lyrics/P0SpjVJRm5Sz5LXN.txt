And in the glade a light was seen
Of stars and shadows shimmering
Immortal maiden elven-wise...
Long was the way through iron halls and darkling doors

And woods of nightshade morrowless
Elven-wise dance with me...
Cold be hand, heart and bone
And cold be my sleep under stone
Never more I'll wake on a snowy bed
Never - 'til the sun fails and the moon is dead

In the black winds the stars shall die
And still on gold here let them lie
'Til the dark lord lifts his hand
Over dead seas and withered land

And I'll fly away...
Where I dwell none can say
For into darkness fell my star
In Mordor where the shadows are
