You wash them clothes
Sweedeedee
And hang 'em on the line
I can see by the way

You wash them clothes
Cookin' must be fine
I'm with you in the morning
'Til the break of day

I know everybody
Has a little hard luck sometimes
I know lately, I've been havin' mine

We used to live
In a fleabag apartment
You know the kind

And he come home
And he'd say to me
"We gotta leave, leave, leave the city"

You wash them clothes
Sweedeedee
And hang 'em on the line
I can see by the way

You wash them clothes
Cookin' must be fine
I'm with you in the morning
'Til the break of day

I know everybody
Has a little hard luck sometimes
I know lately, I've been havin' mine
