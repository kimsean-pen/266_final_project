Sky, so vast is the sky
With far away clouds just wandering by
Where do they go?
Oh, I don't know, don't know
Wind that speaks to the leaves
Telling stories that no one believes
Stories of love
Belong to you and me
Oh, dindi
If I only had words
I would say all the beautiful things that I see
When you're with me, oh, my dindi
Oh, dindi
Like the song of the wind in the trees
That's how my heart is singing dindi
Happy dindi, when you're with me
I love you more each day
Yes, I do, yes, I do
I'd let you go away
If you take me with you
Don't you know, dindi
I'd be running and searching for you
Like the river that can't find the sea
That would be me without you, my dindi
Oh, dindi, my dindi, my dindi
