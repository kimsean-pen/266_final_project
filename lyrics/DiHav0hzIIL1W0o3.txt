You, you got your head in a scream
And im, I'm trying to get your attention
You appear as a child put your heart on a seam
But you're acting exactly as you do in my dreams
I said you; you are not what you seem
And you're finding out that

Falling down can feel strange
No one remembers your name
You're losing the game
That's the thing about trust
It's always the same
Sad story again
You lose all your friends
That's the thing about trust

You, you got your head in a swing
Yeah, and I, I'm trying to give you salvation
You appear as a devil
Like a wolf in the woods
But your acting exactly as we expected you would
I said you; you read the words that I sing, as a shock through the system

Falling down can feel strange
No one remembers your name
You're losing the game
That's the thing about trust
It's always the same
Sad story again
You lose all your friends
That's the thing about trust

Don't lie to me when the pressure's on, you gotta have trust
Don't lie to me when the pressure's on, you gotta have trust
Don't lie to me when the pressure's on, you gotta have trust
Don't lie to me when the pressure's on, I said you gotta have trust

Falling down can feel strange
No one remembers your name
You're losing the game
That's the thing about trust
It's always the same
Sad story again
You lose all your friends
That's the thing about trust
Falling down can feel strange
No one remembers your name
You're losing the game
That's the thing about trust
It's always the same
Sad story again
You lose all your friends
That's the thing about trust
Trust
