Dear catastrophe waitress
Dear catastrophe waitress
I'm sorry that you seem to have
The weight of the world over you

I cherish your smile
There's a word of peace on you lips
Say it, and with tenderness I'll cherish you

I'll cherish you
Dear catastrophe girlfriend
Dear catastrophe girlfriend

I'm sorry if he hit you with a
Full can of Coke, it's no joke
Your face is bleeding
You'll soon be leaving this town
To the clowns who worship
No one but themselves, no one but themselves

I hate feeling this way, oh

I hate feeling this way, oh

I know that you hate it too, oh

Now that your coffee's growing cold, oh

All of the customers look so old, oh

Honey, if I could be so bold
Dear catastrophe waitress
Dear catastrophe waitress

I'm sorry if the kids hold you
In cool disregard, I know it's hard

You stick to what you know
You'll blow them all to the wall
When they realize what you've been working for
What you've been working for, what you've been working for
