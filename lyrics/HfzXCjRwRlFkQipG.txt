Brown bird, common bird
How's your little twig nest been?
I heard you searched the hollow earth
Have you finally found your long lost friend?

Endless words of "a dream deferred"
Wouldn't have you look my way
So I made the rounds in Germantown
They could barely taste my pancreas that day

The 28th, Will
The Lucky 8th, Bill
Did you win that Grammy, Will?
Good for the landfill
Did you beat Phil?
Did you network well?

You wanna circle Sinai
Another forty years
Have I made myself and myself clear?
Still seduced by the child celebrity appeal
Have I made myself?
Have I made myself and myself clear?

Brown eyes, brown eyes, what do you see?
Brown eyes, brown eyes of an adult looking back at me
Brown eyes, brown eyes, what do you see?
Brown eyes, hazel eyes and a caterpillar book on my knee
Now you're gonna explain to me about resilience and fragility?

Circling Sinai another forty years?
Have I made myself and myself clear?
Let's watch the desert sky do silent shapes appear?
Have I made myself in any way myself?
Hold your children close whenever we come near?
Speak in children's prose for those with ears to hear?
You in the diving bell atop the silver skyline
Play the victim well, who's the devil this time?
The devil this time?
The devil this time?
