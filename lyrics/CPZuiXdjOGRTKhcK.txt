Well everytime I feel you're comin' round you're going down,
You hit the ground with every force it makes no sense or sound

God bless you soul girl,
Now you got the whole world
I'm on my way now,
I'll get there somehow

Have you ever seen the light?
Don't you wonder where I hide
I will live, then I will die
I will keep you on my mind

It's your eyes that make me smile
(Oh Yeah, Oh Yeah)
Wasting time, hangin' out
(Oh Yeah, Oh Yeah)
These teenage years well they don't last
(Oh Yeah, Oh Yeah)
These teenage lips they speak too fast
(Oh Yeah, Oh Yeah)

I see the light that's shining from your eyes, blinding me
It's like I'm walking down your street again at seventeen

God bless you soul girl,
Now you got the whole world
I'm on my way now,
I'll get there somehow

Have you ever seen the light?
Don't you wonder where I hide
I will live, then I will die
I will keep you on my mind

It's your eyes that make me smile
(Oh Yeah, Oh Yeah)
Wasting time, hangin' out
(Oh Yeah, Oh Yeah)
These teenage years well they don't last
(Oh Yeah, Oh Yeah)
These teenage lips they speak too fast
(Oh Yeah, Oh Yeah)
