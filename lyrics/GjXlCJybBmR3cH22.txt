It's on now
It's on now

Any minute, now that we've seen it all
Any day now, waiting for your curtain to fall
Any second, you called but I'm calling you out
Any minute, I've never been one to give in
Any day now, it has to end before we begin
Any second, you called but I'm calling you out

These eyes they see more than you know
We're all dressed in our best, so take it or leave it

Nobody make a move, everybody on the ground
Let me see your hands, bring the fucking cameras out
You better use your head, you better use your head
Before we take it off your mother fucking shoulders

Any minute, any day now
Any second, you called but I'm calling you out
Any minute, I've never been one to give in
Any day now, it has to end before we begin
Any second, you called but I'm calling you out

These eyes they see more than you know
We're all dressed in our best, so take it or leave it
These eyes they see more than you know
We're all dressed in our best, so take it or leave it

I've got all the plans in the world
To take everyone hostage in a national bank
Instead of money, I want fame
Bring on the cameras, bring on the lights
Roll tape, call action, it's show time, it's show time

Any minute, any day now
Any second

These eyes they see more than you know
We're all dressed in our best, so take it or leave it
These eyes they see more than you know
We're all dressed in our best, so take it or leave it

These eyes they see more than you know
We're all dressed in our best, so take it or leave it
