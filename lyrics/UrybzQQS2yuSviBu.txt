Oh yes I walk the path that righteous
Many men have walked before
And this pain's held
A broken shell
Straight shackled onto the floor

So welcome to the world
That I lived in
Puking up bile and hate
My world has turned
To false inclusion
Sickening broken state

But then I'd see
There's things in me
That make me want it
More than you

But I deny all this
'Cause pain was my bliss
Get wasted on self-destruct

So hold on to the edge

It's all about
The blood, the sweat, the tears
Attribute to the strength
Built through the years

It's all about
The blood, the sweat, the tears
Attribute to the strength
Built through the years
Attribute to...

Oh yes I walk the path
That gives me
Confidence strong and pure
Now I realize
That freedom rises
From confronting the source

I built these walls around me
And I can break them all away
I'll focus all the strength I call
Into unstoppable energy

So hold on to the edge

It's all about
The blood, the sweat, the tears
Attribute to the strength
Built through the years

It's all about
The blood, the sweat, the tears
Attribute to the strength
Built through the years
Attribute to...

Hold on
I'm not falling
Please let go

Hold on
I'm not falling
Not falling down again

It's all about
The blood, the sweat, the tears
Attribute to the strength
Built through the years

It's all about
The blood, the sweat, the tears
Attribute to the strength
Built through the years

Believe me that
Time will sear the wound
Time will sear the wound
Time will sear the wound
