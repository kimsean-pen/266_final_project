Something told me you're around
But if you're pleasantly drunk you can't hear a sound
Power hungry was the crown
But if you're pleasantly drunk you can't hear a sound

There's a war of words I'm about to lose
Wiped the glass three times to erase its use
Saw a twitch from a chair that's about to fall
Took the things on display at a nations hall

I thought I belonged to something
Walking up stairs gets me down

Everyone has known the mouth to mouth
Everyone's agreed from north to south
Everyone has moved to greet the greed
Everyone has known the mouth to mouth
Everyone's agreed from north to south
Everyone has moved to greet the greed

Exits, you are just another entry
But if you're pleasantly drunk you can't read the news

There's a war of words I'm about to lose
Wiped the glass three times to erase its use
Saw a twitch from a chair that's about to fall
Took the things on display at a nations hall

I thought I belonged to something
Walking up stairs gets me down

I thought I belonged to something
Walking up stairs gets me

Everyone has known the mouth to mouth
Everyone's agreed from north to south
Everyone has moved to greet the greed
Everyone has known the mouth to mouth
Everyone's agreed from north to south
Everyone has moved to greet the greed
