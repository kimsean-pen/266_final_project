I really don't feel like talking on the phone
And I really don't feel like company at home
Lately I don't wanna do the things I used to do
Baby since I lost you

And I don't want to sing another love song babe
I don't want to hum another melody
I don't want to live my life without you babe
It's drivin' me crazy

I really don't feel like smiling anymore
And I haven't had the peace to sleep at all
Ever since you went away, baby my whole life has changed
I don't wanna love and I don't wanna live

And I don't want to sing another love song babe
I don't want to hum another melody
I don't want to live my life without you babe
It's drivin' me crazy

Tell I don't wanna laugh, I don't wanna play
I don't wanna talk, have nothin' to say
I don't want to tour, forget the show
How can I go on now that you are gone?

And I don't want to sing another love song babe
I don't want to hum another melody
I don't want to live my life without you babe
It's drivin' me crazy

And I don't want to sing another love song babe
I don't want to hum another melody
I don't want to live my life without you babe
It's drivin' me crazy
I don't want to sing another love song babe
I don't want to hum another melody
