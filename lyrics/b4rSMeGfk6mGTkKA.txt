Used to be so judgemental
Now I respect the ones
Who dare to be sinful
Always searching for my pride
Now I know it's all fleeting
Just glad to be alive

Brontosaurs fear of art is torn apart by making
Good mistakes and branching out
He switch it up like baking
The more I tried to sleep it off the more I started thinking
I wanna live in mushroom park, do unrestricted shrinking

You're salty, can't fault you
I'm numb to the rhythm that guides you
Take all your confetti away

I know, I know what's killing me
Don't need your love, yout sympathy
I know, I know just what you'll say
Don't you try to rescue me

Made up magic turtle guy is feeling like he's crap
He needs to spend some time alone to understand his path
There's different types of waves and things your mind is tuning to
It takes in information and it sorts it out for you

Won't fight you, not like you
I'm numb to the rhythm that guides you
But I'll take your confetti away

I know, I know what's killing me
Don't need your love, your sympathy
I know, I know just what you'lll say
Don't you try to rescue me
Don't you try to rescue me
Don't you try to rescue me

Now you're on a midnight crusade
Flexing your stats
But you can't touch me, touch me, touch me
Tell me how to think my own way
You can give it your best
But you won't touch me, touch me, touch me

I'm kissing a baby that licking a boot
I live in a deli put meat on your tooth
My bisness is pregnant and flayntin' off nude
I'm smoking a chicken I took out the coupe
Show off addiction and make it sound fiction
You arent't doing art if you're dead in the park
If you feel like you died show'em you have
Give up your life for the virtual clap
Shear off the weird then watch'em appear
Now you're a spiritless, fearless lil lyricist
Shear off the weird then watch'em appear
Now you're a spiritless, fearless lil lyricist
Hoax
