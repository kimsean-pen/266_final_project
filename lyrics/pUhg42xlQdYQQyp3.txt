Is there a remedy for the passions of the soul
brother if there is one I don't really know
have I let my imagination run out of control
I'm a rainbow
just a rainbow

Am I living here in this nameless state
it's light on darkness sound of silence
I just can't get it straight
see I don't wanna be no one that I ain't
I'm a rainbow
just a rainbow

And all the colors that you see
are all part of me
in this crazy world of mine

Like the wind that blows
the trees are sailing for the breeze
ever changing all the time

I'm a rainbow just a rainbow
ever changing all the time
I'm a rainbow colorful rainbow
sometimes I shine

And all the colors that you see
are all part of me
in this crazy world of mine

Like the wind that blows
the trees are sailing for the breeze
ever changing all the time

Da, da, da, da, da...

Like the wind that blows
the trees are sailing for the breeze
ever changing all the time

I'm a rainbow just a rainbow
and sometimes I can shine
I'm a rainbow just a rainbow...
