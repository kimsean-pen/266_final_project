You swore to tell the truth and the whole truth
But I can see it clearly in my rearview
While you were lying with him
You were lying to me, you were lying to me

Now every single text and every single call
Every single word that says: It's my fault
While you were messaging him you were messing with me

I don't wanna hear a made up excuse
I'm done feeling used, it's over
I don't wanna hear I'm something I'm not
You're done you, got caught, it's over

Once a liar gonna be a liar always
Some other liar gonna get you some day
What you're giving, you'll get it, you'll get it back
All the same

You played with my head with everything you said
You're a water gun in Russian roulette
If it means anything now, you mean nothing to me
You mean nothing to me

I don't wanna hear a made up excuse
I'm done feeling used, it's over
I don't wanna hear I'm something I'm not
You're done, you got caught, it's over

Once a liar gonna be a liar always
Some other liar gonna get you some day
What you're giving, you'll get it, you'll get it back
All the same

(All the same)
You swore to tell the truth and the whole truth
But I can see it clearly in my rearview
(All the same)

I don't wanna hear a made up excuse
I'm done feeling used, it's over
I don't wanna hear a made up excuse
I'm done feeling used, it's over
I don't wanna hear I'm something I'm not
You're done, you got caught, it's over

Once a liar gonna be a liar always
Some other liar gonna get you some day
What you're giving, you'll get it, you'll get it back
All the same
All the same
