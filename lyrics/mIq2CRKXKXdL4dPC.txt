You say that you're damned.
You say that your life isnt fair.
What's right and what's wrong.
You've got your needs and you just dont care.
On and on we drift, back to where we were before.
You can welcome me in, i will not walk through that door.
I may be blind but i'll find my way.
Like a Lost Prayer on a stormy day.
You can carry your courage, i've said, but these times, and i've cut you free.
Keep your word to your self, i buried what was in my sympathy.
On and on we drift, back to where we were before.
You can welcome me in, i will not walk through that door.
I may be blind but i'll find my way.
Like a Lost Prayer on a stormy day.
Oh stormy day.
Stormy day.
I may be blind but i'll find my way.

I may be blind but i'll find my way.
Like a Lost Prayer on a stormy day.
I may be blind but i'll find my way.
Like a Lost Prayer on a stormy day.
Oh stormy day.
