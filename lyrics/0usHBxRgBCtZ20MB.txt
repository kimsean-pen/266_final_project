A flask, I drink of sober tea
While relay cameras monitor me
And the buzz surrounds, it does
(Buzz surrounds, buzz surrounds)

Closed eyed, sky wide open
Unlimited girl, unlimited sigh
Elsewhere, indefinitely far away
Magnifies and deepens

Ready to sing
My sixth sense peacefully placed on my breath
And listening
(Keeps me from my hurt)
My ears know that my eyes are closed
(Perish thoughts like contraband)

I train myself in martial arts
As advertised
I reinforce my softened parts
As advertised

See through me, little glazed lane
A world in myself

Ready to sing
My sixth sense peacefully placed on my breath
(Flickering I roam)
And listening
My ears know that my eyes are closed

I see to bolts, put keys to locks
No boat are rocked, I'm free to roam
On dummy screens and magazines

Closed eyed, sky wide open
Unlimited girl, unlimited sigh

To think that I lay next to you
Wasting time when I could do
A simple job in strip lights
A flask, I drink a sober tea
'Till daylight sends me home
Flickering I roam

Daydreaming admiring being
Quietly open the world

I hear the time of the starry sky
Turning over at midnight

See through me, little glazed lane
A world in myself

Daydreaming admiring being
Quietly open the world

I hear the time of the starry sky
Turning over at midnight
