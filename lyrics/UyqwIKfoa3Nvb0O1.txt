You with the sad eyes
Don't be discouraged, oh I realize
It's hard to take courage
In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
And the darkness ooh inside you
Make you feel so small

But I see your true colors shining through
I see your true colors and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show your true colors
True colors are beautiful like a rainbow

Show me a smile then
Don't be unhappy, can't remember
When I last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
You call me up because you know I'll be there

And I see your true colors shining through
I see your true colors and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show your true colors
Your true colors are beautiful like a rainbow

Oh I can't remember when I last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy
You've taken all you can bear
You call me up because you know I'll be there

And I see your true colors shining through
I see your true colors and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show your true colors
True colors, true colors are shining through

I see your true colors and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show your true colors
True colors are beautiful like a rainbow
