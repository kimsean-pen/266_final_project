We've been here before
and Im losing hope
Of all the bad boys
you're badder than most
And I couldn't see all your flaws below your charm
And you cannot see all my scars your love has caused
See I will get over you
You're not the man that I once knew
You've taken the best of me
left me with nothing good
See I will get over you
Im taking a chance and I'm breaking free
You've hid me away now I can't find me
And I couldnt see all your flaws below your charm
And you cannot see all my scars your love has caused
See I will get over you

You're not the man I once knew
You've taken the best of me
left me with nothing good
See I will get over you
I cut These ties
We say Goodbyes
To love You not
Would be A lie
Now go And find
Another mind
To stain The way
That you did to mine
That you did to mine
That you did to mine
That you did to mine
That you did to mine
See I will get over you
You're not the man I once knew
You've taken the best of me
left me with nothing good
See I will get over you
