I don't want to feel what I feel
I don't know what's real anymore
I don't want to feel what I feel
I just want to be with you
I just want to talk with you
I've lived without your touch
For so long that it fades from my memory
I'm so hungry for your touch
I just want to know how you feel

Should I forget you
Should I hold onto
Those precious days so long ago now
I really just want to give my love to you
But you're far away now

The thought that you're out there somewhere
Comforts and confuses my mind
I know we both got things to do here
I just want to dream with you

Should I forget you
Should I hold onto
Those precious days so long ago now
I really just want to give my love to you
But you're far away now

I'm tired of playing the fool
What am I supposed to do?
I want you to be in it too
I'm tired of spilling my life
When there's no one to pick it up

So should I forget you
Should I hold onto
Those precious days so long ago now
I really just want to give my love to you
But you're far away now
You're far away now
So far away now
You're far away now

I'll never forget you
I'll always hold onto
Those precious days so long ago now
I'll always just want to give my love to you
But I'll keep it for now
