Girl, what's come between you and me?
Look right through me.
I wont let it go
I can't control this feeling anymore
I won't go anywhere
And maybe you'll see me

Ohhhh...
Yeah
We are
We are the shaken
We are the monsters
Underneath your bed
Yeah
Believe what you read
We are
We are mistaken
We are the voices

Inside your head

Yeah
Believe what you see
It came as no surprise
You bring me back to life
Believe me (you bleed for me I'll bleed for you)

I caught you walking through walls
Drowned with applause

From the world that makes me crazy
We are
We are the shaken
We are the monsters
Underneath your bed
Yeah
Believe what you read
We are
We are mistaken
We are the voices

Inside your head
Yeah
Believe what you see

We are the monsters
We are the monsters
We are the monsters
Underneath your bed
We are the voices
We are the voices
We are the voices
Underneath your bed

We are the monsters

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

We are the shaken
We are the monsters
Underneath your bed

Inside your head

Underneath your bed
