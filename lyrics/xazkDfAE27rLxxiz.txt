Under a silver moon, tropical temperature
I feel my lotus bloom, come closer
I want your energy, I want your aura
You are my destiny, my mantra

I never knew I could see something so clearly lookin' through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your life
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical tonight
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beatin' like a drum
Legendary lovers, we could be legendary (La, la, la, la, la)
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary (La, la, la, la, la)

Go down in history
Go down together, into infinity, forever
Your Cleopatra, your blushing Juliet
Anything for your love, a ride or die

I never knew I could see something so clearly lookin' through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your life
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical, tonight
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beatin' like a drum
Legendary lovers, we could be legendary (La, la, la, la, la)
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary (La, la, la, la, la)

Ah-ooh, ooh, ah-ooh, ooh, ah-ooh
Legendary lovers (Ooh), legendary lovers (Ah-ooh), legendary lovers (Ooh)

Oh, take me down to the river
Underneath the blood orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum (Drum, drum, drum, drum)
Legendary lovers, we could be legendary (La, la, la, la, la)
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary (La, la, la, la, la)

Oh, take me down to the river
Underneath the blood orange sun (Underneath the sun)
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beatin' like a drum (Oh, baby)
Legendary lovers, we could be legendary (La, la, la, la, la)
Ooh, legendary lovers, we should be legendary (La, la, la, la, la)
Ah-ooh
