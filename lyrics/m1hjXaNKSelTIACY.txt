Dark -1.0
Sample taken from the movie Dark City, released in 1998 (based on a novel). Opening monologue, spoken by Dr. Daniel P. Schreber (played by Kiefer Sutherland).

First there was darkness, then came the strangers. They were a race as old as time itself. They had mastered the ultimate technology, the ability to alter physical reality by will alone. They called this ability tuning. But they were dying; their civilization was in decline. And so they abandoned their world, seeking a cure for their own mortality. Their endless journey brought them to small little world, in the farthest corner of the galaxy.
