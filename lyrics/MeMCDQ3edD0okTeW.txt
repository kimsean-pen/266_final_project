We are a lullaby, an everlasting song
Taken as prisoners to a place where we belong
If the tune stops, I will not wake.
Oh no, without us I'm no one, my soul swells and aches

So on the day when the music dies, so will our love
There'll be some pain, but I'll keep it in my locket
If you'll lead the band, then I will have to follow
There's no escape for me, so

(Play on)
Keep me dancing in the air
(Play on)
No one else they can compare
(Play on)
To the harmony of our sweet rapture
(Play on)
You have a supernatural flair
(Play on)
Push me further than I dare
(Play on)
Play on, play on, play on
So play on for me.

So if this melody should stop or fade away
The oceans will drain out, and the stars disintegrate
It's like voodoo, I've lost all my control
I look into you, you make me rock and roll

So on the day when the music dies, so will our love
There'll be some pain, but I'll keep it in my locket
If you'll lead the band, then I will have to follow
There's no escape for me, so...

(Play on)
Keep me dancing in the air
(Play on)
No one else they can compare
(Play on)
To the harmony of our sweet rapture
(Play on)
You have a supernatural flair
(Play on)
Push me further than I dare
(Play on)
Play on, play on, play on
So play on for me

(Play on and on and on and on
and on and on and on and on and on and on and
on and on and on and on and on and on)

(Play on)
Keep me dancing in the air
(Play on)
No one else they can compare
(Play on)
To the harmony of our sweet rapture
(Play on)
You have a supernatural flair
(Play on)
Push me further than I dare
(Play on)
So play on, play on, play on
Play on for me

(Play on, play on)
(Play on, play on)
(Play on, play on)
Play on to the harmony of our sweet rapture
(Play on)
You have a supernatural flair
(Play on, play on)
Push me further than I dare.
So play on for me
