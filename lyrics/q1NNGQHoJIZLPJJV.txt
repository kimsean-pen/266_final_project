All it's all or nothing with your ego tripping
Everybody's looking for a Sunday mission
Ain't nobody searching for a second chance
I'm just looking for a new romance

And all it's all or nothing with your ego tripping
Everybody's looking for a Sunday mission
Ain't nobody searching for a second chance
I'm just looking for a new romance

Because you're too serious
You're gonna make me delirious
Because you're too serious for

Losing, losing, losing and I'm feeling lucent
Everybody's losing and there's no one choosing
Ain't nobody searching for a second chance
I'm just looking for a new romance

Because you're too serious
You're gonna make me delirious
Because you're too serious for me

Because you're too serious
You're gonna make me delirious
Because you're too serious
You're gonna make me delirious
Because you're too serious for me
