I was sleeping, gently napping when I heard the phone
Who is on the other end talking, am I even home?
Did you see what she did to him, did you hear what they said?
Just a New York conversation rattling in my head
Ooh my, and what shall we wear, ooh my, and who really cares?
Just a New York conversation, gossip all of the time
"Did you hear who did what to whom?", happens all the time
Who has touched and who has dabbled hear in the city of shows
Openings, closings, badrap party - everybody knows
Ooh, how sad and why do we call, ooh I'm glad to hear from you all
I am calling, yes I am calling just to speak to you
For I know this night will kill me, if I can't be with you
If I can't be with you
