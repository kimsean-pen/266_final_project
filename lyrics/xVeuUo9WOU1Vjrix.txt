I can hear your thoughts
Please don't leave now
I can't sleep alone
Chasing the light until the dawn

Thought we left a trail
Back to the way that it was
I can see it now
In your eyes you let it fall

Running in a crypt
Of a thousand words
Hiding in the dark

Where the violence starts

Looking for a star
We've gone too far
Too far
Don't hide in the dark

Playing shadow games
Turn out the lights uuu
Time for a change

Cause the devil, he sleeps in your head
Don't hide in the dark
Playing shadow games
Turn out the lights uuu

Didn't you say we would stay
Til we heard the last

Echo, echo, echo
Look into my eyes
Do you see something to defend?
Spinning in the lights

Will I grow old before I die?
Silence is a curse
I feel it breaking the ice
I can see it now

In your eyes you let it fall
Running in a crypt
Of a thousand words
Hiding in the dark
Where the violence starts

Looking for a star
We've gone too far
Too far
Don't hide in the dark
Playing shadow games

Turn out the lights uuu
Time for a change
Cause the devil sleeps in your head
Don't hide in the dark
Playing shadow games
Turn out the lights uuu
Didn't you say we would stay
Til we heard the last
Echo, echo, echo
yeah yeah ah huh ah huh way a way oh
You got to be the star
turn off the darling lights
The dark is on your side
You got to beat it
