How to be unfaithful?
How to be disgraceful?
To lose yourself, to lose control
Fall off the fence, fire and soul
To lose yourself, to lose control
Fall off the fence, where is your fire and soul?

I'll wait for you forever
I'll wait for you forever
I'll take you to my grave

Now in the beginning
How the room was spinning?
Hold on to me, hold on to you, hold on to us is what we'll do
Hold on to me, hold on to you, hold on to us is what we'll do

I'll wait for you forever
I'll wait for you forever
I'll take you to my grave (grave)

Hu-hu-hu, hu-hu-hu, hu-hu-hu
Hu-hu-hu, hu-hu-hu, hu-hu-hu

I'll wait for you forever
I'll wait for you forever
I'll wait for you forever
I'll wait for you forever

To lose yourself, to lose control
Fall off the fence, fire and soul
To lose yourself, to lose control
Fall off the fence, where is your fire and soul?
