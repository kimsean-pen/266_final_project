Why, do you care what people think
Are you hooked up to their leash?
You know, anklebiters!
Ate up your personality
Try, to remember how it felt
To just make up your own steps
And let anklebiters!
Chew up, and spit out someone else

And fall in love with yourself

Because
Someday
You're gonna be the only one you've got
Someday
You're gonna be the only one you've got
Why you wanna please the world
And leave yourself to drop dead?
Someday
You're gonna be the only one you've got

What, but do you actually expect
A broken mirror to reflect?
You know, anklebiters!
Gave you a false perception
Why do I defend your ignorance (Come on, come on)
Oh why do I defend the state you're in (Come on, come on)
You should, fall in love with yourself
Oh again
Fall in love with yourself

Because
Someday you're gonna be the only one you've got
Someday
You're gonna be the only one you've got
Why you wanna please the world
And leave yourself to drop dead?
Someday you're gonna be the only one you've got

Anklebiters!
Anklebiters!
(Someday you're gonna be alone!)
Anklebiters!
Anklebiters!
