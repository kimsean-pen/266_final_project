Mum said no to Disneyland
And Dad loves the church
Hallelujah, Oh, Oh

And the boys chew lego
So now we can't build castles or robots
Cause the pieces don't fit together

So look left and look right, cross the road but hold my hand
Look left and look right, cross the road just hold my hand
And we'll hold on, and we'll hold on

Only one, where once stood four
And closest to the kitchen floor
Family favourite

Today we learn't
That screaming are we there yet
Doesn't get you there any faster

So look left and look right, cross the road but hold my hand
Look left and look right, cross the road just hold my hand
And we'll hold on, and we'll hold on
Cross the roads and say goodbye
Cross the roads there wasn't a dry eye
You cross the road and say goodbye
There wasn't a dry eye, cross the road wasn't
A dry eye, there wasn't a dry eye!
