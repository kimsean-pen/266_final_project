Turn around
Stand up like a man and look me in the eye
Turn around
Take one final look at what you left behind
Then walk away
From the greatest lover you have ever known
Yes walk away
You're telling me you can make it on your own
By yourself all alone without my help
Mister you just made a big mistake

You think you are a man
You think you are a man but you are only a boy
You think you are a man you are only a toy
You think you are a man but you just couldn't see
You were not man enough to satisfy me

Shut the door
Take a look around and tell me what you find
Shut the door
Take a giant step for you and all mankind
Then don't come back
I always gave you so much than you deserve
No don't come back
'cause no one makes a fool of me
You've got a nerve to walk away
Mark the words I'm gonna say
Mister you just made a big mistake

You think you are a man
You think you are a man but you are only a boy
You think you are a man you are only a toy
You think you are a man but you just couldn't see
You were not man enough to satisfy me

Mister you just made a big mistake
You think you are a man
You think you are a man but you are only a boy
You think you are a man you are only a toy
You think you are a man but you just couldn't see
You were not man enough to satisfy me

Shut the door
Take a look around and tell me what you find
Shut the door
Take a giant step for you and all mankind
Then don't come back
I always gave you so much than you deserve
No don't come back
'cause no one makes a fool of me
You've got a nerve to walk away
Mark the words I'm gonna say
Mister you just made a big mistake

You think you are a man
You think you are a man but you are only a boy
You think you are a man you are only a toy
You think you are a man but you just couldn't see
You were not man enough to satisfy me
