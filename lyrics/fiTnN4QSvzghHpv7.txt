Oh, I'm stressing, rattling my brain for a feeling that's missing
Oh, I question everything that's taking a weight on my chest
But now undone, giving into the things they want
I'm done with doubt, enough, shutting out all the noise
And all their distractions, no

All I know, I'm outta my head, outta my mind
Doing the whatever makes us lose control just for a night
Try to do the city lights

(2)
Look inside for what you think, either way, you'll break it free
Who needs sleep when we're the one we all feed
I'm thinkin' lately it's been hard to see
Under pressure, I'm on the edge, let it take control
shutting out all the noise and all their distractions

(Interlude)
Dangerous, stay stay out of reach
Feel the earth beneath our feet
Chasing things we cannot see
Nothing's ever what it seems

(Bridge x2)
Searching for another way
Truth is hard to find these days
Chasing things we cannot see
Nothing's ever what it seems
