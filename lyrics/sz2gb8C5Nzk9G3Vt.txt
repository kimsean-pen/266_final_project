Little black dress just walked into the room
Makin' heads turn, can't stop looking at you
It's so right, it's so right, it's so right you know

Little black dress did you come here alone?
It's too late, it's too late, it's too late to go home
It's so right, it's so right, it's so right you know
It's so right, it's so right, it's so right you know

I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me

Little black dress, who you doin' it for?
Little black dress, I can't take anymore
It's not right, it's not right, it's not right you know

Little black dress what's your favourite song?
Little black dress, I won't do you no harm
It's so right, it's so right, it's so right you know
It's so right, it's so right, 'cause I'll take you home

I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me

I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me

I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me
