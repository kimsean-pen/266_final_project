Derelict flow running, motherfuckers always hating on something.
Took a small break to fill up my plate 'cause all of this running 'round got me hungry.
Tell 'em I'm back, chillin' my glass, ain't no need to be panicked.
Soon as I knock this back Imma rock that ass like 'stop' (goddammit).
Skinny Bones Jones with immaculate flow (didn't even know that he could rap like that, though) Yeah, well who's the asshole that told you I had to rap slow, point 'em out.
I stepped into my future, blocked out that noise, and I came back with a vengeance like I'm Bruce Willis on 'roids.
Tell me now, who's got that smooth shit, sipping on some Leford, and I walked out of that smoke cloud with my game tight and on point

I'm feeling real good right now, yeah, I'm feeling real fine (and a little drunk).
I'm feeling real good right now, yeah, I'm feeling real fine (and a lot drunk).
So if they ask about me...

Ooh, tell 'em what I does, tell 'em what I do.
Eeh, tell 'em where I is, tell 'em where I be.
I'm feeling real good right now, yeah, tell 'em what I do.
I'm feeling real good right now, yeah, tell 'em what I do, fuck you

Man boys, it is colder than a witch's titty face-down in the snow in a brass bra but this beat makes me feel like I'm tongue-fucking a margarita

Yo, keeping my cool running, everybody's always mad about something.
Figured if that's the way that it is then I ain't got time to worry about nothing.
Tell 'em I'm back and try to relax.
You can go ahead and be honest, kid.
This shit here has to run it back home like 'stop' (oh shit).
Sippin' on a little bit of Templeton (what's the big deal about Templeton) Picture what it's like to get head on top of a pile of Benjamins, it's like that, but better.
Walked out of that mic booth, hopped onto that stage, and I came back to go batshit on these jokers like I'm Bruce Wayne.
Tell 'em now who got that smooth shit jumping off of my page.
You talk like I've been listening but I'm too buzzed to be phased

I'm feeling real good right now, yeah, I'm feeling real fine (and a little drunk).
I'm feeling real good right now, yeah, I'm feeling real fine (and a lot drunk).

Ooh, tell 'em what I does, tell 'em what I do.
