Cracks in your phone screen
Touch yourself while you text me
Tastes like morphine when you're
Calling at 4 in the morning
You know where I'm at, hit me right back
Got the key under the mat
I'ma rev on the gas like dat
Put it down on that ass like dat, yeah
I don't wanna be tied
Down to your love
I just wanna be tied up
I ain't tryna sip wine
I want ya liquor filling up my cup
My phone is buzzing
But I see that it's two on two
You're catching feelings
So I'ma hang up on you
Yeah
Hung up on you
Yeah
Pills in the morning
You cause a fuss, I ignore it
Talk is boring, yeah
Shut your mouth, I'm recording
Got her looking outside, hundred and five
You know you can't stay the night
It's a hell of a vibe alright
I'ma push it and drive all night, yeah
I don't wanna be tied
Down to your love
I just wanna be tied up
I ain't tryna sip wine
I want ya liquor filling up my cup
My phone is buzzing
But I see that it's two on two
You're catching feelings
So I'ma hang up on you
Yeah
Hung up on you
Yeah
I don't wanna be tied
Down to your love
I just wanna be tied up
