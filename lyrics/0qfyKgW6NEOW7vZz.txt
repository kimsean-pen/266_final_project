Daylight come
Daylight go
How far will it reach
Ain't nobody know
When the dawn breaks
The cradle will fall
And down come baby
Cradle and all
Now I know you need the dark
Just as much as the sun
But you signin' on forever
When you ink it in blood

A. E. I. O. U. E. I. O. U. A. E. I. O. U. I.

I used the state of the art
Tech-nology
Supposed to make for better living
Are we better human beings?
We've got out wires all crossed
Our tubes are all tied
And I'm straining to remember
Just what it means to be alive
A life worth living
Now you can feel it in your chest
Buildin like little bullets
Just building up the nest
And you build it up strong
And you fill it up with love
And you pray for good rain
All from the lord above

A. E. I. O. U. E. I. O. U. A. E. I. O. U. I.

I sued my state of the art
Tech-nology
Now don't you forget it
It ain't using me
Cause when the? goes out
I got?
Cause the? goin' out
...the power's goin' out
I mean it, the power's goin' out
I really mean it the powers goin' out
