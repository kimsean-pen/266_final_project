What d'you wanna do
When ur speed dial hollering
079 4am rude boy ting
I can keep you up put you down If I want to
Tell me what's good
Still around Guess I like you
Keep me on the line I'll catch you out if I feel to
Never one to start it up walk away you need to
Catch me on your mind
Leaving scraps for you to figure out
Turnin in ur sleep shit is weak clear your mind now
Ima leave u bitter
Wishing we were never timed out
Say you're really bout it but you call Every night now
Look at me look at you I get down real low
I already figured out
You ain't ready, take it slow
What d'you wanna do

Fiending for your time
And I got it how you like
30 clicks to my house And I'm down for the night
Is it good is it nice gonna come through twice?
Real talk Are you really bout this spice
Say what you want need to hear what's on your mind b

Taught you what you know, now you wanna get rowdy
Nobody watchin but you act up loudly
What do you wanna do
When your speed dial hollering
