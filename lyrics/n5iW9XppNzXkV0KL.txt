Youre de cap side
Youre pendulum
When we already say, its you time
Cover ... you know its your time, youre over the world
And I feel alone, feel
Explain what you see
And Im gonna see you like a pendulum
In your minds, your pendulums
Fortune telling you to say
Its your time
And your wife she says, Ill be know when its your time, over the world
Then I feel no feels
Whispering in every since
And Ill gona see you like a pendulum
Then I feel no feels
Whispering in every since
And Ill gona see you like a pendulum
You face in no fear as I change in this
I gonna see you like a pendulum
So apart, so apart
