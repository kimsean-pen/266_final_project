Turn on water once an hour
Don't forget or the pipes will freeze
Feel something you've never felt once every year
To keep up the belief that life is changing, you are growing

Child sits still hugging father, overhears another voice
Outside on the street with anger, do I really have a choice?
Life is changing, I am growing

It's not fair that you don't love me once you're there
I understand that I am a vacuum and there is light elsewhere

Desert scenes of some serene cowboyish man producing steam
The ocean grows and flies recede they know the waves remain unseen
Remain unseen

It's not fair that you don't love me once you're there
I understand that I am a vacuum and there is light elsewhere
