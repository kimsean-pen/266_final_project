All that I see
Show me your ways
Teach me to meet my desires
With some grace

All that I fear, don't turn away
And leave me to plead
In this hole of a place
What if I never break
Estuary won't you take me
Far away, far away

All that I seek
Please police me
I want you to police me
But keep it clean

Now that you meet my day
Now let's take them away
(That's why I hold you)
Strong as you've seen

Old as you behave
(That's why I hold you)
You will always obey
(That's why I hold you)

All that I feel, capital ways
Teach me to grieve and conspire
With my age

All that I can see
A gold mystic spree
A seething routine
I could never navigate
Maybe I like to stray

No harm it seems to be less so free, not today
It's like you want it that way

All that I see
Is peaceful eyes drawn away from me
Drawn away from me

We would like to take the sights
(That's why I hold you)
And bring silence in disguise
(That's why I hold you, dear)

We would like to meet the buyer
(That's why I hold you)
That is on your life

That's why I hold you
That's why I hold you
That is why I hold you
That's why I hold you
That is why I hold you, dear

That's why I hold you
That's why I hold you, dear
That's why I hold you
That's why I hold you, dear

That's why I hold you
That is why I hold you, dear
That's why I hold you
That is why I hold you, dear

That's why I hold you
That is why I hold you, dear
That's why I hold you
That is why I hold you, dear

That's why I hold you
That is why I hold you, dear
That's why I hold you
