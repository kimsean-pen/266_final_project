The guilty and us alike
All fall in the big one
A new spring
Man to maker

Martyr
The given
Dogs killing for theirs
You scorch the earth before you
Roam the waste like ants under duress
Men dot the skies above you
To scorch the earth before you

Off grid and off line
We all fall in the big one
A new spring
Man to maker
God delusion
And it won't take much to get the rest of us

Martyr
The given
Dogs killing for theirs
You scorch the earth before you
Roam the waste like ants under duress
Men dot the skies above you
To scorch the earth before you

Nothing
Post collapse
Dust to dust
Burn you
Gas you
Watch you
Dust to dust
Nothing
A new spring
Dust to dust
Man to maker

Martyr
The given
Dogs killing for theirs
Dogma paves the way
And in its wake
Find superstition
Down the barrel of a gun
Man to maker
God delusion
They'll send us all to meet them
