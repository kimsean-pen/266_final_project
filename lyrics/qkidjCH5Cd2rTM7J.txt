Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la

When the day is dawning,
On a Texas Sunday Morning
How I long to be there
With Marie who's waiting for me there
Every lonely city
Where i hang my hat
Ain't as half as pretty,
As where my baby's at

Is this the way to Amarillo?
Every night I've been hugging my pillow
Dreaming dreams of Amarillo
And sweet Marie who waits for me
Show me the way to Amarillo
I've been weeping like a willow
Crying over Amarillo
And sweet Marie who waits for me

Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
And Marie who waits for me

There's a church bell ringing
With a song of joy that its singing
For the sweet Maria
And the guy who's coming to see her
Just beyond the highway
There's an open plain and it keeps me going
Through the wind and rain

Is this the way to Amarillo?
Every night I've been hugging my pillow
Dreaming dreams of Amarillo
And sweet Marie who waits for me
Show me the way to Amarillo
I've been weeping like a willow
Crying over Amarillo and sweet Marie who waits for me

Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
And Marie who waits for me

Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
And Marie who waits for me...
