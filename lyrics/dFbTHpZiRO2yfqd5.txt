Pillars supporting sky crumble
Sun moon the stars pour down
Rivers and oceans rush where the earth sinks
Great conflagration quenched by raging flood

North and south polars
Counterchange
Screaming world
Turning over
Sky makes war with the earth
Fragments fall down

And the darkness that follows

Rent
In great
Chasms

Tachylite lava from the abyss
Turn into a pillar of vapour
Great heat boil the sea
Death of a continent

Enormous surge of water
Wipe out humanity

Coming of ice
A cataclysmic flood
Destroys the advanced
Mankind of high tech age

Wall of water
Sweep across the earth

Wall of water
Fossilize all
