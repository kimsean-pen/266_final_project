I am trudging through
My confident host
I feel sedated
Subdued
Seduced by the numbness
So I look to both my mother and father
So entranced by religion
And the thought of the world ending
Oh I look to you my love
I thought you knew better
You keep taking the drug
Yeah I'm reaching for a hem in the sky
Asked so many
Question
No reply
Won't you help me out?

You've gotta help me out
Lost in a crowd

Am I a fountain of loss?
Just a well of empty thought?
Feel like a cloud bearing no rain
And is my time here in vain?
I'm reaching for a hem
