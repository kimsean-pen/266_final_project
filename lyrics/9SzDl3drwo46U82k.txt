Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Huh

Every morning I wake up to find
I always dream the same
Every night I come to my window
When you call my name

But the way the words you say
Just fall like rain
Till I'm drowning in the sound
Of your invitation

When you ask, "Do you wanna dance
My barefoot Cinderella?
Don't need no slippers or a party dress
The way you're lookin' right now's what I like the best"

And then you say, "Do you wanna take a chance
And stay with me forever?
No one will ever be more beautiful
My barefoot, barefoot Cinderella"
Yeah, oh

A dream world is always perfect
But that's not my real life
Wish you did but you don't know
The me I am inside

I pray that you'll come lookin'
And I won't hide
I'll be smiling when you find me
'Cause I've been waiting
For you ask, "Do you wanna dance
My barefoot Cinderella?

Don't need no slippers or a party dress
The way you're lookin' right now's what I like the best"
And then you say, "Do you wanna take a chance
And stay with me forever?

No one will ever be more beautiful
My barefoot, barefoot Cinderella"
When I close my eyes it starts, yeah
Like a movie for my heart

Here comes my favorite part
Yeah, yeah, oh
When you ask, "Do you wanna dance
My barefoot Cinderella?

Don't need no slippers or a party dress
You're what I like the best", and then you
Say, "Do you wanna take a chance?
Stay with me forever

No one will ever be more beautiful
Cinderella"
When you ask, "Do you wanna dance
My barefoot Cinderella?

Don't need no slippers or a party dress
The way you're lookin' right now's what I like the best"
And then you say, "Do you wanna take a chance
Stay with me forever?
No one will ever be more beautiful
My barefoot, my barefoot Cinderella"
"Do you wanna dance
My barefoot Cinderella?
Don't need no slippers or a party dress
The way you're lookin' right now's what I like the best"
And then you say, "Do you wanna take a chance
Stay with me forever?
No one will ever be more beautiful
My barefoot"
