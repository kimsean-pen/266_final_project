No is a dirty word
Never gonna say it first
No is just a thought that never
Crosses my mind

Maybe in the parking lot
Better bring your friend along
Better off together
Than just one at a time

S is for the simple need
E is for the ecstasy
X is just to mark the spot
'cause that's the one you really want

(Yes!) Sex is always the answer
It's never a question
'cause the answer's yes
Oh the answer's (Yes)
Not just a suggestion
If you ask a question
Then it's always yes

I'm loving what you wanna wear
I wonder what's up under there?
Wonder if I'll ever
Have it under my tongue?

I'll love to try to set you free
I love you all over me
Love to hear the sound you make
The second you're done

S is for the simple need
E is for the ecstasy
X is just to mark the spot
Cause that's the one you really want

(Yes!) Sex is always the answer
It's never a question
'cause the answer's yes
Oh the answer's (Yes)
Not just a suggestion
If you ask a question
Then it's always yes (YES)
Yeeeeeeeah, yeeeah, yeah
Yeeeeeeeah, yeeeah, yeah
Yeeeeeeeah, yeeeah, yeah
Yeeeeeeeah, yeeeah, yeah
