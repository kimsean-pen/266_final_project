Turning in the grain again
the bells begin to chime

Time, she says,
"there's no turning back,
keep your eyes on the tracks"
through the fields, somewhere there's blue
oh, time will tell, she'll see us through

Howling out,
the windy hills
and all the time we took
you should know just how it steals
keep your hand on the wheel
and through it all, somewhere we knew
time will tell, she'll see us through

And all fire and flames took all we trust
we're kicking up dust
stations fade just like they do
oh, time will tell, we always knew

Oh, time will tell, we always knew
