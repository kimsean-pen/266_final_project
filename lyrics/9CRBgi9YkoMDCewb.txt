My divorce from dependence
That's when you found me
I was still soft
And we always were in trouble
Odds stacked against us
And trouble's what we are

We get so far
And then it just starts rewinding
And the same old song
We're playing it again
Suspension without suspense

Now that I've murdered your inspiration
And I forced you off
Do you hate me
Do you want revenge
I want to call you
But I won't

We get so far
And then it just starts rewinding
And the same old song
We're playing it again
Suspension without suspense

Oh the pessimistic protection plan
Moderation loving
I've been hardened by the circumstance
We knew this was coming

We get so far
And then it just starts rewinding
And the same old song
We're playing it again
Suspension without suspense

We get so far
And then it just starts rewinding
And the same old song
We're playing it again and again
Suspension without suspense
Intentions without intent
But I don't want the love we have to end
