My body's covered in fat
Skin is covered in black ink
My head is a million men
My ego's beginning to shrink
The world never seemed so big
How did come to this
How did it turn into more drinking, sinking
When all that I ever wanted Was less thinking
All that I ever wanted was less thinking

Everything was fine
Yet I wanted more, more, more
Now I can't rewind
To the way things were before
Living lies and a bluff
And acting like I should
It's all out of love
I don't wanna scare or hurt

Burden of the Captain
He gets all the fame
Everybody distracted
And attracted to a name
But as everything slips by
He must stay with his ship
Looking out for the tribe
And missing all the trip

Burden of the Captain
More, more, more.
Burden of the Captain
Aaahh-ahhh Aaahh-ahhh Aaaaahhh

Skin is covered in black ink
Ego's beginning to shrink
World never seemed so big
How did it turn into more drinking, sinking
When all that I ever wanted was less thinking
All that I ever wanted was less thinking

Everything was fine
Yet I wanted more, more, more
Now I can't rewind
To the way things were before
Living lies and a bluff
And acting like I should
It's all out of love
I don't wanna scare or hurt

Burden of the Captain
More, more, more
Burden of the Captain
Aaahhh-ahhh
