Fallen, fallen, Babylon the great
Summon the 4 horsemen, devils incarnate
Vatican demanding, punishment divine
Drink the blood of sinners, spirits of the Christ

Paying for indulgence
Righteous cowards crawling
The age of consequence
Look how the mighty have fallen

Fallen, fallen, Jesus dogs of war
Hunting the Orion, starlight as a claw
Kings with crowns of burden weighs down on his head
Duty drives in purpose, prophecies are read

Paying for indulgence
Righteous cowards crawling
The age of consequence
Look how the mighty have fallen

Fallen, fallen, revelations curse
Mother of all harlots, bleeding bad to worse
With the flesh of prophets, sorcery undone
Unicorns to mystify, Illuminates won

Paying for indulgence
Righteous cowards crawling
The age of consequence
Look how the mighty have fallen

Paying for indulgence
Righteous cowards crawling
The age of consequence
Look how the mighty have fallen
