Soft skin,
you touch me within and so I know I could be human once again.
I know your face holds something that could consume you completely.
Soft skin,
you touch me once again and somehow it stings
'cause I know it is the end
I hate that you're leaving, so why don't you talk to me?
You act like nothing ever happened but it meant the world to me.

And you can't, and you can't see the wind in the trees.
And you can't, and you can't see the wind in the leaves,
and you can't, and you can't see the weight in the dark.
And you can't, and you can't see the weight in the heart.
(These were our ...).

Soft skin.
I'll have you be near my heart until I feel human.
Soft skin, oh.
You were never in love to begin with so now I'm suffering.

Oh you can't, and you can't see the wind in the trees.
And you can't, and you can't see the wind in the leaves.
And you can't, and you can't see the weight in the dark.
And you can't, and you see the weight in the heart.
(These were our...).

Soft skin,
you touch me within and so I know I could be human once again.
I know your face holds something that could consume you completely.
Soft skin,
you touch it once again and somehow it stings
'cause I know it is end.
I hate that you're leaving so why don't you talk to me?
