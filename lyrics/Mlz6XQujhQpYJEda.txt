Make waves, make waves, I'm sea
it's all you can take
come back, back down, now I'm drifting away

away

your ship's sunk It's gone down, now your captain is dead
your saints become sailors when my ocean is fed
by these bloody waters, mark my words
come on

Alright I want you all to clap along and sing with me

when I said I'd fight back
I didn't say that I'd fight fair
I said I'd fight back
I didn't say that I'd fight fair
I said I'd fight back
I didn't say that I'd fight fair
I said I'd fight back
I didn't say that I'd fight fair

salt your eyes

sleep with all the fishes
the waves start the flood thats drowning yourself

broken, then we'll salt your eyes
no wind, this sound
waves, make waves, back down
stop drifting away, come back, come back
it's all you can take
we'll pour salt in your eyes
we'll pour salt in your eyes
I said I'd fight back
I didn't say that I'd fight fair
I said I'd fight back
I didn't say that I'd fight fair
