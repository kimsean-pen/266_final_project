The promise of love
It came from my heart
Thought all that we shared
Would last forever

So where did things go wrong
What happened that made things fall apart
Why I just don't know it's so hard to let go
Of someone I used to call my own

But I'll find a way
I'll get over you one day
I'll find a way
I'm gonna deal with all this pain

I'll, I'll find a way
'Cause I know that somewhere
My soul mate is waiting for me
Gonna make it through the day
I'll find a way

Silence gets so intense
Without you to share a word
I really miss your presence
This loneliness feels awkward

But I won't call you I refuse
I'd rather lay here by myself in the dark
Crying my heart out I wish these tears could erase
All the memories of you but they can't

But I'll find a way
I'll get over you one day, oh
I'll find a way
I'm gonna deal with all this pain, yeah

I'll find a way
'Cause I know that somewhere
My soul mate is waiting for me
Gonna make it through the day, woh woh

'Cause what hurts today in time will fade away
When you told me good-bye, oh I felt so betrayed
Find the courage to move on
'Cause one day I'll replace the precious love I lost
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

I'll find a way, yes I will, I'll find a way
I'm gonna be strong move on
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'll find a way, baby I'll find a way
Gonna make it through the day
I'll find a way, yeah yeah yeah
I'll be okay
