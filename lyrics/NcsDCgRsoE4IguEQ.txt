The heat it drowned itself and all the roads
With rattles from all the pubs and pokies room
Sound never goes
They'd given up the workers life
For a moment it was clear and so precise
And I'll say

I don't mind
I don't care
I'll just say whatever
I don't mind
We don't care
We'll be here forever
And we don't mind
And we don't care
We'll be here forever
Cause I

Burnt my life and I branded my soul
Went to church and sung to a god
And it breaks my heart
This is the place where it starts
Cause it's this burnt life and its great payed world
Four wheel drives, this peaceful moment
I'll say it again
Whatever happened to you my friend?
And I'll say

I don't mind
I don't care
I'll just say whatever
We don't mind
We don't care
We'll be here forever

It's the truth that keeps you warm
And lets you fall down
Like soda it will pop
Yeah let it fall down
Cause I

Went to the pokies, a dead friends game
Stayed in a pub and drink warm beer
And I'll say thank you
For all the greetings and gratitude
Cause we don't play enough but we never shut up
Talk to computers and made up drugs
And I'll say it again
Whatever happened to you my friends?
And I'll say

I don't mind
I don't care
I'll just say whatever
We don't mind
We don't care
We'll be here forever

It's the truth that keeps you warm
And lets you fall down
Like soda it will pop
Yeah let it fall down
Let it fall down
Let it go
