All the girls in the bathroom talkin
Who they gonna take to the Sadie Hawkins
My ears are burnin but I kept on walkin
Smile on my face and an air guitar rockin

The Sadie Hawkins Dance
In my khaki pants
There's nothin better
Oh oh oh
The girls ask the guys
It's always a surprise
There's nothin better
Baby do you like my sweater?

Sittin in the back of my next class nappin
Gotta give a speech then bow to the clappin
Told a funny joke got the whole class laughin
Think I got a tan from the light which I was baskin

The Sadie Hawkins Dance
In my khaki pants
There's nothin better
Oh oh oh
The girls ask the guys
It's always a surprise
There's nothin better
Baby do you like my sweater?

Scan the cafeteria for some good seating
I found a good spot by the cheerleaders eating
The quarterback asked me if I'd like a beating
I said that's one thing I won't be needing
And since I'm rather smart and cunning
I took off down the next hall running
Only to get stopped by a girl so stunning
Only to get stopped by a girl so stunning?
She said, "You're smooth, and good with talkin
You go with me to the Sadie Hawkins"

The Sadie Hawkins Dance
In my khaki pants
There's nothin better
Oh oh oh
The girls ask the guys
It's always a surprise
There's nothin better
Baby do you like my sweater?

The Sadie Hawkins Dance
In my khaki pants
There's nothin better
Oh oh oh
The girls ask the guys
It's always a surprise
There's nothin better
Baby do you like my sweater?
