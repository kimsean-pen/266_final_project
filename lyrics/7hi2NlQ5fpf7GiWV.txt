Where did all the people go?
they got scared when the lights went low
I get you through it nice and slow when the world's spinning out of control
Afraid of what they might lose
might get scraped or they might get bruised
You can beg on what's the use
that's why it's called the moment of truth

I'll get it if you need it
I'll search if you don't see it
You're thirsty, I'll be your rain
You get hurt, I'll take your pain

I know you don't believe it
But i said it and i still mean it
When you heard what i told you
When you get worried I'll be your soldier

Funny when times get hard
At the last moment when it's supposed to charge
We are always on the longest yard
Oh they feel their feet get cold
Hiding here, hiding there
Find them underneath the stairs
People hiding everywhere
Trying to be still as a stone

I'll get it if you need it
I'll search if you can't see it
You're thirsty, I'll be your rain
You get hurt, I'll take your pain

I know you don't believe it
But i said it and i still mean it
When you heard what i told you
When you get worried I'll be your soldier

My aim is so true
I wanna show you
I'll try forever
I'm never gonna say "surrender"

I'll get it if you need it
I'll search if you can't see it
You're thirsty, I'll be your rain
You get hurt, I'll take your pain

I know you don't believe it
But i said it and i still mean it
When you heard what i told you
When you get worried I'll be your soldier
I'll be your soldier
I'll be, oh I'll be your soldier
I'll be a soldier
