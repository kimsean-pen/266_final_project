Black bird in the morning sun, cast a shadow on the white (?)
She's a suspect on the run, looking for an alibi
It's too late, it's too late, she's a runaway
It's too late, it's too late, she's a runaway

Closer to the heart of time, the present becomes the past
Counts the (?) in the (?) 'til the first becomes the last
It's too late, it's too late, she's a runaway
It's too late, it's too late, she's a runaway

She is free,
Yes, she is free
No more names, no more labels, can be hung
She is free
Yes, she is free
No more pain, no more sorrows to be sung
Ahhh, she's a runaway

The journey has only just begun
Dreams, they cling to her bones
The (?) in the arc of the sun, she's so far away from home

It's too late, it's too late, she's a runaway
It's too late, it's too late, she's a runaway
It's too late, it's too late, she's a runaway
It's too late, it's too late, she's a runaway
