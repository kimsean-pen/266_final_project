My eyes roll back
The ceiling fades
I breathe you in, exalt your flames
Let's lose our minds
Come here to me

We're wasting time,
Darling, can you hear me?
Heroine, my sweetest sin
I can't seem to get enough
Pull me under
Wake me up
Feel the rush
Morphine lover, make me numb

Make it so I can't get up
Paper-thin till you sink in
Could you be my heroine?
Do you feel exposed?
Let your feelings show
Can I taste you, can I replace you?
I need to know
Let's lose our minds

Please stay with me
We're wasting yeah, we're wasting time
Why don't you believe me?
Heroine, my sweetest sin
I can't seem to get enough
Pull me under
Wake me up
Feel the rush

Morphine lover, make me numb
Make it so I can't get up
Paper-thin till you sink in,
Could you be my heroine?
It starts with the spins, yeah you got me swimming in

I'm falling to pieces, and I won't be whole
Until you let me in
Until you let me in
Until you let me in
Until you let me in oh
Heroine, my sweetest sin
I can't seem to get enough
Pull me under

Wake me up
Feel the rush
Morphine lover, make me numb
Make it so I can't get up
Paper-thin till you sink in,
Could you be my heroine?
My heroine,
My heroine,
Could you be my heroine?
