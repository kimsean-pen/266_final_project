Amado mío, love me forever
And let forever, begin tonight
Amado mío, when we're together
I'm in a dream world of sweet delight

Many times I've whispered
"Amado mío"
It was just a phrase, that I heard in plays
I was acting a part

But now when I whisper
"Amado mío"
Can't you tell I care, by the feeling there
'Cause it comes from my heart

I want you ever
I love my darling
Wanting to hold you
And hold you tight

Amado mío
Love me forever
And let forever
Begin tonight

Many times I've whispered
"Amado mío"
It was just a phrase, that I heard in plays
I was acting a part

But now when I whisper
"Amado mío"
Can't you tell I care, by the feeling there
'Cause it comes from my heart

I want you ever
I love my darling
Wanting to hold you
And hold you tight

Amado mío
Love me forever
And let forever
Begin tonight

And let forever
Begin tonight
And let forever
Begin tonight
