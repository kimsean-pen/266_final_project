A mind lost within its own self
Existing to feed its hunger
Your body hollowed empty shell
Awaiting feed of the ages

Darkness will cover the mind
Casting a shade on reasoning
Immolation of the human self
Conflagration of the ego

Burn in your own hell
Life: grand holding cell

Two become as one
One become a slave
Burn the eye to blind
Keeping truth from mind
Breathe in the life
Breathe in the lie

No longer are you human
Just a leech of the addiction
Loathing till insanity
Mental deterioration

Burn in your own hell
Life: grand holding cell
To destroy the faith
In humanity
Burn the eye to blind
Keeping truth from mind
Breathe in the life
Breathe in the lie

Life shell-shocks your empty shell
Hatred for those privileged, unlike you
You think you will win
But you can't face the system of self destruction

Life skins mind, bleeding dry
Hatred for the self and the life

To destroy the faith
In humanity
Burn the eye to blind
Keeping truth from mind
Breathe in the life
Breathe in the lie
Burn the eye to blind
Keeping truth from mind
