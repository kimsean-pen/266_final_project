Left behind when the summer's over
In quiet lineups by the lake
Cheating hearts descend like clouds of falling leaves
To lie and rot and wait for rain

Summer heat
Will you drain your blood from me?
Into lawns and limpid pools
Where your kiss was young and cruel
Cut by cut and play by play
It will always be this way
Summer love, summer love, summer love

If I could only hold your heart
And never beat again
And never beat again

Someone's breath against your shoulder
Someone's voice to say your name
Just as long as someone's there to break your fall
Longer shadows, shorter days

Summer heat
Will you drain your blood from me?
Into lawns and limpid pools
Where your kiss was young and cruel
Cut by cut and play by play
It will always be this way
Summer love, summer love, summer love
Summer love, summer love, summer love
Summer love, summer love, summer love

If I could only hold your heart
And never beat again
And never beat again
If I could only hold your heart
And never beat again
And never beat again
If I could only hold your heart
And never beat again
And never beat again
