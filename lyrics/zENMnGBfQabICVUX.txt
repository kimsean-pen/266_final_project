Into the fire
You watched me burn
Living in shadows
I had so much to learn
Taking my chances
I place my bets
No overthinking
No time to have regrets

Go for the gold
And don't look back

Oh! I've been drowning in the crowd
You try and bring me down
But oh no
Oh oh no
Oh oh no
There's no stopping me...
Now! I've found a way to stand my ground
I'm finally ready for my solo
My solo, my solo
Gonna let you go

People around us
Don't understand
Nobody out there
To give a helping hand
Everything changes
When you decide
To step in the spotlight
And leave the pas behind

Go for the gold
And don't look back
No apology

Oh! I've been drowning in the crowd
You try and bring me down
But oh no
Oh oh no
Oh oh no
There's no stopping me...
Now! I've found a way to stand my ground
I'm finally ready for my solo
My solo, my solo
Gonna let you go

Go!
Gonna let you go
You don't run the show
Go!
Gonna let you go!

You've been telling me
You'll change
For all my life
Say 'goodbye' cause now it's too late
It's too late!

Go! I've been drowning in the crowd
You try and bring me down
But oh no
Oh oh no
Oh oh no
There's no stopping me...
Now! I've found a way to stand my ground
I'm finally ready for my solo
My solo, my solo
Gonna let you go

Go!
Gonna let you go
You don't run the show
Go!
Gonna let you go!

Go!
Gonna let you go
You don't run the show
Go!
Gonna let you go!
