Right now I'm on 10%
Room spins
Got the Hen in my blood
Like insulin
Sugar I'm up
Dancing still
Every chance that I get
Did it big like a Texas whip
And that right there on the reel
Direct in the cut
Tryna heal, rollin' cloraphly
Most praises to the lord, yeah
They can't whitewash my head
Never fold for the L'oreal
Blkswn
Nigga fuck swine
They ain't did shit, but take mine
Lately life done been a bad clock
So I just really need a good time

Hadda tell lil' ma
Au revoir
Before bonjour
If she don't cha cha
Smi no concur
Miss honey dijon
Gimme a reason
To take a lil' intermission

I need a little breather
Little ventilation
A million degrees
I got the heat stroke waitin'
When everybody leave
And it's just finally you and me
Ya best believe
I pledge allegiance to the juice box, baby
Oooh
I got a hemi in the stick shift
Power power
Hittin' hunnit and 6 miles an hour
Speeding to money
And money speedin' up to problems
I need a break, gimme silence

Blkswn, nigga, fuck swine
They ain't did shit but take mine
Lately life done been a broke clock
Broke clock
I really need a good time
I hadda tell lil' ma
Au revoir
Before bonjour
If she don't cha cha
Then Smi no concur
Miss honey dijon
Gimme a reason
To take a lil' intermission
I need a little breather
Little ventilation
A million degrees
I got the heat stroke waitin'
When everybody leave
And it's just finally you and me
Ya best believe
I pledge allegiance to the juice box, baby
Oooh
I got a hemi in the stick shift
Power power
Hittin' hunnit and 6 miles an hour
Speeding to money
And money speedin' up to problems
I need a break, gimme silence
