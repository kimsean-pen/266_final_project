Me not working hard?
Yeah, right! Picture that with a Kodak
Or better yet, go to Times Square
Take a picture of me with a Kodak
Took my life from negative to positive
I just want y'all know that
And tonight, let's enjoy life
Pitbull, Nayer, Ne-Yo
That's right

Tonight I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know, we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight

Don't care what they say
Or what games they play
Nothing is enough
Till I have your love (Let's do it tonight)
I want you tonight
I want you to stay
I want you tonight

Grab somebody sexy tell 'em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight

Take advantage of tonight
Cause tomorrow I'm off to Dubai to perform for a princess
But tonight
I can make you my queen
And make love to you endless
This is insane, the way the name growin'
Money keep flowin'
Hustlers move aside, so I'm tiptoein'
To keep flowin'
I got it locked up like Lindsay Lohan

Put it on my life baby
I make you feel right baby
Can't promise tomorrow but I promise tonight.
Dale

Excuse me (Excuse me)
But I might drink a little more than I should tonight
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight
And maybe I'm a make you feel so good tonight
Cause we might not get tomorrow

Tonight I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know, we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight

Don't care what they say,
Or what games they play
Nothing is enough
Till I have your love (Let's do it tonight)
I want you tonight
I want you to stay
I want you tonight

Grab somebody sexy tell 'em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight

Reach for the stars and if you don't grab 'em,
At least youd fall on top of the world
Think about it, cuz if you slip
I'm gonna fall on top of you girl,
What i'm involved with is deeper than the mazes
Baby, baby and it ain't no secret
My grammy's from Cuba but I'm an American
And i don't get money like Seacrest.
Put it on my life baby
I make you feel right baby
Can't promise tomorrow
But I promise tonight.
Dale

Excuse me (Excuse me)
But I might drink a little bit more than I should tonight
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight
And baby I'm a make you feel so good tonight
Cause we might not get tomorrow

Tonight I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know, we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight

Don't care what they say
Or what games they play
Nothing is enough
Till I have your love (Let's do it tonight)
I want you tonight
I want you to stay
I want you tonight

Grab somebody sexy tell 'em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight

Excuse me (Excuse me)
But I might drink a little more than I should tonight
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight
And baby I'm a make you feel so good tonight
Cause we might not get tomorrow...
