I steal my cigs from the 76
Smokin' up in church, and up to all my tricks
I'm a bad little angel. I fell from grace
Georgia peach gone bad, yeah, you know the taste, and...
If you must know what I think of you
So help little lord, I'm gonna speak the truth
And I try,
And I try, try, try
And i try
To do right
But I got trouble in mind
(Got trouble in mind)
I got trouble in mind
Got trouble in mind
Born under a bad sign like Albert King
He had the matchbox blues I liked to sing
I'll break your heart, baby for the kicks
I'm a bonafide slacker and I like a quick fix.
I could behave, but what's the use?
So help me lord and I gotta cut loose
And I try,
And I try, try, try
And I try
To do right
But I got trouble in mind
(Got trouble in mind)
I got trouble in mind
Got trouble in mind
Shimmery shake, oh long did I ache
Oh doctor, you gotta give me something for this pain
And I got trouble in mind
Got trouble in mind
Ohoh oh oh oh oh
Ohoh oh oh oh oh
Ohoh oh oh oh oh
And i try, and try
I got to Paris, all the lights went down
They built the Berlin Wall to keep me out
I broke your heart from 30 thousand feet
And post a danger sign every where i sleep
Cause I got trouble in mind
(Got trouble in mind)
I got trouble in mind
But I got trouble in mind
(Got trouble in mind)
I got trouble in mind
Got trouble in mind
Shimmery shake, oh long did I ache
Oh doctor, you gotta give me something for this pain
Shimmery shake, oh long did I ache
Oh doctor, you gotta give me something for this pain
