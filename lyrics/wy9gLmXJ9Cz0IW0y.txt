Take me back to the night, we met in the yard
Climbing up to the roof, hidden in the dark
With a bottle of wine for two
Though I'm already drunk off you
Then we both fell asleep, underneath the stars

We're young and naïve, and you're telling me
That someday we'll run off together
I'm starting to think, I'm stuck in a dream
'Cause we're young, and we don't know better

Now I'm falling heavily, recklessly
Trying not to lose my sensibility
But gravity, it pulls me into you
We're just a couple of kids
We're just a couple of kids
Sneaking out late for a kiss
'Cause we're just a couple of kids

When I'm wrapped in your arms, I never feel a thing
Living life on a whim, it's never a routine
And it's troubling to live this way
When you never know where you'll stay
But we live and we learn, and I wouldn't change a thing

We're young and naïve, and you're telling me
That someday we'll run off together
I'm starting to think, I'm stuck in a dream
'Cause we're young, and we don't know better

Now I'm falling heavily, recklessly
Trying not to lose my sensibility
But gravity, it pulls me into you
We're just a couple of kids
We're just a couple of kids
Sneaking out late for a kiss
'Cause we're just a couple of kids
'Cause we're just a couple of kids

Now I'm falling heavily, recklessly
Trying not to lose my sensibility
But gravity, it pulls me into you
We're just a couple of kids
We're just a couple of kids
Sneaking out late for a kiss
'Cause we're just a couple of kids
