There's no way that I can talk myself out of this one tonight
and there's no way that I can ever win with you.
I've sung the same song. I've sang it for way too long.
And now the melody is finally escaping me.
There's no way that I can talk myself out of this one tonight.
Every one is my last, I swear that this is my last.
By now you should know what to say.
By now you should know all of this by heart,
By now you should know what to say.
