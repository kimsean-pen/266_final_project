What else should i be
all apologies
what else could i say
everyone is gay
what else could i write
i don't have the right
what else should i be
all apologies

in the sun
in the sun i feel as one
in the sun
in the sun

married
buried

I wish i was like you
easily amused
find my nest of salt
everything is my fault
i'll take all the blame
aqua seafoam shame
sunburn with freezerburn
choking on the ashes of her enemy

In the sun
in the sun i feel as one
in the sun
in the sun

i'm married
Buried
married
buried
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All in all is all we all are all in all is all we are
