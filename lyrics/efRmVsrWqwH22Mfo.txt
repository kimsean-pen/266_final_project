Living out my life as though I knew how it was done
I have sat upon many a hillside in the sun
Same old feelings have their way of coming back around
Makes me wonder why I ever bother leaving town

All that time I was trying to be clever
Didn't know that I'd be loving you forever
All the years I spent chasing a meaning
How unfair to have a heart that's still beating
When I can't just love a moment that's fleeting
When I can't just love a moment that's fleeting

How many disasters will it take to make you smile
Haven't seen you laughing at yourself in quite a while
People that you love that never learn how to speak with
Sometimes what you don't gain, it's another kind of gift

All that time I was trying to be clever
Didn't know that I'd be loving you forever
All the years I spent chasing a meaning
How unfair to have a heart that's still beating
How unfair to have a heart that's still beating
How unfair to have a heart that's still beating
