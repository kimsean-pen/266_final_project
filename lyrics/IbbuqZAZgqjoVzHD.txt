Run to your dreaming when you're alone
Unplug the TV and turn off the phone
Get heavy on with digging your ditch
Because I'm digging a ditch where madness gives
Digging a ditch where silence lives
Digging a ditch for when I'm old
Digging a ditch my story's told
Where all these troubles weighing down on me
Run to your dreaming when you're alone
Where all these worries heavy on my heart
Will die
Will die
Will die
Will die
Run to your dreaming when you're alone
Unplug the TV and turn off your phone
Get heavy on with digging your ditch
'Cause I'm digging a ditch where madness gives
Digging a ditch where silence lives
Digging a ditch for when I'm through
Digging this ditch I'm digging for you
Where all these disappointments hanging on me
All these habits heavy at my heart
Will die
