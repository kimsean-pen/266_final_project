See me, I live in a wonder
I'm gonna meet you on the other side
Well, I'm gonna steal your thunder
You'd better run, you'd better hide, aha

I see you, you think you're something
Well you're nothing, you're a butterfly
You've no love, you've no reflection
You'd better run, you'd better hide, aha

Angels, give me shelter
'Cause I'm about to fall
Stone cold, Helter Skelter
I'm not afraid
I'm gonna face you all, aha, aha

Wake up, I'm onto something
You got me shaking and I feel alive
You know me, I'm all or nothing
You'd better run, you'd better hide, aha

Angels, give me shelter
'Cause I'm about to fall
Stone cold, Helter Skelter
I'm not afraid
I'm gonna save you all

I got to stand for something
That's why I'm not standing for you
And I won't fall for no one
That's why I'm not falling for you

We got to stand for something
That's why we're not standing for you
And we won't fall for no one
That's why we're not falling for you

Ain't that something
Ain't that true
Walking someone
Else's shoes

Ain't that something
Ain't that true
Walking someone
Else's shoes
