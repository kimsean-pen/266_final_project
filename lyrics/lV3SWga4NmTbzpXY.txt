This must be the ugliest piece of bread I've ever eaten

This must be the ugliest piece of bread I've ever eaten
Wrapped in a foil-like substance
It's an unidentified object
Shapelessly square

(ジャムでしょ)
I wonder why

God, it's so ugly
(ジャムでしょ)
I wonder why

Maybe the answer lies
(それジャムでしょどぞ)
In the thickness or the size
