We turn it up, we turn it up
We're coming up, we're coming up

Out in the streets I hear the crack of thunder
People keeping low, people searching for some cover
But in my room I hear the sound of trumpets
Meeting me through the field that keeps us in

We turn it up, we turn it up
We don't care what you say
We're coming up, we're coming up
We don't care what you say

We turn it up, we turn it up
We don't care what you say
We're coming up, we're coming up
We don't care what you say

Message to the world
Can you feel the heat is rising?
From the heights of above the storm
Can you see the lightnings flashing?

From where I live
I can hear their voices joining
Like trumpets through
The field they use to keep us in

We turn it up, we turn it up
We don't care what you say
We're coming up, we're coming up
We don't care what you say

We turn it up, we turn it up
We don't care what you say
We're coming up, we're coming up
We don't care what you say

If you're afraid
Fear will only break your heart
If you're afraid
And know your walls will keep them away

We turn it up, we turn it up
We don't care what you say
We're coming up, we're coming up
We don't care what you say

We turn it up, we turn it up
We don't care what you say
We're coming up, we're coming up
We don't care what you say

We turn it up, we turn it up
We don't care what you say
We're coming up, we're coming up
We don't care what you say

We turn it up, we turn it up
We don't care what you say
We're coming up, we're coming up
We don't care what you say
