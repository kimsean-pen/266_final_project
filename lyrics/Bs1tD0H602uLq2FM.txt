The blood of this family, it mingles
With the clay in the sinking riverbed
I tie the boy down and tear his mother's gown
But it's OK, she's already dead

I'll sell the boy and the horses to the snake you cannot see
I cut open the white man and take from his woman too
If it were up to me, all the white faces would bleed
and bleed and bleed and bleed, it's true

Murder, it's murder
Murder, it's murder

Empty plains echo with empty screams
There's a wagon on the highland
Father and his girl, both are heading south
I tie the boy and the horses
then I use the skills of the wolf
I don't use a bullet, I get close enough that I can use my knife (my knife)

I cut open the white man and take from his woman too
If it were up to me, all the white faces would bleed
Red's a better color, it's true

Let the blood out, let it flow
Cut the blood out, let it flow
Kill the blood out, let it flow

Let it flow, like a river
Let it flow, like a river
Let it flow, like a river into the sea
