You'll leave me in the morning anyway
My heart
You'll cut it out you never liked me anyway
Why do you take me down this road
If you don't wanna walk with me?
Why do you exist all alone
When you could just talk to me?

Now I'm all messed up
Sick inside, wondering where
Where you're leaving your makeup
Now I'm all messed up
Sick inside wondering who
Who's life you're making worthwhile

Go, go, go if you want
I can't stop you
Go if you want
I can't stop you

Stay
You come back to me always anyway
Leave a mark
You said you never really loved her anyway
Why do I take this lonely road
Nobody here to walk with me
So I start fresh all over again
Why won't you just comfort me?

Now I'm all messed up
Sick inside, wondering where
Where you're leaving your makeup
Now I'm all messed up
Sick inside wondering who
Who's life you're making worthwhile

Go, go, go if you want
I can't stop you
Go if you want
I can't stop you

Go, go, go if you want
I can't stop you
Go if you want
I can't stop you

Now I'm all messed up
I'm sick inside, wondering where
Where you're leaving your makeup
Now I'm all messed up
Sick inside wondering who
Who's life you're making worthwhile

Go, go, go if you want
I can't stop you
Go if you want
I can't stop you

Go (please stay)
Go (please stay)
Go if you want
I can't stop you
Go if you want
I can't stop you

Go (please stay)
Go (please stay)
Go if you want
I can't stop you
Go if you want
I can't stop you

Go (please stay)
Go (please stay)
Go if you want
I can't stop you
Just go if you want
Go if you want
I can't stop you
