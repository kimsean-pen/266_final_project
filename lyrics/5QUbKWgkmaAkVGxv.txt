You can't stop it now
It's already in motion
Don't try to fight it now
You're already dead again
She's taken over
Snuffed out the life you had
The life you had
It's coming down to this
Another year you can't have back
You're a little older
Your lies a little bolder
You've tried to change
But the secret caged inside
Won't escape you
You should have stopped and told her
Your heart had gotten colder
And make the change
It's locked way deep inside
You can't stop it now
