I told 'em pick up 'cause my favorite porn star is a white girl
She said she goin' next, it's my turn
I might just give her that and shit you might learn
Some things you might learn

My favorite porn star is a big titty, bitch is jiggy, sex super litty
She said if you hit it, you can get it, just don't leave a hickey
I ain't ever talkin', never fuckin' talkin', beg you fuckin' pardon
Poppin' 'cause you know you got it, clappin' but you know you got it
Sin city, bitch is gritty, favorite rapper Biggie
Shawty bottle-poppin', product coppin', ballin' Michael Bibby
We ain't know you winnin', poppin', overspendin', pussy co-dependent
Young girls poppin' soda, we make Gucci chokers over linen

White girl
She said she goin' next, it's my turn
I might just give her that and shit you might learn
Some things you might learn
My favorite porn star is a white girl
She said she goin' next, it's my turn
I might just give her that and shit you might learn
Some things you might learn

My favorite porn star is a border man
Bet you thought you had it but she sorta had it
Fuck the quarter how she threw it at me like she quarterbackin'
You're the one, tell 'em you're the one
I need muscles, send me 40 to the 40 floor
And bring 'em, bring 'em all at once
Big titty, bitch is witty, body just like Iggy
Like I'm black on black on black, this time you'll forgive me
I ain't ever talkin', never fuckin' talkin', beg you fuckin' pardon
Now I'm on my Cameron Diaz, Katy Perry, Dolly Parton
Life, you know the life
I told her pop it every night, that's good advice
I mean she's in love with the lights, she love the lights
I said, well do that, that's my spice, my fuckin' spice

My favorite one is a white girl
She said she goin' next, it's my turn
I might just give her that and shit you might learn
Some things you might learn
My favorite porn star is a white girl

Oh no
Baby, you're a brand new weapon
Throw it back and let it happen
