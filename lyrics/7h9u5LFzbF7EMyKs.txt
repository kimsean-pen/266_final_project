Everyone laughed at her joke
As if they never even heard it before
And maybe they were truly amused
But every word that she spoke was a bore

And maybe it's because they had seen
The previews on the TV screen
Well this part is good and that's well understood
So you should laugh if you know what I mean

But it's all relative even if you don't understand
Well it's all understood
Especially when you don't understand
Then it's all just because even if we don't understand
Then let's all just believe

Everyone knows what went down
Because the news was spread all over town
And fact is only what you believe
And fact and fiction work as a team

It's almost always fiction in the end
That content begins to bend
When context is never the same

And it's all relative even if we don't understand
And it's all understood
Especially when we don't understand
Then it's all just because even if we don't understand
Then let's all just believe

I was readin' a book
Or maybe it was a magazine
Suggestions on where to place faith
Suggestions on what to believe

But I read somewhere that you've got to beware
You can't believe anything you read
But the good book is good and that's well understood
So don't even question if you know what I mean

But it's all relative even if you don't understand
Well it's all understood
Especially when you don't understand
And it's all just because even if we don't understand
Then let's all just believe

But there you go once again
You missed the point and then you point
Your fingers at me
And say that I've said not to believe

Ohh, there you go once again
You missed the point and then you point
Your fingers at me
And you say that I've said not to believe, I believe

Ohh there you go once again
You missed the point and then you point
Your fingers at me
And say that I've said not to believe, I believe
I guess, I guess it's all relative
