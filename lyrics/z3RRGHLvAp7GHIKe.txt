Oh and if you, believe me when I say
You're not so different now
Just stop this little game and save ourselves
But ever since the day, I started burning out
Well I know that you're the one that I've been dreaming about
Won't you take my hand
Like I know you will
When you're sparkling madly in the moonlight
Don't you understand
That I need you still
When you're sparkling madly in the moonlight
Oh and if you, could take another breath
I'll hold your hand up close
I swear that I will come back from this road
And if we fall asleep
In the back seat of your car
We'll wake up in the snow with every other trouble
Won't you take my hand
Like I know you will
When you're sparkling madly in the moonlight
Don't you understand
That I need you still
When you're sparkling madly in the moonlight
Stand back, some day
Call out and hold you together
Stand back, some day
Call out did you hold it together?
Stand back, some day
Call out
Won't you take my hand
Like I know you will
When you're sparkling madly in the moonlight
Don't you understand
That I need you still
When you're sparkling madly in the moonlight

Oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh oh
