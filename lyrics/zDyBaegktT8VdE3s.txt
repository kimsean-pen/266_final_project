There's no one ready for this and for this
Our calls are all faded and disheveled
There's no one waiting on this and on this
They call us all, lift us from the start

Take what you want
Take what you need
You take all, 'til all can't breathe

There's no one ready for this, before this
We'll call this all, left us in the shadows
There's no more waiting for this and for this
What calls us all, tears us all apart

It's something carried from the start
As long as I can wait I can see
It's something buried in the heart
What you've taken I have given for free

Take what you want
Take what you need
You take all, 'til all can't breathe

There's no one ready for this and for this
Our calls are all faded and disheveled
There's no more waiting for this and for this
What calls us all, tears us all apart

Take what you want
Take what you need
You take all, 'til all can't breathe
Take what you want
Take what you need
You take all, 'til all can't breathe

It's something carried from the start
Take it from what's left of you
It's something buried in the heart
What you've taken I have given for free

Take what you want
Take what you need
You take all, 'til all can't breathe
Take what you want
Take what you need
You take all, 'til all can't breathe

It's something carried from the start
As long as I can wait I can see
It's something buried in the heart
What you've taken I have given for free

Take what you want
Take what you need
You take all, 'til all can't breathe
Take what you want
Take what you need
You take all, 'til all can't breathe
