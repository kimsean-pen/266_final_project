Found out how scared you were
to ask how I knew
everything

But not how I ever blamed you.
I know you were never aware

So how could you say
sorry, how could I take and take
and never think of you?

I'm not sorry I don't care about you.

Found out how little I felt
When I stepped back and heard you say,
it's not my fault- I was raised this way

And I'll be damned if I pity you
Like I used to do
When I still loved you.
