You may speak to the heart of a crowd
But your words won't always be graceful
This show is a beautiful thing
But we're all in a season of changing

Forget what you know
The things you try to control
You've got to let go

The whole world's talking to you
But you're lost
When will you listen
Love is waiting for you patiently
When you start to listen

Your skin will grow old
Your body will slow
There's no hope in escaping
The institution will fold
And go down in a hole
With all your good intentions

Forget what you know
Everything that you control
You've got to let go

The whole world's talking to you
But you're lost
When will you listen
Love is waiting for you patiently
When you start to listen

Son, what's spoken
Was born in peace

The whole world's talking to you
But you're lost
When will you listen
Love is waiting for you patiently
When you start to listen
The whole world's talking to you
But you're lost
When will you listen
Love is waiting for you patiently
When you start to listen

Forget what you know
Everything that you control
You've got to let go
