Blind me with all your lies, you're evil
I can look into your lies, you're evil
I can look into your face, you're evil
Lying all over the place, you're evil

Hey ma, run into the night
Into the night to roam
You lie, you know

Those looks you give me tell me that you're evil
I hope I don't see you alive, you're evil
You, yeah you, you're so evil
You're so evil, you're evil, you're evil

Hey ma, run into the night
You're a creature of destruction
I bet you know

Into the night, into the night to fight
Come on baby let's fight, ha ha ha

Those looks you give me tell me that you're evil
I hope I don't fit in your plans, you're evil
You, yeah you, you're so evil
You're so evil, you're evil, you're evil

Hey ma, run into the night
You're a creature of destruction
I bet you know

Into the night, into the night to fight
Come on baby let's fight, ha ha ha!
