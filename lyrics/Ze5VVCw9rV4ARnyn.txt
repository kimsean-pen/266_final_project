18 years, faced all of our fears
We took on the world together, I caught all of your tears
You told me back then that our love would never end
You li-i-i-i-i-i-i-ied

Hold me like you did before
Console me like we never went to war
You throwed me and my heart into the floor
I di-i-i-i-i-i-i-ied

(Now you're) dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me
(You're) dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me

(You're) dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me
(You're) dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me

Look at how you've turned, yeah, you watched me burn
Just threw me in the fire and you weren't concerned
You told me it was love, I would always be enough
You li-i-i-i-i-i-i-ied

Maybe one day you'll come around
But baby, I'll be nowhere to be found
Betrayed me, my baby in my eyes
You've di-i-i-i-i-i-ied

Dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me
(You're) dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me

(You're) dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me
(You're) dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me

(Now you're)

(Dead to me, dead to me, dead to me)

Dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me
(You're) dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me

(You're) dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me
(You're) dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me

(You're) dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me
(You're) dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me

(You're) dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me
(You're) dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me

You're dead to me
