Strawberry jam like blood
And my problems like God
In the morning my feet
Tell me to not repeat
The same mistakes I make everytime
When I try to communicate
And I feel I should clarify all the time (Run, run, run)

Everytime I run I get stuck in the sun (Run, run, run)
Everytime I run I get stuck in the sun (Run, run, run)
Everytime I run I get stuck in the sun (Run, run, run)
Everytime I run I get stuck in the sun (Run, run, run)

My brain is a machine
I should control it before I talk
But each night in my dream
A conversation is written in chalk
And how can we reach the point
When we accept the sadness
How can we reach the point
When we are tired of talking to each other

Everytime I run I get stuck in the sun (Run, run, run)
Everytime I run I get stuck in the sun (Run, run, run)
Everytime I run I get stuck in the sun (Run, run, run)
Everytime I run I get stuck in the sun (Run, run, run)

We can take you out of that sunny day
Into deep shades
Pop that bubble you say it give you edge, all saints
The industry all faints and quakes at the arrival
MEI and CC we'll take on all titles
Hurricanes, arrivals, revive your vitals
Lost them like Michael, yeah

You can define but never find love
But then you find what you get
And never find what you had
Look at how we stand hand in hand
Don't hide what you see when (You could follow, you could follow)
Us and any other place from the light
And yet we're still bright, we fight, we- (Run, run, run)

Everytime I run I get stuck in the sun (Run, run, run)
Everytime I run I get stuck in the sun (Run, run, run)
Everytime I run I get stuck in the sun (Run, run, run)
Everytime I run I get stuck, stuck, it's stuck, it's stuck
