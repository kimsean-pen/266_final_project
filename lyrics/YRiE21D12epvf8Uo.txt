Leaving it all unsaid
Keeping it quiet instead
You know that I won't explain
Cause I've grown to need this pain
You tell me it's good for now
I'll heal but I don't know how
Safe in the way we touch
But it hurts to feel this much

And they say that it goes so I hope that it shows
You are all that I've known for a while
And I'm coming up slow and I'm thinking of home
But you're all that I've known for a while

Spending our nights awake
Silent for both our sake
Hold me until I'm strong
Cause I'll miss this when you're gone

And they say that it goes so I hope that it shows
You are all that I've known for a while
And I'm coming up slow and I'm thinking of home
But you're all that I've known for a while

I'd tell you but I can't
Please don't make this hard
Time is all I want
So speak the words I won't

And they say that it goes so I hope that it shows
You are all that I've known for a while
And I'm coming up slow and I'm thinking of home
But you're all that I've known for a while
