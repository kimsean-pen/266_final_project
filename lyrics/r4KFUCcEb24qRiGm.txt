I like to think when I'm driving
I like to daydream a little
I like to think about the people
The faces of the young and the old
I want to watch the whole story unfold

I'm gonna drive real fast now
Forget about my past now
I know I'm a fuck up
I know, a real tragedy
I never listen to people, you see

You can't say what's on your mind
Just go for it
Come on this time
I know, I know, I know I'll cry
I'll cry

Hot ideas in this cool head
Forget about what she said
Idolater of beauty
She's going to leave you always wanting more, wanting more

You can't say what's on your mind
Just go for it
Come on this time
I know, I know, I know I'll cry
I'll cry
I'll cry
