Ever since the day that we met
I have had to overcome my death
Everybody says I'm not really there
That I'm stuck between here and my bed

Sleeping in waking
See, I'm awake
Sleeping in waking, oh
Oh

When your body loses your mind
And your waking's not synchronised
Leave those thoughts for tonight
They'll be waiting for you at the end of the line

Sleeping in waking
See, I'm awake
Sleeping in waking, oh
Oh

And all I really wanna say is breathe easy
This is the time to let it go
You'll only hear this from me once more
Don't think about me tonight
It's all right
I won't forget
So goodnight
So goodnight

Sleeping in waking
See, I'm awake
Sleeping in waking, oh
Oh (it's all right)
Sleeping in waking (I won't forget)
See, I'm awake (so goodnight)
Sleeping in waking, oh
Oh (so goodnight)
