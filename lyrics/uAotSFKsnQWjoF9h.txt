I see them with the suits and the ties and their motherfucking lies
-Analyzing
-Realizing
I think about the choices they've made in their lives when they realized
Too scared to run away 'cause they don't want to hear all the people judging-
The people judging
but I DON'T GIVE A FUCK
-if they care
-if they don't
I just realized
yeah

I am going up right now

I've buried all my friends in the land of the god-
but I keep on fighting
I keep on fighting
I'm trying to find a way to deny all the shit that I should have done
yeah
I want to find a place with no race but the truth is I'll never find it
-I'll never find it
'Cause blood is all around on this ground and I don't think they really mind
yeah

I am going up now
