I'm running out of dreams today
Running out
I keep on trying anyway
Running out
Running out

Broken and insane
I'm broken and insane
Broken and insane
I'm broken and insane
I'm broken and insane
Broken and insane
I'm broken and insane
Broken and insane

I can't stop lying to your face
Running out
Life like a never ending race
Running out, running out

All my breath, leaking out, leaking out
I can't feel my hands or my legs
I'm leaking out, out, out

All my breath, leaking out, leaking out
I can't feel my hands or my legs
I'm leaking out, out, out
