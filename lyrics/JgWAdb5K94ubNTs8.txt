Rooted within the pitch-black heart
(the pitch-black heart)
Entrenched behind the weary eyes
(the weary eyes)
In the faraway song the cold sea sung
(the cold sea sung)
In the calm whisper of winds afar
(those winds afar)
It lies, calls and awaits deep in the primeval dark
Embodiment of despair that leaves or serves the ties
