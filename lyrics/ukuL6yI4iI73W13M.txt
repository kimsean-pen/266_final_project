Everybody knows that I was such a fool
To ever let go of you but baby I was wrong
And yeah, I know I said, we'd be better off alone
It was time that we moved on, I know, I broke your heart
I didn't mean to break your heart but baby, here I am

Banging on your front door
My pride's spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised
And I'm crawling back to you

Begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?
I was running from the truth
And now I'm crawling back to you

I know you're in there and you can make me wait
But I'm not gonna wait, it's the least that I can do
Just to tell you face to face, I was lying to myself
Now I'm dying in this hell, girl, I know you're mad
I can't blame you for being mad but baby, here I am

Banging on your front door
My pride's spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised
And now I'm crawling back to you

Begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?
I was running from the truth
And now I'm crawling back to you

If you could see these tears I'm crying
Touch these hands that can't stop shaking
Hear my heart that's barely beating
You would see a different man but baby, here I am

Banging on your front door
My pride's spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised
And I'm crawling back to you

Begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?
I was running from the truth
Now I'm crawling back to you

Banging on your front door
My pride's spilled on the floor
I was running from the truth
Now I'm crawling back to you

Yeah, now I'm crawling back to you
Crawling back to you
Crawling back to you
Crawling back to you
