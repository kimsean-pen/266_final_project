Moments of perfection
Idle in the sunshine
Over there in yonder
In another world

I'm not your kind
I'm not your girl
Dreams we had seemed bright
And passed the time

Cologne cerrone, cerrone Houdini
Cerrone Houdini
Cologne cerrone, cerrone Houdini
Cerrone Houdini

Sunlight in your eyes
Driving over stateside
Left the smoke behind us
Could we be together in another world?

I'm not your kind
I'm not your girl
See I'm in your car
But not your life

Cologne cerrone, cerrone Houdini
Cerrone Houdini
Cologne cerrone, cerrone Houdini
Cerrone Houdini

Sunlight in your eyes
Sunlight in our eyes
Like diamonds in your hair
