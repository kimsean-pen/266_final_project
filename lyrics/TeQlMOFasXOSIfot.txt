Ask me I'm fine, or I will be
I gotta bullet proof vest on and the cure for aids
And a pill that makes me happy
Ask me I'm fine, or I will be
I've got the cure for loneliness and a pill that makes all my problems resolved

I got a bulletproof vest on
and I wire tapped your brain
I want to do this right
dyno, dyn-o-mite

You should have just listened to your friends
You would have been over this by now
I thought we told each other to live in different worlds

Oh you should have listened to your friends
You would have been over this by now
Over this by now
Oh there's only so much I can take
But I guess we'll never really find out
Never really find out

Rate me and judge me on a graph that you drew
Hope I compare to the friends that left you for dead

I guess I'm not making myself perfectly clear
I guess I'm not making myself perfectly clear
How many times
How many times
How many times is this gonna happen?
How many times
How many times
How many times is this gonna happen?

I've got to blame all these people as fast as I motherfucking can
You were fooled, this ain't no fucking day job

Oh you should have listened to your friends
You would have been over this by now, over this by now
Oh there's only so much I can take
But I guess we'll never really find out, never really find out

Suddenly, we startle ourselves
Staring upon each other in silence
Silence
To think this whole time, we're provoking each other in blinding violence
