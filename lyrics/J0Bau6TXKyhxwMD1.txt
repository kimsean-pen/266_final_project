If there's a time when the tears should fill your eyes
And you can't see past the shadows to the sun on the other side
Don't despair, because there always will be someone there
Don't lose faith, love won't let you lose your way, because

You, you'll never stand alone, I'll be standing by
I'll keep you from the cold, I'll hold you when you cry
I'll be there to be strong when you can't find the strength inside
And you, you'll always have a home in these arms of mine
You'll never stand alone, love is standing by, oh yes, it is, yes

If there's a day when the rain should find your heart
And you're cold and tired and lonely and this world has you in the dark
Don't be scared, you can just reach for me and I'll be there
Don't lose hope, love will see you through you know, because

You, you'll never stand alone, I'll be standing by
I'll keep you from the cold, I'll hold you when you cry
I'll be there to be strong when you can't find the strength inside
And you, you'll always have a home in these arms of mine
You'll never stand alone, love is standing by

Standing by to lift you above all the hurt and pain, oh yeah
Standing by to carry you through all the tears and rain
Reach for me, I'll be with you, reach for me, baby, I'll see you through
See I'll be the one to hold you the one to show you that

You, you'll never stand alone, I'll be standing by
I'll keep you from the cold, I'll hold you when you cry
I'll be there to be strong when you can't find the strength inside
And you, you'll always have a home in these arms of mine
You'll never stand alone, love is standing by

You'll never stand alone, I'll be standing by
I'll keep you from the cold, I'll hold you when you cry
I'll be there to be strong when you can't find the strength inside
And you, you'll always have a home in these arms of mine
You'll never stand alone, love is standing by
Love is standing by
