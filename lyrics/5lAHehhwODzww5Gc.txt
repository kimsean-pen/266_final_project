I kneel in front of the altar
It's covered with flowers
I pray to Lord Jesus
And confess my sins

I hear a scornful laughin'
Voices sound through the silence
The organ plays by oneself
Hell, what's happen here?

I look around and scared
Skulls lie on the black altar
All crosses turned
Green blood drops from the walls

Demoniac monsters grin at me
All over signs of the evil
A man with a black coat floats over me
Glowin' eyes stare in the distance

Total calm, the figure raise the voice
"Our master is angry
We must appease him
You're chosen, be happy"

Panic takes me, I run to the gate it's open
Nobody stops my route
"Don't be so stupid, you cannot escape"

I awake, only a dream bathed in perspiration
A scornful laughin' sounds
A phantom floats over me
"You cannot escape"
