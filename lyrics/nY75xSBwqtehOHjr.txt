Never fly before you can
Make sure you know how to land
Or somebody's going to hurt
Gravity's the final word
And it's always gonna win

There's gonna come a time
You're gonna need a safe place to fall
Before you say goodbye
You better make sure you've said it all

So come and hold me tight
Last chance let's dance on the wire
Don't worry 'cause tonight
Tonight we are the flyers

Never lie unless you can
Remember words come back again
Just like feathers in the wind
They can rise and fall and spin
Sometimes they will lock you in

There's gonna come a time
You're gonna need a safe place to fall
Before you say goodbye
You better make sure you've said it all

So come and hold me tight
Last chance let's dance on the wire
Don't worry 'cause tonight
Tonight we are the flyers

So come and hold me tight
Last chance let's dance on the wire
Don't worry 'cause tonight
Tonight we are the flyers

So come and hold me tight
Last chance let's dance on the wire
Don't worry 'cause tonight
Tonight we are the flyers
