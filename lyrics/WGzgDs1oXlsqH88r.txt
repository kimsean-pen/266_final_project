My bills keep climbin', the stress I keep buyin' plays with my mind
I smoke and I drink, not to think about it
Now there goes my lover, ugh
Quick go find another or I'll start thinkin', overthinkin'
We both know that never goes well

But it's lookin' like another sad sad summer for me
It's lookin' like another sad sad summer

And I got them big dreams, my name on the marquee
But I'm feelin' blue 'cause my shit ain't poppin' off yet
And I miss my momma, sometimes when I call her
I hope she'll say "Baby girl, come on home"

But it's lookin' like another sad sad summer for me
It's lookin' like another sad sad summer

Beach balls and waterfalls, everyone in love
But I'm in the water just, just tryna stay above
They all got beach balls and waterfalls
I don't feel the love
I'll be here, in the cold, cold, cold, cold water ooh

And I don't wanna grow up, ugh
Of being told what I'm suppose to do, ooh
So I smoke and I drink not to think

'Cause it's still lookin' like sad sad summer for me
It's lookin' like another sad sad summer

Ooh it's lookin' like another sad sad sad summer
