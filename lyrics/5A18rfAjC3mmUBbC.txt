Dem wanna fuck with me
But tell 'em they time's up 'cause I'm up
Young Don, mash up di place, make it light up (yeah)
Every see a gyal in di rave with dem legs up?
Bitches gettin' touched in the dark, call the sun shine
Got a clean heart but get dark when you test mine
Capability or intelligent, you vexed it
P-p-pedigree, Don business is war time
Workin' women, winning catchin' Ws
Flyin' across the coast to pick the colour too
New bags, new clothes, Fendi, Guc'
My style and my flow put you on mute

Heard she get that plenty-o, plenty-o (yeah)
Heard she gettin' plenty, oh, where she get it though?
I been gettin' ready though, for rockin' Fendi though
Bitches gettin' jellio, I'm gettin' heavy-o
Rollin' through the W, I'm catchin' Ws
I was born in 92, you know what I do
Baby, gettin' heavy-o, you know she jellio
But they ain't even ready though, ain't seen me sent me though

They ain't touchin' me
Dirt on my shoe never touchin' me
Came from the bottom but they still ain't touchin' me
Even if I wore a chain that said "touch me," they ain't touchin' me
Ayo, Steff, how you think these hoes feel now?
Fuck 'em, I don't care, got my mummy proud
Let these bitches chat the chat 'cause I'ma walk it out
They ain't even half what I am, they just Insta' clowns
Said that I'ma do it and I did it
If they ever doubted, I bet now they feelin' stupid
Black girl from the ends goin' platinum, shit's stupid
Daddy, rest in peace 'cause the killers restin' stupid
It ain't hurtin' me, fam, it's hurtin' dem
Publicise my tweets but never posted when
I signed myself for more than half an M
1.2 to be exact, ask my nigga right

Heard she get that plenty-o, plenty-o (yeah)
Heard she gettin' plenty, oh, where she get it though?
I been gettin' ready though, for rockin' Fendi though
Bitches gettin' jellio, I'm gettin' heavy-o
Rollin' through the W, I'm catchin' Ws
I was born in 92, you know what I do
Baby, gettin' heavy-o, you know she jellio
They ain't even ready though, ain't seen me sent me though

Leave 'em in the dirt like they layin' in the bath
Leave 'em in the Eastside when the gun talk
Rap on, pop off, nigga, why turn soft?
Rap on, pop off, nigga, boy, get jelly, turn soft
Leave 'em in the dirt like they layin' in the bath
Leave 'em in the Eastside when the gun talk
Rap on, pop off, nigga, why turn soft?
Rap on, pop off, nigga, boy, turn
Heard she get that plenty-o, plenty-o (yeah)
Heard she gettin' plenty, oh, where she get it though?
I been gettin' ready though, for rockin' Fendi though
Bitches gettin' jellio, I'm gettin' heavy-o
