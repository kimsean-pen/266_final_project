Four in the afternoon
I should be up and gone soon
This is the shirt
That I'm wearing out

Torn at the elbow
From too much football
And one size too small
All around

Stretched shoulder to shoulder
A stretch from soda to soda
And I slept to the radio
Over the wind in the morning

I'm turned like an elbow
A slumber after parting
Red faced from too much sun
In too many summers

And your state fair mirror of John Taylor
Saw the whole thing
