I met a girl
Snowball in hell
She was scarred
And as cracked as the Liberty Bell

I got her to
Come on, move in with me
And I said I'd find a better place
We can spend eternity

But don't go down
Don't go down
Stay with me, baby stay

Her momma called me a thief
And her dad
Called himself Commander in Chief

I fought him off with my love
But I knew the sense of worthlessness
She'd have to rise above

Don't go down
Don't go down
Stay with me, baby stay

Don't go down
Don't go down
Stay with me, baby stay

She had a dream
Woke up in shock
She had seen her own body
Outlined in chalk

And I split the scene
The globe's been spun
And her ghost beamed down to kiss me
With a message from the sun

Don't go down
Don't go down
Stay with me, baby stay

Don't go down
Stay with me, baby stay
Don't go down
Stay with me, baby stay
