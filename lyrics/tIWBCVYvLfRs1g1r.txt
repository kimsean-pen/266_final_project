Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper "I love you"
Birds singing in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me

Say "Nighty-night" and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading but I linger on dear

Oh how you linger on

Still craving your kiss

How you crave my kiss

Now I'm longin' to linger till dawn dear
Just saying this

Give me a little kiss

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams, whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading but I linger on dear
Still craving your kiss
Yeah, I'm longing to linger till dawn dear
Just saying this, yes

Sweet dreams

Dreamin'

Till sunbeams find you
Keep dreaming

Gotta keep dreamin'

Leave your worries far behind you

But in your dreams, whatever they be

You gotta make me a promise
Promise to me you'll dream
Dream a little dream of me
