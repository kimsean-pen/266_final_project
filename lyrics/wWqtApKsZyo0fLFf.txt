You didn't know where to go
Walking around in this flag-waving town
I saw you waiting for a train
And you disappeared
Your face pressed up to the window

You went so far away
And I want to come there too
I want to be with you
I'm just waiting until you say these words:
"Come back, come back, come back, oh, to me

I'm living near Gda≈Ñsk
There's a train, you'd be here soon
There's a life for me and you
The East means so many things
But it could be home, it could be home,
it could be home, it could be home
For you and me
It could be home, it could be home,
it could be home, it could be home
Come back, come back, come back, oh, to me."

And if you'd ever say those words
I'd come to you, where you are
It's too hard to be apart
The East's not so far away
But it could be home, it could be home,
it could be home, it could be home
For you and me
It could be home, it could be home, it could be home, it could be home
Come back, come back, come back
Oh, to me
