And I feel like taking off, let me be your supernova
Before you make the biggest mistake of your life
Just give me the chance to get it right

They got it all, they've got all the things I thought I wanted
But I can't afford to fake anymore to live this facade
And smile as the warm champagne pours

Out on the lawn, we'll pretend we're having
Tons of fun in this world where we don't belong
Some bloke all alone, is she thinking of me
Did she forget what we once had

And I feel like taking off, let me be your supernova
Before you make the biggest mistake of your life
Just give me the chance to get it right, get it right

Oh, they got it all, you can see they got it all
They got the cars, the boat, and the beautiful house by the shore
And you know there's more, but I can't take another minute of it all

He wants his kids and the dog
He wants his breakfast in bed, he's got his trust fund saved
Not a worry in his head, but he's not you or me
I wanna break up the scene and see you running back to me

'Cause I feel like taking off, let me be your supernova
Before you make the biggest mistake of your life
Just give me a chance to get it right, get it right

Yeah, I feel like taking off, let me be your supernova tonight
Before you make the biggest mistake of your life
Just give me a chance to get it right, get it right

You've got it wrong if you say our love is gone
You've got it wrong if you say our love is gone
You've got it wrong if you say our love is gone
You've got it wrong if you say our love is gone
You've got it wrong if you say our love is gone

Yeah, I feel like taking off, let me be your supernova
Before you make the biggest mistake of your life
Just give me a chance to get it right get it right

Yeah, I feel like taking off, let me be your supernova tonight
Before you make the biggest mistake of your life
Just give me the chance to get it right, get it right
