It's the little white lies that keep us awake
It's the long drive home that makes people talk
It's the fear in our hearts that give us away
It's the playful fight in a swimming pool, I still think of you

Alright, I'm ready to shake things up
Dear God this is really gonna Mess Her Up
And I keep on praying that I'm strong enough
It's a lot for love
It's a lot for love

Alright, I'm ready to shake things up
Dear God, this is really gonna Mess Her Up
And I keep on praying that I'm strong enough
It's a lot for love
It's a lot for love

It's the brush of my hand in a white hallway
It's the long goodbyes that give us away
It's the song that comes on and it hurts the most
It's the kiss in the car and you hate yourself
But the high notes get the best of you

Alright, I'm ready to shake things up
Dear God, this is really gonna Mess Her Up
And I keep on praying that I'm strong enough
It's a lot for love
It's a lot for love
Alright, I'm ready to shake things up
Dear God, this is really gonna Mess Her Up
And I keep on praying that I'm strong enough
It's a lot for love
It's a lot for love
It's a lot for love

Some say that we'll be over before we've begun
And I can't let it be over, I gotta have one
Listen to you laugh like crazy
Time should make this easy

Alright
Alright, I'm ready to shake things up
Dear God this is really gonna Mess Her Up
And I keep on praying that I'm strong enough
It's a lot for love
It's a lot for love
Alright, I'm ready to shake things up
Dear God this is really gonna Mess Her Up
And I keep on praying that I'm strong enough
It's a lot for love
It's a lot for love
It's a lot for love

This is really gonna, really gonna Mess Her Up
This is really gonna Mess Her Up
