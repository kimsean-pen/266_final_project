Nobody can tell ya
There's only one song worth singing
They may try and sell ya
Cause it hangs them up
To see someone like you

But you've gotta make your own kind of music
Sing your own special song
Make your own kind music
Even if nobody else sings along

You're gonna be nowhere
The loneliest kind of lonely
It may be rough goin'
Just to do your thing's the hardest thing to do
But you've gotta make your own kind of music
Sing your own special song
Make your own kind music
Even if nobody else sings along

So if you can not take my hand
And if you must be goin', I will understand

You gotta make your own kind of music
Sing your own special song
Make your own kind music
Even if nobody else sings along

You gotta make your own kind of music
Sing your own special song
Make your own kind music
Even if nobody else sings along
