In the mirror angel face with angel hair in an angel cage
In the mirror, violence staged tremble without her embrace
In the mirror velvet wires dressed her shivers in desire
Precious silence for the masses
Blind them all hope to ashes
Make way breathe with ease
Display her thoughts on peace

The truth in your eyes never should have been so lonely
A fragile move within
Breathing in time with the ones who never owned you
Requiem, invite them all

In the mirror cracks in their truth
Today she's done, today she's gone
Gently veiled in violent slumber
Eyes forgave sins outnumbered
Save her innocence
Long lost is her scent

The truth in your eyes never should have been so lonely
A fragile move within
Breathing in time with the ones who never owned you
Requiem, invite them all

Cura, mortuus, sanctus, veritas
