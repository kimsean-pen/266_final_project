Sweet like my tomato
Red cherry tomato
Down at the market pick out the ripe one
Tempting me sorely I want to bite one
Wait, save it for later

We had a good time at the beginning
It tasted just like all the things I was missing
I'll go at full boil 'til you
stop stop stop stop me
Later

Stay and I will make you dinner
Taste, each dish will be better
After the first bite say it's delicious
But then appetite isn't what we'd predicted
Would you want to heat it up later?

Rollercoaster, want to go back
to the way things were
I'm on the rollercoaster, want
to get back on the Tilt-A-Whirl

I'll be your monkey, a puppy, your circus freak
Fell the first day, it took a whole week
Rollercoaster, can't we go back
to the way things were?

Vertigo is the only clue
You're sick on me, I'm sick on you
Rollercoaster, want
to back to the Tilt-A-Whirl

I'm dizzy and faithless, where is the ground?
You said this thing would not go upside down
Rollercoaster, want to get back
to the way things were.
All right...

Sweet you're my tomato
Red cherry tomato
I know that some of our days are bitter
Stay with me honey
and things could be better
Wait, wait until later
