Won't you come away with me
Won't you come
Won't you come away with me
Won't you come
Won't you come away with me
Won't you come away

Won't you come away with me
Won't you come
Won't you come away with me
Won't you come
Won't you come away with me
Won't you come away
They were made for each other
It was love at first sight
They were caught in the moment

It was the end of the night
Well they were walking on such delicate ropes
Well they're talking of running off to the coast
They were made for each other
They run off in the night
She said to him

Won't you come away with me
Won't you come
Won't you come away with me
Won't you come
Won't you come away with me

Won't you come away
They were made for each other
They knew it was right
So sick of this ghost town
So they ran off in the night
She said to him

Won't you come away with me
Won't you come
Won't you come away with me
Won't you come
Won't you come away with me
Won't you come away

They're chasing the sun and it's light
They're racing running all the red lights
They're placing their trust in the night
They're waiting, now waiting
Won't you come away with me
Won't you come away
Won't you come away with me
Won't you come
Won't you come away with me
Won't you come
Won't you come away with me
Won't you come away
