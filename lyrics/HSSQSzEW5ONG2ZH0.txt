Sometimes I see his face
I want to hold you but it feels unsafe
Too scared to give me heart up now
I'm not brave enough to play my part now

Can you guarantee that you'll stay
Here with me, with me

Feels strange like a foreign thing
I'm still waiting for the love to kick in
Sometimes when I watch you sleeping
I keep hand to check you're breathing

It's not fair, not your fault
Not at all, not at all

Once bitten, twice shy
I try and I try, I try
Cause I'm holding on to nothing
I'm holding on to nothing
Once bitten, twice shy

I can't seem to find the strength
What's the point in keeping you at arm's length
I want to love you but I can't imagine
What I'd do if the worst did happen

Where I've been, never thought
No I won't go back
Couldn't take anymore
I'm not going back
Going back, going back
