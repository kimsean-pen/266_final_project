Everything is good
And brown, oh I'm here again
With a sunshine smile upon my face, my friends
Are close at hand
And all my inhibitions
Have disappeared without a trace, I'm glad
Oh that I found
Somebody who I can rely on

This is the return of the space cowboy
Inter-planetary good vibe zone
Say at the speed of Cheeba, oh you and I'll go deeper
Maybe I'll have to get high to get by

Everything is good, oh and green
Say I'm red again
And I don't suppose I'm coming down, I can see clearly
So high in the sky
A man with psychedelic picture frames
of happiness to shade his eyes, he's glad
Oh that I found
Somebody who he can rely on

This is the return of the space cowboy
Inter-planetary good vibe zone
Say at the speed of Cheeba
Oh You and I go deeper
Maybe I'll have to get high to get by.

This is the return of the space cowboy
Inter-planetary good vibe zone
Say at the speed of Cheeba
Oh you and I go deeper
I'll get high to get by

You and I go deeper
Space cowboy
