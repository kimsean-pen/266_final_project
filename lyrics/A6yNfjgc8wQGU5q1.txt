Oh we building a love song
I can't bear to see you go
I know things aren't the best for us
And it's starting to show

Take a plane and a promise
To put honey in your jar
Maybe it's the weather
But I got nothing in my heart
Maybe it's the weather
But I got nothing in my heart

Got into the car today
But didn't go outside
Maybe we're too far gone to try

Take a plane and a promise
To put honey in your jar
Maybe it's the weather
But I got nothing in my heart
Maybe it's the weather
But I got nothing in my heart

Take a plane and a promise
To put honey in your jar
Maybe it's the weather
But I got nothing in my heart
Maybe it's the weather
But I got nothing in my heart
