After my medicine, I'll turn away
From every side of life tha'ts worth complaining
You are the helicopter far away
There's no alternative, I'm on the way to you

Under our shelter, I will dedicate
My every breath to why this place is worth saving
You are my sedative, you have to stay
Cause' you are the pilot in my hurricane

You've got no side effects to you
You've got no side effects to you
And i've got nothing left but you
So won't you take my side effects
My side effects on you

You are my medicine, don't go away
I can't afford to make the same mistake, no
You are imperative in every way
I don't speak in sugar, I just thought I'd say

You've got no side effects to you
You've got no side effects to you
And i've got nothing left but you
So won't you take my side effects
My side effects on you
