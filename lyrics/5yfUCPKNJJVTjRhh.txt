Passing Ships

Swimming Tapes

In faded hues, of green and blue
Beneath the willow tree
I think of you, the way you looked
Barefoot in the stream

I thought I saw you once
Passing on the overground
We were two ships passing on the sea
I watched you fading out
Fade into a misty dawn
Drifting after something you can't see

And as the trees, dropping their leaves
Rusty on the green
I think of you, the way you looked
You were there with me

I thought I saw you once
Passing on the overground
We were two ships passing on the sea
I watched you fading out
Fade into a misty dawn
Drifting after something you can't see

We were just, ships out on the sea
We were just, ships out on the sea.

In faded hues, of green and blue
Beneath the willow tree
