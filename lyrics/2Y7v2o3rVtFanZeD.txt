Jealousy has a hold on you
It's good for no one
Like walking around with a loaded gun
You're insecure, wish you never knew her
Hold you down quicker
And your friends are even fewer
I don't know just what I'd do
If I found out, all the boys you're talking to
Yeah, I don't know what I would do, yeah

Jealousy has a hold on you
Jealousy's gonna rip you in two
Jealousy has a hold on you
Jealousy's gonna rip you in two

Girl, you're the only one
Yep, you're the only one
Yep, you're the only one
Girl, you're the only one

You walk around with a loaded gun
Watch out boy you're gonna shoot someone
You walk around with a loaded gun
They're scared of you, you're no fun

Jealousy has a hold on you
Jealousy's gonna rip you in two
Jealousy has a hold on you
Jealousy's gonna rip you in two

Girl, you're the only one
Yep, you're the only one
Girl, you're my only one
Yep, you're the only one

I'm not your latest purchase, boy
I'm with you 'cause you're worth it
Positions are for keeping
Lovers need their freedom, I know
I don't want you to bring me
Awesome sorts could never cut me
Jealousy is gonna bring you undone
Maybe I'm not the only one
Jealousy, jealousy

Jealousy has a hold on you
Jealousy's gonna rip you in two

Girl, you're the only one
Yep, you're the only one
Yep, you're the only one
Girl, you're the only one
