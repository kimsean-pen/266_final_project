Take a walk, try to relax
It's not as bad as you think
Brush it off, she'll call in the morning
It's not as bad as you think

Is it a sign blowin' through my mind
Or is it just dust on the road
Lost and found, turned around
It's just us on the road

Why's it so hard to find a piece of mind
In a world where you're given all of the time
Just to find out
Yeah, to find out

Why's it so hard to find a piece of mind
In a world where you're given all of the time
Just to find out
Yeah, to find out

Your heart should know

In the mornin' my head is spinning from the evenin'
I try to erase you every mornin'

Why's it so hard to find a piece of mind
In a world where you're given all of the time
Just to find out
Yeah, to find out

So why's it so hard to find a piece of mind
In a world where you're given all of the time
Just to find out
Yeah, to find out

Your heart should know
Should know, know when it's time
Your heart should know
Should know when it's time

Is it a sign blowin' through my mind
Or is it just dust on the road
