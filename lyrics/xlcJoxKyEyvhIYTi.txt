You're watching your favorite show
When the TV died
The biggest power-cut in your neighbourhood since 1989
A blackout in the center of town
But down in the suburbs where it first went out
They've been asking, asking the question

Are you afraid of the darkness?
Are you afraid of the darkness?
I'm afraid of the darkness too

In the hospital
On the critical ward
Too long a breath between
The break and the backup of a life support
One system failure and it stopped her heart
One power vacuum and we're coming apart
We should be asking, asking the question

Are you afraid of the darkness?
Are you afraid of the darkness?
I'm afraid of the darkness too
We're all caught in the blackout
Trying to feel our way out
Wait for the morning
I'll be waiting for you

Meet me in the middle
Meet me in the middle
Bring a burning candle with you
Meet me in the middle
Meet me in the middle
I will be there waiting for you

I was in my comfort zone
I was singing selfish songs
I've been taking for granted everyone understood
How easy trouble comes
But it's not enough anymore
We can't turn just around and close the door on the world
It's asking uneasy questions
We should be asking ourselves uneasy questions

Are you afraid of the darkness?
Are you afraid of the darkness?
I'm afraid of the darkness too
We're all caught in the blackout
Trying to feel our way out
Wait for the morning
I'll be waiting for you

Meet me in the middle
Meet me in the middle
Bring a burning candle with you
Meet me in the middle
Meet me in the middle
I will be there waiting for you
Meet me in the middle
Meet me in the middle
Bring a burning candle with you
Meet me in the middle
