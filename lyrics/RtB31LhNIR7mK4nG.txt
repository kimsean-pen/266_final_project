First, He's inched her latch down
Anxious, Her hand begs, And now my distraction
Distraction
I will learn, To focus on
Oh, you hoo hoo..., Cause you won't

Recognize it, Stablize it
Things take- take me
To exception look for respect
Respect
Down- down there
You're not a nice track footfall
Round
Will we still hold, Rain
Things we couldn't do
Strive, For me to leave
Rights of her, Rights
Treasure her, Treasure
Her freshness
First
He's inched her latch down
Anxious
Oh, her hand begs
And my distraction
Distraction
I will learn to, I will learn
Focus on you, To focus on
You hoo hoo..., Cause you won't

Recognize it, Recognize
Stablize it, Stablize it
He even finds a way
Supreme, man improves
Lkie what might see
Her life for everyone
Will it still hold
Rain
Things we couldn't do
Strive
For me to give
Rights of her
Rights
Treasure her
Treasure
Her freshness
I will learn
To focus on you
You hoo hoo...
Cause you won't
