Paint love in a lonely light
Monochrome only when I go without
Got light in the soul tonight
Every color I've ever heard about
It feels so good I'll have trouble letting go

Strobe light lightning bolts
Dance floor spinning like a hurricane
Love current 10, 000 volts
Heavy win bending up the weather vane
It felt so good I had trouble letting go

The magic is there for us all to feel
Naming it isn't what makes it real
Rushing around for us all to know
Noticing isn't what makes it so

Wanna walk side by side a while
Just a few blocks up 7th Ave
By the time we hit the park
You're gonna be too old to wanna hold my hand
It feels so good I'll have trouble letting go

The magic is there for us all to feel
Naming it isn't what makes it real
Rushing around for us all to know
Noticing isn't what makes it so

I cry when I have it, I cry when I don't
And everyone walks away
Still I ask if I can stay

The magic is there for us all to feel
Naming it isn't what makes it real
Rushing around for us all to know
Noticing isn't what makes it so

I cry when I have it, I cry when I don't
And everyone walks away
Yeah everyone walks away
Yeah everyone walks away
Still I ask if I can stay
