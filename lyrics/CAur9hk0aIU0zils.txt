The handing down, the handing down
Maybe the truth will not be shown
And the dark will just roll on and on. Roll
O three rivers where's that star you once
Held above my faded dreams
Heart worn more than some I guess
But I'm still holding at the seams
Still holding at the seams.
Scarecrow holds an hourglass
Above the cross roads for me
Filled with tears and twilight
From a friend's dying day
And a love letter from the ace of spades
A love letter from the ace of spades
An anchor in the crown
Of Queen Anne's lace and chicory
A charm, a charm to drive away
All the heartaches I gave
All the goodbyes and the 'I love you's
I said but not in time
But mine is the heart of lonesome pine
And the choices weren't always mine
The choices weren't always mine
