When I was younger I put up with shit you wouldn't believe
That bitch was ruthless
I made excuses
She fucked my friends and with my head to get the better of me
Ya she was savage
She did damage

I guess I thought
This is what love was
What love was
I guess I thought
This is what love was

So I spent half of my twenties wasted
And killing time
Kept breaking their hearts before they got to breaking mine
No strings, no emotions
Like I was paralyzed
Who knew, who knew, who knew
That I was waiting for you
That I was waiting for you

Before I met you I was only trying to focus on me
I was resistant you were persistent
I thought the minute you were in it
You'd be trying to leave
Me broken hearted
Why even start it?

I guess I thought
This is what love was
What love was
I guess I thought
This is what love was

So I spent half of my twenties wasted
And killing time
Kept breaking their hearts before they got to breaking mine
No strings, no emotions
Like I was paralyzed
Who knew, who knew, who knew
That I was waiting for you
That I was waiting for you

You make me believe
And see things differently
I'm feeling all the feelings
You make me believe
And see things differently
I'm feeling all the feelings
(all the feelings)

So I spent half of my twenties wasted
And killing time
Kept breaking their hearts before they got to breaking mine
No strings, no emotions
Like I was paralyzed
Who knew, who knew, who knew

That I was waiting for you

That I was waiting for you

That I was waiting for you

That I was waiting for you

That I was waiting for you
