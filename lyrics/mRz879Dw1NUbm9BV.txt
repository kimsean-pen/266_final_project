The army yearns, come on dance
Push it just enough
Ancient parts, distant bloods
Take a chance my love
If I'll run pass the rocks to a wonderful
Piece of love like they can
Spirit up above

(Pre-Chorus)
Way beyond the cliff tops
When it meets the blue we will see
Just beyond her skin
Where you might be

(Chorus x2)
Disarm now
Disarm the armies and people stop
Just like disco
Being a superstar

(Verse)
All define secret get
They still passed it low
The audience stop and dance as they looked around

(Pre-Chorus)
Way beyond the cliff tops
When it meets the blue we will see
Just beyond her skin
Where you might be

(Chorus x2)
Disarm now
Disarm the armies and people stop
Just like disco
Being a superstar

(Bridge)
It's the night
I wanna kill the light
Just go easy now
I don't her playing around
Oh just go now go, baby go now
Don't waste another, yea never worry
Oh just go now go, baby go now
Just go now

(Chorus x2)
Disarm now
Disarm the armies and people stop
Just like disco
Being a superstar
