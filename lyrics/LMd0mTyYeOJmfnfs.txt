Dim all the lights sweet darling
cause tonight it's all the way
turn up the old victrola
gonna dance the night away

Love just don't come easy
no it seldom does
when you find the perfect love
let it fill you up

Dim all the lights sweet darling
cause tonight it's all the way, hey baby
turn up the old victrola
gonna dance the night away

Love just don't come easy
no it seldom does
when you find the perfect love
let it fill you up

Dim all the light sweet honey
cause tonight it's you and me
no need to worry darlin'
cause it's for eternity

Love don't come easy
this you know I understand
I want to be your woman
if you'll be my man
let yourself go freely and I'll
show you things that you've dreamed of
don't think that your dreaming
we've found the perfect love
and I'm like a cup come fill me up

Dim all the lights sweet darlin'
cause the night is on the way, oh baby
turn up the old victrola
gonna dance the night away

Do what you want
you can use me all up
take me bottom to top
don't leave even one drop

No, no, no do it tonight
you know the moment's so right
turn my brown body white
come let's dim all the lights

Dim all the lights sweet darlin'
cause the night is on the way, hey baby
turn up the old victrola
gonna dance the night away, hey baby
dim all the lights sweet darlin'
dim all the lights sweet honey...
