We played through the scenes
Called it a remedy
You can take care of me
But you know nothing about me

You started talking about
How lately the weather compliments my mood
Cause when the sun doesn't shine
And it rains in my mind
Like I got nothing left to prove
Baby it's difficult
To call you out on being cynical
Maybe you're beautiful
That doesn't mean I'll stay amused
So I'm just saying...

We played through the scenes
Called it a remedy
You can take care of me
But you know, I know

We played through the scenes
Called it a remedy
You can take care of me
But you know nothing about me

I started thinking about
Your smile that you buried in my pillow
But the present disaster
Made you choke on your laughter
Over something I don't know
(GO!)
When did I do something wrong
Besides stay up way too late
To write these songs
So I'm just saying
while you're still waiting...

We played through the scenes
Called it a remedy
You can take care of me
But you know, I know

We played through the scenes
Called it a remedy
You can take care of me
But you know nothing about me

I've got no time
(to make it seem like I've been trying)
I've got no time
(For staying true)
I've got no time
(to make it seem like I've been trying)
I've got no time
(For staying true)
Well I've got no time

We played through the scenes
Called it a remedy
You can take care of me
But you know, I know

We played through the scenes
Called it a remedy
You can take care of me
But you know, I know
