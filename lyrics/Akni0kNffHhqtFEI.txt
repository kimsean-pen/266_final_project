Is my world not fallin' down?
I'm in pieces on the ground
And my eyes aren't open and I'm standin' on my knees

But if cryin' and holdin' on
And flyin' on the ground is wrong
Then I'm sorry to let you down
But you're from my side of town and I'll miss you

Turn me up or turn me down
Turn me off or turn me 'round
I wish I could have met you in a place where we both belong

But if cryin' and holdin' on
And flyin' on the ground is wrong
Then I'm sorry to let you down
But you're from my side of town and I'll miss you

Sometimes I feel like I'm just a helpless child
Sometimes I feel like a king
But baby, since I have changed
I can't take nothin' home

City lights at a country fair
Never shine but always glare
If I'm bright enough to see you, you're just to dark to care

But if cryin' and holdin' on
And flyin' on the ground is wrong
Then I'm sorry to let you down
But you're from my side of town and I'll miss you
