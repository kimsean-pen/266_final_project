She never knows when it's raining
She only knows when it's cold
She's always saying how she hates it
How her story sounds so old

She packed her clothes in her suitcase
Then put that case in her car
She says she's gonna get so far gone
Oh so far gone
That she don't even care how far

Where did you go
And you knew you didn't know me
And you never wanted to figure me out
I didn't know
I never even saw it coming
I'll wait all my life

So come back over to the east coast
Baby, we'll figure out a way to make this work
My chest is feeling empty, always
And your only it's only cure

You know that I try so hard
I try so hard
And nothing seems to ever work
It's like I'm running
And I cannot stop, I cannot stop
Oh you just love to make this hurt

Where did you go
And you knew you didn't know me
And you never wanted to figure me out
I didn't know
I never even saw it coming
I'll wait all my life
If you give me some time

She's all alone now
She can't find her own way out
Where I am the sun's down
And she's caught up in her new west coast town

She's all alone now finding her way out
California let me down
She traded me for living the good life
Staying up all night
Darling can you hear me now?

Where did you go
And you knew you didn't know me
You never wanted to figure me out
I didn't know
I never even saw it coming
I'll wait all my life

Where did you go (woahh)
I didn't know (woahh)

I didn't know
I never even saw it coming
I'll wait all my life
If you give me some time
Give me give me
Gi-give me some time
Give me give me
Gi-give me some time
Give me give me some time
Give me give me
Gi-give me some time
If you give me some time
