Look at this mess
Look at this place I call home
No sleep no rest
Surrounded yet still alone
Drift slowly or do something

But Ive been locked down in this wasted town
They got anything you need but you cant stay sober
I gotta get the hell outta here
Been locked down in this wasted town
Where everyones a friend till they hear your over
I gotta get the hell outta here

Walk through these streets
To feel the hopelessness I
Carry with me
No matter how hard i try
Drift slowly or do something

Its always the same
Eagles and games
California to the coast of Maine
Its always the same
People and games
Do you like to play?
