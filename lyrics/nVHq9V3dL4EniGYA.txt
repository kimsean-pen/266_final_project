We wait
Love is pulling out
Calling your name
In turn to fix
Until you just die

The killer beside me
Has come to life (cut)
I'm cutting the memory
It's black and white (now kill it)

Now you can't forget about it
Make me to give up
But who cares to wanna talk about it
So you slam shut

We wait
Blood is pouring down
Cut in your veins
In turn to fix
Until you just die

The killer beside me
Has come to life (cut)
I'm cutting the memory
It's black and white (now kill it)

Now you can't forget about it
Make me to give up
But who cares to wanna talk about it
So you slam shut
Slam shut
Cut!

The killer beside me
Has come to life (cut)
I'm cutting the memory
It's black and white (now kill it)

Cut!
