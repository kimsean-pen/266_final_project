Oh babe, meet me in Tompkins Square Park
I wanna hold you in the dark
One last time
Just one last time
Oh babe, can you tell what's on my tongue?
Can you guess that I'll be gone?
With the twilight
With the twilight

And no flame burns forever, oh no
You and I both know this song too well
And most don't even last the night
No they don't, just say they don't

Oh, babe, I never been so lost
I wanna hear you live one last time
Just one last time
But oh, babe
I really wish you were not cry
I only ever told you one lie
When it could have been a thousand
It might as well been a thousand

But no flame burns forever, oh no
You and I both know this song too well
And most don't even last the night
No they don't, just say they don't
And we can talk it around again girl
Around and around
Around and around again
We could leave it out tonight
Leave it out
Just leave it out

I never tried to trick you, baby
I just tried to work it out
But I was hold swallowed up by doubt
If only things were black and white
'Cause I just want to hold you tight
Without holding back my mind
Without holding back my mind

But no flame burns forever, oh no
You and I both know this song too well
And most don't even last the night
No they don't, just say they don't
