It's a virtual system
Stories in a database
I got just enough rhythm
Enter the stereo space

Echoes in my head
Visions in the system
We can bring it back
Bit by bit, day and night

It's a virtual system
Stories in a database
I got just enough rhythm
Enter the stereo space

Visions in my head
Echoes in my database
I got just enough rhythm
I got just enough rhythm

Stories in a database
It's a virtual system
Enter the stereo space
