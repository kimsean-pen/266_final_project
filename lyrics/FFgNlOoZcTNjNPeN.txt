Sweating blood
Wading in mud
Pulling heavy carriage
On this road to nowhere
Pounding rain
A roaring thunder
Trying to maintain sanity

Fading consciousness
Every whiplash throws me back to this nightmare
I will break my leash
I will break the bond between us
And prove my innocence

Running through the woods
And an open field
A feeling of freedom
Is just passing by
Once I was a hunter
Now I've become prey
They can tear me to pieces
But my ghost will stay whole

I am exhausted
Feels like I'm reaching the end
I keep on falling
You were my master
You treated me like a pet
Now I have my own opinion

Cut off the ropes
Seal my wounds
Let me run away to find my brigade
Give back my name
And my dignity
I want to run free with my brigade

I was your slave with no name
You defiled my body
But you couldn't destroy my soul
I'm the growing rage
I'll break all the chains
No one can stop me
I give you salvation

Now it's my turn to look down on you
While you're digging your own grave
I am immortal
I will make you lose your mind
And you will see the light

Cut off the ropes
Seal my wounds
Let me run away to find my brigade
Give back my name
And my dignity
I want to run free with my brigade
