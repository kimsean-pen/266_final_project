This is the same as a game not having an end

能無しの口叩きってやつを現実で捩じ伏せ
蛙鳴蝉噪並べる無知を潰せ
Before I Decay

Please abandon instinct
I was stuck in a loop of a vicious circle
It was a mistake to have entrusted you
I die at abnormal speed

This is the same as a maze not having an end
不変の人間心裏

能無しの口叩きってやつを現実で捩じ伏せ
蛙鳴蝉噪並べる無知を潰せ
Before I Decay

Please abandon instinct
I was stuck in a loop of a vicious circle
It was a mistake to have entrusted you
I die at abnormal speed

Only the rumor is splendid
Disappear with a sexual
You sold even us to protect oneself
You are powerless than anyone

Watch me...

繰り返す為にまた笑えばいいの?
繰り返す為にもう...
I cannot laugh

Before I Decay

Please abandon instinct
I was stuck in a loop of a vicious circle
It was a mistake to have entrusted you
It was a mistake...

Please abandon instinct
I was stuck in a loop of a vicious circle
It was a mistake to have entrusted you
I die at abnormal speed
