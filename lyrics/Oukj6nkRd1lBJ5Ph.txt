So, oh, uh, ooh

What happened to the man who used to take me
Straight into misery
I want you back and now I must admit it shames me
How could this be?

Tell me what's this desperation
'Cause I don't recognize these chains
I think I made a bad mistake

'Cause once I ran away
I loved you since the day
The day I broke your heart (heart, heart, heart, heart)
It's more than I could take
I loved you since the day
The day we fell apart (part, part, p-part, part)

Now everything is coming undone
'Cause you were the chance I can't afford to waste
I loved you since the day
The day we fell apart, oh

I must admit the grass is so much greener
On the other side
Since you left I noticed now you're so much meaner
And it's something I think I like

Tell me what's this desperation
'Cause I don't recognize these chains
I think I made a bad mistake

'Cause once I ran away
I loved you since the day
The day I broke your heart (heart, heart, heart, heart)
It's more than I could take
I loved you since the day
The day we fell apart (part, part, part, part)

Now everything is coming undone
'Cause you were the chance I can't afford to waste
I loved you since the day
The day we fell apart

I made a bad mistake
Used to pray for sins
Drowning you one more time
And mend my wicked ways
'Cause once I ran away
I loved you since the day, the day I broke your heart (heart, heart, h-heart, heart)
It's more than I could take
I loved you since the day, the day we fell apart (part, part, p-part, part)
Now everything is coming undone [(coming undone)]
'Cause you were the chance I can't afford to waste
I loved you since the day, the day we fell apart
The day we fell apart, oh
Uh, oh, ooh yeah
