Oh, the cuckoo she's a pretty bird
She warbles as she flies
But I never give her water
Till the forth day of July.

It is often that I wonder
Why women love men
And I look back and I wonder
Why men are men.

Oh, the cuckoo she's a pretty bird
She warbles as she flies
But I never give her water
Till the forth day of July.

Gonna build me another castle
On a mountain so high
So then I can see my true love
As she passes by.

Oh, the cuckoo she's a pretty bird
She warbles as she flies
But I never give her water
Till the forth day of July.

Jack of Diamonds, Jack of Diamonds
I know you of old
You have robbed my poor pockets
Of silver and of gold.

Oh, the cuckoo she's a pretty bird
She warbles as she flies
But I never give her water
Till the forth day of July
