Don't wanna be adored
I want more
Don't wanna be adored
I want more, yeah

'Cause it's you that I'm thinking of
As I fall into the sun
And I know now just what it was
'Cause it worked just like it should

Don't wanna be adored
I want more
Don't wanna be ignored
I want more, yeah

'Cause it's you that I'm thinking of
As I fall into the sun
And I know now just what it was
'Cause it worked just like it should
(I wanna know)

Promise me, we could be
But I don't wanna know
That's enough, things get rough
And I won't work it out
Everything in between the time
Won't help us out
That's enough, is this love?
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know

'Cause it's you that I'm thinking of
As I fall into the sun
