For a while, to love was all we could do
We were young and we knew and our eyes were alive
Deep inside we knew our love was true

For a while, we paid no mind to the past
We knew love would last, every night something right
Would invite us to begin the dance

Something happened along the way
What used to be happy was sad
Something happened along the way
And yesterday was all we had

And oh
After the love has gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around?

Oh, oh, oh
After the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?

For a while, to love each other with all
We would ever need love, was strong for so long
Never knew that what was wrong, (oh baby) wasn't right

We tried to find what we had
'Till sadness was all we shared
(We were scared) This affair would lead our love into

Something happened along the way
Yesterday was all we had
Something happened along the way
What used to be happy is sad
Something happened along the way
Oh, yesterday was all we had

And oh
After the love has gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around?

Oh, oh, oh
After the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, OH!
After the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?

Oh, woah, woah
After the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?

Oh, woah, woah
After the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?
Oh, woah, woah

Oh, woah, woah
After the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?

Woah, woah, woah
After the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?
Woah, woah woah
