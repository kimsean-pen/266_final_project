Sit still and close your eyes
What's behind the other door?
Ooh, no more silence
Don't kill this thing we got called love
Just searching for the perfect drug

When love comes calling
Don't look back
When love comes calling
Don't look away
When love comes calling
Don't look back
When love comes calling
Don't look away

And I'm standing over here
Watching you over there
Smiling, happy, unaware
Oh, life is spinning 'round
You're going underground
Forgetting who you are
Let's try and keep it
Just one more day

When love comes calling
Don't look back
When love comes calling
Don't look away
When love comes calling
Don't look back
When love comes calling
Don't look away

You take your love, throw it all around
Like it's nothing special, just a sound
Let me say one more thing:
I don't think you realize
That a day is like a year sometimes

When love comes calling
Don't look back
When love comes calling
Don't look away
When love comes calling
Don't look back
When love comes calling
Don't look away

When love comes calling
Don't look back
When love comes calling
Don't look away
When love comes calling
Don't look back
When love comes calling
Don't look away
