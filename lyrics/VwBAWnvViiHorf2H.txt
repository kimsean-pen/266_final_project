Throwing shoes, cursing you again
No make-up sex, now help me rest my head
Take my wine, I'll be fine tomorrow morning
Forget the strain my drunken nights will bring

'Cause I get myself in trouble when I drink too much, think too much
And you're somehow on my mind when I drink too much, think too much

Summer haze lonely days again
And casual sex to help forget the pain
Not this time I cross the line tomorrow's coming
Forget the words, I said them out of hurt

'Cause I get myself in trouble
When I drink too much, think too much
You're somehow on my mind
When I drink too much, think too much
'Cause I get myself in trouble
When I drink too much, think too much
You're somehow on my mind
When I drink too much, think too much

And if we only had one more chance
Baby, I would never run without your hand
And if we only had one more chance
I would dream so much less next time

'Cause I get myself in trouble
When I drink too much, think too much
You're somehow on my mind
When I drink too much, think too much
'Cause I get myself in trouble
When I drink too much, think too much
You're somehow on my mind
When I drink too much, think too much

Much
Much
Much
