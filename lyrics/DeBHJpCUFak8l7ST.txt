Oh baby when you talk about it
I get so ecstatic
You invoke the rabbit in me

Shake your tail feather
Boy go up and down
Play your song and
Everyone is bound to love you

Don't stop until the music says you should
I'd be stoked if you would leave this venue with me

My place is just a block away but if you
Choose to stay then baby don't be late I'm gonna

Show you a good time, a good time
I've got collaboration on my mind

Fly
Into my
Frequency
B2B

Oh baby can we slow it down a bit
I'm exhausted and it's only 4 am

I think your song is just too fast for me
I'm so 85 and you're 170

You know our sound is so compatible
We're adorable it's supernatural

Well maybe we should try a different speed
Half the rhythm but we'll keep the energy

Oh baby when you talk about it
I get so ecstatic you invoke the magic in me

I think we might've made a masterpiece

(Shake your tail feather
Boy go up and down)

Show you a good time, a good time
I've got collaboration on my mind
