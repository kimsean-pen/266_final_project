If you were here
baby we'd increase the dose
there was no fear
in my room when we got close
call me anytime you've got a ghost

you're the only person in the world
I feel that way about
and if you move off to the side
i'll get swept back out
where it's cold but not that deep
cos your legs grow
cold but not that deep
cos your legs grow

there's a lot that rises up
from the bottom of the lake
and its beam has hit me hard
now i'm wide awake
where it's cold but not that deep
cos your legs grow
cold but not that deep
cos your legs grow

if you were here
baby we'd increase the dose
there was no fear
in my room when we got close
call me anytime you've got a ghost
