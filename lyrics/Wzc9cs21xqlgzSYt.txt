What do you want me to do?
Run to the top of the stairs and yell, "Forgive me?"
For you, I throw myself away, yeah
Through the windowpane
I know your kind, little figurine
You want some whiskey and a tambourine
To fill my solace with insanity
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do?
Try to rein you in as you make a situation?
And you, you always find a way to pin all the blame on me
I hope your weekend in the wilderness
You got your peace, love and happiness
But now you're home and I'm a total mess
What do you want me to do?
(What do you want me to do?)
What do you want me to do?
I'm stranded in a forest of barely formed intentions
And you, you left me here waiting for way too many years
When you land in eternity
I hope you save a little place for me
A tiny window so that I can see out
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do? (Oh, oh)
What do you want me to do? (Oh, oh)
What do you want me to do?
