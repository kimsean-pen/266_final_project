He's the one, pure in his heart
Shining fear in the bliss never lost
Noble grace, innocent faith
Running throughout the fields immense
Shouting free in the air again
Dancing there with the wind

Sudden gust hit my face, burning rain tore the clouds
From depth of the gloaming
THUNDER CAME!!!

On a mountain I saw it
When lightning reached out for him
Enchanting my eyes
In magical rhapsody
On a mountain I watched him
As power filled up his veins
Surrounded by dusk
As the rain from the heavens were falling
Falling...

And lone he might be on the ways of this world
His sword, sole companion, always there

On a mountain I watched him
When proudly he swung his steel
Entracing my heart
In mystical harmony
On a mountain I saw it
When knowledge aroused his sense
Encircled by clouds
In the gales now enlightened reborn

Whooaaa...

Wish I could fly through this land beloved
Not in my dream, nor by spell then bound
Paradise here in the fields immense
Here is my life, not above
How could I leave this place?

Wish I could fly through this land beloved
Not in my dream, nor by spell then bound
Paradise here in the fields immense
If I return to this world, here I will live again

Strenghtened by fury, I feel no fear
Fire inside, it keeps me awake
For no blind I ever shall bend!
This is my law! This is my way!

Hey!

Insight's my power, truth is my breath
Free in my thoughts I always remain!
Choose to take a different path
Strong in the storms, pure through the waste

Na-naaa...

Stand up, oh brothers over the world!
Enemies are there and mostly the same
We are a kind that never gives in!
We are a flame born in the wind!

Hey!

Time's of no matter, it never was!
World is the same, just different form
Freedom is something one doesn't earn
Always your own! Graced by the will!

Na-naaa...

He's the one, pure in his heart
Shining fear in the pride never lost
Noble grace, unbroken faith
Running throughout the fields immense
Shouting free in the air embraced
Dancing there with the wind

Whooaaa...
