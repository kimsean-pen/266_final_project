I'm back on the edge again
Can't help what they telling me
I'm back on the edge again
Say you wanna mess with me
But if I tell you how I feel
I know you'll run away
Everyone the fucking same
I'm back on my own again
Edge again
Can't help what they telling me
I'm back on the edge again
Say you wanna mess with me
But if I tell you how I feel
I know you'll run away
Everyone the fucking same
I'm back on my own again

My money higher than ever
But my tears up all in my m-e
Got an annoying bitch named depression
These gals jealous 'cause she get some of me
All of my time, all of my attention
All up in my mind, she love it when I'm stressing
I try block her out, she keeps sending messages
She calling all the time, I'm searching for an ex
Can you please help me find my way?
Different sides of me that I try to see
I'm screaming inside, inside the pain
I got demons around inside of me

I'm back on the edge again
Can't help what they telling me
I'm back on the edge again
Say you wanna mess with me
But if I tell you how I feel
I know you'll run away
Everyone the fucking same
I'm back on my own again
Edge again
Can't help what they telling me
I'm back on the edge again
Say you wanna mess with me
But if I tell you how I feel
I know you'll run away
Everyone the fucking same
I'm back on my own again

I'm back on the edge again
Can't help what they telling me
I'm back on the edge again
Say you wanna mess with me
But if I tell you how I feel
I know you'll run away
Everyone the fucking same
I'm back on my own again
Ba-ba-back on my own again
I-I'm back on my own again
Ba-ba-back
I-I-I'm back on my own again
