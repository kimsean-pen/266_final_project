This is the call to the Broken
(The Broken)

Take it from me

They dont care
If you're Lonely
As you can see

They dont care
If you're scared
Your heart
Is the only friend you have
In this whole world

Don't start to think
You can't do this yourself
This is the call out
This is the call to the Broken
(Stand up)
To all the ones who've been thrown away
This is the call to the Broken

(Stand up)
Stand up and take back your world today
(Stand up)

I know
What you're thinking
You say
You're tired of keeping score

Just me
You're not the only one going through this
You see
I've been through this before.
(This before)
This is the call out.
This is the call to the Broken

(Stand up)
To all the ones who've been thrown away
This is the call to the Broken
(Stand up)
Stand up and take back your world today.
This is the call to the Broken

(Stand up)
We're gonna do this our own way
This is the call to the Broken
(Stand up)

Stand up and take back your world today.
They found their strings in our weakness
To Keep us down and we fall down
But now we hold on the pieces
To change the world
This is the call out.
This is the call to the Broken
(Stand up)
To all the ones who've been thrown away
This is the call to the Broken
(Stand up)
Stand up and take back your world today.
This is the call to the Broken
(Stand up)
We're gonna do this our own way
This is the call to the Broken
(Stand up)
Stand up and take back your world today.
