I need you here to calm me down
I need you here to calm me down

That day in New York, I spun out
I fell short, but I felt close to you
One night in Detroit, I thought there
Was no point but I felt close to you

Everyone tellin' me what to do
What to think, where to be
But everyday, everyday, everyday's fillin' up with my anxiety
I can barely open up my eyes
Open up my eyes, eyes, eyes

I need you here to calm me down
I need you here to calm me down
I don't know if I can stay strong
Hold on, for too long
I've been lost
I need you here to calm me down
I need you here to calm me

That day in Brooklyn, I spun out
You jumped in and I felt close to you
One night in LA, I thought there
Was no way but I felt close to you

Everyone tellin' me what to do
What to think, where to be
But everyday, everyday, everyday's fillin' up with my anxiety
I can barely open up my eyes
Open up my eyes, eyes, eyes

I need you here to calm me down
I need you here to calm me down
I don't know if I can stay strong
Hold on, for too long
I've been lost
I need you here to calm me down
I need you here to calm me
Down, down
I need you here to calm me
Down, down
I need you here to calm me

Everyone tellin' me what to do
What to think, where to be
But everyday, everyday, everyday's fillin' up with my anxiety
I can barely open up my eyes
Open up my eyes
All this paranoia's got my vision going blind

Everybody tellin' me where to go
How to live, how to see
But everyday's, everyday's, everyday's fillin' up with insecurities
I can barely open up my eyes
Open up my eyes, eyes, eyes

I need you here to calm me down
I need you here to calm me down

I need you here to calm me down
I need you here to calm me down
I don't know if I can stay strong
Hold on, for too long
I've been lost
I need you here to calm me down

I need you here to calm me
Down, down
I need you here to calm me
Down, down
I need you here to calm me
