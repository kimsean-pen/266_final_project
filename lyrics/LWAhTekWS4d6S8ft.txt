Laying in your car when the lights go low
Dancing in the dark with you on my shoulder
And I don't even know what you came here for
All I know is I just want you closer

Yeah but it's all in my head
Yeah I made a mess again
Yeah I'm just the last one going out the door without you

I take cold showers to remember I'm not with you
I leave with someone else to act like I don't miss you
I can't pretend I won't give in
I hate myself for giving you the things I give you
When I know that it's over

I'm starting to hate how this all played out
Cause you don't understand that I am trying
Maybe I'm a mess and God knows how
I'd do anything to justify it

Yeah but it's all in my head
Yeah I made a mess again
Yeah I'm just the last one seeing you for what I should be

I take cold showers to remember I'm not with you
I leave with someone else to act like I don't miss you
I can't pretend I won't give in
I hate myself for giving you the things I give you
When I know that it's over

I take cold showers to remember I'm not with you
I leave with someone else to act like I don't miss you
I can't pretend I won't give in
I hate myself for giving you the things I give you
When I know that it's over
