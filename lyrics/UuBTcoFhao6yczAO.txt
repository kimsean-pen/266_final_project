All damn night, I was here waiting
Cooked your favourite, dressed up real nice
I know you were with her, I know that you kissed her
You came home late when I was so mad
Had my break up speech ready
Then you kissed my face, it's the way you persuade me

You're dirty, disgusting
But I can't get enough of your loving
Boy, I hate you, really hate you
My momma said I shouldn't date you
You're cheatin', you're lyin'
I know that you're hidin' two cellphones
But, boy, right before I say that it's the end

You sweet talk me again, yo
I don't wanna be friends, no
Why am I such a fool when it comes to you?
A, B, C, D, E-E-eee, F.U

All my friends say I'm a sucker
Can't explain, it's complicated
I wish you were dead 'til you take me to bed
You're so good, so good, you lead on, my love
Oh, them brown eyes and that body
I'll get my revenge, take my key to your Benz

You're dirty, disgusting
But I can't get enough of your loving
Boy, I hate you, really hate you
My momma said I shouldn't date you
You're cheatin', you're lyin'
I know that you're hidin' two cellphones
But, boy, right before I say that it's the end

You sweet talk me again, yo
I don't wanna be friends, no
Why am I such a fool when it comes to you?
A, B, C, D, E-E-eee, F.U

I wanna say, Shoo, shoo
I wanna say, Screw you
I practice my lies in the mirror
Then you smile, that's my killer
So I say, Love you
And, Baby, I need you
Cause you're drop dead gorgeous
And Cupid ain't coming to warn us

You're dirty, disgusting
But I can't get enough of your loving
Boy, I hate you, really hate you
My momma said I shouldn't date you

You're cheatin', you're lyin'
I know that you're hidin' two cellphones
But boy, right before I say that it's the end

You sweet talk me again, yo
I don't wanna be friends, no
Why am I such a fool when it comes to you?

A, B, C, D, E-E-eee, F.U
