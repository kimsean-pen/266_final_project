Three thousand miles away I'm feeling something desperate
Came with one life to change so you're the one I left with
(I) I think I found myself in the new light today
(So I) so I let these chemicals and poison lead the way

I feel when you're looking at me
That you're far from happy
If only we could wait for the truth
When you know it's not so dramatic
Let's cut through the static
And be the living, the living proof

You're in your head again, this place has got you trembling
I'll be your medicine if you help write the alternate ending
(I) I thought I found myself in the new light today
(So I) but the darkness inside me it pushes you away

Pushes you away

I feel when you're looking at me
That you're far from happy
If only we could wait for the truth
When you know it's not so dramatic
Let's cut through the static
And be the living, the living proof

Show is ending into overtime
It's not yours to fix, no it's all mine
You decided, I'm indecisive
Now it's all that you want to believe

I feel when you're looking at me
That you're far from happy
If only you could

And I feel when you're looking at me
That you're far from happy
If only we could wait for the truth
When you know it's not so dramatic
Let's cut through the static
And be the living, the living proof

Think I found myself in the new light today
And be the living, the living proof
So I let these chemicals and poison lead the way
And be the living, the living proof
