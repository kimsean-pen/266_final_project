Slow down, stepping up my game
Tied to you, try not sink on through the cracks
And maybe I could forget this town
And maybe I should get out

Ooh
There's something about your love
Can you feel it, ooh
There's something about your love
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Can you feel it

Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Can you feel it

Right now, I'm feeling like a astronaut
I'm fading to the thought of coming back to you
And maybe I should forget this town
And maybe I could get out

Ooh
There's something about your love
Can you feel it, ooh
There's something about your love
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Can you feel it

Ooh
There's something about your love
Can you feel it, ooh
There's something about your love
Can you feel it
