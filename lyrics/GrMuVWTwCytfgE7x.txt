Always
I remember you
Slow down
So I can follow you

And you
Such a fearless soul
Disarmed me by truth, and broke my mold
Always
I remember you
Slow down
And try to tell the truth

And I know
I'm just a coward when it comes to love
Disarmed by words
Like an old white stain

Goodbye
My deeper child
Time for you to take down your barricades
And follow your own heart now

Always
I remember you
Slow down
And try to tell the truth
Always
I can recall you
Can you slow down
So I can follow you?

Deep down
You said I'm a coward when it comes to love
Deep down
Your words changed my mold
Deep down
You said I'm a coward when it comes to love
Deep down
Your barricades changed my mold
