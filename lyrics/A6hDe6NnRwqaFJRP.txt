Promised you a miracle
Belief is a beauty thing
Promises, promises
As golden days break wondering

Chance
As love takes a train
Summer breeze and brilliant light
Only love she sees
He controls on love
Love sails to a new life

Promised you a miracle
Belief is a beauty thing
Promises, promises
As golden days break wondering

Only love she sees
He controls on love
Life throws a curve
Everything is possible
With promises
Everything is possible
Oh oh

I promised you a miracle
Belief is a beauty thing
Promises, promises
As golden days break wondering

Chance
Reflects on them a while
Love screams so quietly
Slipping back on golden times
Breathing with sweet memories

I promised you a miracle
Belief is a beauty thing
Promises, promises
As golden days break wondering

Only love she sees
He controls on love
Life throws a curve
Everything is possible
In the game of life
Everything is possible

Chance
Lost pearls of great price
Take care of family
Only aches for love
Love waits for fame
In chance, in chance, they'll see

I promised you a miracle
Belief is a beauty thing
Promises, promises
As golden days break wondering

Only love she sees
He controls on love
Life throws a curve
Everything is possible
In the game of life
A burning dream
You can be Queen
Everything is possible...
