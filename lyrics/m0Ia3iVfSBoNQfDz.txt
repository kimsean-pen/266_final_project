Listen as a lost devotion
Whispers like an unfound clue
Covers, cools, and clangs like motion
To the corpse it's applied to
I texted you to say I'm sorry
Am I though? And what about?
Because I deserve to smack the grim taste in my mouth
Do I swallow like I've always done for you?

No surprise the ghost that's claimed your eyes
Has got his shades back on
Is it you this face I look into
Or erase tracks that you've drawn?

Yeah and he's down by the wall
He's down by the wall
Sittin' Indian style

Silence screams when it's unbroken
Boy, I try so hard on you
All you've thought but haven't spoken
Say it now I know you want to
Shiny grains of crucial moments
Fall into the grave while you
Hide out in the orchard
That the devil lured you to
Like a black sheep flocking thinking it's alone

Picture this replacing me
Abyss you've painted my face on
Can't you feel my love for you is realer
Than the beast you're racing from?

Yeah and he's down by the wall
He's down by the wall
Sittin' Indian style
