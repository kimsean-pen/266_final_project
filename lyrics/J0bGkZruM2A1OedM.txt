Clear-eyed girl
In a crooked way
All the crooked walkin
To avoid and evade
Hair like maple, skin like cream
Bet they say I love you
When you strip them thin

Baby, you're so vague
That you probably think this song ain't about you

Green eyed boys
Lick the razor blade
Girl I think I love you
And the mess you made
Setting you up
It don't get you down
When you flash your fangs
You own this town

Baby, you're so vague
That you probably think this song ain't about you
