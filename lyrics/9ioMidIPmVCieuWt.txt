Well I can hear the world a-turning
To the sound of a broken wheel
And I listen as I learn how to feel
Somewhere there's a shadowed window
Reflecting on the both of us
Showing seven different shades of loss of trust

Sweet embrace
All my days
I've been holding on
I'd give it all but they just wanna take
Sweet embrace
All my days
I've been holding on
I'd give it all but this world just wants to take

Sorrow, sorrow, let me go
Sorrow, sorrow, let me go

Birds are singing songs in the morning
The songs of sticks and words
As I'm waiting for that broken wheel to turn
Staring at my own reflection
Wondering what I'd see
If I let my imperfections get a hold of me

Sorrow, sorrow, let me go
Sorrow, sorrow, let me go

Sweet embrace
All my days
I've been holding on
I'd give it all but they just wanna take
Sweet embrace
All my days
I've been holding on
I'd give it all but this world just wants to take

(Sorrow, sorrow)
Sweet embrace
(Let me go)
All my days
(Sorrow, sorrow)
I've been holding on
(Let me go)
I'd give it all but they just wanna take
(Sorrow, sorrow)
Sweet embrace
(Let me go)
All my days
(Sorrow, sorrow)
I've been holding on
(Let me go)
I'd give it all but this world just wants to take
