As pilgrims here, we sometimes journey
To who knows what; to who knows what?
Come and sing this simple story
That god forgot; that life forgot

'Cause don't you know god is disabled?
Is disabled, he's disabled
Clouds may gather all around you
But he is disabled, is disabled

He's no friend to the friendless
And he's the mother of grief
There's only sorrow for tomorrow
Surely, life is too brief
Surely, love is too brief
