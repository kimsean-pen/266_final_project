Oh me, oh my-oh
Look at Miss Ohio
She's a-running around with her rag-top down
She says, I want to do right but not right now

Gonna drive to Atlanta
And live out this fantasy
Running around with the rag-top down
Yeah, I want to do right, but not right now

Had your arm around her shoulder
A regimental soldier
And mama starts pushing that wedding gown
Yeah, you want to do right, but not right now

Oh me, oh my-oh
Would you look at Miss Ohio
She's a-running around with the rag-top down
She says, I want to do right, but not right now

And I know all about it
So you don't have to shout it
I'm gonna straighten it out somehow
Yeah, I want to do right, but not right now

Oh me, oh my-oh
Look at Miss Ohio
She's a-running around with her rag-top down
She says, I want to do right, but not right now
Oh, I want to do right, but not right now
