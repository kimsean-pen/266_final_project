I was stronger that night
I wanted to go alone
The rain was coming down
And nobody could leave the state around
I said things I need like
Alaska and the bears
You knew you couldn't fight
Swimming underneath the Northern Kights

You didn't know it
But I had you in the palm of my hand
Palm of my hand

I confess I needed you there
I've gone through every memory we shared tonight
And I don't have the guts to carry on without you
When storm breaks through I'll be standing there
Waiting for you
Waiting for you
Waiting for you

I can dream or realise
Head? Southern tip of Africa
And put up all the fences that you like
But I can see you feeling
On your own there
You're on your own

I didn't know it
I thought I had you in the palm of my hand
Palm of my hand

I confess I needed you there
I've gone through every memory we shared tonight
And I don't have the guts to carry on without you
When storm breaks through I'll be standing there
Waiting for you

Take me down love me in the avenue
It'll never be what you wanted to
Was it like this with her
Is it everything you dreamed of?

I, I, I thought I had you in the palm of my hand
Palm of my hand

I confess I needed you there
I've gone through every memory we shared tonight
And I don't have the guts to carry on without you
When storm breaks through I'll be standing there
Waiting for you
Waiting for you
Waiting for you

Are you ready, tell me when you want to go
Are you ready, tell me when you want to go
