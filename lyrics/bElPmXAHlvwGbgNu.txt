Yeah, yeah, oh!

(I-69)
(I-69)

I-69, oh.
Two at a time, oh.
So intertwined, oh.
Truly divine, oh.

(I tell you the best)
That wonderful, oh.
Magical, oh.
A sensation of, oh.
Mutual love, oh.

Cuz the best,
(I tell you the best)
The best is mutual,
The best, oh yeah,
(I tell you the best)
The best is mutual.

One twist of fate, oh.
A figure eight, oh.
Why don't we take, oh,
The interstate, oh.

I swear it's the best.
Oh yes.
(I swear it's the best)
The best is mutual.
Oh the best,
(Oh)
Oh yes,
(I tell you the best)
The best is mutual.

And even if you're not a pro,
I came to let you know,
That there's only one who,
Only one who,
That do unto me as I do unto.
Though it's true,
That the best love,
Is mutual.

(It's a groovy new way to travel.)
(Take a chance on I-69.)
(It's an equal distribution.)
(Never hurry, just take your time.)
(What a wonderful way to mingle.)
(If you get a chance, take the highway.)
(It's a journey you shant regret.)
