When I'm feelin' lonely,
Someone telephone me,
It's gettin' hard to pass my time.

Take me out'a dieing,
Watch me while I'm flyin',
Baby, it's a waste of time.

I need a man, perhaps a man like you,
I need a man, to make my dreams come true.

Say that you will find him,
Creeping up behind him,
Moving round' the town all day.

Well, I'm underestimated,
Highly underated,
Can there be another way?

I need a man, perhaps a man like you,
I need a man, and I need a man.

And then I won't be feelin' lonely,
Knowing I'm the only one.

He'll understand,
Oh, what I'm feelin' deep inside me,
Knowing that at last he's gone.

Oh well,
Gettin' tired of lookin',
Wastin' all my cookin,
Ending in a dreadful row.

Can somebody tell me,
Say to me, or sell me,
Why I'm feelin' lonely, oh.

I need a man, perhaps a man like you,
I need a man to make my dreams,
And I need a man.

And at night I won't be lonely,
Knowing I'm the only one.

He'll understand,
Oh, what I'm feelin' deep inside me,
Knowing that at last he's gone.

It's maybe that I'm dreaming,
Can't say they I've seen him,
Somehow, I just got to find.

Someone outstanding,
Goes without (?),
(?)

I need a man like you, to make my dreams come true,
Perhaps that man is you!
