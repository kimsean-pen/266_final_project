Park the car at the side of the road
You should know
Time's tide will smother you
And I will too

When you laugh about people
Who feel so very lonely
Their only desire is to die

Well, I'm afraid
It doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh

But that joke isn't funny anymore
It's too close to home
And it's too near the bone

It's too close to home
And it's too near the bone
More than you'll ever know

Kick them when they fall down
Kick them when they fall down
You kick them when they fall down
Kick them when they fall down

You kick them when they fall down
Kick them when they fall down
You kick them when they fall down
Kick them when they fall down

It was dark as I drove the point home
And on cold leather seats
Well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my face after all

I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine

I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine, oh

I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine
Happening in mine, happening in mine
Happening in mine, happening in mine

I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now, now, now, it's happening in mine
Happening in mine, now, now

I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine
Happening in mine, happening in mine
Happening in mine

I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now, now, now, it's happening in mine
Mine, mine, mine, oh
