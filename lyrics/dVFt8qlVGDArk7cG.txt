Baby look at all that shines
Baby's down on the world and she knows it
If your spirit's runnin'
Why don't we make it rain like we used to

We run, we hide
We wait and want for the good life
Oh sure, you're right
This ain't, the good life

Aah, elegantly wasted
Aah, elegantly wasted

Look at all the crimes
Baby's down on the world 'cause she owns it
Makin' up her life
Nothin' more, nothin' less makes it voodoo

We run, we hide
We want, the good life
Oh sure, you're right
This ain't, the good life

Aah, elegantly wasted
Aah, elegantly wasted

Well look at all that shines
Baby's down on the world and she knows it
If your spirit's fine
Why don't we make it rain like we used to?

We run, we hide
We want the good life
Oh sure, you're right
This ain't, the good life

Aah, elegantly wasted
Aah, elegantly wasted
(You could be right)
(You could be certain)
(You could be right)

Aah, elegantly wasted
(You could be right)
(You could be certain)
(You could be right)

Aah, elegantly wasted
(You could be right)
(You could be certain)
(You could be right)
(Feels right, feels right)

Elegantly wasted, you could be right
Elegantly wasted, you could be right
Elegantly wasted, you could be right
You could be certain
(Elegantly wasted)
You could be right, just like, just like

Elegantly wasted, you could be right
Elegantly wasted, you could be right
Feels like, feels like
Elegantly wasted, elegantly wasted
Elegantly wasted, elegantly wasted
Elegantly wasted, elegantly wasted
Elegantly wasted
