Wo yoy
Wo yoy, yoy, yoy

We all gonna sing the same song
We all gonna sing the same song
We all gonna sing the same song

Or whether you're a Bobo (Bobo, Bobo)
Or whether you're an Orthodox
Or whether you're a Binghi Natty Dread
Or whether you're ah Twelve Tribes of Israel

We all gonna sing the same song
We all gonna jam the same jam, uh
We all gonna chuck the same chuck

So if you argue, fuss and fight (that's not right)
We're giving hypocrites the right to say
That we can't unite (my God)
It we dignify

We all gonna sing the same song
We all gonna jam the same jam, jammin'
We all gonna chuck the same chuck

Take us out of our homeland,
You take us down here in Babylon
Wanted us to sing you that same song
You wanted us to sing you that same song
You wanted us to sing you that same song (and I know)
We all gonna sing the same song
We all gonna jam the same jam
We all gonna chuck the same chuck

So if you argue, fuss and fight (that's not right)
You're giving hypocrites the right to say
That we can't unite (my God I know)
It we dignify (?)

We all going to sing the same song
We all gonna jam the same jam
We all gonna chuck the same chuck
We all gonna chuck the same chuck
We all gonna jam the same jam
We all going to sing the same song
