This is the beat that makes your mother cry.

I wanna be honest.
I want to be bad.
I want to destroy you.
I want to move fast.
I want the attention.
I want all the cash.
I want all the ass.
Is it too much to ask?
I want to be faithful.
I want to be raw.

I want to be ignorant,
And I want to know all.
I want to die someday.
I want to live long.
I want what I ask for,
And I get what I want.

I'm thinking we should ride,
To a place that we don't know,
To a place where no one's seen us before.
I'm thinking, you and I,
Better just go with the flow,
Last thing that we should do is go slow.

I'm thinking we should ride,
To a place that we don't know,
To a place where no one's seen us before.
I'm thinking, you and I,
Better just go with the flow.
Last thing that we should do is go slow.

(This is the beat that makes your mother cry.)

I think that I'm human.
I think about God.
I think of the chances.
I think that I'm wrong.
I think to be thoughtful,
I know that I'm not.
You think I'm a fake,
And I know you're a fraud.

I fuck 'cause I need to.
I fuck when I want.
I'll fuck you in love,
Even though it is not.
I'll fucking digest you,
One kiss at a time.
You wish I was yours,
And I hope that you're mine.

I'm thinking we should ride,
To a place that we don't know,
To a place where no one's seen us before.
I'm thinking, you and I,
Better just go with the flow.
Last thing that we should do is go slow.

I'm thinking we should ride,
To a place that we don't know,
To a place where no one's seen us before.
I'm thinking, you and I,
Better just go with the flow.
Last thing that we should do is go slow.
Go fast, go fast!
Go fast, go fast!

(This is the beat that makes your mother cry.)
Oh no, no...
Blacker than the white
Everything's white
But it's blacker than I know
And blacker than the white of the snow, yeah
I'm thinking, you and I
No, no, oh no, no
