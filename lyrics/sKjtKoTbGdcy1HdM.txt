You're being watched by a pattern underneath you,
drunken thoughts, wrong doings,
as they remember who??? lying, cheated while his heart turned cold,
and his life became sold to some alcohol,
i see the???? of a storytale,
i've come to cry,
i've come to love,
i've come for help,
i cried, i tried,
and i cannot find peace,
heads or tales come and find out how much we see,
when he walks on the train,
with no coins in his pockets,
you don't know the backstory,
