As she walks down the stairs,
Suddenly the whole room stands in pairs.
No ones arm to hold, not for now.
Sleepless nights alone.
As she walks down the stairs
She's not enough.

"Why is nobody alone but me?
What is it that everyone else has?"

A spine. A mind.
And I'm just not like them
They've got pretty eyes and white lies
And real friends, I'll never fit in.
I'm different.

As he walks in the house
Everybody's got him figured out.
And all the girls lay traps it seems for him.
Can he take one back?
As he walks, in the house he's not enough.

What is it that everyone else has?

A spine. A mind.
And I'm just not like them
They've got pretty eyes and white lies
And real friends, I'll never fit in.
I'm different.

So what is it that everyone else has?
Just tell me everything you know
What is it that?

A spine. A mind.
And I'm just not like them
They've got pretty eyes and white lies
And real friends, I'll never fit in.
A spine. A mind.
And I'm just not like them
They've got pretty eyes and white lies
And real friends, I'll never fit in.
And real friends, I'll never fit in.
