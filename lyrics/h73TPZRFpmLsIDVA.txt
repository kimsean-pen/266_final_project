Here comes
One of my saddest days
A pain tomorrow won't relieve

And I know
Only time is said to heal
But years will fly before I can breathe

I'll keep on trying
But I won't let you go

I'll keep you safe
In a secret place
Until I find my freedom
Goodbye my friend
Love will never end
You will live in my heart

Time erased
So much of what you were
Though I tried to hide you deep

Gone forever
What is left for me to keep?
Joys that I cannot remember

I keep on calling
I want you to know

I'll keep you safe
In a secret place
Until I find my freedom
Goodbye my friend
Love will never end
You will live...

I will try to carry on
I will try to move on
I should try to let you go
As you have before

I'll keep you safe
In a secret place
Until I find my freedom
Goodbye my friend
Love will never end
You will live in my heart
