You know I've always got your back, girl
So let me be the one you come running to, running to, r-r-running
I see it's just a matter of fact, girl
You just call my name
I'll be coming through, coming through, I'll keep coming

On the other side of the world, it don't matter
I'll be there in two, I'll be there in two, I'll be there in two
I still feel it every time, it's just something that you do
Now ask me why I want to

It's everything about you, you, you
Everything that you do, do, do
From the way that we touch, baby
To the way that you kiss on me
It's everything about you, you, you
The way you make it feel, new, new, new
Like every party is just us two
And there's nothing I could point to
It's everything about you, you, you (Everything about you)
Everything about you, you, you (Everything about you)
It's everything that you do, do, do (Everything about you)
It's everything about you

Yes, I like the way you smile with your eyes
Other guys see it but don't realise that it's my-my loving
There's something about your laugh that it makes me want to have to
There's nothing funny so we laugh at no-no-nothing
Every minute's like the last so let's just take it real slow
Forget about the clock that's tick-tick-ticking
I still feel it every time, it's just something that you do
Now ask me why I want to

It's everything about you, you, you
Everything that you do, do, do
From the way that we touch, baby
To the way that you kiss on me
It's everything about you, you, you
The way you make it feel, new, new, new
Like every party is just us two
And there's nothing I could point to
It's everything about you, you, you (Everything about you)
Everything about you, you, you (Everything about you)
It's everything that you do, do, do (Everything about you)
It's everything about you

And you have always been the only one I wanted
And I wanted you to know without you I can't face it
All we want to have is fun, but they say that we're too young
Let them say what they want

It's everything about you, you, you
Everything that you do, do, do
From the way that we touch, baby
To the way that you kiss on me
It's everything about you, you, you
The way you make it feel, new, new, new
Like every party is just us two
And there's nothing I could point to
It's everything about you, you, you (Everything about you)
Everything about you, you, you (Everything about you)
It's everything that you do, do, do (Everything about you)
It's everything about you
