How many times have you told me you wanna die?
How many times have you told me not that you've tried?
Ooh and how many times will i let you get away with murder?
Ooh and how many times will you make me feel more alive?

Hey, I got a feeling there's something going wrong
I put my thoughts in a letter, send it when I'm feeling strong
In the time you became the girl that you wanted to be
Oh I told you all along there was no point looking to me

Oh, it's been harder to be strong
All of this going on
Yes, it's been harder to be strong
With all this going on
I've been lonely too, like you,
I'm just like you...
I'm just like you...

People have been travelling miles just to hear us sing
It's a february night & I don't wanna feel anything
To get away, maybe I could sell kisses
? and point how I tried my pretty hound that fishes? / In Portland I tried my pretty hand at fishing (?)

Oh, it's been harder to be strong
With all this going on
Yes, it's been harder to be strong
With all this going on
I've been lonely too, like you,
I'm just like you...
I'm just like you...
I'm just like you...
I'm just like you...

Hey, I got a feeling there's something going wrong
I put my thoughts in a letter, send it when I'm feeling strong
