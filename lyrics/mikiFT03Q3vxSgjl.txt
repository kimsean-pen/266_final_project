Happiness is when i, i think of you,
and we'll be gettin' together for a rendez-vous,
i'll be on time, you bring the wine,
and when we lock the door, you'll be all mine...
alone in my room, thoughts of you in my head as i wait...
the time is soon, you'll arrive, together then,
we'll escape into the night on wings of love,
and do the things that we onced dreamed of...
all aboard a luxury, a first class ticket to ecstasy...
It won't stop! it don't stop! a non-stop secret rendez-vous!
it won't stop! it don't stop! a non-stop secret rendez-vous!
hey, hey, hey! oh, oh, oh!
From a penthouse view, we'll make love, drink champagne by the candlelight...
i'm so glad i'm in your arms, baby i am yours tonight!
to be with you is all i need, so lock the door and throw away the key!
no one will disturb this groove, we could not stop it if we wanted to!
It won't stop! it don't stop! a non-stop secret rendez-vous!
it won't stop! it don't stop! a non-stop secret rendez-vous!
hey, hey, hey! oh, oh, oh!
secret rendez-vous!
