I will return here one day
and dig up my bones from the clay
I buried nails and strings and hair
and that old tooth I believe was a bear's

I held my hand in the fire
it burned me down to the wires

blood suckers hide beneath my bed
And black fumes of skin so gently bled
I slept with a cat on my breast
slowing my heart stealing my breath

at sunrise the monkeys will fly
and leave me with pennies in my eyes

I will return here one day
and dig up my bones from the clay
I buried nails and string and hair
and that old tooth I believe was a bear's

at sunrise the monkeys will fly
and leave me with pennies in my eyes
