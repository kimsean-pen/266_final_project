I'll wait on the wall to see out again
Lay down my masks to what's born of my own
Long are the known to my wraiths alone

They'll never see all that we see
Trust in blood, live in water
Destroying me, be the ladder
My head is down, and I am with you

I grasp our failure, it slips through my hands
Our heartbreaking blindness seeks to atone
These vessels of suffering in my eyes
Head to the mountains and choose where to die

They'll never see all that we see
Trust in blood, live in water
Destroying me, be the ladder
My head is down, and I am with you

The ice surrounds it burying me
I'm slashing to keep my head fixed
The ever changing psychic waves
Burning me

I'm crashing in my head, I'm freeing fire
The breaking of the last speech
All before me laying in waste
I left the rest for you to touch

The end of all we've seen
The reasons show us all
Receiving new eyes in the breach
I stood on the side waiting

We'll never ever get to rest
The visions are bringing horror
The snake subversive within our ranks
The sun surrounding the entire head
Illuminating reach
