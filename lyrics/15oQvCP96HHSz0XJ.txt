I'm a firm believer in letting the past be the past
But sometimes you have to go back
You have to go back
To remind ourselves of the things we lost
The weight we shed, the lessons learned and how much they cost

As for me I realize this life is not guaranteed
And that we are not promised the things that we need
But this life always has a way
To force you to face yourself
And I've avoided it for way too long

As for me I realize this life is not guaranteed
And that we are not promised the things that we need
Wasted days are suicide if you're not satisfied
You have no one to blame but yourself

There was a time when I did things just to do them
When I let my heart lead me to the lions
There was a time when I saw the value in uncertainty
And there was no difference between you and me
There was a time when everything didn't seem so out of place
There was a time when we said fuck them all and just walked their fucking race
There was a time when we just laughed at everything and everyone
There was a time
Where is the time?

I'm going back to find the better days before me
I'm going back to find the better days before me
I'm going back to find the better days before me
There was a time
Now is the time and I'm fucking going back
I'm going back
I'm going back to find the better days before me
