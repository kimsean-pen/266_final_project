Wait for me dead when light hits me
Void black sun
The reach doesn't reach me
Beating drums in the mouth of abyss
Void black
Dust swarm
Lost in the burning sun
Fire raining on our souls
Burning roots
Flood is coming down
Wash away the doubt
Bone of my bones
Wait for me dead
Void black sun
Lost doesn't find me
Flesh of my flesh
Bearing blank curse
Void black
Dust swarm
Running through fire raining on our souls
Burning roots
Flood is coming down
Wash away the doubt and take away the pain
I came to realize
Void black sun
Bearing blank curse
Void black sun
Fire raining on our souls
Burning roots
Flood is coming down
Wash away the doubt
I'll reap what I sowed
Void black sun
Void
