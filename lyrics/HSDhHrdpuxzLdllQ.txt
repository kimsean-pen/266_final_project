All bets are off
I had my hopes all drawn out on the pages of a screen
That I decipher now from the wreckage of the siege
But the prospect of finding such an ability
To succeed is believed to be false pretense (the lies)

It's dreamt up on the pillow of the bed of our thieves
It's dreamt up on the pillow of the bed of our thieves

Don't forget the vision can bleed
It can bleed

Scout the seas from our new found blind perspective
And see that darkness doesn't change
Because the roots of the character they run too deep
Damaging the mind
Resuscitate the waves of the brain
Breathe life into what once was great.
Remove all my heartache

Remove all my heartache
Remove all my heartache (No!)

(The waves) and resuscitate the brain

Remove all my heartache (the waves)
Remove all my heartache (the waves)
Remove all my heartache (the waves)
Breathe life into what once was great
Breathe life into what once was great
The waves, what once was great
