A little mystery makes you miss me
But a little too much can be the thing that makes you leave
We had it all, yeah, we got history
But is that enough for you to stay and wait for me?

I'm torn between mixed up dreams
I am selfish and I'm asking for a lot
This revelry's confusing me
I can't help it, I don't know if I can stop

But if I could go back and rewind
I'd give it up for you, I'd give it up for you
All the things I thought mattered in life
I'm kinda scared to lose, but they don't compare to—

You could have it all
Ah-ah-ah-ah
You could have it all
Ah-ah-ah-ah

Falling in love changed my perspective
'Cause I always thought that I belonged among the stars
Sometimes I wish for something reckless
A version of lust that I could hold inside my arms

I'm torn between mixed up dreams
I am selfish and I'm asking for a lot
This revelry's confusing me
And the worst is I don't know if I can stop

But if I could go back and rewind
I'd give it up for you, I'd give it up for you
All the things I thought mattered in life
I'm kinda scared to lose, but they don't compare to—

You could have it all
Ah-ah-ah-ah
You could have it all
Ah-ah-ah-ah

You could have it all
Ah-ah-ah-ah
You could have it all
Ah-ah-ah-ah

Oh, can you be patient with me?
Just a little longer now
Oh, please don't change on me
'Cause I think that I'm finally close to figuring out

But if I could go back and rewind
I'd give it up for you, I'd give it up for you
All the things I thought mattered in life
I'm kinda scared to lose, but they don't compare to—

You could have it all
Ah-ah-ah-ah (Mmmm)
You could have it all
Ah-ah-ah-ah (Mmmm)

(You could have it all)
Ah-ah-ah-ah (Mmmm)
(You could have it all)
Ah-ah-ah-ah (Mmmm)
You could have it all
