Oh it wasn't bad, wasn't it good?
Oh it was a moment of life
We were just two little humans
Walking to end of the night

Oh it's been a ride
I think i have survived
But I don't know
I'm miffed without your love
Oh it's been a ride
I think i have survived
But I don't know
I'm miffed without your love

Oh it wasn't hugs it was combat
Oh it wasn't rocks it was dust
You said i should find what i don't know
You said i should lie in the rust

Oh it's been a ride
I think i have survived
But I don't know
I'm miffed without your love
Oh it's been a ride
I think i have survived
But I don't know
I'm miffed without your love

I was caught in the headlights
What am i gonna see?
I was bound to be lonely
What am i gonna be?
If i don't have a meaning
What am i gonna mean?
If I can't see your face love
What am i gonna see?

I was caught in the headlights
What am i gonna see?
I was bound to be lonely
What am i gonna be?
If i don't have a meaning
What am i gonna mean?
If I can't see your face love
What am i gonna see?

Oh it's been a ride
I think i have survived
But I don't know
I'm miffed without your love
Oh it's been a ride
I think i have survived
But I don't know
I'm miffed without your love

Oh it's been a ride
I think i have survived
But I don't know
I'm miffed without your love
Oh it's been a ride
I think i have survived
But I don't know
I'm miffed without your love
