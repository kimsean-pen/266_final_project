There's men, underground
Who have never seen the sun
But they really know how to party
Little men from underground
Who have never seen the sun
But the really know how to party

The rise their wooden pints and they yoik and sing
And they fight and dance 'till the morning

Tables full, reindeer meat
And the camp fire shines and the brick walls are full candles
Tables full, wooden pints
They don't care about their sins
They just wanna get drunk and party

The rise their wooden pints and they yoik and sing
And they fight and dance 'till the morning

Long war is now past
Only good men have lasted
They need women, meat, beer and rhum
Fight battle full of blood no thoughts about god they just slaughtered killed and tormented

The rise their wooden pints and they yoik and sing
And they fight and dance 'till the morning
And they fight and dance 'till the morning
And they fight and dance 'till the morning

Long war is now past
Only good men have lasted
They need women, meat, beer and rhum
Fight battle full of blood no thoughts about god
They just slaughtered killed and tormented!
The rise their wooden pints and they yoik and sing
And they fight and dance 'till the morning
And they fight and dance 'till the morning
