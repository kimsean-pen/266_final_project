With my parents outta town
I got all my buddies round
Said we're gonna have a party tonight

If your dad has got the truck
Then I'll come and pick you up
And anyone who wants to come for a ride

And if you wanna have a drink
There's some bottles by the sink
Over 20, 000 people inside

You know that everybody likes to
Party on a Saturday night

We'll have every girl in school
In the deep end of the pool
If you wanna take a dip bring your trunks

And when we start to dim the lights
Gotta find a girl you like
And you better hope she's already drunk

And if somebody's feeling sick
Get them in the garden quick
Coz we don't want them to spoil all the fun

You know that everybody wants to
Party on a Saturday night

We're waking everyone asleep
When we start the party in the street
We want the neighbours to complain
Coz our music's driving them insane

And if it's goin to your head
Get behind the garden shed
It's where everybody goes to get laid

If you want another beer
Then there's plenty in the rear
No one here to check, if you're underage

And if you think you're having fun
Then the party's just begun
Anyone who leaves will wish that they stayed

You know that everybody loves to
Party on a Saturday night

We're waking everyone asleep
When we start the party in the street
We want the neighbours to complain
Coz our music's driving them insane

When my parents come back home
I'll say we've been alone
But we don't know how the mess got this bad

I'll be grounded for a while
All I have to do is smile
And I'll get a little talk from my dad

And the next time they're away
All my buddies can stay
Do our best to drive the neighbourhood mad

You know that everybody likes to party on a Saturday
Everybody wants to party on a Saturday
Everybody loves to party on a Saturday night
