Tell it to me straight like you always do
And I will blow a fuse like I always do
The ebb and the flow, that's starting to show
And my weary mind that makes me unkind
Until
We reach the beginning
You'll be a punching bag for my thoughts
I'll be a mess laid out on the floor
You'll still be looking out for me
When my mind is a mess and my heart's not there
But I'll be coming back to you
'Cause you smell like home and your love's still there
Understand I'm not black and white
I understand you love me despite
Take it on the chin like you always do
And I will spout my words
Like I always do
There's shots getting fired
We're both getting tired you know
And finding resolve is taking its toll you know
We've got nothing left to say
Don't know if we're going the right way
You'll still be looking out for me
When my mind is a mess and my heart's not there
But I'll be coming back to you
'Cause you smell like home and your love's still there
Understand I'm not black and white
I understand you love me despite
Because you run so deeply
I won't be scared of all the ups and downs
Because you run so deeply
We survive
It's alright
'Cause when we're at the edge of no return
We'll fall back on the vows
When we're looking at the enemy
We'll fight on through the crowd
When the lightning hits and thunder strikes
We'll find another cloud
And we'll work it out
You'll still be looking out for me
When my mind is a mess and my heart's not there
But I'll be coming back to you
'Cause you smell like home and your love's still there
'Cause you smell like home and your love's still there
'Cause you smell like home and your love's still there
