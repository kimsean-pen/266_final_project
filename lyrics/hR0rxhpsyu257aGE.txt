Take a chance, and take a hold
Give it all and turn it to gold
Time has come, so make a stand
On your own, and take command
Beat the odds, you will survive
Stronger now, you feel alive
Rising up, get into place
Feel it in your heart,
When you are, winning this race
When I look into your eyes
It comes, as no surprise

This is our night, fly to the top baby
Yes we can do it, just wait and see
This is our night, time for a change baby
Get rid of the old, take a hold, and be free
This is our night, fly to the top baby
Yes we can do it, just wait and see
This is our night, time for a change baby
Get rid of the old, take a hold, and be free

This is our night

Counting down, the night of nights
Getting now, to stand and fight
Don't back down, just look within
Do it now, I know you will
When I look into your eyes
It comes as no surprise

This is our night, fly to the top baby
Yes we can do it, just wait and see
This is our night, time for a change baby
Get rid of the old, take a hold, and be free
This is our night, fly to the top baby
Yes we can do it, just wait and see
This is our night, time for a change baby
Get rid of the old, take a hold, and be free

This is our night, fly to the top baby
Yes we can do it, just wait and see
This is our night, time for a change baby
Get rid of the old, take a hold, and be free
This is our night, fly to the top baby
Yes we can do it, just wait and see
This is our night, time for a change baby
Get rid of the old, take a hold, and be free
