I can prove anything
I'll make you admit again and again
That I can prove anything
The way that it's read again and again

And it's only 'cause you came here with your brothers too
If you came here on your own you'd be dead
It's only 'cause you follow what the others do
It's no excuse to say you're easily lead

You could choose anything
You choose to lose again and again
And you could do anything
But why should you do anything again

And it's only 'cause you came here with your brothers too
If you came here on your own you'd be dead
You're winding yourself up until you're turning blue
Repeating everything that you read

So here we go with the letter
Well, can you fix it for me
Because we need entertainment
To keep us all off the streets
So tonight you'll sleep softly in your bed

You could try anything
And no one would know apart from you and me
And you could stop anything
It starts with just one and turns to two then three

It's only 'cause you came here with your brothers too
If you came here on your own you'd be dead
You raise a glass or two, you raise a fist or two
And get a shopping basket wrapped round your head

So here we go with the letter
Can you fix it for me
The twenty-four hour drinking
To keep us all off the streets
So tonight you'll sleep softly in your bed

We are the angry mob
We read the papers everyday
We like who we like, we hate who we hate
But we're also easily swayed
