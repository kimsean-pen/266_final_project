I love the looks of you, the lure of you
The sweet of you, the pure of you
The eyes, the arms, the mouth of you
The east, west, north, and the south of you

I'd love to gain complete control of you
And handle even the heart and soul of you
So love at least a small percent of me do
For I love all of you

I'd love to gain complete control of you
And handle even the heart and soul of you
So love at least a small percent of me do
For I love all of you
Of you
Of you
Of you
