Some people wake up scared of living their dream
They'll settle for anything
Some wanna live an airbrushed world
Like the cover of a magazine
But I believe in thunderbolts and butterflies
When you look into my eyes
I pray tonight that we don't fail
Click my heels
Got a real life fairytale
But

If Cinderella was here tonight
She wouldn't walk out the door leaving you behind
Midnight calling but she don't care
She'd be a fool not to follow you everywhere
Because for you
I would lose
Both, both of my shoes
Stay all night
See the light
That's all I wanna do
(That's all I wanna do)

Some people get lost, looking up at the sky
Waiting for shooting stars
Some never take their eyes off the sidewalk
They'll never take a step too far
But I believe the planets and the stars align
When you look into my eyes
I pray tonight your kiss won't fail
Click my heels
Got a real life fairytale
But

If Cinderella was here tonight
She wouldn't walk out the door leaving you behind
Midnight calling but she don't care
She'd be a fool not to follow you everywhere
Because for you
I would lose
Both, both of my shoes
Stay all night
See the light
Walking home with you
For you
I would lose
Both, both of my shoes
Stay all night
See the light
That's all I wanna do

3AM, kissing in the corner
4AM, running from the doorman
5AM, dancing in the street lights
Just in time for us to see the sunrise

If Cinderella was here tonight
She wouldn't walk out the door leaving you behind
Midnight calling but she don't care
She'd be a fool not to follow you everywhere
Because for you
I would lose
Both, both of my shoes
Stay all night
See the light
Walking home with you
For you
I would lose
Both, both of my shoes
Stay all night
See the light
That's all I wanna do

For you
I would lose both of my shoes
And all night
Walking home with you
