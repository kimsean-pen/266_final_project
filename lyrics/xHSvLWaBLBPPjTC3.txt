All right, girls
(Are you shaking?)
Surrounded by sharp-looking eyes

Dancing in a fever
Forgetting all the words of advice
Moving in and closer
What a life we have

What a life we live
And it's smiling right at us
What a life we share
Gonna get it there
So, never let it go

Never stop till you know
We'll be reaching for the top tonight
Surrender to the beat up and down
In the heat we'll be shaking, shaking
So, never let it go

Never stop till you know
We'll be reaching for the top tonight
And when the night is over
I'll take you in my arms now
Blinded by the scent of your love

Sailing on this feeling
And my mind is high up above
I don't know if I'm dreaming
What a life we have

What a life we live
And it's smiling right at us
What a life we share
Gonna get it there
So, never let it go

Never stop till you know
We'll be reaching for the top tonight
Surrender to the beat up and down
In the heat we'll be shaking, shaking
(We'll be shaking)
So, never let it go

Never stop till you know
We'll be reaching for the top tonight
(We will reach the top)
Surrender to the beat, up and down
In the heat we'll be shaking, shaking
What a life we have

What a life we live
And when the night is over
What a life we share
Gonna get it there
I'll take you in my arms
So, never let it go

Never stop till you know
We'll be reaching for the top tonight
Surrender to the beat, up and down
In the heat we'll be shaking, shaking
(Shaking, shaking, shaking, shaking)
So, never let it go

Never stop till you know
We'll be reaching for the top tonight
And when the night is over
I'll take you in my arms now
So, never let it go
Never stop till you know
We'll be reaching for the top tonight
Surrender to the beat, up and down
In the heat we'll be shaking, shaking
(Shaking, shaking, shaking, shaking)
So, never let it go, never stop
