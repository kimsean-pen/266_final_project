We're going to the last
You and I
We're going to the last
You and I
You're to me than any any son
Never in a fore and only son
And I will love you
Tell me if we're wrong
All I've seen is what you've done
To the last, you and I
To the last, you and I
If only, if only
If only, if only
If only, if only
If only, if only
(If only, if only
If only, if only
If only, if only
If only, if only)
You can hide yourself
In so many words
And I will love you
Tell me if we're wrong
All I've seen is what you've done
We're going to the last
You and I
We're going to the last
You and I
We're going to the last
You and I
To the last
You and I
