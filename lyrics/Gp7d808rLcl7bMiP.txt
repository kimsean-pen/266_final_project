I can't do anything with out you
Can't do anything with you
You drive me crazy, but I love you
You make me lazy, but I love you

I want to hit you, but then I kiss you
Want to kill you, but then I'd miss you
You drive me crazy, but I love you
You make me lazy, but I love you

Oooooooh
Oooooooh

I'm always waiting by the phone
I can't wait for you to get home
I'm always crazy when I miss you
I'm always lazy when I miss you

And even though you are my guy
I always freak when I get high
I'm always crazy when I miss you
I'm always lazy when I miss you

Oooooooh
Oooooooh

Maybe I'm just crazy
Maybe I'm just crazy
Maybe I'm just crazy
Crazy for you baby
