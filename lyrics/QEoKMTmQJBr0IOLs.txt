No time for rest
No pillow for my head
Nowhere to run from this
No way to forget

Around the shadows creep
Like friends, they cover me
Just wanna lay me down and finally
Try to get some sleep

We carry on through the storm
Tired soldiers in this war
Remember what we're fighting for

Meet me on the battlefield
Even on the darkest night
I will be your sword & shield, your camouflage
And you will be mine

Echos of the shots ring out
We may be the first to fall
Everything could stay the same or we could change it all

Meet me on the battlefield

We're standing face-to-face
With our own human race
We commit the sins again and than our sons and daughters pay
Our tainted history, is playing on repeat
But we could change it if we stand up strong and take the lead

When I was younger, I was named
A generation unafraid
For the heirs to come, be brave

And meet me on the battlefield
Even on the darkest night
I will be your sword & shield, your camouflage
And you will be mine

Echos of the shots ring out
We may be the first to fall
Everything could stay the same or we could change it all

Meet me on the battlefield

Meet me on the battlefield
Even on the darkest night
I will be your sword & shield, your camouflage
And you will be mine

Echos of the shots ring out
We may be the first to fall
Everything could stay the same or we could change it all
(We could change it all)

Meet me on the battlefield

Meet me on the battlefield
(We could change it all)
