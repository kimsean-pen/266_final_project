All the strangest things
Keep happening
All by my father's
Old magnolia tree

And the Sydney sky
Is rainless and sings off key
But it's cool in a weird way
That i wish I could be

It's the weirdest high
And the lowest peak
God I'm an alien
On my own goddamned street

I climb some wall
And curse out my favourite team
And stare at the freeway
Inveterately free

Go farther in hope
Go farther
Go farther in lightness

Go farther in hope
Go farther
Go farther in lightness
