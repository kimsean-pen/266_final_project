The park
Let me walk a while alone
among the sacred rocks and stones
let me look in vain belief
upon the beauty of each leaf
There is green in every blade
the tree tops lean providing shade
maypoles spin in happy sound
all nature's strength around
And there's a horse that feels no pain
its iron strength to take the strain
children rock it to and fro
and gaily drink its colour-glow
Above, the sky, devoid of cloud
thinks not to cast a thunder shroud
upon this place so full of joy
a field of gold of loves employ
So, why my heavy heart? you say
when tears would stain
the sights so gay
my brother's dreams once here did soar
until he died at the hand
of needless war
