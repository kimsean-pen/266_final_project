Yo pretty ladies around the world
Got a weird thing to show you,
So tell all the boys and girls.
Tell your brother, your sister
And your mama too, cause they're
About to go down
And you'll know just what to do

Wave your hands in the air
Like you don't care, glide by
The people as they stop to look and stare.
Do yo' dance, do yo' dance, do yo' dance quick
Mama, come on baby, tell me what's
The word, ah â€“ word up,
Everybody say when you hear the call
You got to get it underway,
Word up, it's the code word,
No matter where you say it,
You'll know that you'll be heard.

All you sucker. D.J.'s
Who think you're fly
There's got to be a reason
We know the reason why.
Try to put on an act and act real cool
But you got to realise
That you're acting like some fools.
If there's music we can use it
We need to dance.
We don't have that time
For psychological romance

No romance
No romance
No romance for me mama
Come on baby tell me what's the word.
Ah, word up, y'all
Everybody say when you hear the call
You got to get it underway. Aaauw

Low
Dial "L" for low
Come on, all you people say...

We sure had a good time, don't you forget it
From everybody on this stage on behalf of Cameo
We wanna say thank you for coming out
We wanna send you love
We feel your love
And now it's time to show some more love
Everybody from the front to the back
If you're not doing so already
Please stand up
If you're not doing so already please stand up
Thank you darling, thank you
How you doing? (Nice dress, nice)
Now. We like for you to hold your right hand up in the air
Don't wave 'em like you just don't care
Don't wave it, don't...
Now we want you to say at the
Top of your lungs from the front to the back
Side to side we want you to say
