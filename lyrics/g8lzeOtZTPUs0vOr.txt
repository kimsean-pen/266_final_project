Uh – Ohhh, Uh - Ohhh
Uh – Ohhh, Uh – Ohhh

Honestly
If I tell
Tell you what
What you want to know love
There ain't another
Don't want no other lover
I put nothing above ya
I'll kick 'em to the gutter
You try to shake me
When up lovin me crazy now
Look at us lately
And tell 'em who's your lady

I never thought you'd be the one
Make me shine brighter than the sun
There ain't no ups & downs
No in's & outs
You're here right now

If you want me to stay
I'll never leave
If you want me to stay
We'll always be
If you want me to stay
Love endlessly
If you want me to stay
If you want me to stay
I'll never leave you
Uh – Ohhh, Uh - Ohhh
Uh – Ohhh, Uh – Ohhh

Now how you're lovin' I
We're happy it's a fact
Can't nothing hold us back
We got this in the wrap
There ain't no maybes
No questions
Love you daily now
Look at us lately
And tell 'em who's your lady

I never thought you'd be the one
Make me shine brighter than the sun
There ain't no ups & downs
No in & outs
You're here right now

If you want me to stay
I'll never leave
If you want me to stay
We'll always be
If you want me to stay
Love endlessly
If you want me to stay
If you want me to stay
I'll never leave you

Uh – Ohhh, Uh - Ohhh
Uh – Ohhh, Uh – Ohhh
Uh – Ohhh, Uh - Ohhh
Uh – Ohhh, Uh – Ohhh
