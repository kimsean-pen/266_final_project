The cracks were visible in the beginning
Now we're staring deep down into the guts of the earth
We've been watching these two tectonic plates slowly drifting apart
And wen the first cracks appeared on the
surfaces, we had surrendered our hopes to reality
Odds and ends adding up to a serious kick in the teeth of vanity
At this stage any will for solutions had bowed to the gallows

You showed your true colours only in my absence
Crawl away
Don't grind your teeth
Make believe you were never here

You piled up inside of you an extensive collection of
small monuments to frustration and failure to communicate
And this was the tragic dilemma of our constellation:
Not the difference between us but the lack of honest talks

You showed your true colours only in my absence
Crawl away
Don't grind your teeth
Make believe you were never here

I turned the tables on you after you had seized
everything that was not nailed to floor, or locked away
And now you're waving the flag of justice and equity
The devil takes the hindmost
You show your true colors in my absence
