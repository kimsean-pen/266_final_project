I don't like country-and-western
I don't like rock music
I don't like, I don't like rockabilly or rock 'n' roll particularly
Don't like much really, do I?
But what I do like I love passionately

Paninaro, Paninaro, oh, oh, oh
Paninaro, Paninaro, oh, oh, oh
Paninaro, Paninaro, oh, oh, oh

You, you're my lover, you're my hope, you're my dreams
my life, my passion, my love, my sex, my money
violence, religion, injustice and death

Paninaro, Paninaro, oh, oh, oh
Don't like much really, do I?
Paninaro, Paninaro, oh, oh, oh
But what I do like I love passionately
Paninaro, Paninaro, oh, oh, oh
