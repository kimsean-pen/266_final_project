The stars and the moon
Aren't where they're supposed to be
But this strange electric light
It falls so close to me
Love I come to ride
I am that seasick rolling wave
And you know that I am
Just trying to get down

Oh the glorious sound
Oh the one way street
But you can't get ...
Can't get it down without crying

When I'm dressed in white
Send roses to me
I drink so much sour whiskey
I can't hardly see
And everywhere I've been
There's a well that howls my name
From the one tiny sting
To that vacant fame

Oh the deafening roar
Remember that's called a one way street
And you can't get ...
Can't get it down without crying

Through the mysteries of sight
Can't get out
In the psychotropic light
You can't get out
Love I come to ride
High on that seasick rolling wave
That's the way that I fall
Trying to get out

Oh the glorious sound
Of the one way street
And you can't get ...
Can't get it down without crying
Oh the deafening roar
It's called a one way street
