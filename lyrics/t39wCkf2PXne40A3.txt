Your life is ending one minute at a time
Check the clock and stand in line
Hibernate till your, till your life's passed you by
Please stop living like you're waiting to die

Keep up, keep up, don't get left behind
Don't slip up, slip up, chase that finish line
They don't want you believing
That your life deserves a meaning

Weary souls, trying to forget
That we're all puppets with a lifetime debt

What a feeling, built to break
Happiness with an expiry date
Please, stop living like you're waiting to die
Please, stop living like you're waiting to die

Stitched into our lives, drained until we expire
Weary souls trying to forget
That we're all puppets with a lifetime debt
We're all weary souls, trying to forget

Keep two eyes on that intangible finish line
In this race, we're all reduced to vermin
Keep two eyes on that intangible finish line
In this race, we're all reduced, we're all reduced to vermin

Stitched into our lives, drained until we expire
Your life is ending one minute at a time
Weary souls, trying to forget
That we're all puppets with a lifetime debt
