No bother, climb to it, and call out, canary
Don't worry, just grab it, or somethin', abuse it
My vision, a forest, a lot here, to carry
Slide over, and bite it, the apple, and bury
The volume, and the riot, the smell of, the lions
and the sun sets, behind me, the bullets, start flying

Finding a light in a world of ruin
Starting to dance when the earth is caving in
We're ready to begin

Its alright
A bit scathed
A bit lost
I've been played
I ain't that clever
a city boy that can never say never
i got the life but that girl bites like a wolf

Inertia, take cover, a canon, you ready
The image, the session, a poet is sleeping
The current, the pilot, antennas and sirens
Like college, like thieves that, can eat with the wolfpack

Finding a light in a world of ruin
Starting to dance when the earth is caving in
Set in the sun and our hearts are burn in'
Leaving the nest to the back a thousand winds
We're ready to begin

Its alright
A bit scathed
A bit lost
I've been played
I ain't that clever
a city boy that can never say never
I got the life but that girl bites like (a wolf)

Its on me
Its only
A small heart
On one sleeve
Academy killer
Off with his head
In the make believe game of fools
That girl bites like a wolf

Are you ready?
I'm waiting to begin
