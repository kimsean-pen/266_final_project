One, two, three

Baby left in Omaha
She's got too much just going on
All these options forcing me to find myself
Why on Earth would I ask you for any help?

I was thinking wrong, yeah
You're already gone, baby
I was thinking wrong, yeah
Already gone, baby

Who said it's forever?
You've got to set your mind free
I don't have time for this weather
I let it pour over me

'Cause you're thinking wrong, yeah
We're already gone, baby
'Cause you're thinking wrong, yeah
You're already gone

You're already gone, yeah
(You've got to set your mind free)
You're already gone, baby
(You've got to set your mind free)
You're already gone, yeah
(You've got to set your mind free)
You're already gone, baby
(You've got to set your mind free)
(You've got to set your mind free)
(You've got to set your mind free)
