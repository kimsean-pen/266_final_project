People talking
And they're saying that you're leaving
So unhappy
With the way that you've been living

We always wish for money
We always wish for fame
We think we have the answers
Some things ain't ever gonna change
(Change)
It doesn't matter who you are
It's all the same

What's in your heart will never change
Look in the mirror
And you see how you've been taken
Ohh, you won't surrender

But now your heart is breakin'
We always wish for money
We always wish for fame
We think we have the answers
Some things ain't ever gonna change
(Change)
It doesn't matter who you are

It's all the same
What's in your heart will never change
Do you remember
When you got your lucky break?

You're looking back now
And it seems like a mistake
We always wish for money
We always wish for fame
We think we have the answers
Some things ain't ever gonna change
(Change)
It doesn't matter who you are
It's all the same
What's in your heart will never change
It's only change

(Change)
It doesn't matter who you are
It's all the same

What's in your heart will never change
It doesn't matter who you are
It's all the same
(Change)
What's in your heart will stay the same
It doesn't matter who you are
It's all the same
(What's in your heart)
It's only, it's only, it's only change
Never
(It doesn't matter)
You ain't gonna, you ain't gonna change
(What's in your heart)
You ain't gonna change
