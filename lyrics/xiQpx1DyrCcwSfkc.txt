Confidence and ignorance approved me
Define my day today
I've tried so hard to shut it down like an oath
Gently walk away

Appetite and impulses confused me
Decide my day, today
Now my body says it's over
Shaking hands move to tear my face away

And when the night comes I'm fiending like a pyrale
And I know stables my survival
When there's music all around me and I haven't got a single word to say

And then the light shines
Is cleaning like a bottle
And lord knows I'm tackeled from frowled?
May I illuminate the nameless faceless saints of this out and open grace

Every lover on a mission shifted your known position due to the light
Every diamond elemental you are instrumental due to the light
Every sonic every illusion make your contribution due to the light
Every lover on a mission shifted your known position due to the light

Oh body mine please leave behind
And I'll do you long better
While you define
Your heartless time
I'll defend my love forever

Every lover on a mission shifted your known position due to the light
Every diamond elemental you are instrumental due to the light
Every sonic every illusion make your contribution due to the light
Every glory and every bond is gonna bring you faster on due to the light
