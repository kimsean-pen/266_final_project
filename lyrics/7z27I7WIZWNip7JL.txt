One step next to you
Catching stills of midnight moon
We're on the descend
Vows in enclosed rooms
Tortures walls without a view
We're unrevealing
Mixed up point of views
Climbs the pillars of our youth
Without a meaning
Strained out, you don't believe it
One conflict to two, we're ignited

Oh, we're ticking down and ticking down the days
It's longer than missing, longer than hoping
Beat the heart, beat it, we're beating
Unusual, the remnants of you stain
Beat it, we're beating
Beat the heart, beat it, we're beating

The voice that makes us move
Glides amongst our melting shoes
We're illuminated
Spaced out, feel the distance
Earth set from the moon
We're floating

Oh, we're ticking down and ticking down the days
It's longer than missing, longer than hoping
Beat the heart, beat it, we're beating
Unusual, the remnants of you stain
Beat it, we're beating
Beat the heart, beat it, we're beating

Oh, we're ticking down and ticking down the days
It's longer than missing, longer than hoping
Beat the heart, beat it, we're beating
Unusual, the remnants of you stain
Beat it, we're beating
Beat the heart, beat it, we're beating

Beat it, we're beating
Beat it, we're beating
Beat it, we're beating
