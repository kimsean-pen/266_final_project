If I came in the morning would you still be here?
And if I left in the evening too?
Well, I don't have the time to keep you in line
I don't have the time

And do I fail to know what's in your eyes?
Do I fail to know?
Do I fail to know what's in your eyes?
Do I fail to know?

'Cause my love for you has died tonight
I don't know how to own you
My love for you was faulty
Now angels watch it die

So I caught you in a lie, singin' hey [Incomprehensible]
I'll never be what you want, no, oh
Fabulous teeth and [Incomprehensible] your heart
Gonna come undone, you know how to play

And do I fail to know what's in your eyes?
Do I fail to know? Oh, oh, oh
Do I fail to know what's in your eyes?
Do I fail to know? Ooh, oh

'Cause my love for you has died tonight
I don't know how to own you
My love for you was faulty
Now angels watch it die

Now, I caught you in a lie, singin' hey
Yeah, I caught you in a lie, singin' hey
I caught you in a lie, singin' hey
And I caught you in a lie, singin' hey

My love for you has died tonight
I don't know how to own you
My love for you was faulty
Now angels watch it die, oh

My love for you has died tonight
I don't know how to own you
My love for you was faulty
Now, baby, just watch it die
