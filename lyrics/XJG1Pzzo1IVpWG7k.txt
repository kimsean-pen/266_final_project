I left scars on your heart like the cracks in the concrete
You know I feel them too
Since the day that I left I punish myself
Hoping to find some truth
But you have to believe I just didn't know what else to do
And now the life that I left is leaving me too

Set free
You stood by me when no when else would
Set free
Trusted my vision when I didn't think that I could
Set free

You tried desperately to keep my head above water for the sake of us
But somewhere along the line I lost track of who I was
I just got so tired of pulling you under, under with me
And now that I lost you, I lost everything

Set free
You stood by me when no when else would
Set free
Trusted my vision when I didn't think that I could
Set free
Not a day goes by that I don't think of you
Set free
How can I live with myself and what I put you through?

This is not an apology or an admission of guilt
This is a realization of how I destroyed all the things we've built

Set free
You stood by me when no when else would
Set free
Trusted my vision when I didn't think that I could
Set free
Not a day goes by that I don't think of you
Set free
How can I live with myself and what I put you through?

Set free
