I live in a new construction home
I live on the strip behind the dealership, yeah
I live in a greenhouse and I am getting wasted, yeah

Temperature rising
I can feel it all the way down
And what hits the spot, yeah, like Gatorade?
You and me baby, hittin' the spot all night

Up in the light of the high Temecula sunrise
High Temecula sunrise
High Temecula sunrise

Definitely you can come and live with us
I know there's a space for you in the basement, yeah
All you gotta do is help out with the chores and dishes

And I know you will
Rest assured, comfortable
You have nothing
The face of earth will be white
And after all, yeah, all of it
Indian paintbrush and a couple of brown finches

Right there in the light of the high Temecula sunrise
High Temecula sunrise
High Temecula sunrise

I welcome the new construction roads
I see that my silhouette is golden, yeah
I know the horizon is bright and motionless
Like an EKG of a dying woman

Far away from the light of the high Temecula sunrise
High Temecula sunrise
High Temecula sunrise
