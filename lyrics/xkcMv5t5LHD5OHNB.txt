In the brightest hour of my darkest day
I realized what is wrong with me
Can't get over you, can't get through to you
It has been a helter-skelter romance from the start
Take these memories that are haunting me
Of a paper man cut into shreds
By his own pair of scissors
He'll never forgive her, he'll never forgive her

Because days come and go but my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go but my feelings for you are forever

Sitting by a fire on a lonely night
Hanging over from another good time
With another girl, little dirty girl
You should listen to this story of a life
You are my heroine-in this moment I am lonely fulfilling my darkest dreams
All these drugs all these women
I am never forgiven... this broken heart of mine

Because days come and go but my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go but my feelings for you are forever

One last kiss
Before I go
Dry your tears
It is time to let you go

One last kiss (one last kiss)
Before I go (before I go)
Dry your tears (dry your tears)
It is time to let you go

Because days come and go but my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go but my feelings for you are forever

One last kiss (one last kiss)
Before I go (before I go)
Dry your tears (dry your tears)
It is time to let you go

One last kiss
Before I go
Dry your tears
It is time to let you go
One last kiss
