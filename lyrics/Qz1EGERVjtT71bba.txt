I just can't believe it, you left me here alone
When you coming back now?
Looking in the mirror for all I used to know
I just can't believe it

Leila, why did you leave again?
Stay home
Leila, can you believe again?
Stay home

(Stay, stay, stay)
(Stay, stay, stay)

It's never like the first time, where did it go wrong?
It's always in your head now
I always had to wonder, why you let it go
It's never like the first time

Leila, why did you leave again?
Stay home
Leila, can you believe again?
Stay home

Been lonely since you left me, when you coming home?
Please come back to bed now
I always had to wonder, why you let it go
You drive me into madness

Leila, why did you leave again?
Leila, can you believe again?

Leila, why did you leave again?
Stay home
Leila, can you believe again?
Stay home
