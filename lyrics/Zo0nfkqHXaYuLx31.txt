I relate to your kind, your design
Your devotion to wave
Get your brain on the prize
Then dive inside the mindset of a killer
With your mind out of phase

It's a game that we like
We crave yet nobody wins
Any way you decide
You try but you die

The mindset of a killer
With your gaze
You paint the room blood red
With tears pouring from the stage

And you can't stop now
Row by row, almost out
Covered in black and gold
No one cares and no one knows

My gift to the world outside
It's OK, I'm all right
Now open your empty hands
'Cause here comes the fun, here comes the end

Click, erases the device
Give thanks then clear out the room
Blow kisses, wave them goodbye
Goodnight

Mindset of a killer
With your gaze
You paint the room blood red
With tears pour from the stage

And you can't stop now
Row by row, almost out
Covered in black and gold
No one cares and no one knows
My gift to the world outside
It's okay, I'm all right
Now, open your empty hands
'Cause here comes the fun, here comes the end
