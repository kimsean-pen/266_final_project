Wish I could feel what I can't see
Float like a butterfly, scream like a banshee
Something's hiding in the pantry
But I can't find it, so would you please
Enchant me, give me a potion
For my devotion, to the emotion

I've yet to surrender to tales of forever
But never say never, my dear

Can you make me believe it?
At the night when I call for the magic
'Cause I just wanna feel it,
When things go bump in the attic, baby
Like a rabbit pulled from a hat
Or that any true love can match
Can you help me to see it?
Because I want to believe in the magic

Cast all your spells onto me
Touch me with your wand till the light shines through me
Come on, baby, let's get spooky
I don't know if it's real but I want it to be
If there's an omen, I wanna know when
My eyes are open

I've yet to surrender to tales of forever
But never say never, my dear

Can you make me believe it?
At the night when I call for the magic
'Cause I just wanna feel it,
When things go bump in the attic, baby
Like a rabbit pulled from a hat
Or that any true love can match
Can you help me to see it?
Because I want to believe in the magic

Fairy tales and sleeping beauties
Is magic like what's in the movies?
Want to know it absolutely like you do, like you do
But I felt something when you held me
Maybe one more kiss could help me
Close your eyes, your lips will tell me if it's true, if it's true
Oh oh, baby

Can you make me believe it?
At the night when I call for the magic
'Cause I just wanna feel it,
When things go bump in the attic, baby
Like a rabbit pulled from a hat
Or that any true love can match
Can you help me to see it?
Because I want to believe in the magic

Oh ooh oh ooh
Because I want to believe in the Magic
Oh ooh oh ooh
Because I want to believe in the Magic
