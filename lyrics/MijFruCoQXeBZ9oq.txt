The neon light, of the "Open all night",
was just in time replaced by the magic appearance of a new day-while,
a melancholic Reno was crawling on his back just in,
front of the supermarket door-way child

Hey girl, on a cold summernight,
as we stood on the corner,
as a man passed by and asked us,
what we were doing what we need,
as he pointed his big fat finger
to the people hangin round at the corner of the - other side of street
Oh well

Doin' nothing, just hanging around,
what do you mean doin' nothing Sir.
So we had to hit him to the ground,
doin' nothing just hanging around.
His head all busted lookin' just a lttle to wise child

I just can't wait
I just can't wait for saturday night
for saturday night
for saturday night
saturday night

Bit with solo:
saturday night
saturday night
saturday night

I just can't wait
I just can't wait
