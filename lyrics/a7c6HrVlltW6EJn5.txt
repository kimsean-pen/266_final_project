Shootin' for the stars
Cruise the speed of light
Glowin' God of Mars
Body burnin' bright

Well, I'm riding
Riding on the wind
Yes, I'm riding
Riding on the wind

Tearin' up through life
Million miles an hour
Blindin' all in sight
Surgin' rush of power

Well, I'm riding
Riding on the wind
Yes, I'm riding
Riding on the wind

Riding on the wind
Riding on the wind
Riding on the wind
Riding on the wind

Thunderbolt from hell
Shatterin' aloud
Screamin', demons yell
Burstin' through the clouds

Well, I'm riding
Riding on the wind
Yes, I'm riding
Riding on the wind
