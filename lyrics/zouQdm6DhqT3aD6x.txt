She said, how did we get ourselves so lost?
And I said, I don't know
But we will not be leaving, tonight, tonight
When you hold me, I, I feel better

I only want one night together in our arms
This is the longest night, we're meeting arms to arms

Nothing is wasted and life is worth living
Heaven is nowhere, just look to the stars
There is a day that is yours for embracing
Everything's nothing and nothing is ours

Nothing is wasted and life is worth living
(I only want one night)
Heaven is nowhere, just look to the stars

There is a day that is yours for embracing
(This is the longest night)
Everything's nothing and nothing is ours, oh, oh

And maybe if we'd never come this way
Then we would live and prosper
But I doubt it, we are a violent race

And we deserve what we get
When you hold me, when you hold me
I feel better, I feel better

I only want one night together in our arms
(I feel better)
This is the longest night, we're meeting arms to arms
(I feel better)

I only want one night together in our arms
(I feel better)
This is the longest night, we're meeting arms to arms

Nothing is wasted and life is worth living
Heaven is nowhere, just look to the stars
There is a day that is yours for embracing
Everything's nothing and nothing is ours

Nothing is wasted and life is worth living
Heaven is nowhere, just look to the stars
There is a day that is yours for embracing
Everything's nothing and nothing is ours

Nothing is wasted and life is worth living
(I only want one night)
Heaven is nowhere, just look to the stars
(Together in our arms)

There is a day that is yours for embracing
(This is the longest night)
Everything's nothing and nothing is ours
(We're meeting arms to arms)

Nothing is wasted and life is worth living
(I only want one night)
Heaven is nowhere, just look to the stars
(Together in our arms)

There is a day that is yours for embracing
(This is the longest night)
Everything's nothing and nothing is ours
(We're meeting arms to arms)
