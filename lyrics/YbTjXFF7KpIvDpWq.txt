I'm a tightrope walker without a net
A high risk taker without regrets
I give it all and nothing less
And that's the way I've always been

You can call it reckless
But these dreams are relentless
I can't keep 'em on a shelf
So I'm sorry that I can't help

Everytime I hear danger, danger
I move a little bit closer, closer
Hey, and if I tumble and fall
Honey it's my own damn fault
If there's a rule, then I'm the breaker
If there's a storm then I'm the chaser
Everytime I hear danger, danger
Danger, danger

I love right past the caution tape
Even though sometimes my heart'll break
I still get up, through the pain
Brush it off, make a change

Yeah you can call me crazy
You could even try to save me
But I got my own story to tell
So I'm sorry that I can't help

Everytime I hear danger, danger
I move a little bit closer, closer
Hey, and if I tumble and fall
Honey it's my own damn fault
If there's a rule, then I'm the breaker
If there's a storm then I'm the chaser
Everytime I hear danger, danger
Everytime I hear danger
I move a little bit closer

Danger, danger
Danger, danger
I move a little bit closer, closer

But everytime I hear danger, danger
I move a little bit closer, closer
Hey yeah, and if I tumble and fall
Honey it's my own damn fault
If there's a dare, I'll be the taker
If there's a rule, then I'm the breaker
If there's a storm then I'm the chaser
Oh everytime I hear danger, danger

I get closer
Danger, danger
Danger, danger
