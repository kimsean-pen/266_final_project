My little brother just discovered rock and roll
My little brother just discovered rock and roll
My little brother just discovered rock and roll
There's a noise in his head, and he's out of control

And yes it frustrates!
Let's let him make his own mistakes
See him on the dance floor, watch him go now
Boy those moves, I just don't know how

My little brother just discovered rock and roll
My little brother just discovered rock and roll
My little brother just discovered rock and roll
He's only 22 and he's out of control

How's he living?
With all of that unforgiving
See him on the dance floor, watch him go now
Boy those moves, I just don't know how

My little brother just discovered rock and roll
My little brother just discovered rock and roll
My little brother just discovered rock and roll
There's a noise in his head, and he's out of control

He no longer likes A-sides
He made me a tape, of bootlegs and B-sides
And every song on that tape, every single song says
Oh why don't our parents worry about us?
All we ever want, is for our parents to worry about us
There isn't anybody he really wants

My little brother just discovered rock and roll
My little brother just discovered rock and roll
My little brother just discovered rock and roll

My little brother just discovered rock and roll!

Stay off, the crack!
