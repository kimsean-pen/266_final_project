I'm singing you this lullaby, lullaby, lullaby
Singing you this lullaby, lullaby, lullaby
I'm singing you this lullaby, lullaby, lullaby
Singing you this lullaby, lullaby, lullaby

Sleep, we be bumping like my Jeep
You my man, but tonight we gon' do it like we're creep
Me on you and you on me
I don't mind being your freak
I'mma knock ya, knock ya out
You ain't gotta count no sheep
I'mma go sing you a song
Baby you could sing along
It go something just like la-la-la-la ain't got nothing on
Me and you we go together
So we ain't doing nothing wrong
By the time I finish with you, baby boy you gon' be gone

Cause baby when the lights go out in the room
I'mma put it down on you
I'll show you the time of your life
Baby right before I say goodnight

I'm singing you this lullaby, lullaby, lullaby
Singing you this lullaby, lullaby, lullaby
I'm singing you this lullaby, lullaby, lullaby
Singing you this lullaby, lullaby, lullaby

Sleep, it ain't never felt so sweet
Under covers like the water baby, we be swimming deep
We be rocking like the beat
When we get between the sheets
I can be your Mayweather baby, knock you off your feet
Cause you know that I'm the shit
This as good as it gon' get
Boy this love is just too wrong baby, you never forget
Baby cause see once me and you, we get up in this bed
I'mma make you tap out, yeah it's over the edge

Cause baby when the lights go out in the room
I'mma put it down on you
I'll show you the time of your life
Baby right before I say goodnight

I'm singing you this lullaby, lullaby, lullaby
Singing you this lullaby, lullaby, lullaby
I'm singing you this lullaby, lullaby, lullaby
Singing you this lullaby, lullaby, lullaby

If you don't mind I wanna come in this room and I just wanna sing to you
I hope you're ready for all this love that I came to bring to you
With all that talk I need to see some action boy, you done turned me on
What we're doing boy, I'm so silky man, I'm like extra soft

Putting you to bed tonight, singing you a lullaby
I'll be putting you to bed tonight, bed tonight, bed tonight

Cause baby when the lights go out in the room
I'mma put it down on you
I'll show you the time of your life
Baby right before I say goodnight

I'm singing you this lullaby, lullaby, lullaby
Singing you this lullaby, lullaby, lullaby
I'm singing you this lullaby, lullaby, lullaby
Singing you this lullaby, lullaby, lullaby
