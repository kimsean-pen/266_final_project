I'm sick of living off of leaving all the things I thought I loved.
It's not the fact they all deceive, I just believe a lying tongue and maybe, I was built for the guilt that I let sink in.
But lately, I would kill for the will that lived in me.
Would it be easier to turn away, from all the things we've made too afraid and I can't take it.
And down the road I know I'll miss your face, and all the things we made.
Too afraid and I can't fake it.
And I don't mean to kill this dream we've got
I'm used to lying through my teeth before the feeling seems to stop.
And maybe, I can stay, run away from the pain inside.
But lately, I'm aware, I don't care for the ones I leave behind.
Would it be easier to turn away, from all the things we've made.
Too afraid and I can't take it and down the road I know I'll miss your face, and all the things we made.
Too afraid and I can't fake it.
I'm so sorry, she cut me deep, and hope hasn't found me since.
Would it be easier to turn away, from all the things we've made.
Too afraid and I can't take it.
Would it be easier to turn away, from all the things we've made.
Too afraid and I can't take it and down the road I know I'll miss your face, and all the things we made.
Too afraid and I can't fake it
