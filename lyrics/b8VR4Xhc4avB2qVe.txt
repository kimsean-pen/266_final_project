I know the summer's gonna end
But now I'm far away with friends
Don't even blush when we're holding hands
And sometimes it is for the best
(sometimes it is for the best)
To forget about what's left at home
Tomorrow might not even come

Now baby I've got to know
(baby I, baby I got to know)
Why your love doesn't show
(why your love, why your love doesn't show)
I worry about things that doesn't make sense
Are we lovers or are friends?
Let me know
(baby I, baby I got to know)
Do you want me to go?
(do you want, do you want me to go?)
I worry about you all the time
I want to ask you
Baby, are you mine?
(baby, are you mine?)

I know this chance might come to waste
So now we dance and hardly speak
I don't feel bad when we're cheek to cheek
And when the days are closing in
(when the days are closing in)
I know I've held my hope so high
I almost forget we're all gonna die

Now baby I've got to know
(baby I, baby I got to know)
Why your love doesn't show
(why your love, why your love doesn't show)
I worry about things that doesn't make sense
Are we lovers or are friends?
Let me know
(baby I, baby I got to know)
Do you want me to go?
(do you want, do you want me to go?)
I worry about you all the time
I want to ask you
Baby, are you mine?
(baby, are you mine?)

Baby, are you mine?
(baby, are you mine?)
Baby, are you mine?
Baby, are you mine?
(baby, are you mine?)
Baby, are you mine?
(baby, are you mine?)

Now baby I've got to know
(baby I, baby I got to know)
Why your love doesn't show
(why your love, why your love doesn't show)
I worry about things that doesn't make sense
Are we lovers or are friends?
Let me know
(baby I, baby I got to know)
Do you want me to go?
(do you want, do you want me to go?)
I worry about you all the time
I want to ask you
Now baby I've got to know
(baby I, baby I got to know)
Why your love doesn't show
(why your love, why your love doesn't show)
I worry about things that doesn't make sense
Are we lovers or are friends?
Let me know
(baby I, baby I got to know)
Do you want me to go?
(do you want, do you want me to go?)
I worry about you all the time
I want to ask you
Baby, are you mine?
