O Crown of Light, O Darkened One
I never thought we d meet
You kiss my lips and then it s done
I m back on Boogie Street

A sip of wine, a cigarette and then it s time to go
I tidied up the kitchenette, I tuned the old banjo
I m wanted at the traffic-jam, they re saving me a seat
I m what I am, and what I am is back on Boogie Street

And O my love, I still recall the pleasures that we knew
The rivers and the waterfall, wherein I bathed with you
Bewildered by your beauty there, I d kneel to dry your feet
By such instructions you prepare a man for Boogie Street

O Crown of Light, O Darkened One
I never thought we d meet
You kiss my lips and then it s done
And I m back, back on Boogie Street

So come, my friends, be not afraid, we are so lightly here
It is in love that we are made, in love we disappear
Though all the maps of blood and flesh are posted on the door
There s no one who has told us yet what Boogie Street is for

O Crown of Light, O Darkened One
I never thought we d meet
You kiss my lips, and then it s done
And I m back, back on Boogie Street

A sip of wine, a cigarette and then it s time to go
I tidied up the kitchenette, I tuned the old banjo
I m wanted at the traffic-jam, they re saving me a seat
I m what I am, and what I am is back on Boogie Street
