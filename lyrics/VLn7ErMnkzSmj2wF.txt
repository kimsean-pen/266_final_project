Run away
Run away
I need time to figure out
Wide awake
Wide awake
Seeing signs of slowing down

Oh yeah we wake up in the morning
Think about the nights
Every drink we're pouring
Starts another fight
It's a hazard to our health
But we do it to ourselves
Every time
Every time

Who knew
Nobody could hurt me like
You do
Stuck me in the dark like
Voodoo
Go on make your mark yeah
I'mma love you from afar

Bless your wicked heart
Na na Na na
I know you mean no harm baby
Bless your wicked heart
Na na Na na
I'm gonna love you from afar baby
Bless your wicked heart
Na na Na na
I know you mean no harm baby
Bless your wicked heart
Na na Na na

I don't know where is home
Or where to or what to say anymore
'Cause I swear that I've done and
I wrote and l sang
All the same shit that you've heard before
Because we wake up in the morning
Think about the nights
How we spent $200 on a dinner
And we fight
It's a hazard to our health
But we do it to ourselves
Every time
Every time

Who knew
Nobody could hurt me like
You do
Stuck me in the dark like
Voodoo
Go on make your mark yeah
I'mma love you from afar

Bless your wicked heart
Na na Na na
l know you mean no harm baby
Bless your wicked heart
Na na Na na

l'm gonna love you from afar baby
Bless your wicked heart
Na na Na na
I know you mean no harm baby
Bless your wicked heart
Na na Na na
l'm gonna love you from afar baby
Bless your wicked heart

We never meant for this to be so tragic
Let's go back to the way it was
Maybe you can do your quick black magic
Bring to life all that's dead with us

Who knew
Nobody could hurt me like
You do
Stuck me in with your
Voodoo
Go make your mark baby
Go make your mark
Imma love you from afar

Who knew
Nobody could hurt me like
You do
Stuck me in the dark like
Voodoo
Go on make your mark yeah
I'mma love you from afar
Bless your wicked heart
Na na Na na

l know you mean no harm baby
Bless your wicked heart
Na na Na na
l'm gonna love you from afar baby
Bless your wicked heart
Na na Na na

Bless your wicked heart
Na na Na na
