It's cloudy in the west, it looks like rain
my eyes are black holes and i'm burning away

you slaughtered your loving man
killed him in his sleep
the blood and crying of your murder
simply stains your sheets

Now, you're a ghost on the highway
your gesture is meaningless
you're lost to the living men
trailing souls to the end

You thought winning as a woman, meant failing as a friend
it is nor an art statement, to drown a few passionate men,

you made yourself a diamond
to blind young men's eyes
you claim because they want your shine
they deserve to walk the line,

You're a ghost on the highway
your gesture is meaningless
you're lost forever to the living men
trailing souls to the end

(noise)

Yes, I would give you my love
so my soul would not starve
but, it could never move the honest rock
of what you really are,

You're a ghost on the highway
you're like straw and meaningless
I hate you, but I love you
I'll carry that to the end

If I ever lie with you again, I pray I do not sleep
If I ever closed my eyes again, I'd realize what you are to me.
you are simply a liar
an animal who bluffs and steals
until you become
a bigger creature's meal,

You're a ghost on the highway
your trash and meaningless
I hate you, but I love you
I'll carry that to the end

You lost on the highway
