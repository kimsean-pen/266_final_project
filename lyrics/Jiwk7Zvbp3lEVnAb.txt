(In the middle)
Can't get above or below
(In the middle)
Everything that's left ain't right
(In the middle)
And I have to get up to get down
(In the middle)
Can't spend another minute outside of the

360 degrees
(In the middle)
Cooking with the hottest heat
(In the middle)
The heart of the matters lies right
(In the middle)
Everything that matters resides
(In the middle)

I ain't ever gonna get caught
(In the middle)
Remember everything I forgot is
(In the middle)
Guess I'm gonna have to decide
(In the middle)
Nothing happens when you just stand right
(In the middle)
Balancing two extremes
(In the middle)
Swinging in the in between
(In the middle)
Going where there isn't a guide
(In the middle)
Goining where the love is hiding

And I can't get enough of your love

(In the middle)
Can't get above or below
(In the middle)
Everything that's left ain't right
(In the middle)
And I have to get up to get down
(In the middle)
Can't spend another minute outside of the

360 degrees
(In the middle)
Cooking with the hottest heat
(In the middle)
The heart of the matters lies right
(In the middle)
Everything that matters resides
(In the middle)

And I can't get enough of your love

Building up a head of steam
Current in a running stream
Centre of a laser beam

Compliments to the King 'n' Queen
Perfectly operating machine
Deep inside a beautiful dream

The middle if you know what I mean
Only momentarily seen
Everything in everything
