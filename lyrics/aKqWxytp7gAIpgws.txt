Susie's gone
Are you gonna save me
Never gonna come, come on
Do something amazing
Never gonna scream, in a silent movie

Come back for the summer
Come back for the summer
Don't leave me on my own
Come back for the summer
Don't leave me on my own

She's g-g-g-gone
She's g-g-g-gone

Winter springs along
But lately Susie's gone
What did i do wrong

All we know is we don't know
For all your charm
Is honestly
Just hands on screen
In a silent movie

Come back for the summer
Come back for the summer
Don't leave me on my own
Come back for the summer
Don't leave me on my own

She's g-g-g-gone
She's g-g-g-gone

Susie, come back Susie
Come back Susie
Come back Susie
Come back

Come back for the summer
Come back for the summer
Don't leave me on my own
Come back for the summer
Don't leave me on my own
