To kill a mockingbird
Is to silence the song
That seduces you
Why?
'Cause you need that desire in your heart to survive
And you need that burning fire in your soul to know
You're still alive
To catch me when I fall
Or did I dive at your delight?

In my heart I can fly
And I cannot disguise my love
There is no time
And I wouldn't know how
Constellations tonight
are so fiercesomely bright, my love
I have no fear
I am Atticus now

Remember what I lost like hot coals in my hand from days gone by
Like Pandora adored the euphoria as her heart raced
Like love lost you've got to try even in vain
Feels like you'll go insane
But you're the hardest instrument that I've ever had to play

In my heart I can fly
And I cannot disguise my love
There is no time
And I wouldn't know how to
Constellations tonight
Are so fiercesomely bright, my love
I have no fear
I am Atticus now

So why don't we fall into the waves?
Can't you see how my heart yearns to misbehave?

In my heart I can fly
And I cannot disguise my love
There is no time to
And I wouldn't know how
Constellations tonight
Are so fiercesomely bright, my love
I have no fear left
'Cause I am Atticus now

So why don't we fall into the waves?
Can't you see how my heart yearns to misbehave?
