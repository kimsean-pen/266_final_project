We won't leave 'til you realise, these are the reasons
Why we won't survive on our own, nobody gets left behind
(One, two, three, four)

Don't say you didn't see it coming
Now the world's in disarray
And all that I have said comes back to haunt me

I didn't see the lights
Even though they're blinding me right in the eyes couldn't read the signs
Telling me to swim against the current as they're pulling me under
I'm intoxicated, led astray by the fake
Unconscious to the right solution
Our minds are barely moving
We might deserve a second chance
If I can prove we're alive

Don't say you didn't see it coming
Now the world's in disarray
And all that I have said comes back to haunt me
Don't say you couldn't see the warnings
Or the wolves outside the gates
And all that I have said comes back to haunt me

We won't leave 'til you realise
These are the reasons why we won't survive on our own
Nobody gets left behind
Who told you it's ours for the taking
Every man for himself
In favour of all who trade intelligence
Order for the selfish who don't deserve a second chance
If they're still picking a side

It's the dose that makes it poisonous
It tastes bitter but we're keeping our head above the surface
We're still alive although we've been bitten
It's like a sickness written into our anatomy

This is the sound of no one listening to you running your mouth
Are you thinking out loud or just can't see through the amount of shit
You feel the need to surround yourself with?
You feel the need to surround yourself with?
Back up I'm sick of telling you, enough is enough

It takes my breath away
But I don't feel like I deserve the taste
You're missing the point, can't understand my pain
Some people never change
It's like a fire without a flame

Don't say you didn't see it coming
Now the world's in disarray
And all that I have said comes back to haunt me

Don't say you didn't see it coming
Now the world's in disarray
And all that I have said comes back to haunt me
Don't say you couldn't see the warnings
All the wolves outside the gates
And all that I have said comes back to haunt me

It takes my breath away
But I don't feel like I deserve the taste
You're missing the point, can't understand my pain
Some people never change
It's like a fire without a flame
