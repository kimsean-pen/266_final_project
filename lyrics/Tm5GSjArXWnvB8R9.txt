She got her head in the dirt
And her neck in my hands
She won't live too long with a mind like that
I can't hang every day, baby, I've got plans, oh woah
I won't waste her time with a life like that

Keep your hands on your face
Don't let 'em slip off with the pressure, no
Just stay blind
Take a gram to the face
Don't let 'em see your depression, no
It's not right

Oh baby, maybe it's that look in your eyes
They been telling me she wanna leave
She's been dancing with the devil all night
It's like Hell is where she wanna be

She got a smile on her face and a knife in her hand
She don't look too sane when she acts like that
She said "it's hard to relate when you don't understand"
Well, get your shit straight, baby, I am not your man

Keep your hands to yourself
Don't put 'em on someone else's life
Stay right there, right there
Take advice from yourself
If the energy's dead, baby, let things die
I don't care
Oh, no

Baby, it's that look in your eyes
They been telling me she wanna leave
She's been dancing with the devil all night
It's like Hell is where she wanna be
Now, watch her dance in the dark
Watch her dance in the dark
Watch her dance in the dark
Watch her dance in the dark

I love to watch her dance
When the lights are gone her emotion shows
I love to watch her dance
Seems like tragedy is all she knows

Baby, it's that look in your eyes
They been telling me she wanna leave
She's been dancing with the devil all night
It's like Hell is where she wanna be
Now, watch her dance in the dark
Watch her dance in the dark
Watch her dance in the dark
Watch her dance in the dark
