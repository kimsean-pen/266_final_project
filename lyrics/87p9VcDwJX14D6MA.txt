You can't run, can't hide
I can't leave your side
When your heart is burnin'
Turn me inside out if you can
Love is just the yearnin'
Searchin' for a caressin' hand

Hi!, Hi!, Hi!
We need emotion
(Love is incurable)
I say, Hi!, Hi!, Hi!
Gimme a sign
We might apologize
An' we might realize, Hi, Hi

Hi, Hi, Hi
We need emotion
(Love is incurable)
I say Hi!, Hi!, Hi!
Gimme a sign

I can't lie, can't fly
While we share this style
This might be the answer
To the latest question we had
Runnin' round my mind
It doesn't cease drivin' me mad

Hi!, Hi!, Hi!
We need emotion
(Love is incurable)
I say, Hi!, Hi!, Hi!
Gimme a sign
We might apologize
An' we might realize, Hi!, Hi!

Hi!, Hi!, Hi!
We need emotion
(Love is incurable)
I say, Hi!, Hi!, Hi!
Gimme a sign

Hi!, Hi!, Hi!
We need emotion
I say, Hi!, Hi!, Hi!
Gimme a sign

I say, Hi!, Hi!, Hi!
We need emotion
(Love is incurable)
I say, Hi!, Hi!, Hi!
Gimme a sign
We might apologize
An' we might realize, Hi!, Hi!

Hi!, Hi!, Hi!
We need emotion
(Love is incurable)
I say, Hi!, Hi!, Hi!
Gimme a sign

Hi!, Hi!, Hi!
We need emotion
Love is incurable
I say, Hi!, Hi!, Hi!
