Push to the back
To the front
To the back again
Noses on the back wall
Bringing out
The terrapin
Push to the back
To the front
To the back again
Tunnel vision
I can't see

I want you
To start
Making sense again

Creature comforts
Creature hopes
They've all been sold
Put it at the front
Leave the rest behind
Until we grow old

I want you
To start
Making sense again

Look out Joe
Here comes a cliche
Rock and a hard place
Nothing to say
Ask me a question
What to do
I can't believe
I listen to you

I want you
To start
Making sense again

Push to the back
To the front
To the back again
Noses on the back wall
Bringing out
The terror in
Ask me a question
What to do
I can't believe
I listen to you

I want you
To start
Making sense again
