I'm under the ice
My whole life
If you see me gently smiling baby
You should know I'm just trying not to cry

I see you skating by
You look strong, you look full of life
I gather strenght then change my mind
My heart goes dark
Then I fall behind

I'm under the ice
My whole life
If you see me gently smiling baby
You should know I'm just trying not to cry

I'm under the ice
My whole life
If you see me gently smiling baby
You should know I'm just trying not to cry

We all get a chance at joy
Did mine come and go?
Every morning I quit smoking
Every night I'm bumming a light

I'm under the ice
My whole life
If you see me gently smiling baby
You should know I'm just trying not to cry
I'm under the ice

How much longer do I have to wait
For you to come and burn a hole through my soul?
I want to skate on top with you
But it's dark and it's cold and I'm scared

And I'm still under the ice
My whole life
If you see me gently smiling baby
You should know I'm just trying not to cry
