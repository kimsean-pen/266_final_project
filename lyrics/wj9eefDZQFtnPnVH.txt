Truth is gone up in smoke.
State of doubt settling slowly.
Thought we'd keep going strong.
What'd you think you're doing?
What about the dreams you fed me? What about the promises?
Who's to blame, who's to blame by you?
Who's to blame, who's to blame by you?
I can't help but wonder.
If we are only broken dreams.
Who's to blame?
High, we might recover.
You promised we were bound to be. Who's to blame by you?
Who's to blame?
Who's to blame by you?
Darkest night wide awake.
Rich in pain loathing.
We went wrong in so many ways.
What was your intention with all those
lies?
You fed me empty promises.
Who's to blame, who's to blame by you?
Who's to blame, who's to blame by you?
I can't help but wonder.
If we are only broken dreams.
Who's to blame?
High, we might recover.
You promised we were bound to be.
Who's to blame but you?
Who's to blame?
Who's to blame but you?
