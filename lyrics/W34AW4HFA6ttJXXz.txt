I'm in the heartland
I'd look into your eyes
And I asked:
"Are you really ready for this life?"

Did you see it coming
It happened so fast
The timing was perfect
Water on glass

Like tracing figure
Its own eyes
It escapes
Away

And if his eyes
Should break
It would be
My mistake

Between the cities
Between the city realms
Something inside you
That doesn't sleep well

It won't last forever
Or maybe it will
Our clothes they gave you
We made them so well

Someone once told you
In love, that you must
Place all you're given
In infinite trust

Then a tracing figure
Its own eyes
It escapes
Away

And if his eyes
Should break
It would be
My mistake
