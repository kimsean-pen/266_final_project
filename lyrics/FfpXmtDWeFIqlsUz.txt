Let's call it quits and see what the future holds
I've been here before, yeah, we just went down this road
A long time to feel young, short time to get old
I was holding onto something, knowing you would just let me go
Yeah, I was holding onto something, knowing you would just let me go
I love it when I get high, hate it when it gets cold
Indiscretion is a blessing if you know how the truth is told
But I don't feel my life is real
I'm on the fence with common sense
The tendency of time is to never understand it
The lesson of my life is to never comprehend it
No matter how much you spend trying to blend in
Or maybe on my deathbed I finally get an answer
Yeah, maybe on my deathbed I finally get an answer
Or tell me why it's always been this way
Indiscretion is a blessing if you know what you want to say
But I don't feel my life is real
I'm on the fence with common sense
Won't you enlighten me?
Won't you just set me free?
