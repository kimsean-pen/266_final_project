JOSS STONE
Nothing in this world
got me like you do baby
I'd give up my soul
If I couldn't sing with you daily
I'm not the only girl
In love with you, it's crazy
I appreciate you groove
Now I know I owe everything to you

CHORUS:
Music
I'm so in love with my music
The way you keepin' me movin'
Ain't nobody do what you doin'
So bring me back to the day when tape decks press play
DJ drop the needle 'till the record just break
You are my sunlight, you are the one mic
that sounds so sweet 'cause the beat just inspires me

Verse:
No limit to your mind
Your endless love is open
To every race and kind
Could it be your blood runs golden?
Baby, if this world were mine
We would be singing in the key of life
When you're gone, I just can't survive
'Cause I just can't be without my...

CHORUS:
Music
I'm so in love with my music
The way you keepin' me movin'
Ain't nobody do what you doin'
So bring me back to the day when tape decks press play
DJ drop the needle 'till the record just break
You are my sunlight, you are the one mic
that sounds so sweet 'cause the beat just inspires me

Colours of sound
Scales and beauty
Audio scenery
Electric love and
Rhythmic symmetry
Written in memory
Beautifully crafted scenery
Complex or simplicity
Sonic energy
Piercing insensitivity
Sympathetic poetry
For some even identity
Collective entity
Something to belong to
A source of energy
The possibilities
Wave lengths and bandwith
Higher vibration
Energizing entire lands with
Or stand for
Lovers to walk hand in hand with
then plan for
Sanctuary chords
Harmony, melodies, even riffs can be
Disguised human essence
Sonically bottled ecstasy
Or melancholy
Agony blues angst
Exercising anxieties
Fueling entire societies
Making economies
Stimulating generating
Inspiration synonymously
Entertaining expression
Intangible invisible but undeniable
Plays the language of excitement on survival
Some call it tribal
But perspective is everything
Connected to everything
Some say collectively everything

Music
I'm so in love with my music
The way you keepin' me movin'
Ain't nobody do what you doin'
So bring me back to the day when tape decks press play
DJ drop the needle 'till the record just break
You are my sunlight, you are the one mic
that sounds so sweet 'cause the beat just inspires me
