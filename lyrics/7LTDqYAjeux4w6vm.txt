Nowhere to run
Not a place to hide
Black widow, butterfly
You're free till winter falls on me

Set the clock
Make you believe
I hold the power to deceive
Your wings rest fragile in my hands

Amnesia
Urgency, emergency, insurgency
Amnesia

Left behind
Time to waste
Burrowed in a fallen saint
I have not a memory in my heart

No control, don't recall
Who or what I was before
Fill me without guilt
I won't repent

Amnesia
Urgency, emergency, insurgency
Amnesia

No eye has seen
Ear has heard
I cannot imagine her
A wanton womb of sick that won't give up
Arcane amputee
Bathing in depravity
Blind, torture, kill
I won't repent
Amnesia
