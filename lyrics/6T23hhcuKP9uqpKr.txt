Used to be our key to myself
When you talked, I was somewhere else
Didn't truly appreciate until it was too late
I'll be gone, gone for weeks at a time
On the phone, didn't pay no mind
Like a fool thinking you would stay
Until you walked away

So, baby won't you please come back?
I swear this time that I would love you more than that
So trust me when I tell you that
I, I, I, I, I'm never gonna hurt you again
No, I, I, I, I, I'm begging let me love you again
Love you again
Uh uh uuh, let me love you,
Oh, let me love you again
Uh uh uuh, let me love you,
Love you again

I was young, I was dumb, I was blind
I was wrong, I was so unkind
and for all the mistakes I made
Girl, let me start by saying
I'm sorry that I kept you in the dark
You find it in your heart to forgive me, baby
We can make a brand new start
I'll leave the light on for you
Won't you leave a light on for me, too?!

So, baby won't you please come back?
I swear this time that I would love you more than that
So trust me when I tell you that
I, I, I, I, I'm never gonna hurt you again
No, I, I, I, I, I'm begging let me love you again
Love you again
Uh uh uuh, let me love you,
Oh, let me love you again
Uh uh uuh, let me love you,
Love you again

You & I can make this right
I failed you once
Wouldn't fail you twice
Now I see, I see the truth
I don't want nobody else
No, it was only you
So I want you to me
I can't take this more
Yeah, I need you here
Wanna see you walking through my door

Uh uh uuh, let me love you,
Oh, let me love you again
Uh uh uuh, let me love you,
Love you again
