Early man walked away as modern man took control
Their minds weren't all the same, to conquer was their goal
So he built his great empire and he slaughtered his own kind
He died a confused man, killed himself with his own mind

Early man walked away as modern man took control
Their minds weren't all the same and to conquer was their goal
So he built his great empire and he slaughtered his own kind
He died a confused man and he killed himself with his own mind
LET'S GO!

That's why we might as well take our time
