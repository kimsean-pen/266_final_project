I'm a China toad
But I'm in filing mode
Please take it off
Please take it off

I have four arms to see things through,
For fetching food, so we can't stop
Please take it off
All I ask is once again

It's Boston and his friend,
Stops in the haunt again,
Rising from down below

It's Choade and, sure the black dog,
Sure the black dog,
Lose my friend,
It's Choade my dear,
Alone my dear,
Please let go to.

I'm a China toad
But I'm in reckless mode
Please take it off
Please take it off

I have four arms and I have lost my choade
For fetching food, so we can't stop
Please take it off
All I ask is once again

Suite...?
