I can feel it with the way you look at me
It's written all over your lovely face
And babe, it feels so good the way our energy
With just a touch it seems to overtake

Throw away responsibility, yeah
There's a time and place for everything, yeah
Don't you take your eyes off of me, yeah
As I dedicate, appreciate, yeah

If you're so damn electric
The way we speak body language
And everything is connected
And everything is connect

If you're so damn electric
The way we speak body language
And everything is connected
And everything is bodt
(And everything is body)

Love your feeling, love your generosity
It's like you're reading into my sensation
I could give you everything you want and dream
Take your mind off of things that are bothering

Throw away responsibility, yeah
There's a time and place for everything, yeah
Don't you take your eyes off of me, yeah
As I dedicate, appreciate, yeah

If you're so damn electric
The way we speak body language
And everything is connected
And everything is connect

If you're so damn electric
The way we speak body language
And everything is connected
And everything is body

If you're so damn electric
The way you touch on me baby
The way we speak body language
Conexão, conexão

What a feeling, what a feeling, what a feeling
What a feeling, what a feeling, what a feeling

Don't you see that, don't you see that, don't you see that

Yeah, yeah
Yeah
