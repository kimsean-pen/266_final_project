She got the call today, one out of the grey
And when the smoke cleared, it took her breath away
She said she didn't believe, it could happen to me
I guess we're all one phone call from our knees
We're gonna get there soon

If every building falls, and all the stars fade
We'll still be singin' this song, the one they can't take away

Gonna get there soon, she's gonna be there too
Cryin' in her room, prayin' "Lord come through"
We're gonna get there soon

Oh it's your light, oh it's your way
Pull me out of the dark, just to shoulder the weight
Cryin' out now, from so far away
You pull me closer to love, closer to love
Meet me once again, down off Lake Michigan

Where we can feel the storm blowin' down with the wind
And don't apologize for all the tears you've cried
You've been way too strong now for all your life
I'm gonna get there soon, you're gonna be there too

Cryin' in her room, prayin' "Lord come through"
We're gonna get there soon
Oh it's your light, oh it's your way

Pull me out of the dark, just to shoulder the weight
Cryin' out now, from so far away
You pull me closer to love, closer to love
'Cause you are all that I've waited for all of my life (We're gonna get there)
You are all that I've waited for all of my life
You pull me closer to love, closer to love
Pull me closer to love
You pull me closer to love, closer to love (Oh no)
Closer to love, closer to love, closer to love
You pull me closer to love
