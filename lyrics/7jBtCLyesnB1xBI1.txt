Oh yeah...

For the longest while we're jamming in the party
And you're wining on me
Pushing everything
Right back on top of me, yeah hey
But if you think you're gonna get away from me
You better change your mind
You're going home
You're going home with me tonight

Let me hold you
Girl caress my body
You got me going crazy, you
Turn me on

Let me jam you
Girl wine all around me
You got me going crazy, you
Turn me on
Turn me on

Well a gal a nah go getaway tonight
If she think say Madman nah go fight
Me done feed her with popcorn and sprite
War come fly way like kite

One hand on the ground her bumpa cocked sky-high
Wining hard on me
Got my python
Hollering for mercy, yeah hey
Then I whisper in her ear so wine harder
And then she said to me
Boy just push that thing
Push it harder back on me

So let me hold you
Girl caress my body
You got me going crazy, you

Let me jam you
Girl wine all around me
You got me going crazy, you

But if you think you're gonna get away from me
