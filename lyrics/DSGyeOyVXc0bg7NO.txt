High school ring,
High school ring,
Who would have guessed it was a homicidal thing.
Crying crying crying on your front porch swing.
Eyes swollen up like a yellowjacket sting.

Call him a thief, call him a crook,
Youll never get back what the magpie took.
Call him a raven, call him a rook,
Youll never get back what the magpie took.

Your boyfriend's mean,
Your boyfriend's mean,
I swear, I swear, I swear I didnt say anything.
Your grandmothers silver,
You kept it so clean.
And those dark glasses, can you see what I mean.

Call him a thief, call him a crook,
Youll never get back what the magpie took.
Call him a raven, call him a rook,
Youll never get back what the magpie took.
