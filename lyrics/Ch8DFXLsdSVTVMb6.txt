Can't tell your friends to sit on my mess, oh no
It's easy to say when they got their interests, oh yes
We're spendin' all our money, we're broken but we still party
I think I could love someone like you-ou-ou-ou

When you look my way
I want you to say
"Let's not throw it away"
You'll be breakin' my heart if you don't stay
So don't let it go
Speed it up or go slow
'Cause I need you to know
You'll be breakin' my heart if you don't stay

When I go away you make me pay, oh yeah
But I don't control where our lives go, oh no
I'm spendin' all my money, I'm broken but we still party
I think I could love somebody like you-ou-ou-ou

When you look my way
I want you to say
"Let's not throw it away"
You'll be breakin' my heart if you don't stay
So don't let it go
Speed it up or go slow
'Cause I already know
You'll be breakin' my heart if you don't stay

Don't give me a reason
To be older than my feelings
For you, for you
'Cause I don't need a reason
To be feelin' what I'm feelin'
I just do, I just do

Don't be lonely 'cause you're not alone
Gotta send me pictures, save 'em to my room
If I fly to see you would it feel like home?
If I change my number, you're the first to know

'Cause when you look my way
I want you to say
"Just don't throw it away"
You'll be breakin' my heart if you don't stay
So don't let it go
Speed it up or go slow
'Cause I already know
You'll be breakin' my heart if you don't stay

Don't give me a reason
To be older than my feelings
For you, for you
'Cause I don't need a reason
To be feelin' what I'm feelin'
I just do
You'll be breakin' my heart if you don't stay
