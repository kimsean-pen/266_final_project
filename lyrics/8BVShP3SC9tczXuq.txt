Don't drop me off just yet
It's too safe
And we've only just met
I'll rephrase
Please just drive
The city limit's fine

And then I'll make my way
But I could always stay
Lead the way
Just drive
The city limit's fine
We're inside

Don't drop me off just yet
Spend some time
Cause we've only just met
We're way behind
Please just drive
The city limit's fine
We're inside

Just drive
The city limit's fine
We're inside
