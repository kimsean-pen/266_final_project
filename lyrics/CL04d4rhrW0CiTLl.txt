Your brown eyes are my blue skies.
They light up the river that the birds fly over.
Better not to quench your thirst.
Better not to be the first one diving in,
though you caught me and you know why
they breathe in the deepest part of the water.

What's the matter? You hurt yourself?
Opened your eyes and there was someone else?
Now i've got you in the undertow.
Now i've got you in the undertow.
Why you wanna blame me for your troubles?
Ah ah ah you better learn your lesson yourself.
Nobody ever has to find out what's in my mind tonight.

Let tonight pass us by.
Do you really want to be the one to fight?
And i said "You're better not to light that fire.
It will take you to the darkest part of the weather."

What's the matter? You hurt yourself?
Opened your eyes and there was someone else?
Now i've got you in the undertow.
Now i've got you in the undertow.
Why you wanna blame me for your troubles?
Ah ah ah you better learn your lesson yourself.
Nobody ever has to find out what's in my mind tonight.
Nobody ever has to find out what's in my mind tonight.

Nobody in my mind. Nobody in my mind.
I feel it in my heart tonight.

I laid on the floor, pressing in my eyes.
Seeing little lights.
These are the decisions that only one could make(?)
I wanted to stay home but i went running running running running from the troubles
runningrunningrunningrunningrunningrunningrunning

What's the matter? You hurt yourself?
Opened your eyes and there was someone else?
Now i've got you in the undertow
Now i've got you so
why you wanna blame me for your troubles?
Ah ah ah you better learn your lesson yourself.
Nobody ever has to find out what's in my mind tonight.
Nobody ever has to find out what's in my mind tonight.
