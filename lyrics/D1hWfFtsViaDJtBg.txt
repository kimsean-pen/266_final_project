When you look into my eyes
Baby, when you speak my name
I can feel it in my heart
My whole life has changed
Givin' me your heart
Give me your phone
And your mind
Isn't that fine?

Isn't that enough? Isn't that enough?
Isn't that enough? Isn't that enough?

Well, they say that you don't want me
You don't really care
But when nobody love me
Baby, do appear

(Do you wrong, do you wrong)
They say run along
(Do you wrong, do you wrong)
I say no, 'cause he keeps me warm at night
(Do you wrong, do you wrong)
Switch him, do him wrong
(Do you wrong, do you wrong)
They don't know, and it makes me feel so wrong

Isn't that enough? Isn't that enough?
Baby I'm in love, yeah
Give me your heart
Give me your soul (Isn't that enough)

Ooh, ooh

No, I don't care what they say about us
No, I don't care 'cause baby
They don't understand us
I don't care what they think about me
'Cause you make me, oh
You make me so happy, yeah

Isn't that enough? Isn't that enough?
Baby, baby
Isn't that enough?
(Yeah, ooh-ooh-ooh) Isn't that enough?
Isn't that enough?
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Isn't that enough?
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Isn't that enough?
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Isn't that enough?
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
