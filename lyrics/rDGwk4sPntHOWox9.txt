There's polyphonic voices in my head again
The outcome catastrophic
This isn't me who's talking
It's an invasion on my patience cause I've listened and the lesson's gone
Intuitive we knew it is, why is it something that we get so wrong?

So free ourselves don't let nobody take control
Remember yourself don't let nobody take control
Cause in the end you know you make it right, you fight it out
In the end you make it right
So free ourselves don't let nobody take control

Self control
Self control

Self control
Self control

Telescopic seeds have been implanted
A negative topic gives them all watering
It's an invasion on my patience cause I've listened and the lesson's gone
Intuitive we knew it is, why is it something that we get so wrong?

So free ourselves don't let nobody take control
Remember yourself don't let nobody take control
Cause in the end you know you make it right, you fight it out
In the end you make it right
So free ourselves don't let nobody take control

Self control
Self control

Self control
Self control

Self control
Self control
