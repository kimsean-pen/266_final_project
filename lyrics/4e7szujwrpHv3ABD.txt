Stand on the morning
Head like a weather vane
You stuck to your shirt
Clung to your lemonade
Dirt in the wind
The bugs were singing out of tune
You hear the thump
Beating down low

When your heart aches
And your morning breaks
By the TV on your own
And your hollow hand on a cold can
You're rising like a stone
I heard the warning
I saw you falling
Down along Sydney Road
Be alright, put your weight
On the second hand

Back in the headlights
Windows were screening one by one
A moving image
Of your reflection
You hardly look sharp
Your guts are in a knot
And all your new friends
Are frayed at the ends

When your heart aches
And your morning breaks
By the TV on your own
And your hollow hand on a cold can
You're rising like a stone
I heard the warning
I saw you falling
Down along Sydney Road
Be alright, put your weight
On the second hand

I heard the warning
I saw you falling
