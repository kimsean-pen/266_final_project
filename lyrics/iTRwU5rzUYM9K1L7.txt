This is what I know about sacrifice,
Meet me at the crossroads.
LET'S GO!
This life, is constant sacrifice,
I laid myself up for the world to see.
TO SEE!
This time, I'm going to get it right,
My past should be more than just a memory.
I said that I would give anything,
To live my life out and follow my dreams.
I didn't know what I would be facing,
and it would take this, and everything from me!
In a world that won't stop,
on top of all that I love, (?)
I gave this all that I've got,
SO TAKE YOUR BEST SHOT!
NOW LISTEN UP! I'M HERE TO SET
THE STORY STRAIGHT!
MEET ME AT THE CROSSROADS,
LET'S GO!
