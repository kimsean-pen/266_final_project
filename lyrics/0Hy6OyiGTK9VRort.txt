Here I go, with snakes around my neck
Pound of iron on my chest
With this body made from lead
Am I toxic, do I poison what I love
Am I dangerous to trust
Explosive to this touch

God why won't you let me go
Into the raging sea below
Into the storm cloud above
Because I can't stand your love

Send me to hell, it's where I belong
Don't be afraid, I won't be long
I'm coming straight back
No fear I'll attack
And when I do, I'm coming for you

God why won't you let me go
Into the raging sea below
Into the storm cloud above
Because I can't stand your love

Send me to hell, it's where I belong
Don't be afraid, I won't be long
I'm coming straight back
No fear I'll attack
And when I do, I'm coming for you

God why won't you let me go
Into the raging sea below
Into the storm cloud above
Because I can't stand your love
