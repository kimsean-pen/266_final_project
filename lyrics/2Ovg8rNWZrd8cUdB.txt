My lady your Lablakley dress
Descending from your shoulders
It's lifting me up
In surprise
I thought I've gone away
Your body rhythm shifts about
And sends me sweet aromas
That little sparkle
In your life
It's sugar on my day
I want to sleep with you at night
And wake up on your toes
As I kiss softly
From your stomach where we lay
