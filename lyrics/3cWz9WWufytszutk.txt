I've got these holes in my shoes that
I feel just can't be filled until
I get that sway in your hips, and you can give me your address.

And in the wake of the offer,
We could have another twist across the bridge,
If you'd stay a little later.
I've got these holes in my shoes that I feel
Just can't be filled until I get that sway in your hips, then we can kiss.

We'll send it up. We'll send it out with a light that burns.
Burn the sun! Burn the sun!
We'll burn the sun! We'll burn the sun with our light!
We'll send it off with a light, while you lie and burn the sun.

I can tell you're lonely, clawing at the walls.
I'm waiting for you. Cause when you walk my heart just stops.
I can taste the money on the tip of my tongue.
I'll bring you the sun whenever you want, wherever you are.
Cause I've been tearing at these walls waiting for your call.

Cause when you walk my heart just stops.

And in the wake of the offer
We could have another twist just like this,
If you'd stay a little later.

I've got these holes in my shoes that
I feel just can't be filled.
Until I get that sway in your hips and you can give me your address.
Until I get that sway in your hips.
Cause I've been trying to stay afloat but I've got these holes.
