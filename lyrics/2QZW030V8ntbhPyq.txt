Boy you know you make me float
Boy you really get me high, ooh
I feel like I'm on dope
'Cause you, you serve me on a regular
Boy we need to tie this rope
Before drifting me deeper
You're now hold me close
Boy let's take this overboard now

I want you to rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
Work it in the middle, work the middle
Work the middle, work the middle
Change positions, do positions
Do position, do position
(Now stroke it baby), stroke it for me, stroke it for me
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me

Ooh baby I love your stroke
'Cause you, 'cause you get me where I'm going
In a jury you'll get my vote
'Cause I believe
I believe you know just what you doing now
Baby now we can coast (let's coast, let's coast)
Please don't get in a hurry
That's too slow
Go ahead and put that thing in overdrive

I want you to rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
Work it in the middle, work the middle
Work the middle, work the middle
Change positions, do position
Do position, do position
(Now stroke it baby), stroke it for me, stroke it for me
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me

I want you to rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
Work it in the middle, work the middle
Work the middle, work the middle
Change positions, do position
Do position, do position
(Now stroke it baby), stroke it for me, stroke it for me
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me

Stroke it for me
Mm, stroke it baby, stroke it baby
Mmmm, work it baby, work it baby
Ooh, stroke it
There is somethin' I want you to do

I need you to use yourself
Like you never ever used it before (never)
To explore my body (explore it baby)
Until you reach the shore
You'll be calling, calling for more

Rock the boat, rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat
Work it in the middle, work the middle
Work the middle, work the middle (Work it baby, work it baby)
Change positions, do position (mmm, change)
Do position, do position
Now stroke it for me (baby), stroke it for me
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me

I want you to rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
Work it in the middle, work the middle
Work the middle, work the middle (Oh, work it baby!)
Change positions, do position
Do position, do position
Now stroke it for me, stroke it for me
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me

Rock the boat, rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat
Work the middle, work the middle
Work the middle, work the middle
Change positions, do position
Do position, do position
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me

Rock the boat, rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat
