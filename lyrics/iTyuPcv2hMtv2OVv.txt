I'll never love again...
(love again... love again...)
I wont ever have to pretend...
(pretend... pretend... pretend... pretend...)
I'm never gonna love again...
(love again... love again...)

DAMN!

I don't ever want to have to try
And though I lie
It never flies.
I don't ever wanna have to die.
But deep inside
The death it hides.
And I never wanna clarify
And justify
So I run and hide.
And I never wanna signify
So I pacify all the hate inside.

(Noooo...)
I'll never love again!
(Noooo...)
I wont ever have to pretend!
(Noooo...)
I'm never gonna love again!
Never gonna have to try to pretend!
Never!
Never!
Never!

I don't ever wanna satisfy
'cause things inside
Are doing fine.
I don't ever wanna multiply
'cause deep inside
I'm not qualified.
And I never wanna clarify
And justify
So I run and hide.
And I never wanna signify
So I pacify all the hate inside.

(Noooo...)
I'll never love again!
(Noooo...)
I won't ever have to pretend!
(Noooo...)
I'm never gonna love again!
Never gonna have to try to pretend!
Never!
Never!
Never!

I'll never love again...
I'm never gonna love again!

NEVER!
NEVER!
NEVER!

(Scat...)

(Noooo...)
I'll never love again!
(Noooo...)
I won't ever have to pretend!
(Noooo...)
I'm never gonna love again!
Never gonna have to try to pretend!
Never!
Never!
Never!

(Noooo...)
Never!
Never!
Never!
(Noooo...)
Never!
Never!
Never!
(Noooo...)
I'm never gonna love again!
Never gonna have to try to pretend!
Never!
Never!
Never!
