You're mine, motherfucker!
Let me begin, envy's a sin
You'll have to find new words to invent
Cause I've heard you broken record
And I'm not impressed

I love when you talk, I just use it to drive me
I won't let your judgment define me
I'm not broken, so don't fix me
I want you to hate me

Tell me what you've lost, hang me on your cross
If you're so wise, then why are you so soft?
Do you leave your "Throne" as you cast your stones?
I'm above living under your microscope

You're mine, motherfucker!

I'm insane, I'm "insane in the membrane"
I wanna fuck your face with a switchblade
I'm not broken, so don't fix me
I'll leave you behind me

Internet killed the video star
Internet killed the video star

Tell me what you've lost, hang me on your cross
If you're so wise, then why are you so soft?
Do you leave your "Throne" as you cast your stones?
I'm above living under your microscope

Cry baby, cry baby
Did I just hear you whimper?
Cry baby, cry
Suck on my middle fucking finger
BLEGH

Cry baby, cry baby
What have you done lately?
Cry baby, cry baby
What have you done?

Tell me what you've lost, demonize my flaws
Do they call you when dumb needs a mascot?
Do you leave your "Throne" as you cast your stones?
I'm above living under your microscope

You dilate
God of your existence
Begging me to listen
While you "pray"
Swallow in vain
Silver spoon religion
Closer from a distance

You're mine, motherfucker!

Cry baby, cry baby
Cry baby, cry baby

You're mine, motherfucker!
