I'm waiting for the feeling to get to me and throw me to the floor
You've found a little place in the back of my mind, so just work a little more

And think of how you want to spend the rest of your days
With all your dreams still in your head
I've learnt to be heard without all of the words,
no good to me, they've all been said

and
I want someone who reaches out, so we connect, oh
I want someone who reaches out, someone who can
Show me love but you keep on telling me
What you want, oh, you keep on telling me
How I feel, but I want someone
Who can make me fall in love and then hit the ground running,
Not just keep on telling me, keep on telling me.

I'm better than the things that you want from me
so take another guess
and slip a little further into fantasty
jut put it to the test
and think about the words that you started to say
no good for me, you lost your head
and taking it for granted that will be around
dont want to be safety net

cos
I want someone who reaches out so we connect, oh
I want someone who reaches out, someone who can
Show me love but you keep on telling me,
What you want, oh, you keep on telling me
How I feel, but I want someone
Who can make me fall in love and then hit the ground running,
Who can make me feel what you keep on telling me,
Show the love that you keep on telling me
Keep on telling me, keep on telling me

I'm waiting for the feeling to get to me
and throw me to the floor
I'm waiting for the feeling to get to me
and throw me to the floor
I'm waiting for the feeling to get to me

(chorus repeat)

I'm waiting for the feeling to get to me...
