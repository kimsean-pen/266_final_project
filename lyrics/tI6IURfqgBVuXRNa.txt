I can't help that I like to be kissed
And I wouldn't mind
If my name changed to Mrs.

This is one side
My conventional side
An attraction to tradition
My vintage disposition

My sincere architecture
And I want to cook him dinner
But I'm more indecisive then ever
And who believes in forever?

Who will be the one to marry me?

A girl in the world
Barking up the wrong tree
A creature conditioned
To employ matrimony

Crumbling continuity
I pick up the pieces
The ceremony makes me zealous
As the past quickly ceases

Fear from being neutered
I'm now prude, now defensive
Quickly I'm altered and tempted
By new love only rented

Do you believe you'll marry me?
You might be the one to marry me

Back, looking back, looking back at me
(Back)
(I'm not how I used to be)
I'm not how I used to be
Take me back, take me back into history
(Take me back)
Diamond ring, tie me down, just like it used to be
(Diamond ring, like it used to be)
(Tie me down, how it used to be)
(Look how it was used to be)
(No love was used to be)

Who will be the one to marry me?
Who will be the one to marry me?

(How I used to be)
(I'm not how I used to be)
Looking back, looking back at me
(How I used to be)
I'm not how I used to be
(I'm not how I used to be)
Take me back, take me back into history
(Back, back)
Diamond ring, tie me down, just like it used to be
(Like it used to be)

Marry me?
Marry me?
Forever, and ever, and ever, and ever
Happily ever after
Happily ever after
Happily ever after
Happily ever after

Resented
(Something old)
(Something new)
(Something borrowed)
(Something blue)
Rented
(Apprehensive)

Here comes the bride
(You meant it)
All dressed in white
(You hint it)
Here comes the bride
(You mean)
All dressed in white

Something old
Something new
Something borrowed
Something blue

It's pretty when I'm faithful
Hmm, and ever, ever, ever, ever
(Oh)
(Can surely tell)
Forever, and ever
(Oh)
Forever, and ever
(Surely tell)
Forever, and ever, and ever, and ever
(Happily ever after)
(Happily ever after)
(Happily ever after)
(Happily ever after)
Happily ever after
(You and me)
Happily ever after
(You were to be)
(Can't believe)
