I felt the pressure building up pushing from every side
You didn't even mind
It took the rest of me to stop and say no more
You didn't even mind

Am I just reading it all wrong? Too many voices overtaking and I'm misplacing
Wasting this precious time, avoiding signs
I'm in too deep to quit and there's just too many good reasons that keep me sucked in
Though barely scraping by, you didn't flinch at all
I spent the rest of my earnings on just feeling numb
I never meant to keep putting this on you
It's all wrong, It's alright

When it's all gone bad and I've probably lost it
The world could die, but you'd survive

How many faced with, how many torn
I see how much I wasted while you never turned
