The city of angels is lonely tonight
Keep myself alive by candlelight
Say she can't love you like I do
Look me in the eyes and say it's true

I ask myself is this love at all?
When I need you most you let me fall
I'm always here at the side of your stage
Let you live your life, pretend I'm okay

Don't you know that this ain't over?
I'll be okay
I'll hold you close, we'll stay forever

I, I don't understand
Why you're leaving me
I, I don't understand

How without you I can't breathe
Please don't, don't leave me here
Take my hand
I plead in tears

I don't understand
Why you can't take me with you

You can pretend I don't exist

But you see my face every time you kiss
I hope you hurt and your walls fall down
When you hear the sound that I'm okay

Don't you know that this ain't over?
I'll be okay
You can't hold me down, I won't stay forever

I, I don't understand
Why you're leaving me
I, I don't understand
How without you I can't breathe

Please don't, don't leave me here
Take my hand
I plead in tears
I don't understand

Why you can't take me with you

I watch you leave, walk away tonight
And I'm letting go for the last time

And through the tears I say goodbye
So breathe in, breathe in, breathe in, breathe out

I, I don't understand

Why you're leaving me
I, I don't understand
How without you I can't breathe
Please don't, don't leave me here
Take my hand
I plead in tears
I don't understand
Why you can't take me with you
I don't understand
Why you're leaving me
(I, I don't understand)
How without you I can't breathe
Please don't, don't leave me here
Take my hand
I plead in tears
I don't understand
Why you can't take me with you
