Sun
Lying in the sun
Had a lot of rain in the winter
All I want is the

Sun
Doesn't everyone
Have a little pain from time to time
Now it's time for the sun to shine
And doesn't it feel good

Sun
Doesn't hurt my eyes
I can see a lot in the moving patterns
Made by the sun

I close my eyes and I can see
The more I feel
The more I'm free
The sun is an electric show
The more I dream
The more I know

Sun
Lying in the sun
Had a lot of rain in the winter
All I want is some
Peace for a minute
All alone in the sun
