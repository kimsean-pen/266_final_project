Yeah, she says I'm living in the wrong dimension
I don't care
Sometimes it's better when I don't think about it

Sometimes when we're going in circles
You make it hard to see
Take me down to everyone's level
I'm way too high to breathe

The look in your eyes is slowly fading away
It doesn't matter now 'cause I think I'm far too late
The look in your eyes is slowly fading away
It doesn't matter now 'cause I think I'm far too late

Yeah, I'm a victim of my own delusions
It's not fair
Trapped in the city with no real conclusions

I feel broken in a thousand places
The lies are one that show
Dying to be somebody else now
There's nowhere else to go

The look in your eyes is slowly fading away
It doesn't matter now 'cause I think I'm far too late
The look in your eyes is slowly fading away
It doesn't matter now 'cause I think I'm far too late

It all changes all the time
Everything is gonna be just fine
It all changes all the time
Everything is gonna be just fine

Sometimes when we're going in circles
You make it hard to see
Take me down to everyone's level
I'm way too high to breathe

The look in your eyes is slowly fading away
(It's not the first time that I've felt this way)
It doesn't matter now cause I think I'm far too late
(It's not the first time that I've felt this way)
The look in your eyes is slowly fading away
(It's not the first time that I've felt this way)
It doesn't matter now cause I think I'm far too late
(It's not the first time that I've felt this way)
