There's a war inside of me
Do I cause new heartbreak to write a new broken song
Do I push it down or let it run me right in to the ground
I, I feel like, I wouldn't like me, if I met me

Well I can't stop talking for fear of listening to unwelcome sound
And you haven't called me in weeks
And honestly it's bringing me down
Ohh I,
I feel like, I wouldn't like me, if I met me
I feel like, you wouldn't like me, if you met me

And don't you worry there's still time
Don't you worry there's still time

There's nothing to live for when I'm sleeping alone
And I wash the windows outside in
hopes that the glare will, bring you around

I, I feel like, I wouldn't like me, if I met me
I, I feel like, you wouldn't like me, if you met me
So don't you worry there's still time
Don't you worry there's still time
Don't you worry there's still time
Don't you worry there's still time

Sunshine is days away, I won't be saved
I know all the words
I can't say that I'll love you forever
Sunshine is days away, I won't be saved
I know all the words
I can't say that I'll love you forever
