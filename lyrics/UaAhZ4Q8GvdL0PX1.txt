Instead of carving up the wall
Why don't you open up, we talk?
I am ready, I am ready for a fall
Instead of carving up the wall
Why don't you open up, we talk?
We are ready, we are ready for the floor
I can't hear your voice, do I have a choice?
I'm hoping with chance, you might take this dance
I can't hear your voice, do I have a choice?
(You're sinking below, I'm using my force)
I'm hoping with chance, you might take this dance
You're my number one guy
Instead of carving up the wall
Why don't you open up, we talk?
I am ready, I am ready for a fall
Instead of carving up the wall
Why don't you open up, we talk?
