One day I woke up
I woke up knowing
Today is the day I will die
Cash Dogg was barking
Went to the park
And enjoyed it one last time
I called my mother
Told her I loved her
And I begged her not to cry
I wrote a letter
I said I'd miss her
And I signed that good bye

You know the happiest day of my life
I swear the happiest day of my life
Is the day that I die

Can you feel the cold tonight? (the day that I died)
It sets in, but it's alright (the day that I died)
Darkness falls, I'm letting go (the day that I died)
All alone, but I feel fine (the day that I died)

We took a drive and
We drove through DC
To see the places we lived
Long conversations
We talked of old friends
And all the things that we did
Summer nights
Drunken fights
Mistakes we made
Did we live it right?

You know the happiest day of my life
I swear the happiest day of my life
Is the day that I died

Can you feel the cold tonight? (the day that I died)
It sets in, but it's alright (the day that I died)
Darkness falls, I'm letting go (the day that I died)
All alone but I feel just fine

You know the happiest day of my life,
I know the happiest day of my life
I swear the happiest day of my life
Is the day that I die

Can you feel the cold tonight? (the day that I died)
It sets, but it's alright (the day that I died)
Darkness falls, I'm letting go (the day that I died)
All alone, but I feel fine

Did I live it right?
(day that i die)
I hope I lived it right
(day that i die)
Did I live it right?
(day that i die)
Did I Live it right?
I Hope I lived it right
(day that i die)
I know I Lived it right
