Ohhhhh!!
I wish I could believe you
Then I'd be alright
But now everything you told me
Really don't apply
To the way I feel inside
Loving you was easy
Once upon a time
But now my suspicions of you

Have multiplied
And it's all because you lied
I only give you a hard time

Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forgive this
But I'm much too full of resentment
Just can't seem to get over

The way you hurt me
Don't know how you gave another
Who didn't mean a thing no
Of Everything you gave to me
I thought I could forgive you
And I know you've changed
As much as I wanna trust you

I know it ain't the same
And it's all because you lied
I only give you a hard time
Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forgive this

But I'm much too full of resentment
I may never understand why
I'm doing the best that I can and I
I've tried and I've tried to forgive this
I'm much too full of resentment (you lied)

I'll always remember feeling (you lied)
Like I was no good (you lied)
Like I couldn't do it for you (you lied)
Like your mistress could
And it's all because you lied

Loved you more than ever (you lied)
More than my own life (you lied)
The best part of me I gave you (you lied)
It was sacrificed
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I've tried and I've tried to forgive this
I'm too damn full of resentment

I know she was attractive but I was here first
Been riding with you for 6 years
Why did I deserve
To be treated this way by you
I know you prolly thinking

What's up wit "B"
I've been crying for too long
What did you do to me
I used to be so strong
Now you took my soul
I'm crying I can't stop crying
Can't stop crying
You could've told me
You was unhappy
I know you didn't wanna hurt me
But look what you done to me now
I gotta look at her in her eyes (you lied)
And see she's had half of me (you lied)
How could you lie (you lied)
