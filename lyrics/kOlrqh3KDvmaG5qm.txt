I don't love her
I tried to tell myself
But you could see it in my eyes
So don't deny, I can't fool no one else
The truth is in the tears I cried

Cuz if it isn't love
Why do I feel this way
Why does she stay on my mind
And if it isn't love
Why does it hurt so bad
Make me feel so sad inside
(If it isn't love)

I told her I'd never fall in love
But now I know better

How does it feel
I can't describe this feeling
That came when I saw her last night (Ohh...)
She got to me
I'll let you know the reason
I saw her with another guy

So if it isn't love
Why do I feel this way
Why does she stay on my mind
And if it isn't love
Why does it hurt so bad
Make me feel so sad inside

And if it isn't love
Why do I feel this way
Why does she stay on my mind
And if it isn't love
Why does it hurt so bad
Make me feel so sad inside
(If it isn't love)

Maybe she'll take me back
(Hey girl, He's begging)
I made a big mistake
(Want you to forgive him girl)
Now I can feel it
(He's never felt before)
I really love her
(Love her... What)

It took my heart
Shattered in a thousand pieces
Before I'd ever dropped my pride(Ohh... Ohh... Ohh...)
Losing love, worrying about my image
Really helped me realize
If it isn't love
Why do I feel this way
Why does she stay on my mind
And if it isn't love
Why does it hurt so bad
Make me feel so sad inside
(Repeat til end)
