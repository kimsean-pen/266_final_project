Well hullo angel
A gift and a smile
Well hello angel
As we walk a mile
And a twisted man
Leans on twisted sticks
With children's laughter
Hanging on swings
Well hello angel
And the skipping rope turns
Whilst little bodies twist
In caroused curves
Well hello angel
At the end of your tether
Well hello angel
Time for sleep
Well hello angel
Time to cry
That which is falling should also be pushed
That which is crawling should also be crushed
