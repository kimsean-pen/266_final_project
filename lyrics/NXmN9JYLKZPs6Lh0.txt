I don't want to talk too much
I just want to get to you
I don't want to see you there
I just want to get you there

All by myself
Not everybody else

I don't need no wedding hall
I just watch your rollerball
Forget your friends and what they do
I got to get inside of you

I don't need society
To open up my life for me
I don't need no audience
To shoot you in my cunning sense

I don't think you understand
What's that dripping in your hand
All the things you thought you do
You finally met your Waterloo
