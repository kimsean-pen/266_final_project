Think I'm a few feet shy of making it home safe
And I was scared to death I would scare you away
You did your worse, you brought your hell
Think I caught my own glimpse of the devil

One too many things, not what they seem
Building a wall between you and me
But if I stay right here, if I lose track of time
I'll find a light that can keep me blind

(Keep me blind)
(Keep me)
Find a light that can keep me blind
(Keep me blind)
(Keep me)
Find a light that can keep me blind

The static in my head drowns out the pulse of my heart
Beating through skin, leading me back,
leading me back where we first fell apart
It's sinking in my head, everything you said
Now I'm just seeing red
Now I'm just seeing red
Now I'm just slipping away from where I stand
It's sinking in my head, everything you said
Now I'm just slipping away from where I stand

The static in my head drowns out the pulse of my heart
Beating through skin, leading me back,
leading me back where we first fell apart
The static in my head drowns out the pulse of my heart
Beating through skin, leading me back,
leading me back where we first fell apart

I can't pretend it's unfamiliar
I stared for hours at those pictures
In my mind, contained in time, when we both still felt alive

Can't pretend I'm sincerely speaking
When I know that you're still leaving
Can't explain when I can't see clearly
I could've sworn you said you need me
Does absolution mean nothing to you?
'Cause I would stare into your eyes until the black turned blue
Does absolution mean nothing to you?
'Cause I would stare into your eyes until the black turned blue

The static in my head drowns out the pulse of my heart
Beating through skin, leading me back,
leading me back where we first fell apart
The static in my head drowns out the pulse of my heart
Beating through skin, leading me back,
leading me back where we first fell apart

Keep me blind
Keep me
Keep me blind
Keep me
Keep me blind
Keep me
