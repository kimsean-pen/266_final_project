You bum right here and you
Bounce over there Sponji Reggae
I say you bum right here and
You bounce over there
Sponji Reggae
I say you rock right here and
You rock over there Sponji Reggae
I say you punch right here and you
Punch over there Sponji Reggae

A keep trying very hard to succeed
I almost lost my reflex
My bare feet was burn
That i almost lost my nerves
My fingers are shaking as the
Day start breaking
I could a never keep it no longer
I had to tell it to one another

I say you bum right here,
And you bounce over there, sponji reggae.
I say you rock right here,
And you rock over there, sponji reggae.

mmmm...

Some say i am nuts zooky crazy
Want i to leave the music alone
They say go and look work
I and i are lazy (mmm... ohhh...)
But i think for a while and
Say to my self
It's a time for every style

You bum right here,
And you bounce over there, sponji reggae.
I say you rock right here,
And you rock over there, sponji reggae.
I say you punch right here,
And you bounce over there, sponji reggae.

We brought it from the bottom,
And we fly to the top, sponji reggae, sponji reggae.

ohh.

mmm...

I may not be a movie star
I don't drive a big fancy car
I can afford only a winchester cigar
From the day i was born and
Given life
I and i a actor genius name it
Genuine character

I say you bum right here,
And you bounce over there, sponji reggae.
I say you rock right here,
And you rock over there, sponji reggae.
I say you bum right here,
And you bum over there, sponji reggae.
You rock right here,
And you rock over there, sponji reggae.
