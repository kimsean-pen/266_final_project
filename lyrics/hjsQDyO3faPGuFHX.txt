You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore
When you lived inside of me
There was nothing I could conceive that you wouldn't do for me
Trouble seems so far away
You changed that right away baby
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore
Love don't live here anymore
Just emptiness and memories of what we had before
You went away
Found another place to stay another home
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
(love don't live here anymore)
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore
In the windmill of my eyes
Everyone can see the loneliness inside me
Why'd you have to go away?
(away)
Don't you know I miss you so I need your love
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
(love don't live here anymore)
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Live here anymore
Don't live here anymore
Don't live here anymore
(love don't live here anymore)
No-no don't-don't live here anymore
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
No don't live here anymore
Love don't live here anymore
(love don't live here anymore)
You don't live here anymore...
