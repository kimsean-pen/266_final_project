INSECURITIES,
Encountered every single night,
My sentiments is all that I could think of.
This clenched feelings, vivid faith but I know I'll fail,
Scintillating hearts, covered in vile.

Craving for contentment, these satisfactions neglect my eagerness,
Seeking for compassions dejected by uncertainty.
I've crossed to the side, where my anxiety keeps me in thrust.
Forced down to the ground, on my knees I weep I beg of thee!

Sinking in grief I sleep, gazing vibrant haze in seas, floating still, mourning in deep, conceiving endlessly.
Weary eyes I get from being jaded half of my life.
Wanting to know how happiness could bring, I climb myself uninspired.

Haunting my surroundings, exhausting believing.
Conquering my instincts, cunningly slick, I hoped for vindication but it was an error of committing.
I just need my self belief, relieving me will just shatter me.

Sinking in grief I sleep, gazing vibrant haze in seas, floating still, mourning in deep, endlessly.

I JUST NEED MY SELF BELIEF, RELIEVING ME WILL JUST SHATTER ME! FRACTURE ME!

I just needed my self belief, relieving me will just shatter me, fracture me instead, I've finally come to it.
Weary eyes I get from being jaded half of my life.
Wanting to know how happiness could bring, I climb myself uninspired.
