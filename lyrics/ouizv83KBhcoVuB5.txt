I didn't mean to let you down
You have to believe me
I don't know what went through my mind
...

But now I can see
That I waited too long
To tell you how much it matters
(Just to be right here with you)
But I couldn't think of anything better

...
I should've told you so
(all):
Baby open your heart
Won't you give me a second chance
And I'll be here forever
Open your heart
Let me show you how much I care
And I will make you understnad

...
If you open your heart
To love me once again
I'll try to make it up to you
...

I want you to know
(You have to know)
Baby I swear that I'll be true
And never let go
If waited too long

To tell you how much it matters
(Just to be right here with you)
But I couldn't think of anything better
I should've told you so
(all):
Baby open your heart
Won't you give me a second chance
And I'll be here forever
Open your heart
Let me show you how much I care

And I will make you understnad
...
(Make you understand)
If you open your heart
To love me once again

Mark (all):
We could releive this pain and sorrow
(But we better do it in time)
Start over here and save tomorrow
I wanna make you mine

I waited too long
To tell you how much it matters
(Just to be right here with you)
But I couldn't think of anything better
I should've told you so
(Shane):
Open your heart with a chance
...
Open your heart and I'll be here forever
(Forever)
Open your heart and I'll care
And I will make you understand
Ooh babe
If you open your heart to love me once again
...
I waited too long
To tell you how much it matters
(Just to be right here with you)
But I couldn't think of anything better
I should've told you so
Baby open your heart
Won't you give me a second chance
And I'll be here forever
(Forever)
Open your heart
Let me show you how much I care
(I care)
And I will make you understnad
(Make you understand, ooh)
...
If you open your heart
To love me once again
