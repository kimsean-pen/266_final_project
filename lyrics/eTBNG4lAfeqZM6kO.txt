I must have been a burden the first hours of my life,
The way dad pushed me and mom aside
Looking for a better life.
Most of my family
Believes I'll never be a star.
Since I was old enough to make a change,
I knew I'd make it far.

'Cause not knowing who you are
Keeps you wanting more.
Set fire to your heart,
Be your own light in the dark.

I'm never looking back again,
And I'm never settling again.
I built these walls
To keep you out.
I'll chase the sun into the ground,
But I'm never looking back again.

Progressing smoothly now,
Slowly defeating my self-doubt.
Removed the dead weight of
Of the people who only
Look out for themselves.
And now that I have grown
Enough to feel it in my bones.
I think about the choices made
And all the winding roads.

I'm sick of always being asked,
"If this fails what comes next?"
Honestly, there's nothing left.
This is all I have.

I'm never looking back again,
And I'm never settling again.
I built these walls
To keep you out.
I'll chase the sun into the ground,
But I'm never looking back again.

Undetermined, failure, burdened by the womb.
Forced into this world by someone on the move.
See the stars,
Chase the moon.
I can be anything,
But nothing like you.

The road is long,
I'm too far gone.
The burning sun is beating down,
Still I'm never looking back again.

I'm never looking back again,
And I'm never settling again.
I built these walls
To keep you out.
I'll chase the sun till it burns out,
And I'm never looking back again.
