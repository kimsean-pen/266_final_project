I had a vision tonight that the world was ending
Yeah the sky was falling, the top was bending
I watched the heavens collide right before my eyes
What if the world dies whith the sunken lies
Baby it's all right, we'll be up all night
What if we're up the day when the stars fade
Keep you going to the night 'til I'm sick of the day
I had a vision that come from the great beyond
I tell 'em be on time if the world is done
Let me watch the recital in the midnight sky
What if the world dies with the sunken lies
Baby it's all right, we'll be up all night
What if we're up the day when the stars fade
Keep you going to the night 'til I'm sick of the day
What if the world dies with the sunken lies
Baby it's all right, we'll be up all night
What if we're up the day when the stars fade
Keep you going to the night 'til I'm sick of the day
We wait for the sunrise
We watch as the world dies
We howl in the moonlight
When the world ending comes, baby don't close your eyes
We wait for the sunrise
We wait for the sunrise
I had a vision tonight that the world is ending
Yeah the sky was falling, the top was bending
We spent our last night in the moonlight
Baby it's all right, keep me up all night
I got a hell of a beef with the end of the world
I got a bottle of booze and a beautiful girl
If I don't know when to die I'm going to go with this dial
What if the world dies with the sunken lies
Baby it's all right, we'll be up all night
What if we're up the day when the stars fade
Keep you going to the night 'til I'm sick of the day
What if the world dies with the sunken lies
Baby it's all right, we'll be up all night
What if we're up the day when the stars fade
Keep you going to the night 'til I'm sick of the day
Well I'll be watchin the night 'til I'm sick of the day
Yeah I've been watchin the night 'til I'm sick of the day
Yeah I'll be watchin the night 'til I'm sick of the day
Yeah, I'll keep you going to the night 'til I'm sick of the day
