Pop rocks and cherry cola
It gets colder when you're gone
We like getting drunk now
Jimmy flunked out, pants undone
Internet scams & waist coats
We're just scapegoats all too dumb
Body paint & day glow where do trends go when you're numb?
When everybody wants to be somebody
They all care
And everybody wants to know themselves
We're too scared, we're still figuring it out
(OHWOAHOHWOAHOHWOAH)
We're still figuring it out
(OHWOAHOHWOAHOHWOAH)
Made for mass production
Is it hard when you want more
Was i made to function, or create, or just get BORED
High school conversations, graduations whats in store
A 5 year plans invasion
wasn't your invitation burned?
When everybody wants to be somebody
They all care
And everybody wants to know themselves
We're too scared
We're still figuring it out
(OHWOAHOHWOAHOHWOAH)
We're still figuring it out
)OHWOAHOHWOAHOHWOAH)
Manic Monday, when you lose the ground beneath us
Tear gas Tuesday, I think I found Jesus
Wake and bake on Wednesday with a rosary and incense
Thirsty Thursday, I'll drink away my demons
On Friday (Friday), Saturday (Saturday)
Lose ourselves on Sunday because
Everybody wants to be somebody
They all care
And everybody wants to know themselves
We're too scared, we're still figuring it out!
We're still figuring it out
We're still figuring it out
(OHWOAHOHWOAHOHWOAH)
I'm still figuring it out
(OHWOAHOHWOAHOHWOAH)
I'm still figuring it out
(OHWOAHOHWOAHOHWOAH)
I'm still figuring it out
(OHWOAHOHWOAHOHWOAH)
I'm still figuring it out
Out
Out
