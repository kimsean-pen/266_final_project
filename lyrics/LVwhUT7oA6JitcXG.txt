leaky lifeboat
sleeps offshore
it was sailing backwards
to the freaky north
my brother the wind he's got to know
got to get it together and blow

slipping sideways
get it straight
the siren sonars
are tempting fate
fates in a pleasant mood today
don't get around much but hey, i gotta say- suns gotta play

leaky lifeboat
called to shore
you gotta another chance to score
my brother the wind he's got to know
gotta get it together and blow,
before the sun gets cold-
cold to gold
