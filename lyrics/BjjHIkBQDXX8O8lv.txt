Stand on up and take a bow
There's something there and it's showing
There's no need to look around
You're the best we've got going

Shout out to the dreams you'll chase
Shout out to the hearts you'll break
Nothing's gonna stop you now
I guess you better be going

You'll never be far
I'm keeping you near
Inside of my heart you're here
Go on, its got to be time

You're starting to shine cause what you've got is
Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-old
I know you're gold
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I know, I know
I don't need the stars in the night
I've found my treasure

All I need is you by my side
So shine forever

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I know you're gold
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I know you're gold

It won't take long to get when you feel like you're soaring
So write it all and don't forget you got to tell us your story
Shout out to the friends back home
Shout out to the hearts you have known

You gave them nothing but the best
Yeah and you can tell them your story
You'll never be far
I'm keeping you near
Inside of my heart you're here
Go on, its got to be time
You're starting to shine cause what you've got is

Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-old
I know you're gold
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I know, I know
I don't need the stars in the night
I've found my treasure
All I need is you by my side

So shine forever
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I know you're gold
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I know you're gold
Cause what you've got is
Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-old
I know you're gold
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

All I need is you by my side
So shine forever
