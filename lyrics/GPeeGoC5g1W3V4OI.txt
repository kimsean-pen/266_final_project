Sometime
They say that love is blind
But I think that dumb is what they had in mind
I could let it go, but I'd rather know
If I sit around, will another show

Sometime
I get to fly so high
That the sun burns my wings, but I will fly
Just a little too far, cause thats where you are
And I won't bring you down, believe in me

Sometime
I like to sit around
and just contemplating sitting round
I could lay in bed, like my momma said
Don't just do something, sit around instead

Sometime
If I may say myself
I'm not bad at life, I'm not good as well
And though life goes on, I can't plainly see
Just what is it for, if its not for me?

Sometime
Though its a big surprise
I made compromise the thing I most desire
I can say with pride, hold my head up high
That I had a great idea but nevermind.

Oh... babe...

I'm going nowhere, nowhere is where I wanna be
And then I'm good for nothing
Nothing is good enough for me

Anything, anything can come to anybody
Everything, everything can come to someone, sometime

Oh, please.

I'm good for nothing.
Nothing is good enough for me.
Anything, anything can come to anybody
Everything, everything can come to someone, sometime

Sometime
Opportunity passes right by me didn't even slow,
I can't breathe and think and I need a drink,
All this common sense made a fool of me.

Sometime
I like to sit around
and just contemplating sitting round
I can lay in bed like my momma said
Don't just do something, sit around instead

Sometime
I get to fly so high
That the sun burns my wings, but I will fly
Just a little too far, cause thats where you are
And I won't bring you down, believe in me

Sometime
I get me all confused, and the resons why are confusing too
I could be with you, try to sort it out
If I tell the truth, I like to lie about

Sometime
Though its a big surprise
I made compromise the thing I most desire
I can say with pride, hold my head up high
That I had a great idea but nevermind.

Sometime
I like to sit around
and just contemplating sitting round
Although life goes on, I can't plainly see
All this common sense made a fool of me

I don't want to live but I can't resist

I've got some reasons and I made list

I'm gonna drown before my ship comes in

And I forgot to ring my mum again

and life ain't good without cigarettes...
