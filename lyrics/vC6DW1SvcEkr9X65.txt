Well, haven't you heard
Baby's got a new thing
And doesn't wanna be disturbed?
There'll be no introducing her

But that won't deter
From making us wanna meet now
Am I allowed to call this defeat

I've been shown
Without deserving
That you're at home
With my unnerving so
I suppose I'll take to healing
And be getting on, getting on

Answer
You got no clever answer
No answer
So we get no further
No sir, no sir

Well haven't you heard
The lady says she's walking
And when he gave his word
She didn't find it soothing?

I know what he prefers
Is a little bit more control now
Than what she had vowed
Home ain't just a place to eat

I've been shown
Without deserving
That you're at home
With my unnerving so
I suppose I'll take to healing
And be getting on, getting on

Answer
You got no clever answer
No answer
So we get no further
No sir, no sir
