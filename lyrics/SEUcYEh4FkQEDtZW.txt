Thought you'll change the weather
start a little storm, make a little rain
but I'm gonna do one better
have the sun until you pray
I'm a tornado
looking for a soul to take

You're gonna see me coming by the selfish things that you did
I'm gonna leave you guessing have this fun on this gonna hit
I'm a tornado, looking for a man to break

Yeah I'm gonna leave this house, spinning all around
tossing in the air and playin in the ground
make sure you'll never found

Thought you'll take the swing try another girl, try another night
but it's the paint to bring, my force of nature back to life
I'm a tornado, what's it's done gotta left by

Hey I'm gonna leave this house, spin it all around
tossing in the air and put it in the ground
I'm gonna leave this house, spin it all around
tossing in the air and put it in the ground
make sure you'll never find, oh yeah

Hey I'm gonna leave this house, spin it all around
tossing in the air and put it in the ground
yeah I'm gonna leave this house, spin it all around
tossing in the air and put it in the ground
make sure you'll never find

The winds are getting stronger and the sky is falling through
You ain't got much longer till the rage rips off the roof.
I'm a tornado and I'm coming after you
