I've been having dreams
Jumping on a trampoline
Flipping in the air
I never land, just float there

As I'm looking up
Suddenly the sky erupts
Flames alight the trees
Spread to fallin leaves
Now they're right upon me

Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved

I've been having dreams
Splashing in the summer stream
Trip and I fall in
I wanted it to happen

My body turns to ice
Crushing weight of paradise
Solid block of gold, lying in the cold
I feel right at home

Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved

Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved

I never feel so loved
La la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la

Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel soâ€”

Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved
