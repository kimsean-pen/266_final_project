Dear brother how did we end up here
When I think about the good and hold back the tears
Late nights we spent
Planning forever
And the lump in my throat to you it never meant a fucking thing

It's not the person who you choose to be
But the person that I want to be
So I carved a line into the sand between
So I could figure me out

Is it better to have loved and lost
When you decided that I'm not enough
They say love is blind so I opened up my eyes
So I could you figure you out

I've lost all faith I had in you
This time I can't close, this time I can't close
We live, we grow
This time I can't close my mouth

All the times that I was there to pull you out
All the lies I had to hear and close my mouth
The times I'd hear you pulling down my name
The pain I feel dragging me into all your games
I've lost all faith I had in you
This time I can't close, this time I can't close
We live, we grow, you stay so close
This time I can't close, this time I can't close my mouth
I know you'll blame but it's all on you
This time I can't close, this time I can't close
We live, we grow
This time I can't close my mouth

After all was done
How could we be the same
After so many chances

I hope hoped you'd change
After Everything I gave
L gave You the answers

This ain't a fucking game
You can't just walk away
Not expecting a reaction

Coz I've been burnt before
Tryina to put you out
But you keep going back for more
You put me through hell for me to know
I think it's time, I need to let you go

I've lost all faith I had in you
This time I can't close, this time I can't close
We live, we grow, you stay so close
This time I can't close, this time I can't close my mouth
I know you'll blame but it's all on you
This time I can't close, this time I can't close
We live, we grow
This time I can't close my mouth
