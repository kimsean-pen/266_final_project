Way back on the radio dial
a fire got lit inside a bright eyed child
Every note just wrapped around a soul
from steel guitars to Memphis
on the way to rock and roll

Oh, I can hear em' playing.
I can hear the ringing on a beat up old guitar
Oh, I can hear em singing
Keep on dreaming
even if it breaks your heart

Down town is where i used to wonder
Old enough to get there but to young to get inside
So i would stand outside the sidewalk
listen to the music playing every Friday night

Oh, I can hear em playing
I can hear the ringing of the beat of old guitar
Oh, I can hear em singing.
Keep on dreaming
Even if it breaks your heart

Some dreams stay with you forever
Drag you around and bring you back to where you were
Some dreams keep on getting better
Gotta keep believing if you wanna know for sure

Oh, I can hear em playing
I can hear the ringing of the beat of old guitar
Oh, I can hear em singing
Keep on dreaming
Even if it breaks your heart
Keep on dreaming
Even if it breaks . your heart.
Ohhh, Ohhh Keep on dreaming
ohhh, ohhh, Don't let em break your heart
Even if it breaks your heart
