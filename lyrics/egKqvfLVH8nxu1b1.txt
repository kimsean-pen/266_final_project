Oh say no more
I let us down let us down
Let you down I let you down
Now what are we for
As we sink down beneath

'Cause we fight then we kiss
Our hearts dark in the mist
Then we break to recall
Tryna' fix every bit
No I, I'm sorry every time

Baby we're still lost at sea
We keep running through
This endless siege
Need some time for us
To breathe
We're still lost at sea
We're still lost

Sea (say no more, say no more, say no more)
We're still lost at sea
We're still lost
Sea (say no more, say no more, say no more)
We're so lost so lost

There's no help for us
In sight yeah
Nothing no, no possibilities
'Cause no matter what I do
It don't get through to you
Get through to you

'Cause there's no need to
Tell me I know it
Save your breath I owe it to you
Every time I don't show it
Too busy hiding, trying to
Get my way out
In this mess that I've made
Can you tell me now
Can you tell me that I'm alright

Baby we're still lost at sea
We keep running through
This endless siege
Need some time for us
To breathe
We're still lost at sea
We're still lost

Sea (say no more, say no more, say no more)
We're still lost at sea
We're still lost
Sea (say no more, say no more, say no more)
What do I have to do to get
Through to you

'Cause we fight then we kiss
Our hearts dark in the mist
Then we break to recall
Tryna' fix every bit
Please now say no more
'Cause I let us down
I let you down

Baby we're still lost at sea
We keep running through
This endless siege
Need some time for us
To breathe
We're still lost at sea
We're still lost

Ooh yeah yeah we're still
Lost at sea ooh
Baby we're still lost at sea
We keep running through
This endless siege
Need some time for us
To breathe
We're still lost at sea
We're still lost
