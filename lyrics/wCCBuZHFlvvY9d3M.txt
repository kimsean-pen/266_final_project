Did you see any action
Did you make any friends
Would you like some affection
Before I leave again

Well, I've been walkin' behind you
Since you've been able to see
There's never been any reason
For you to think about me

Did you have any bad dreams
Did you break any glass
Would you be my companion

Is there even a chance
You've been talkin' in circles
Since I've been able to cry
There's never been any reason

For never telling me why, yeah, yeah
Save my life
I'm goin' down for the last time
Woman with the sweet lovin'

Better than a white line
Bring a good feelin'
Ain't had in such a long time
Save my life

I'm goin' down for the last time
Have you ever been lonely
Do you have any fun

Do you ever think of me
I'm just another one, yeah
You never give me no answer
You never tell me the truth

There's never been any reason
For me to think about you
There's never been any reason

There's never been any reason, yeah
There's never been any reason

Save my life
I'm goin' down for the last time
Woman with the sweet lovin'

Better than a white line
Don't you know she could
Bring a good feelin'
Ain't had in such a long time
Save my life
I'm goin' down for the last time, wow
Save my life
I'm goin' down for the last time
Save my life
I'm goin' down for the last time
Save my life
I'm goin' down for the last time
Save my life
I'm goin' down for the last time
Save my life
I'm goin' down for the last time
