Lay me down easy
Lay me down hard
Light my cigarette and make my bed
Somewhere beneath the stars

I was born a blue child
Of the wild western sky
But I left my prairie home
Found a boxcar for to ride
Now I'm way down in Okema
Earning blisters on my feet
With my guitar and my buck knife
Thumbing down Woody Guthrie Street

So lay me down easy
Lay me down hard
Light my cigarette and make my bed
Somewhere beneath the stars
Don't look for me in glory
Don't look for me below
'Cause I'll be riding on that freight
Where the souls of ramblers go

And there's a sadness that follows
Most everywhere I roam
You can see it on my smile
You can smell it on my clothes
Sometimes all that running
It never lasts too long
So keep me good and loaded
And I'll keep singing songs

Lay me down easy
Lay me down hard
Light my cigarette and make my bed
Somewhere beneath the stars
Don't look for me in glory
Don't look for me below
'Cause I'll be riding on that freight
Where the souls of ramblers go

If I don't leave here tomorrow
I believe I'll blow out my brains
But either way there'll be sorrow
And you won't be seeing me again

Lay me down easy
Lay me down hard
Light my cigarette and make my bed
Somewhere beneath the stars
Don't look for me in glory
Dont look for me below
'Cause I'll be riding on that freight
Where the souls of ramblers go
