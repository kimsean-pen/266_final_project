We can last today
But we can't survive this way
Wrinkled and crumpled up
Our bodies will starve

But our minds won't give up
Always aching never breaking
For the lives we are supposed to lead
Resting every night with those

Who are now resting without peace
Circling through my mind
For something I can find
A little piece of the divine

But that's just a sign of these desperate times
Do we accept our existence like this?
Or do we leave what we once loved behind?
You were the catalyst

But now I let you go
To drift in the universe
In perfect syncronicity, in infinite perfection
Part of everything and intrinsic to nothing

Don't give in, because they are stronger than you
Go down fighting, they'll remember the truth
