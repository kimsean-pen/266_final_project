Made it out the struggle, yeah, a nigga too tough
Yeah I crush, I bring the cup, bring crush
Yeah, I fuck niggas' hoes, I ain't gotta lust
Black mask, big gat, make him give it up
Diamonds came from G so you know they wet as fuck
Heard you been with me now you act cuffed up
Now I got your main ho in my truck
How you tryna cross me out then say you love me?
Fuck the hell you talkin' 'bout, you ain't there for us
If I get on your head I ain't lettin' up
If I get on your ho, I ain't lettin' up
Please watch your mouth (Let's go)
Please watch your mouth
Please watch your house
Please watch your spouse

Boy, you so counterfeit, the fake, I been cut you off
I did what I did, I know what I took, 'cause you count me out
When I'm on that Henny,
you hearin' my clutch, you hear my exhaust (Yeah, yeah)
I came from the bottom,
I came from a place where you don't make it out
I own a traphouse on Conley road, you know it ain't no drought

We're dope so money fold, we came from the south
Rockin' the same clothes, run it up when we came out the house
Still had all the hoes, nigga playin', we airin' 'em out
My momma don't want for shit, lil' nigga, so what is a drought
Tote them sticks, now I'm a threat
When I come through, yeah, I'm bombin' your land
Yeah, we like to flex, and we got a check
Nigga play chess, yeah, we smash him like a king
'Talkin out the neck, 'til I got a tec
Start sweetin' up, just like some candy
No more stress, got it out my chest
Throwin' back shots, with King Brandy
I'ma keep it goin', all the way
Lifestyle [?] Penny Hardaway
Yeah, we got over them starvin' days
Came from dope flippin', the harder way
Young nigga listen like a Sensei
Straight from the dome, no pen and paper
Cuffin' that bitch, she meant to save her
My balls in her mouth like a lifesaver
Can't help me, I can help you get back on your feet
Yeah, exotic off the trees
Gettin' real high from the smokin' all the weed
Nah, I'm [?]
Catch him writin' off, just check the receipt
I just spent some money
WiFi drug, I connect the streets
Baby

Made it out the struggle, yeah, a nigga too tough
