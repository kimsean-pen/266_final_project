I lost my sanity with my socks
One at a time, I barely noticed
'Til one day I found they all were gone
I couldn't find them and I couldn't focus

We gotta put this to bed
('Cause I got some things to do
I got some things to do)
We gotta put this to bed
('Cause I got some things to do
I got some things to do)

Oh, how you make me laugh

Benadryl in the bath

Oh, how you make me laugh
Benadryl in the bath
We gotta put this to bed
'Cause I got some things to do
I can't keep losing the socks
Taking up too many thoughts
We gotta put this to bed
'Cause I got some things to do

Apaixonada, apaixonada
Saquei, saquei minha alma
Minha alma, minha calma
Só você não sacou, cê não sacou
Alma, minha calma
Só você não sacou nada
Saquei minha alma, minha, saquei minha alma

Strands of colored hair in the sink
Jewels and glitter, sushi and candy
Bits of purple dust and bits of pink
Your hand tattoo inked in my memory

We gotta put this to bed
('Cause I got some things to do
I got some things to do)
We gotta put this to bed
('Cause I got some things to do
I got some things to do)

Oh, how you make me laugh

Benadryl in the bath

Oh, how you make me laugh
Benadryl in the bath
We gotta put this to bed
'Cause I got some things to do
I can't keep losing the socks
Taking up too many thoughts
We gotta put this to bed
'Cause I got some things to do

Apaixonada, apaixonada
Saquei, saquei minha alma
Minha alma, minha calma
Só você não sacou, cê não sacou
Alma, minha calma
Só você não sacou nada
Saquei minha alma, minha, saquei minha alma

Oh, how you make me laugh
Benadryl in the bath
We gotta put this to bed
'Cause I got some things to do
I can't keep losing the socks
Taking up too many thoughts
We gotta put this to bed
'Cause I got some things to do
