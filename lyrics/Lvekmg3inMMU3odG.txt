Our lives are fake.
They mean nothing you see.
Our dreams are lost.
Just aiming fantasy.

How many times have you been misguided?
How many times have your hopes been smited?

This life means nothing to me.

Victimized.
Deceived.
A black veil of insanities crushing
Like fire beating all of our disease.
The black veil of insanity misleads.

Our hearts are free.
Does that mean anything?
Do what we're told.
So seed democracy.

How many times have you been misguided?
How many times have your hopes been smited?

This life means nothing to me.

Victimized.
Deceived.
A black veil of insanities crushing
Like fire beating all of our disease.
The black veil of insanity misleads.

Black veil!
It's coming for me.
It's coming for me.
It's coming for me.
It's coming for me.
It's the black veil of insanity!
It's coming for me.

Set free, set free, set free, set free,
set free, set free! set free! set free!

Set free!

Victimized.
Deceived.
A black veil of insanities crushing
like fire beating all of our disease.
The black veil of insanity misleads.
