You don't know how to feel.
Because you don't know what's real!
Getting lost it's okay.
We take the wrong steps everyday.

She want's something better
She want's something better

Images take a fall.
Close your eyes and see them all
Saturation false demise...
Well I tell you it's no surprise.

Yeaaaahhhh
Yeaaaahhhh.
Yeaaaahhhh
Yeaaaahhhh.
