You speak my name and shudder, but I'm still here
I built a bridge here just to burn it, just to light my faded path
So I could see what's down below me, because how I yearn to see you laugh
Oh, how I yearn to see you laugh

So selfish were my footsteps and so foolish are they now
But there's not much I can do here, now that I'm living underground
Speak now my precious whispers, float softly through the breeze
Please float on by my loved ones and let them know that I'm still here

You speak my name and shudder, but I'm still here
I built a bridge here just to burn it, just to light my faded path
So I could see what's down below me, because how I yearn to see you laugh
Oh, how I yearn to see you laugh

So selfish were my footsteps and so foolish are they now
But there's not much I can do here, now that I'm living underground
Speak now my precious whispers, float softly through the breeze
Please float on by my loved ones and let them know that I'm still here

And we sing (woah oh woah oh)
Our voices carry through the hills (woah oh woah oh)
The whole world is standing still
We're singing for the dead, for the lost and for the stolen

Our hearts beat double time
And oh, they feel so broken, oh, how they feel so broken

Is this really what I wished for when I felt my feet drag heavy on the earth?
Is this really, the answer I sought when I was searching for self worth?
Go now precious whispers, float my sorrow into the sea
Let the waves collapse above me, and wash away my fucking memory

So selfish were my footsteps and so foolish are they now
But there's not much I can do here, now that I'm living underground
Speak now my precious whispers, float softly through the breeze
Please float on by my loved ones and let them know that I'm still here

I'm still here
