Reckless with your love
You. Just. Give it up
Fearless with your life
But no-one can you trust
Reckless with your love
You. Just. Give it away
Fearless with your life
Living day to day

Reckless with your love
You. Just. Give it up
Fearless with your life
But no-one can you trust
Reckless with your love
You. Just. Give it away
Fearless with your life
Living day to day

I'm talking to myself like I used to do
The touch of someone else
Always gets to you
There's something in your eyes
Baby, I can tell that soon
Uh - you're just a stranger in the room

Better know what to say
Gotta know what to do
I can't feel a thing with you
baby I can't feel a thing
Can't feel the same I used to do
Living a lie, never been true
but I get stronger everyday
while you

Reckless with your love
You. Just. Give it up
Fearless with your life
But no-one can you trust
Reckless with your love
You. Just. Give it away
Fearless with your life
Living day to day

Reckless with your love
You. Just. Give it up
Fearless with your life
But no-one can you trust
Reckless with your love
You. Just. Give it away
Fearless with your life
Living day to day

Living in a void of vice and ecstasy
Building up a wealth with animosity
Always in disguise
There's nothing left of you â€“ uh
You're just a stranger in the room

Better know what to say
Gotta know what to do
I can't feel a thing with you
baby I can't feel a thing
Can't feel the same I used to do
given a lie, never been true
but I get stronger everyday
while you

Reckless with your love
You. Just. Give it up
Fearless with your life
But no-one can you trust
Reckless with your love
You. Just. Give it away
Fearless with your life
Living day to day

Reckless with your love
You. Just. Give it up
Fearless with your life
But no-one can you trust
Reckless with your love
You. Just. Give it away
Fearless with your life
Living day to day

Reckless with your love (love)
You. Just. Give it up
Fearless with your life (life)
Reckless with your love (love)
You. Just. Give it away
Fearless with your life (life)
