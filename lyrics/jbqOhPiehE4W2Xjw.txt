The sun goes up, my heart goes down
I've spent too long in this ghost town
Sometimes I wanna leave, I wanna get out
I can't stop now
I've seen so much, I can't forget
This gallery inside my head
I paint it all black, it doesn't do shit
I can't stop now

So I focus on the next thing
I remember to keep breathing
Better think of something, start the song

There's only one way up
Only one way down
I don't know where to go
I can't stop now, now
You can pull me in
You can push me out
Still I'm on my way
I can't stop now, now

Plastic legs coming out of cars
Click those heels down the boulevard
Made-up names cooking in the tar
Metal stars
Suck it in, swallow it down
When I get home, spit it all out
But there's a bitter taste stuck in my mouth
It's in my mouth

So I focus on the next thing
I remember to keep breathing, ah
Better think of something, start the song
There's only one way up
Only one way down
I don't know where to go
I can't stop now, now
You can pull me in
You can push me out
Still I'm on my way
I can't stop now, now

I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, ooh
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, ooh
I can't stop now
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, ooh
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, ooh
