I did that
I know that
No, I'm running around
I'm wasting all my time
I did that
I know that
No, I'm running around
I'm wasting all my time

And we did do this, and we did do that
And we did do this, and we did do that
And we did have fun, and we can't have fun
And I promise that, and I promise that
Can I do this, can I do this

All you wanted, all you wanted
All you wanted was time
All you wanted, all you wanted
All you wanted was time
All you wanted, all you wanted
All you wanted was time
All you wanted, all you wanted
All you wanted was time
