Then I hear you leave
And I'm happy
Just for a moment I'm free
Then it dawns on me

Then our time has passed
Now it won't last
And I'm getting nowhere fast
That's a fact

Peace to the night
Saw what I was really like
Start with a kiss
End with a fight

Peace come and go
Acting like you didn't know
That I have lost my head

Oooooooh
Oooooooh
And I'll leave
So I know that you have your doubts

Oooooooh
Oooooooh
And I'll leave
But I swear that I'm better now

Can you honestly
Live without me?
'Cause you miss the fire
You can't disagree

Peace to the night
Saw what I was really like
Start with a kiss
End with a fight
I love a fight

Ooooooooooh
Ooooooooooh
And I'll leave
So I know that you have your doubts

Oooooooh
Oooooooh
And I'll leave
But I swear that I'm better now

You got to just find me
You know that I'm needy
You say settle down
And I said get the fuck out
Burn your pictures, outburst
I love the way you acting tough
And I'll never be good enough
I'm just too much

Ooooooooooh
Ooooooooooh
And I'll leave
So I know that you have your doubts

Oooooooh
Oooooooh
And I'll leave
But I swear that I'm better now

Better now
