Do it like you said, taking deep breaths
Keeping my cool, counting to ten.
On my own again, trying to keep my head clear
Go for walks away from here
But I know, I am

I'm still alone, still alone
Like the day I was born
Born and brought into this world

Still alone, still alone
Like the day I was born
Born and brought into this world

"Hold on to your friends," that's what he said
I guess that his friends are not like mine
I could write a list of people I don't miss
I'm sorry, but I'm so much better off without you

I'm still alone, still alone
Like the day I was born
Born and brought into this world

Still alone, still alone
Like the day I was born
Born and brought into this world

Hold it all against me, still don't bother
Hold it all against me, still another complaint
Ha, maintenance complaint, oh shutup
Ba da dee da da da da, ba ba da
Ba da dee da da da da, ba ba da da da
Ba ba da da da
Oh, shutup

Still alone, still alone
Like the day I was born
Born and brought into this world

Still alone, still alone
Like the day I was born
Born and brought into this world

Still alone, still alone
Like the day I was born
Born and brought into this world
