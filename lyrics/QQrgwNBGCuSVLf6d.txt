Is it over?
Did it end while I was gone?
Cause my shoulders
Couldn't hold that weight for long
And it all just feels the same

Somebody better let me know my name
Before I give myself away
Somebody better show me how I feel
Cause I know I'm not at the wheel

Is it over?
Did it last or come undone?
Cause I told ya
I didn't wanna hurt no one
But the faces are all the same

Somebody better let me know my name
Before I give myself away
Somebody better show me how I feel
Cause I know I'm not at the wheel

Somebody better let me know my name
Before I give myself away
Somebody better show me how I feel
Cause I know I'm not at the wheel

Somebody better let me know my name
Before I give myself away
Somebody better show me how I feel
Cause I know I'm not at the wheel
