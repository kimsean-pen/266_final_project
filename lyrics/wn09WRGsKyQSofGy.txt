시간이 자꾸 먼저
돌아 돌아 돌아
내가 너의 NO.1
Hey where, where, where to go
갈수록 나에게 자꾸만
빠져 빠져
The time is up! Up! Oh wow

두 눈을 감아도 아무리 피해도
보이는 Hallow
꺼지지 않는 Hallow
같은 건 지겨워
이제 날 따라와
모두 다 Follow
내뒤에 모두 Follow
Just believe Oh Woah

One&One&One&One

We belong together
말하지 않아도
Oh can't you feel to my heart
조금만 기다려
내 가슴 속에 Funny
네 가슴 안에 Funny
Feel the music

We belong together
멀리서 있어도
Oh I can feel you love
너에게 다가가
내 가슴 위에 Funny
네 가슴 안에 Funny
Feel the music
