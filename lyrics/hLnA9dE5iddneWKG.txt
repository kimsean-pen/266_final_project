As we get up
The sun goes down
And the moon is the space in the cloud
A golden gate
The door to lalalalalalaland
As we fall into the sky
We'll be never afraid of the height
A night of faith
The door to lalalalalalaland

As we get up

And the moon is the space in the cloud
A golden gate
The door to lalalalalalaland

As we fall into the sky
We'll be never afraid of the height
A night of faith
The door to lalalalaland
