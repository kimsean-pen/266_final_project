Aha shake
Taper jean girl with a motel face
Aha shake
Bury your eyes in a secret place
Aha shake
Black as night on a Summer day

Cunts watch their bodies, no room for make up
I think he's tasted, tasted the watcher

Heart break
Knockin' 'em down like the 7th grade
Heart break
cigarettes and songs, with a winter's chafe
Heart break
Keep like my daughter and a run away

Cunts watch their bodies, no room for make up
I think he's tasted, tasted the watcher

Aha shake tapered jean girl kills me

Cunts watch their bodies, no room for make up
I think he's tasted, tasted the watcher

I gotta shake, shake, shake, I'm comin', aha
I gotta keep on, keep on, keep on ravin' 'til the dark
I gotta keep on, keep on, keep on comin', aha
I gotta shake, shake, shake, I'm ravin' in the dark
