I'm holding
Onto every word that you last said to me
Hear your emotion
And how everything to you was uneasy, oh

All these hours between us, they mean nothing
I'll be back to you one day
One day
And all these miles between us, they mean nothing
Oh, I promise we're okay
We're okay now

2 AM calls, oh, it's my nature
I'm a little bit high, calling to tell you
I'm yours
I'm yours
Remember that night out in my car
When I told you there wouldn't be no scars?
Still yours
Still yours

No matter who I'm with, it's you that I adore
If you're not sure
Baby, I'm yours
Given the way you make me feel, I want you more
If you're not sure
Baby, I'm yours

I'm hoping
That you'll hear me when I say I need you around
'Cause life's so busy, babe
You keep me up
I'm never coming down, oh yeah, hey

And all these towns between us, they mean nothing
I'll be back to you one day
One day
And all these roads between us, they mean nothing
Oh, I promise we're okay
We're okay

2 AM calls, oh, it's my nature
I'm a little bit high, calling to tell you
I'm yours
I'm yours
Remember that night out in my car
When I told you there wouldn't be no scars?
Still yours
Still yours

No matter who I'm with, it's you that I adore
If you're not sure
Baby, I'm yours
Given the way you make me feel, I want you more
If you're not sure
Baby, I'm yours

I know it's how you're feeling
I'm here, I'm never leaving
I'm yours
I'm yours
I know it's how you're feeling
I'm here, I'm never leaving
I'm yours
I'm yours (Oh, I'm yours)

No matter who I'm with, it's you that I adore
If you're not sure
Baby, I'm yours
Given the way you make me feel, I want you more
If you're not sure
Baby, I'm yours

2 AM calls, oh, it's my nature
I'm a little bit high, calling to tell you
I'm yours
I'm yours
Remember that night out in my car
When I told you there wouldn't be no scars?
Still yours
Still yours
