Saw you in the middle on the marble slab
The best trip that I've ever had
Higher than a jet plane, pass it around
My drinks on empty, need another round

I wanna fly, wanna ride with you
Is this the best that you can do?
I wanna fly, wanna ride with you
Higher than a jet plane with you

Will we arrive in the middle of nowhere
Don't act like you know, I been here so many times
I never seen you before
But now that I have, I don't wanna see you no more

Higher than a jet plane with you
Higher than a jet plane with you

I wanna fly, wanna ride with you
Is this the best that you can do?
I wanna fly, wanna ride with you
Higher than a jet plane with you

Auto pilot no control
Auto pilot no control
Higher than a jet plane with you
Higher than a jet plane with you

I wanna fly, wanna ride with you
Is this the best that you can do?

I wanna fly, wanna ride with you
Higher than a jet plane with you
I wanna fly, wanna ride with you
Is this the best that you can do?
I wanna fly, wanna ride with you
Higher than a jet plane with you
I wanna fly, wanna ride with you
I wanna fly, wanna ride with you
