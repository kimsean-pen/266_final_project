As if you did nothing wrong
You say what's up
As if hasn't been long
Oh, hi silly boy

Well I'm not done
Anymore I won't make the same mistakes
The ones that I make before
And I carefully got you think that it's ok with me for you to call me now

Is there anything else that you could take
From me for yourself
