Little Suzie cruising for some love and affection
Arm in arm with everyone been charming the nation
Cindy picks the wallets for her friends medications
As willing patient Julie sit and wait for attention

Lucy's got a uniform for every occasion
Annie's got a gun she says she stole for protection
As someone in the background screams another objection
Sally turns her back and walks in dissatisfaction

Rudy got a problem, he got too much aggression
Disregarding everything it's time for attention
He got Bobby in a bottle, he got Billy in a stetson
He's got Betty does her best but it's a bad situation

Gina's getting God so she can get up to Heaven
Looking like an Angel in the name of salvation
Cathy's in a coma that she calls meditation
As Danny does the Devil now he's left for damnation

Jim's trying hard to learn from every lesson
Looking to the future and some great expectation
Nikki's countin' day's until she inherits the mansion
And all the boys are waiting for a piece of the action

Simon says and Simon does what nobody mentions
Peter's getting restless lacking all true expressions
Tommy's undecided he can't make no decisions
As Joni's in the basement getting bored at the tension
