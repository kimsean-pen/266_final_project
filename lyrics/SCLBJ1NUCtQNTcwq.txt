As the deus of night arose
I remenber yielding fire in your eyes
Only hoof prints in the mud

All of you is here with me like a scar that cannot heal
Soon as you were gone thence I learned to love

It was heaven sent the voice inside you ah
For you the nightshade has bacome deceiving

All of you here with me
Yet I know you defy the dark
A rainbow in the sky shines on your solitary Barbaria

In every cry of every man lies an abyss of despair
You throw the sand against the wind then i all returns to you

All of me is within you like the sacred truth
Soon as you were gone thence you learned to love

All of you here with me
Yet I know you defy
Angels will shine on your solitary Barbaria
