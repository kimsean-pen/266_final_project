As i wait mad about things
we've sunken deep together

And i don't
wanna remember

All you had is coming back
It feels a bit dramatically speaking
I am brave, in close embrace
Still I hope you found what you've been missing
Hope you found what you've been missing
Hope you found what you've been missing
Hope you found what you've been missing

Used to think
I was incomplete
Now sympathy is much there

And I don't wanna remember

Broken and broken words
Would you still want in my heart
On the weekend
Room for which you were saying
You reach for me
Still I hope you found what you've been missing
Hope you found what you've been missing
Hope you found what you've been missing
Hope you found what you've been missing
Hope you found what you've been missing
