Enter the nightmare, this future does implore,
Hijack your city state, a prison nothing more.
Rounded up like cattle, you're forced in to the trains,
Nothing that you've ever known will bring you so much pain.

If you try to resist me you'll find me inhumane,
But if you just submit you'll live your life a slave.
Your love, your servitude will medicate your pain,
With our technology, we'll always keep you safe.

Microchipped by darts, their thoughts are not their own,
All that's left of human kind is now in their control.
Planned out through centuries, patient and contrived,
Pray of man's naivety, gullible and blind.

If you try to resist me you'll find me inhumane,
But if you just submit you'll live your life a slave.
Your love, your servitude will medicate your pain,
With our technology, we'll always keep you safe.

The nightmare unfolds before my eyes
I will resist 'til the end of time
A spirit born free has to break these chains
We're lost, we must find our way.
We must find our way.
We'll find our way.
They say that you're a danger to everything that's pure,

There are too many of you, they're offering the cure.
Swift extermination if you refuse the game,
Arrested development, your vaccinated fate.
If you try to resist me you'll find me inhumane,

But if you just submit you'll live your life a slave.
Your love, your servitude will medicate your pain,
With our technology, we'll always keep you safe.
The nightmare unfolds before my eyes,

I will resist 'til the end of time.
A spirit born free has to break these chains,
We're lost, we must find our way.
The nightmare unfolds before my eyes,
I will resist 'til the end of time.
A spirit born free has to break these chains,
We're lost, we must find our way.
We must find our way,
We'll find our way.
