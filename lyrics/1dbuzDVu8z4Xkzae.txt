Darling, you know how I feel
Everything's too much, everything's too real
Lord, just know it's hard to be alone
Talking to myself and I, in my empty home

I'll show you how, how

Nothing's going to keep me down, yeah
Nothing's going to keep me down, yeah
Nothing's going to keep me down
Nothing's going to keep me down, yeah

Lord, just know it's hard to be alone
Talking to myself and I, in my empty home
Left with thoughts, some to break a man
But you keep on going like no one can
Left with broken parts, you make a man
It's a sad fact that no one will understand

I'll show you how, how

Nothing's going to keep me down, yeah
Nothing's going to keep me down, yeah
Nothing's going to keep me down
Nothing's going to keep me down, yeah

Nothing's going to keep me down, yeah
(Nothing's going to keep me down)
Nothing's going to keep me down, yeah
(Nothing's going to keep me down)
Nothing's going to keep me down
(Nothing's going to keep me down)
Nothing's going to keep me down, yeah
(Nothing's going to keep me down)
