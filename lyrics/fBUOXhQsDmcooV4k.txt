Long time ago and the times we had were so and so
It was the worst days of your life
So I called you home your so-called father was on the phone
He wasn't easy to ignore
But we're all happy 'cause the streets they're always there for us
And it's quite scary when you wake up in the same old clubs
It's getting darker and I know this time wasn't meant for us
So won't you please please please come back to me
But yesterday when I saw your eyes in a black haze
You didn't even know my name
So I walked on pretending that you still belong
But it will never be the same no more
But we're all happy 'cause the streets they're always there for us
And it's quite scary when you wake up in the same old clubs
It's getting darker and I know this time wasn't meant for us
So won't you please please please come back to me
It's like a picture of a loved one in disguise or
It's like finding something pretty in a jar of flies and
If you want just hide your eyes behind your head
But you can't see me then you can't find me anywhere
But we're all happy 'cause the streets they're always there for us
And it's quite scary when you wake up in the same old clubs
It's getting darker and I know this time wasn't meant for us
So won't you please please please come back to me
Come back to me please please please, please please please
