And we were grown on the same round
Little blue dot
Although the answers will take their time
And they're spending most of it
So could it be that the nightmare is upon us
And heavy hearts can't decide
When they've had enough
So they're burning out cold

It's a steady fall from the pinnacle to the bedrock
And so we set out to bring back that miracle love
I said I'd never do you harm but I was wrong
It's so hard to believe but I barely can see
Where we came from

We got carried away
All the love that I was blind to
And I made my mistakes
And I laid them all beside you
We got carried away
So much love that I was blind to
And I made my mistakes
And you put them all behind you

Can we bring back that miracle love?
Can we bring back that miracle love?

And I would guess that we're losing sight
Of the right way
And though the end is in my mind
I doubt talking's gonna do much for me
Someday, someday
A long time from now
We'll be remembered as the ones
Who couldn't hold it down
Who couldn't fight back for it

We got carried away
All the love that I was blind to
And I made my mistakes
And I laid them all beside you
We got carried away
So much love that I was blind to
And I made my mistakes
Will you put them all behind you?
Can we bring back that miracle love?
Won't you bring back that miracle love?

Can we bring back that miracle love?
Oh bring back that miracle love
Bring back that miracle love
Bring back that miracle love
