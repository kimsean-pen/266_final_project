I'm in your eyes
In a crashing wave
Baby, I'm your slave If you said so,
I would
I am a child caught in the rain
Is this happening
I hope so,
It's so good
Oh, I don't know why I never believed it
You came and I saw that light
I gave in,
I came close
Blue eyes of my lover
Eyes of my man
Green in the morning and
Blue afternoon
You're the sky and the cold blue rush
When we finally touch
Sends me flying
In space
I am a cloud
Floating in your eyes
There ain't no disguising our heartbeats interlace
Oh, I have waded in water so deep
I swam 'til I almost died
I gave in,
I came close
Blue eyes of my lover
Eyes of my man
Green in the morning and
Blue afternoon
I don't mind wasting time
In your eyes,
I fall asleep
Soundly
I don't mind wasting time
In your eyes,
I fall asleep
Soundly

Blue eyes of my lover
Eyes of my man
Green in the morning and
Blue afternoon

Blue eyes of my lover
Eyes of my man
Green in the morning and
Blue afternoon
