Clock is ticking, won't stop tricking me

The clock is ticking, time pass away
Now tomorrow is yesterday
Life is slipping through my hands
No one cares, no one understands

Can't you see that time
Becomes our foe
Time stares you right into the eye
With an ice cold heart and a grinning smile
Can't you see that life
Becomes our woe
Time pass by careless and vile
So treacherous, deceiving and guile

Time is the enemy
Unseen
Playing its tricks on me
Foresee
Won't ever let me be
You see
Cunning eternally
Leave me be

The hours pass by faster each day
Weeks and months just waste away
Year by year I feel more deprived
Thirty nine and barely alive

Can't you see that time
Becomes our foe
Time stares you right into the eye
With an ice cold heart and a grinning smile
Can't you see that life
Becomes our woe
Time pass by careless and vile
So treacherous, deceiving and guile

Would you still be right by my side
The moment our worlds collide
Would you be mine until the end
And again

Can't you see that time
Becomes our foe
Time stares you right into the eye
With an ice cold heart and a grinning smile
Can't you see that life
Becomes our woe
Time pass by careless and vile
So treacherous, deceiving and guile

We all fall apart
Like crumbling towers
At wits end, the gate is near
Soon I will be out of here

There is no time left
This is the twelfth hour
My days are down, my time is here
Cross my heart and have no fear
