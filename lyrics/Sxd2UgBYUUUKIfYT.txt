I still think about you all the time

Missing conversation while I'm far from home
I'll still call you often just to let you know
That every breath I'm taking, it is worth these words
I can't be complacent, I'm just so unsure
I miss our shadows in the streetlights
And how the flowers used to bloom
I miss the sweet embrace of spring nights
Through the windows of my youth

I still think about you all the time
Sending letters home just to let you know I'm alright
I always felt it was a waste of life
To grow old and wither
I know things get better in time
Just a memory, a memory close to me
I'm just a memory in a home, I remember dearly

There are days in which my life feels so colourless
Feel like I'm walking by myself in the dark
And even then, I know you're right there waiting for me so closely
I still got every word you said swimming in my head, swimming in
Don't you wait up for me all night
You always worried the worst you said
As you lay in bed, yeah I said
Don't you wait up for me all night

I still think about you all the time
Sending letters home just to let you know I'm alright
I always felt it was a waste of life
To grow old and wither
I know things get better in time
Just a memory, a memory close to me
I'm just a memory in a home, I remember
In a home I remember

I'm just a memory, a memory close to me
I'm just a memory, a memory close to me
I'm just a memory in a home, I remember dearly

I still think about you all the time
I think about you, I think about you
I still think about you all the time
I think about you, I think about you
(I still think about you all the time)
(I still think about you all the time)
I think about you, I think about you
