Sing that song that no one wants to hear
Sing that song so loud and sing it clear
Sing that song that no one seems to know
Sing it to me slow
Bring me back to when I was a boy
Full of life and love and full of joy
Bring me back to when I was a child
Baby make me smile

Tropic of cancer
You win and you lose
Get so high and so low
And so blue

Limping to the finish with my pride
Next time it won't be somebody's bride
Yin and yang discreetly by my side
How was it for you

Tropic et cancer
You win and you lose
Get so high and so low
And so blue

Tropic of cancer
You win and you lose
Get so high and so low
And so blue
