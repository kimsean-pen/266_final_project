Now can you hear it, the sound of your heart beat?
Can you feel it? The blood pumping through in your veins
It's you, who's in the spot
Every muscle contracts in your body
Every second from now on is in your hands
Step up with all you got
So just...

Hold it, own it, time to take the moment, this is what you all about
And don't let go, it's finally your moment

We did it and spit it out

So raise your head, so raise your head
Cause we're not dead (yeah)
So raise your head (yeah)
So raise your head

Everyone's watching, the peak of a lifetime
Look around you and see there's a million eyes
And you, give em all you got
It is your whole life, compressed into one night
Dust of your shoulders, the moment depends on you
Time to choose, you got one shot

Hold it, own it, time to take the moment, this is what you all about
And don't let go, it's finally your moment
We did it and spit it out

So raise your head, so raise your head
Cause we're not dead (yeah)
So raise your head (yeah)
So raise your head
