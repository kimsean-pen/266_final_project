missing the nights that left us holding on
cause the city gets lonely when we're not strong enough
lusting the pills that send us to the sky
now the lights are changing and taking us for a ride

I'm a rad racer, big city chaser, running away with you tonight

brake dust tears, but we're still stumblin' on
cause I'm shifting your gears, it's easy when we're gone
(city line fears were made for breaking)

I'm a rad racer, big city chaser, running away with you tonight
