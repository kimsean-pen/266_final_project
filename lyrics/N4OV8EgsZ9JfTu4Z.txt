Ooh, ooooh, RedOne
Oh, Pixie

My heart is bouncing like a hip-hop beat
Boy, this is half the drama you're causing me
But I can't decide if it's good or bad for me
For me, yea, yeah

You say the ride was looking deep in my eyes
You give me pleasure 'cause I constantly smile
But I can't decide if it's good or bad for me
For me, yea, yeah

But there's one thing
That you should know about me hey

I'm not a hit you play, a one-hit wonder Stone
I need a stand-up guy, don't want no rolling stone
I'm not a city you visit, when you're out on tour
I need a stand-up guy, don't want no rolling stone
Rolling stone, rolling stone
Rolling stone, rolling stone
Rolling stone, no rolling stone
Rolling stone, rolling stone
Rolling stone, rolling stone
Rolling stone, no rolling stone

You got all my girlfriends are all on your side
They say go keep your cool and give me the try
But I can't decide if it's good or bad for me
For me, yea, yeah

You keep on jumping in and out of my life
And every time it's such a beautiful ride
But I can't decide if it's good or bad for me
For me, yea, yeah

But there's one thing
That you should know about me hey

I'm not a hit you play, a one-hit wonder Stone
I need a stand-up guy, don't want no rolling stone
I'm not a city you visit, when you're out on tour
I need a stand-up guy, don't want no rolling stone
Rolling stone, rolling stone
Rolling stone, rolling stone
Rolling stone, no rolling stone
Rolling stone, rolling stone
Rolling stone, rolling stone
Rolling stone, no rolling stone
