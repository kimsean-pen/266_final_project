Can we just lay here?
Beautiful morning
Tell me all of your worries
Give me all of you love

Tell me you're all in
When the rain's pouring
Tell me all of your worries
Give me all of your love

Was I cold to the touch?
I can almost still feel it, I know
The sweetest wine against my lips, how it lingers

But you know I can't sleep with my head like that
I'll just stay lying here
The things that I would dream with my head like that
I'll watch the day appear instead

I'll be kissing rhythms from your neck
Chasing melodies around your skin
And all the songs my lips should wet
Replay over and over again

You were caught in my mind
I can almost still feel it, I know
You're sweet like wine against my lips
How it lingers

But you know I can't sleep with my head like that
I'll just stay lying here
The things that I would dream with my head like that
I'll watch the day appear instead

Can we just lay here?
Beautiful morning
Tell me all of your worries
Give me all of you love

Tell me you're all in
When the rain's pouring
Tell me all of your worries
Give me all of your love

Tell me all of your worries
Give me all of your love

Tell me
Tell me all of your worries
Give me all of your love
