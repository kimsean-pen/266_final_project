Oh Mary of silence,
You pick my heart with a smile
Oh sweet Mary
Come inside for a while
Help me get a hold on you,
Or I look in the night
I thought of myself beside you
Take me into your skin

Oh, sweet Mary of silence
Oh, sleeping Mary of silence

We have a steady confusion,
You're looking at fear
It doesn't seem like the first time,
You walked out in a hurry

Oh, sweet Mary of silence
Oh, sleeping Mary of silence
I look in, In your window
To check my head in your pane
My last thoughts, they come to me
I can't take the pain

Oh, sweet Mary of silence
Oh, sleeping Mary of silence

Help me walk with you, To the sky that we see
Shuddering in myself, in-my-self
Oh where
Oh when
Oh well
Sweet Mary of silence
Sweet Mary of silence
Sweet Mary of silence
