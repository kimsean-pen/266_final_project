Out on the road for forty days
Last night in Little Rock put me in a haze
Sweet sweet Connie doin' her act
She had the whole show and that's a natural fact

Up all night with Freddie King
I got to tell you poker's his thing
Booze and ladies keep me right
As long as we can make it to the show tonight

We're an american band
We're an american band
We're comin' to your town
We'll help you party it down
We're an american band

Four young chiquitas in Omaha
A waitin' for the band to return from the show
Feelin' good feelin' right it's saturday night
The hotel detective he was outta sight

Now these fine ladies they had a plan
They was out to meet the boys in the band
They said come on dudes let's get it on
And we proceeded to tear that hotel down

We're an american band
We're an american band
We're comin' to your town
We'll help you party it down
We're an american band

H-e-y
We're an american band
We're an american band
We're comin' to your town
We'll help you party it down

We're an american band
Hey-hey-hey... hey
We're an american band
We're an american band
We're comin' to your town

We'll help you party it down
We're an american band
Hey-hey-hey... hey
We're an american band
We're an american band

We're comin' to your town
We'll help you party it down
We're an american band
We're an american band
W-o-o...
We're an american band
W-o-o...
We're an american band
