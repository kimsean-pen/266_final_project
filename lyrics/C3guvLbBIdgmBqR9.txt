There's not much going on today
I'm really bored, it's getting late
What happened to my Saturday?
Monday's coming, the day I hate, hate

Sit on the bed alone
Staring at the phone

He wasn't what I wanted
What I thought, no
He wouldn't even open up the door
He never made me feel like I was special

He isn't really what I'm looking for
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
This is where I start to bite my nails
And clean my room when all else fails

I think its time for me to bail
This point of view is getting stale

Sit on the bed alone
Staring at the phone
He wasn't what I wanted
What I thought, no

He wouldn't even open up the door
He never made me feel like I was special
He isn't really what I'm looking for
Uh, uh, hey, hey

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, hey, hey
Uh, uh, hey, hey

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, hey, hey
Na, na, na, na, na
We all got choices
Na, na, na, na
We've all got voices
Na, na, na, na, na
Stand up make some noise
Na, na, na, na
Stand up make some noise
Sit on the bed alone
Staring at the phone
He wasn't what I wanted
What I thought, no
He wouldn't even open up the door
He never made me feel like I was special
He isn't really what I'm looking for
He wasn't what I wanted
What I thought, no
He wouldn't even open up the door
He never made me feel like I was special
Like I was special
Cause I was special
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Na, na, na, na, na
