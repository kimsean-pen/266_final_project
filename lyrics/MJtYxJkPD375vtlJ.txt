I wish that I could find a window
Somewhere to watch the rain go by
I wish the darkness in the city would
find another place to lie

Now that I can't near them scream
They need you here

I wish that I could finis the killer and
wash the blood away from here
A psychopath thats out to get me, under a
city wrapped in fear

I wish that I could wee the forest from
all the 'buildings stood like trees
So when the rain falls down in silence
I hear no terror in the breeze
