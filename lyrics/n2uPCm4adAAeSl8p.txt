I Will Find A Way
To Get To You Some Day
Oh But I'm Babe I'm So Afraid I'll Fall
Now Can't You Help Me Call?
Shake Some Action's What I Need
So Let Me Bust Out At Full Speed
And I'm Sure That's All You Need
To Make It All Right
It's Taken Me So Long
To Get Where I Belong
Oh But Oh Please Don't Send Me Back That Way
Or I Will Make You Pay!
Shake Some Action's What I Need
So Let Me Bust Out At Full Speed
And I'm Sure That's All You Need
To Make It All Right
If You Don't Dig What I Say
Then I Will Go Away
And I Won't Come Back This Way Again
Cause I Don't Need A Friend
Shake Some Action's What I Need
So Let Me Bust Out At Full Speed
Then I'm Sure That's All You Need
To Make It All Right Make It All Right
