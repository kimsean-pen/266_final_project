Hey, what's your name?
I've been crawling on my fingers for so long
Shame, is your blame
You think of a better day

It shouldn't be so complicated
'Cause I've been looking for this for so, so long
And I can't believe that many things are overrated
So, I will follow you down

Then it happens again

Blame, that's your game
You've been pointing fingers at me for too long
Fame, is all you gain
You think of a better day

It shouldn't be so complicated
'Cause I've been looking for this for so, so long
And I can't believe that many things are overrated
So, I will follow you down

Then it happens again
Then it happens again
Then it happens again
Then it happens again

It shouldn't be so complicated
'Cause I've been looking for this for so, so long
And I can't believe that many things are overrated
So, I will follow you down

So, I will follow you down
I will follow you down
