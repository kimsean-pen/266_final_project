've been waiting for the sun to come up and to let you know /
There's a reason that I up and left about a week ago /
If complaining is your only move /
Then it's all about my whereabouts and what I plan to do /
I'll never find your heart in a place like this /
I'll never find your trust when it doesn't exist /
I wanna start over, where do we begin? /
I thought I was stronger than to let you in /
I'm finally learning how the tables are turning /
So let's start this over, but where do we begin? /
Sometimes you can read my mind /
It's like we're always breaking ground at the same time /
And I noticed you don't show it /
With Boston still on your skin /
The answer isn't where you are, it's where you've been /
And you know it, So control it, 'cuz I figured out /
I'll never find your heart in a place like this /
This town isn't yours to miss /
I wanna start over, where do we begin? /
I thought I was stronger than to let you in /
I'm finally learning how the tables are turning /
So let's start this over, but where do we begin? /
Am I strong enough now to keep my feet on the ground? /
Can I tell you how I'm feeling with out making a sound? /
Am I strong enough now to keep my feet on the ground? /
So long, here's your song
