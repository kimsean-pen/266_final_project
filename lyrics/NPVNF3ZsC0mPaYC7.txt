I wake to find you're already up now
Pull back the curtain
Smell the sweet refreshment
Of a brand new day

Roll out of bed at 11: 15
Take in the perfect serenity you give me
Every day

The telephone rings out now
But you're, you're no worry
You say forget the world
And listen now

Do do, do do, do do do
You wanna
You wanna move my way
And maybe I don't wanna change

Should, should, should I, should I should I wanna
I wanna feel this way
So tell me why can
We just stay the same

Now I'm head over heels and breaking my back
Reaching for once last chance
Take it away for one last dance
I promise, tonight's your dream

Now I don't know the words don't know the place
But I'm sure
For every moment I'll make it yours
Cause you're the only one I know
That's feeling this way

The telephone rings out now
But you're, you're no worry
You say forget the world
And listen now

Do do, do do, do do do
You wanna
You wanna move my way
And maybe I don't wanna change

Should, should, should I, should I should I wanna
I wanna feel this way
So tell me why can
We just stay the same

Do do, do do, do do do
You wanna
You wanna move my way
And maybe I don't wanna change

Should, should, should I, should I should I wanna
I wanna feel this way
So tell me why can
We just stay the same
No
Do do, do do, do do do
You wanna
You wanna move my way
And maybe I don't wanna change
Should, should, should I, should I should I wanna
I wanna feel this way
So tell me why can
We just stay the same
