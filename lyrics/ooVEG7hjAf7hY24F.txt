Such a cold blooded love
I'm afraid of your touch
Such a cold blooded love
But I love it too much

You had me on your list
The target of your mission
All these times you would be missin' me
Is really guilt admission, baby
The game we're playin' is addictive
And you know I'll risk it all to win it
'Cause I know you better than you think I do

Lately, I get this feelin' that you're watching me
Even when I'm fast asleep, or am I crazy?
The paranoia's sitting in so deep
I don't know what to believe
Tell me what you found
A lunatic in my head spyin'
I hope you know that psychedelic love
Can concentrate excitement, I've tried it

Such a cold blooded love
I'm afraid of your touch
Such a cold blooded love
But I love it so much
Such a cold blooded love
I'm afraid of your touch
Such a cold blooded love
But I love it too much

You had me on your list
The target of your mission
All these times you would be missin' me
Is really guilt admission, baby
The game we're playin' is addictive
And you know I'll risk it all to win it
'Cause I know you better than you think I do

No one knows you're cold blooded, psycho
Waitin' for your next move
No one knows you're cold blooded, psycho
Waitin' for your next move, baby

No one knows
No one knows
No one knows
No one knows
