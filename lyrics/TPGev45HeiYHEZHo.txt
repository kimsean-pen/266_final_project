Hush a wild violet, hush a band of gold
hush you're in a story i heard somebody told
tear the promise from my heart, tear my heart today
you have found another, oh baby i must go away
so hang down your head for sorrow, hang down your head for me
hang down your head tomorrow, hang down your head marie

hush my love the rain now, hush my love was so true
hush my love a train now well it takes me away from you

so hang down your head for sorrow, hang down your head for me
hang down your head, hang down your head, hang down your head marie
so hang down your head for sorrow, hang down your head for me
hang down your head, hang down your head, hang down your head marie
