Oh, something tells me I'm never gone live this one down
But I'll try, but I'm gonna need a quick hand
A sharp eye, a smooth talker
Just to play this one out to the very end
And this is where you come in
I know that I could count on you to walk me through

And I'm making sure that anyone who's anyone
Can be the someone that they've always wanted to
If I couldn't get away with anything then how in the hell did I get here?
Say something, say anything

You were never the one to have something to say
Say something, say something, say anything
I've seen the best and worst of you but we're sticking through
Because without all of the ups and downs
We've been through, you know that it's true

That I could really get sick and tired of you
Oh, something tells me I'm never gonna live this one down
But I'm down and out
'Cause if the tensions light as a feather then I'd be bored stiff
We gotta mix things up a bit to keep up my interest
Sad enough to say that alone I could barely light a match

But together we can burn this place down
Sorry about the mess but when we team up, team up
We always seem to bring this place to the ground
And this is where you come in
I know that I could count on you to walk me through
And I'm making sure that everyone who's anyone

Can be the someone that they've always wanted to
I've seen the best and worst of you but we're sticking through
Because without all of the ups and downs

We've been through, you know that it's true
That I could get really sick and tired of you
I've seen the best and worst of you but we're sticking through

Because without all of the ups and downs
We've been through, you know that it's true
That I could get really sick and tired of you
Sad enough to say that alone I could barely light a match

But together we can burn this place down
Sad enough to say that alone I could barely light a match
But together we can burn this place down
Sad enough to say that alone I could barely light a match
But together we can burn this place down
Sad enough to say that alone I could barely light a match

But together we can burn this place down
Sad enough to say that alone I could barely light a match
But together we can burn this place down

Sorry about the mess but when we team up, team up
We always seem to bring this place to the ground
I've seen the best and worst of you but we're sticking through
Because without all of the ups and downs
We've been through, you know that it's true
That I could get really sick and tired of you
I've seen the best and worst of you but we're sticking through
Because without all of the ups and downs
We've been through, you know that it's true
That I could get really sick and tired of you
