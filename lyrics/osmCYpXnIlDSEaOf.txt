see how we can be fine to each other
it goes like this they call it harmony
when you bite i bite even harder
the downside of emotionality
the mystery in your eyes causes tension
that's what i love
the history around your eyes is so tempting
i know it will last
did you say you want it easy
here i am a broken character
look at all our favorite artists and writers
they sure were broken characters
did you say they're all transfer pictures
the more beautiful are hysterical
you never said you want it easy
take me i'm your broken character
