"My Only Star"

After a day turns into a night
I will light up my light in the sky
Don't shead a tear on the ground I once laid cause I'll be here

From your tears I'll make a chrystal neckless
To surround my heart and my cheast
I'll be up here and walk by your side day and night

Look at me
Me here among the stars
Walking on milkyway part of the eternity

Shining bright in the dark blue sky
Shining your love - my light
Waiting for you to shine by my side
- Look, I am a star!

Meet me in dreamland, come, take my hand
I will guide your way don't be afraid
Hold me in your arms never let go and be my own

Just for tonight I'll be in your dreams
Then I'll exist only in the star streams
Remember me when you look at night sky as time goes by

Look at me
Me here among the stars
Walking on milkyway part of the eternity

Shining bright in the dark blue sky
Shining your love - my light
Waiting for you to shine by my side
- Look, I am a star!
