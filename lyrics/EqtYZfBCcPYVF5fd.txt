Saliva swapping tonsil hockey trollop,
(A misconstructed vivacious sedative.)
Accompanied by operatic coitus,
Accompanied by mal de mer,
(And a jaded disposition...)

Raise the stakes on this!
Now's the perfect time,
Eat crow and liberate your mind.
Oh why do we live? Oh where do we live?
This is a contraceptive,
(This is not accepted where we live...)

Just a piece on the assembly line floor...

Put your hands in the air
A macabre companionship,
Porcelain crusted shards...
Is this how it ends? Was this all pretend!?
Put your hands where I can see em.
