So here's the story of my love, it-
Never fails to keep me up at night
I wonder, while you slumber, why you never slipped away

And I can see it in your eyes, you-
Were the apple of mine, but-
Now I miss it every night

'cause I threw my love away

Threw my love away
'cause I threw my love away

Threw my love, away

Tale
It spins and so it goes
Love will sink you like a stone
And when you find your Dixie cup
I hope it's filling up and spillin' over
And over, and over
'Til the next one down the line

I been thinking often, I been feeling soft
Only half involved, only half a heart

I been dreaming long for another start
Thought you'd understand when I fell apart

Are you saying
You are the one
I don't even, like me that much
That much

'cause I threw my love away

Threw my love away
'cause I threw my love away

Threw my love, away
