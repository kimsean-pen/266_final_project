I don't mind the weather, I've got scarves and caps and sweaters,
I've got long johns under slacks for blustery days.

I think that it's brainless to assume that making changes to your

It's just an escape (it's overrated, anyways).

The hardest part is yet to come.
When you will cross the country alone.
