Are we lovers
Or only just friends
Come tomorrow
Will I be lonely again
When you see me
Is it love in your eyes
What you feeling
Deep down inside

Do you think about me (think about me)
When I'm far away?
Do you dream about me (dream about me)
Can I find a way?
To make you want me (make you want me)
The way that I want you
'Cos I think I love you (think I love you)
Could you love me too?

Take me to your heart
Never let me go
If you knew what I'm feeling
You would not say no
Take me to your heart
Never let me go
For your love, for your love
Is all I need to know

Can you tell me
When you look at me
If you need me
In all honesty
Because I'm certain
As sure as can be
I'd make you happy
Eternally

'Cos I think about you (think about you)
When you're far away
And I dream about you (dream about you)
Night and Day
Can I make you want me (make you want me)
The way that I want you
'Cos I think I love you (think I love you)
Could you love me too?

Take me to your heart
Never let me go
If you knew what I'm feeling
You would not say no
Take me to your heart
Never let me go
For your love, for your love
Is all I need to know

Take me to your heart
Never let me go
If you knew what I'm feeling
You would not say no
Take me to your heart
Never let me go
For your love, for your love
Is all I need to know

'Cos I think about you (think about you)
When you're far away
And I dream about you (dream about you)
Night and day
Can I make you want me (make you want me)
The way that I want you
'Cos I think I love you (think I love you)
Could you love me too?

Take me to your heart
Never let me go
If you knew what I'm feeling
You would not say no
Take me to your heart
Never let me go
For your love, for your love
Is all I need to know
