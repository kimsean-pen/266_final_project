This city drinks and roars
Each word so meaningless
Each word, especially yours, echoes inside my head

Why can't you see
I won't let you get your way
Let you get the best of me
I just need to know
Are you done with me?

So are you done with me
And if you won't you just let me be
I'm trying to understand you keep me believing?
I cannot believe it

This city drinks and screams
This night will never end
This city made of dreams
My dreams have turned to sand

Why can't you see
I won't let you get your way
Let you get the best of me
I just need to know

So are you done with me
And if you won't you just let me be
I'm trying to understand you keep me believing?
I cannot believe it

So are you done with me
Now you wanna sleep?
Did you realize that I can't be all you need
Are you done with me
Now you wanna sleep
Love is gonna die and die again

So are you done with me
And if you won't you just let me be
I'm trying to understand you keep me believing?
I cannot believe it

So are you done with me
And if you won't you just let me be
I'm trying to understand you keep me believing?
I cannot believe it

This city drinks and roars
