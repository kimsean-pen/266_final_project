Ten times more than the sweetest sound
Wouldn't want to change if it brings me down
Every several years this song expires *
Driven by a fear and a sweep of fire
Higher than the heaven's soul
Tendered by your hands
And letting go
Every now and then to fall behind
Leaning on a stranger, turning time

Cause all I want, a second or two
And all we got are seconds to lose
And all I am is tempted by you

Ten times more than the sweetest sound
I wouldn't change if it brings you down
Every seven years, this sonic spy *
Driven by a fear and a sweep of fire

Cause all I want, a second or two
And all we got are seconds to lose
And all I am is tempted by you

Because all I want, a second or two
And all we got are seconds to lose
And all I am is tempted by you
