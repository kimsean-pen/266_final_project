I am sober, had it all when
We were dancing
You always knew how to make me smile
I've been tired, tangled my hair
Tried to think of what would make me
want to live
There's always something missing
And everybody's all alone
And I don't know what to do
(Blowing my head)
7 AM Wednesday
Don't want to be me but who am I
Misty morning clouds my mind
(When it's over)
All my pictures, floats around in my head
I can't see you, now that you're always here
You've been tired, tangled your hair
Tried to think of what would make you
want to live
There's always something missing
And everybody's all alone
And I don't know what to do
(Blowing my head)
7 AM Wednesday
Don't want to be me but who am I
Misty morning clouds my mind
(When it's over)
