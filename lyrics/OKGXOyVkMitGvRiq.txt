Super summer, sugar coppin'
In the mornin'
Do your shoppin' baby, oh
I love my love thing
Super ride inside my lovething

You may disappear
But you'll be back, I swear

Would you love to love me baby?
I would love to love you baby, now
Would you love to love me baby?
I would love to love you baby, now baby now
No, no it's not pain

Super summer, sugar croppin'
In the mornin'
Do your shoppin' baby
I love my love thing
Super ride inside my love thing

You may leave the fair
But you'll be back, I swear

Would you love to love me baby?
I would love to love you baby, now
Would you love to love me baby?
I would love to love you baby, now baby, now

I keep hearin' mother cryin'
I keep hearin' Daddy through his grave
Little girl of all the daughters
You were born a woman, not a slave

Oh I hate my winsome lover
Tell him I've had others at my breast
But tell him he's held my heart
And only now am I a virgin
I confess, I confess

Love my love thing
Love is surely gospel
Love my love thing
Love is surely gospel
Love my love thing
Love is surely gospel
Love my love thing
Love is surely gospel
Love my love thing
Love is surely gospel
Love my love thing
