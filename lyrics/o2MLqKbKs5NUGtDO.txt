You're coming in hot, but not so bright
Making a meal of any appetite
Just take it easy

'Cause if I held you up against the light
I could see clear enough to cut right
To where you're weakest

I can tell that
You wanna laugh it off, but you're lazy
And I've been trying to make amends with you lately
But you're difficult to reason with and maybe
Just maybe

Want my chest to keep it heavin'
On the lighter side of feelin'
I'm not going into grievin' for you, for you, for you
So i'm just gonna laugh it off

I wanna be wrong, but it don't feel right
Lighting my name up with an exit sign
You got me leavin'

You're pushing me into this falling out
And the moment that I watch my mouth
I lose the feeling

'Cause I got the good sense to laugh it off, but this is crazy
You make it seem like I'm the one who's being shady
But your love is in the liminal and maybe
Just maybe

Want my chest to keep it heavin'
On the lighter side of feelin'
I'm not going into grievin' for you, for you, for you
oh-ooh

Want my chest to keep it heavin'
On the lighter side of feelin'
I'm not going into grievin' for you, for you, for you
So i'm just gonna laugh it off

Oh, oh
I'm just gonna laugh it off
Oh, ohh
'Cause the air's got a weight right now
And I can't help but feel out your heavy breathing
I'm only teasing

Want my chest to keep it heavin'
On the lighter side of feelin', ohh
I'm not going into grievin' for you, for you
For you, for you
For you, for you
Oh-ooh

Want my chest to keep it heavin'
On the lighter side of feelin' ohh
I'm not going into grievin' for you, for you
For you, for you
For you, for you
So i'm just gonna laugh it off
I'm just gonna laugh it off
