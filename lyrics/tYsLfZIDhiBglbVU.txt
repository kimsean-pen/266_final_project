One more time baby, gently
That's too gentle

Well, it's one for the money
Two for the show
Three to get ready
Now go, cat, go
But don't you

Step on my blue suede shoes
Well you can do anything
But stay off of my blue suede shoes

Well, you can knock me down
Step in my face
Slander my name all over the place
Do anything that you want to do
But uh-uh, honey lay off of them shoes

And don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes

Steal my car
Drink my liquor
From an old fruit jar
Do anything that you want to do
Uh, uh-uh, honey lay off of my shoes
And don't you

Step on my blue suede shoes, alright
You can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes
Play one time

Burn my house
Steal my car
Drink my liquor
From an old fruit jar
Do anything that you want to do
But uh-uh, honey lay off of my shoes

And don't you
Step on my blue suede shoes
Alright, you can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes

One time baby

Well, it's
Blue, blue
Blue suede shoes
Blue, blue
Blue suede shoes, baby
Blue, blue
Blue suede shoes
Blue, blue
Well, you can do anything
But stay off of my blue suede shoes

Blue, blue
Blue, suede shoes, baby
Blue, blue
Blue suede shoes
Blue, blue
Blue suede shoes
Blue, blue
Well, you can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes
