There were still entire empires
of California highway
I wanted to share with you.
There were still foothills and fires,
and breakdowns on the runways,
I wanted to run with you.
Lost stars are coming on
Lost causes calling on
I was second college bound,
and dreaming of what could be,
wanting to move with you.
Watching concrete island towns,
and skyways full of palm trees
and walking along with you.
Lost stars are coming on
Lost causes calling on
Lost stars are coming on
Lost causes calling on
I found you like a culinary gem
in a stucco-pink strip mall,
I found you as the curtain's coming
down on a melancholy romcom.
I found you in California.
