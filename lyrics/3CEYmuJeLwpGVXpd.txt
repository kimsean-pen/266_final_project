No!

Oh so treacherous, and dangerous, and devious. You keep me on the edge,

(nanana nanana nanana)

Oh you are my guilty pleasure,
So intoxicating when you know it isn't right,
I'll keep it under cover,
See the pressures on cause I'm so into you

Typical boys, that's what I like.
And I really have to say that,
Typical me and my appetite.
For destruction can't you see that,

Any other girl but me,
They would be running from a guy like you.
But now your gonna find there is no fight,
What I really mean to say is

Oh
you are my guilty pleasure
So intoxicating when you know it isn't right.
I'll keep it under cover,
See the pressures on cause I'm so into you.

Evidently your unaware,
Of the chemistry your throwing out.
Indirectly you have no care,
And I really have no doubt that,

That any other girl but me,
They would be running from a guy like you.
Oh your something that I can't do without,
And I really have to say this

Oh you are my guilty pleasure,
So intoxicating when you know it isn't right.
I'll keep it under cover,
See the pressures on cause I'm so into you

Oh so treacherous, and dangerous, and devious. You keep me on the edge

(nanana nanana nanana)

Oh you are my guilty pleasure
So intoxicating when you know it isn't right
I'll keep it under cover
See the pressures on cause I'm so into you

Oh never do without
Mm never do without (Oh, oh, oh)

Right now
Your gonna find there is no fight.
What I really mean to say is

Oh you are my guilty pleasure
So intoxicating when you know it isn't right
I'll keep you under cover
See the pressures on cause I'm so into you

Oh so treacherous, and dangerous, and devious. You keep me on the edge

(nanana nanana nanana)

Oh!
