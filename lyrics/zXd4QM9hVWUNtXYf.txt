Got a picture of a glorious day
A sunny afternoon somewhere with a view
And I don't care what it's all about
As long as I'm with you

And I, I wanna run away with you
I, I wanna run away with you

Wanna get a car, just drive away
Looking at the view and listening to tunes
And I don't care what we talk about
As long as I'm with you

And I, I wanna run away with you
I, I wanna run away with you

And I, I wanna run away with you
I, I wanna run away with you

I, I wanna run away with you
I, I wanna run away with you,
with you

I, I wanna run away with you
I, I wanna run
