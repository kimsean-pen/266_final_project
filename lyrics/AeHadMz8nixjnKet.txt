For my bride
Thought my life
would be right
Took her bowling
got her high
Got myself a showgirl bride
Took a job on the side
In a health shop
keeps me well
Got my mantra for life
Got my karma
And a showgirl bride
All my life
All her life
All our life
I married a showgirl
That's for life
She can't work
in the wintertime
I can't work anytime now
Go to libraries all the while
Looking for a notice
Looking for a name
All my life
All her life
All our life
I married a showgirl
That's for life
I took a showgirl
For my bride
Sprinkled stardust
on my wife
Took her bowling
got her high
Got myself a showgirl bride
Don't you recognize us?
