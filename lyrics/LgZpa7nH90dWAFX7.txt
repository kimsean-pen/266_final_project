I'll take you back to the beginning
I was awoken in screams
The day that I realized there was a devil in me
Who gives a fuck
If I'm a sinner conceived by the flames
You know immaculate conception is nigh

We started broken-hearted
Falling apart at the seams
Don't blame me for your problems
You should fix yourself before you're gonna fix me

Stand back as your world decays
I can't explain why you're falling apart
You need to find someone else to blame
For the hurt and the pain
I'm not the reason that you're insane

Feels like I'm living in a madhouse
Just look in mirrors you'll see
The devil in me shivers every time that you breathe
We're going mad
Go take your pills and get out
I don't understand what the fuck you're screaming about

We're falling downwards spiral
Please just let me be released
Don't blame me for your problems
You should save yourself before you're gonna save me

Stand back as your world decays
I can't explain why you're falling apart
You need to find someone else to blame
For the hurt and the pain
I'm not the reason that you're insane

Yea I know we've seen some better days
Now that explains why we're falling apart
You need to find someone else to blame
For the hurt and the pain
I'm not the reason that you're insane

Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
I'm not the reason that you're insane!

Stand back as your world decays
I can't explain why you're falling apart
You need to find someone else to blame
For the hurt and the pain
I'm not the reason that you're insane

Yea I know we've seen some better days
Now that explains why we're falling apart
You need to find someone else to blame
For the hurt and the pain
I'm not the reason that you're insane

Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
I'm not the reason that you're insane!
