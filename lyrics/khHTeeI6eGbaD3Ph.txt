Call to destruction
Call to destruction of the symbols of paganism
Grand monuments of idolatry
We must tear down these blasphemous edifices of heathenism
We must annihilate all that is pre islamic
We must complete what the Sahabi Amr Bin Al As could not
We must tear down these relics of infidelity
Great and mighty works of blasphemy
Mountains of ancient heresy
Sacriligese, encased in stone
From thousands of years before the prophet
The pyramids must be torn down, demolished, erased
The ancient symbols of human civilization must be pummeled to the ground
Call to destruction
We must become as the prophet himself
Who demolished the kaba temple to erect a mosque
And Al As who laid waste to the library of Alexandria
Burning a vast accumulation of ancient knowledge
Existing long before the quran
Before the quran
Before the quran
The preservation of human heritage
And the enduring achievements of mankind
Are secondary to the will of Allah
We must eradicate all that is not in accordance with the writings of the messenger
Whe shall abrogate these architectures of profane ideology
Engage the destruction machines
We shall unwrite all human histories of heathen origin
We must become as like as unto the prophet himself
Who beheaded hundreds of apostate qurayza
We must cut off the head of the sphinx
Timeless guardian of the ancient pharaohs whose mere existence is a blasphemy unto
allah.
The pagan idols and statues which fill our lands must be removed, struck down, dismantled
demolished, obliterated
Their priceless remains desecrated and violated of their ancient profanation must
be wiped from the face of the earth
Call to destruction
Call to destruction
Call to destruction
All pyramids must be torn down
The preservation of human civilization and the enduring achievements of mankind
Are secondary to the will of Allah
