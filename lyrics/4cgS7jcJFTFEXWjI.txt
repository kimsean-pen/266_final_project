Oh
I stand firm for our soil
Lick a rock on foil (come forth)
They juice me, seduce me
Dress me up in ecstasy

Hell is round the corner where I shelter
Ism's and schisms, we're living helter skelter
If you believe or deceive
Common sense says shouldn't receive
Let me take you down the corridors of my life

And when you walk
Do you walk to your preference?
No need to answer till I take furthur evidence
I seem to need a reference to get residence

A reference to your preference to say
I'm a good neighbor, I trudge
So judge me for my labour
The bond on me ensures my good behavior
The constant struggle ensures my insanity

Passing the ignorance ensures
The struggle for my family
We're hungry beware of our appetite
Distant drums bring the news of a kill tonight

Oh, oh
The kill which I share with my passengers
We take our fill, take our fill, take our fill

I stand firm for our soil
Lick a rock on foil (come forth)
They juice me, seduce me
Dress me up in ecstasy

Confused by different memories
Details of Asian remedies
Conversations, of what's become of enemies
My brain thinks bomb like

So I listen he's a calm type
(As I grow) And as I grow, I grow collective
Before the move sit on the perspective
Mr. Quaye

Lay in the crevice
And watches from the precipice
Empirial passage (yeah)
Heat from the sun somedays slowly passes

Until then, you have to live with yourself
Until then, you have to live with yourself
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

I stand firm for our soil
Lick a rock on foil (come forth)
They juice me, seduce me
Dress me up in ecstasy

Hell is 'round the corner where I shelter
Ism's and schisms, we're living helter skelter
If you believe or deceive
Then common sense says you will receive

Let me take you down the corridor
Mmm, mmm
My brain thinks bomb like, bomb like
(Oh) my brain thinks bomb like, bomb like, bomb like
My brain thinks

Bomb like
Beware of our appetite
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Mmm, mmm

Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Mm hm, mm hm
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
