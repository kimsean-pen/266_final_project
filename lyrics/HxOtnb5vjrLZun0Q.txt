You do it for him

And you would do it again
You do it for her, that is to say
You'll do it for him
Keep your stance wide

Keep your body lowered
As you're moving forward
Balance is the key
Right foot; left foot

Now go even faster
And as you're moving backwards
Keep your eyes on me
Keep my stance wide (Good)

Keep my body lowered (Right)
As I'm moving forward (Concentrate!)
Don't you want him to live!?

Right foot; left foot

Yes, but put your whole body into it!

Everything you have, everything you are

You've got to give
On the battlefield

When everything is chaos
And you have nothing but the way you feel
your strategy and a sword
You just think about the life you'll have together after the war

And then you do it for her

That's how you know you can win
You do it for her, that is to say
You'll do it for him
Deep down you know

You weren't built for fighting
But that doesn't mean
You're not prepared to try
What they don't know

Is your real advantage
When you live for someone
You're prepared to die
Deep down I know
That I'm just a human (True)
But I know that I can draw my sword and fight
With my short existence (Good)
I can make a difference (Yes, excellent!)
I can be there for him
I can be his knight
I can do it for him
You'd do it for her
Okay, now do that again (Yes, ma'am.)
You do it for her, that is to say
You'll do it for him
