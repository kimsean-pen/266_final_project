On the slide I feel a certain liberation
I took the bus to find out what you meant to me
I saw the park I gotta find my destination
12 o'clock and suddenly I feel so free

Don't know what it could be
But some days
I feel it crashing in
If I could see you right here beside me
I'd hold you once again

Every night I listen closely
For your wind to catch me
In our park way after dark

On this bench I feel no itch of desperation
Missed my bus and felt no major urge to leave

Saw a park and followed my dumb inclination
Twelve o'clock and suddenly I feel so free

Don't know what it could be
But some days
I feel it crashing in
If I could see you right here beside me
I'd watch you once again

Every night I listen closely
For your wind to catch me
In our park way after dark
Way after dark

Every night I listen closely
For your wind to catch me
In our park way after dark
Way after dark

Every night I listen closely
For your wind to catch me
In our park way after dark
Way after dark
