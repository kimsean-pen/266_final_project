Never seeing eye to eye
Harmony destroyer
I believe in dreams tonight
I love you Verne Troyer

But If I don't cry (if I don't cry)
I'll be at peace tonight (I'll be at peace tonight)

Time to get you nice and high
Strap you in your moonshoes
Wish on a Genie
Ha ha ha
I want wishes too

And why should I (and why should I)
Apologize? (Apologize)

Never seeing eye to eye
Harmony destroyer
I believe in dreams tonight
I love you Verne Troyer

But If I don't cry (if I don't cry)
I'll be at peace tonight (I'll be at peace tonight)

Time to get you nice and high
Strap you in your moonshoes
Wish on a Genie
Ha ha ha
I want wishes too

And why should I (and why should I)
Apologize? (Apologize)
