We've run out of words, we've run out of time
We've run out of reasons, really why we together?
We both know it's over, baby, bottom line
It's best we don't even talk at all, whoa

Don't call me even if I should cross your mind
Hard enough, I don't need to hear your voice on my messages
Let's just call it quits, it's probably better so
If I'm not returning your calls it's 'cause

'Cause I'm not coming back, I'm closing the door
I used to be tripping over missing you but I'm not anymore
I got the picture phone, baby, your picture's gone
Couldn't stand to see your smile, every time you dialled

'Cause it's over, girl, you know it's over this time
So when you call, I'm pressing 7
Don't wanna hear your messages, messages
I'm trying to erase you from my mind

'Cause it's over, I swear it
Girl, it's over this time
So don't be calling, leaving messages, don't wanna know where ya been
Baby, 'cause it's over

I still wake up every morning quarter to ten
Still eat my cereal right at the kitchen table
I can't even remember how long it's been
When your troubles stayed & occupied

Oh, ask about you whenever I come around
I do what I can not to put my business in the streets
Last thing I need's another episode
Keep conversations short and sweet because

'Cause I'm not coming back, I'm closing the door
I used to be tripping over missing you but I'm not anymore
I got the picture phone, baby, your picture's gone
Couldn't stand to see your smile, every time you dialled

'Cause it's over, girl, you know it's over this time
So when you call, I'm pressing 7
Don't wanna hear your messages, messages
I'm trying to erase you from my mind

'Cause, baby, it's over, I swear it
Girl, it's over this time
So don't be calling, leaving messages, no, don't wanna know where ya been, oh no
Baby, 'cause it's over

You know that it's over when the burning and the yearning inside your heart ain't there anymore
And you know that you're through when she don't do to you and move you like the way she moved you before
And you wanna pull her close but your heart has froze
You kiss her but her eyes don't close
Then she goes out of your heart forever
And it hurts you but you know that it's better

Girl, you know it's over, girl, you know it's over this time
So when you call, I'm pressing 7
Don't wanna hear your messages, messages
I'm trying to erase you from my mind, whoa, girl, you know

'Cause it's over, I swear it
Girl, it's over this time
So don't be calling, leaving messages, don't wanna know where ya been
Baby, 'cause it's over, yeah

'Cause it's over, girl, you know it's over this time
So when you call, I'm pressing 7
Don't wanna hear your messages, messages
I'm trying to erase you from my mind

'Cause it's over, I swear it
Girl, it's over this time
So don't be callin, leaving messages, don't wanna know where ya been
Baby 'cause it's over
