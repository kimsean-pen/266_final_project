Pretty in scarlet
So pretty in scarlet

We slept a while
To turn it off
And get it off our minds
I slept a while
To get it all
It seems alright
To find a place without a single lie
Where is the night
We ran into

Cuz' nothing is good
I can't explain
Falling down and caught up the rain
I turn myself into changes
The night I kissed you goodbye
Cuz' nothing is good
I can't explain
Falling down and caught up the rain
I turn myself into changes
Your death is over

You want to live a lie
And I'm pretty in scarlet
Come on
You want to wash it down
And I'm pretty in scarlet
I turn myself to say goodbye

You want to live a lie
And I'm pretty in scarlet
Come on
You want to wash it down
And I'm pretty in scarlet
I turn myself to say

It's ok
It doesn't count
Found my place
A deeper sound
Let me dive alone
Let me dive alone

You gave me wine
To poison me
And take away my time
I can hear you cry
I wonder why

Cuz' nothing is good
I can't explain
Falling down and caught up the rain
I turn myself into changes
The night I kissed you goodbye
Cuz' nothing is good
I can't explain
Falling down and caught up the rain
I turn myself into changes
Your death is over

You want to live a lie
And I'm pretty in scarlet
Come on
You want to wash it down
And I'm pretty in scarlet
I turn myself to say goodbye

You want to live a lie
And I'm pretty in scarlet
Come on
You want to wash it down
And I'm pretty in scarlet
I turn myself to say goodbye

Pretty in scarlet
Pretty in scarlet
Pretty in scarlet

You want to live a lie
And I'm pretty in scarlet
Come on
You want to wash it down
And I'm pretty in scarlet

You want to live a lie
And I'm pretty in scarlet (so pretty)
Come on (so pretty, so pretty)
You want to wash it down
And I'm pretty in scarlet (and I run, and I run)

And if you throw a stone on me (I'm pretty in scarlet)
And if you need some pain to see
And if you live your lies (I'm pretty in scarlet)

I will run, I will run, I will run, I will run away

And if you throw a stone on me (I'm pretty in scarlet)
And if you need some pain to see
And if you live your lies (I'm pretty in scarlet)
I will run
