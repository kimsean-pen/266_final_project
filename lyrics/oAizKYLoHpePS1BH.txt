Just one night, all we got
Just one night, all we got
Just one night, all we got
Just one night, all we got

I ain't got time for you baby
Either you're mine, or you're not
Make up your mind sweet baby
Right here, right now's all we got

A little party never killed nobody
So we gon' dance until we drop, drop
A little party never killed nobody
Right here, right now's all we got

Skip, parap-pap

Islands, diamonds, trips around the world

Don't mean a thing if I ain't your girl
A little party never killed nobody
So we gon' dance until we drop, drop
A little party never killed nobody

Right here, right now's all we got
A little party never killed nobody
So we gon' dance until we drop, drop
A little party never killed nobody

Right here, right now's all we got
All we got, all we got, all we got, all we got
All we got, all we got, all we got, all we (c'mon)

All we got-got, got, got-got, got, got-got
God damn

Skip, parap-pap

Hahaha
Glad that you made it, look around
You don't see one person sitting down
They got drinks in their hands
And the room's a bust
At the end of the night maybe you'll find love
Fake chit chat 'bout the things they got
And my stout reputation keeping it hot girl

At the party of the year I'm a master plan
If you make me realize, I'm your man
If the people get loud
Underneath the moonlight
Hotsy-totsy, paparazzi
Hold it while I take this pic

Speak Easy, rocking the fellas I'm breezy
Hope you can keep up boys
Cause believe me, I'm the bees knees
It don't mean a thing if I give you my heart

If you tear it apart, no, ah, ah, ah, aoh
It don't mean a thing if I ain't in your eyes
Papa that ain't gonna fly, no, ah, ah, ah, aoh
It don't mean a thing if I give you my heart

If you tear it apart, no, ah, ah, ah, aoh
It don't mean a thing if I ain't in your eyes
Papa that, ain't gonna fly, no, ah, ah, ah, aoh

Just one night, all we got
Just one night, all we got
Just one night, all we got
Just one night, all we got

What do you think, GoonRock?
Are you ready?
A little party never killed nobody
So we gon' dance until we drop, drop (let's do all)

A little party never killed nobody
Right here, right now's all we got
A little party never killed nobody
So we gon' dance until we drop, drop
A little party never killed nobody
