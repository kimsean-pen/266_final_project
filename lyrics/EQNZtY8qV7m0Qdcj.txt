Asleep with the morning light
Walking you home
Found you in the garden with
Pockets of gold
I forgot the future and the time

Would you be the only one
In my life with my love?
I've been running

And you help me realize
There ain't much time in life before the lights go down
So I want to tell you now

You're laying in my white bed
Sleeping in my thoughts
On a trip to Carcassonne where
Our dreams won't get lost
I forgot the past and all its woes

Would you be the only one
In my life with my love?
I've been running

And you help me realize
There ain't much time in life before the lights go down
So I want to hold you now

For a few weeks I'll be obligated to
play my songs and travel on the road
All I want when I get back home is
to see your face and lie with you alone
I'll do my best to show you
How much I want to know you
To know you

Your grandma and grandpa give
You all of their love
I want to stay beside you through
These times that are tough
I can't always trust what's on my mind but I know

You could be the only one
In my life with my love
I've been running

And you help me realize
There ain't much time in life before the lights go down
So I want to know you now
Yeah I want to know you now
I want to know you now
