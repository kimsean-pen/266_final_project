Farewell heartless world
I'll send you postcard words
And the flames you tried so hard
To extinguish with fear of failing

I'll write down everything I have learned
And edit it down to a single word

Love, for you I'm waiting, anticipating

Sparks will fly, beneath the Luna alight

Lazarus and Frankensteins
Baby, I'll be a flatliner for a heartkiller
A little we die, above the lesser light

For you I'm open wide
Baby, I'll be a flatliner for a heartkiller
Heartkiller

Top hats off to the return
Of the beat to lick a wound to
Curse for some and bless for a few

It doesn't have to make any sense at all
Come hither and we'll fall

In love
For love
I'm crawling out of patience, baby

Sparks will fly, beneath the Luna alight
Lazarus and Frankensteins

Baby, I'll be a flatliner for a heartkiller
A little we die, above the lesser light
For you I'm open wide

Baby, I'll be a flatliner for a heartkiller
Paint all your sorrows for me to sing
Heartkiller

Draw your pain and hear me hum it out
Sparks will fly, beneath the Luna alight
Lazarus and Frankensteins
Baby, I'll be a flatliner for a heartkiller
A little we die, above the lesser light
For you I'm open wide
Baby, I'll be a flatliner for a heartkiller
Heartkiller
Heartkiller
Heartkiller
Baby, I'll be a flatliner for a heartkiller
Baby, I'll be a flatliner for a heartkiller
