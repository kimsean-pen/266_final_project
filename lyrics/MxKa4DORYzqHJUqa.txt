Dream of skies and darkless nights
What a dreary situation
Single signs to the sun

I see the pain you hold in your eyes
Into the crystal sacrifice
Shall be whole to make one

Into the beat of the night

Seven circles face the stars
To commence the invocation
Bring us life once again

Creatures surrounded and undone
Shall be whole the two made one
Dark Crystal take me away
Take me away

Keep shining into the sun
Night terrors have just begun
Keep shining into the sun and away

Into the beat of the night
