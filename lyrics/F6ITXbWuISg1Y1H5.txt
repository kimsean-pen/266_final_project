Start stop and start
Stupid acting smart
Flirting with the flicks
You say it's just for kicks
You'll be the victim of your
Own dirty tricks
You've got yourself to tease
And displease

Doors swinging wide
You walked in to hide
Looking at your feet
Failure's complete
Saw you and me on the
Coin-op t.v.
Frozen in fear
Everytime we got near

I'm not surprised at all
And really, why should I be?
See nothing wrong, see nothing wrong
So sick and tired of all these pictures of me
Completely wrong, totally wrong

see you walking by, with another guy
Jailer who sells, personal hells,
Who'd like to see me down on
My fucking knees
Everybody's dying just to
Get the disease

I'm not surprised at all
And really, why should I be?
See nothing wrong, see nothing wrong
So sick and tired of all these pictures of me
Completely wrong, totally wrong

I'm not surprised at all
And really, why should I be?
See nothing wrong, see nothing wrong
So sick and tired of all these pictures of me

Oh, everybody's dying just to get the disease
Everybody's dying just to get the disease
Everybody's dying just to get the disease
