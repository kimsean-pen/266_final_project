And now that time has passed
Memories are made, world turns at last
And now we are a family, I want love

(Did you love me?)
Here at the end
(Did you love me?)
Now that it's over
(Did you love me?)
I should reach out there
(Did you love me?)

But I had lied, I'm made of glass
Brittle and cracked
Not many do last

Now that it's over
(Did you love me?)
I should reach out there
(Did you love me?)
But I am a fake
(Did you love me?)
And I was terrified
(Did you love me?)

(Did you love me?)
(Did you love me?)
(Did you love me?)
(Did you love me?)
(Did you love me?)
(Did you love me?)
