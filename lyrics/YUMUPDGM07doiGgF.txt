There's something I have to say to you
If you promise you'll understand
I cannot contain myself
When in your presence
I'm so humble
Touch me
Don't hide our love
Woman to man

She's just a lover
Who's doin' me by
It's worth the giving
It's worth the try
You cannot cleave it
Or put it in the furnace
You cannot wet it
You cannot burn it

She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Aahh, she wants to give it)
Dare me
(She wants to give it)
(Aahh, she wants to give it)
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Aahh, she wants to give it)
(She wants to give it)
(Aahh, she wants to give it)

It's Just A Feeling
You Have To Soothe It
You Can't Neglect It
You Can't Abuse It
It's Just Desire
You Cannot Waste It
Then, If You Want It
Then, Won't You Taste It

She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Aahh, she wants to give it)
Dare Me
(She wants to give it)
(Aahh, She wants to give it)
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Aahh, she wants to give it)
(She wants to give it)
(Aahh, she wants to give it)
