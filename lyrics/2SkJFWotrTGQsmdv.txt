Behold a jocund morn indeed! -
Sun on high - birds in sky.
Yonder the whist eathing,
Fro where a gale erranteth.

(Ye beholdest but the shadow) That is a lie!
(Mayhap a tithe of trothplight) Lief I am not!
(I deem - e'er and anon!) My words are but a twist.

'Tis a feignéd lie through loathing, I say!
(To and fro, save hither, is thy love.)
A dotard gaffer, I daresay...
(Not a loth! - But vying for my kinsmen!)
...a sapling not!

(Beautiful tyrant!)
(Fiend angelical!)
(Dove-feathered raven!)
(Wolvish-ravening lamb!)
(A hamlet for a slothful vassal -)
(Soothing ale for a parchèd sot.)
(Hie to tell me)
(What ye judgest as naught;)
(I behold the shadow!)

Wherefore call me such names;
Nay imp am I!
Thou art my aghast hart -
Grazing in the glade.

(E'er thou sayest aye!) That is a lie!
(Thief of a plot!) Lief I am not!
(Now go to thy tryst) My words are but a twist!
(Go, leave, totter!) Fare well! - with joy I came,
(Until ye dwindlest.) With rue I leave.
(A morsel, nay more,) Even the orb cannot
(For thy journey) Help me melt the ice?!
(Hither an thither!)
