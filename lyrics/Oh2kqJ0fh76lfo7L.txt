We are greater than this
We are stronger than before
There's no locking us in
We're not hopeless anymore

Everyone feels safe, safe on the inside
Holding on but never really alive
Everyone feels safe, safe in the outline
Holding on to the cage in your mind

I've found a way to pull you from the life you hate
To somewhere real so you don't find your self lost in the grey
We are greater than this
We are stronger than before
There's no locking us in
We're not hopeless anymore

Don't tell me that you're, you're the same
There's nothing, no mold that I can't break
Don't tell me that you're full of shame
There's nothing, you're a rat that wants to bleed
I'm just a rat that wants to bleed

I've found a way to pull you from the life you hate
To somewhere real so you don't find your self lost in the grey
We are greater than this
We are stronger than before
There's no locking us in
We're not hopeless anymore

We're hopeless not helpless
There's more to life than what's in site
We're hopeless not helpless
We're hopeless not helpless
(Not helpless)

I've found a way
I've found a way
We are greater than this
We are stronger than before
There's no locking us in
We're not hopeless anymore
