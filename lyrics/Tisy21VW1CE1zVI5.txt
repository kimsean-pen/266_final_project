Call your friends and your family
I need all of your energy
I need all of your energy
I need all of your energy
Now we're getting on swimmingly
I need all of your energy
I need all of your energy
I need all of your energy, energy
Charming, cheeky, funny, makes a really good impression
Kinda guy, you like
Tells you what you want to hear
Can't wait to go for drinks another time, alright

I swear we're all in this together
I swear

But it was all a dream
Hate to burst your, burst your bubble
Tide swept us out to sea
There's blood in the water
There's blood in the water
'Cause it was all a dream
Starting, starting, starting trouble
Don't you, don't you, don't believe that they're sorry
Snakes on the ladder, impeccable manners
Believe me you don't matter

I-I-I
I-I-I-I can't lie, lie
I need all of your energy
We've just got it that chemistry
I need all of your energy
You and me are the recipe
I feed off of your energy, energy

I swear we're all in this together
I swear

But it was all a dream
Hate to burst your, burst your bubble
Tide swept us out to sea
There's blood in the water
There's blood in the water
'Cause it was all a dream
Starting, starting, starting trouble
Don't you, don't you, don't believe that they're sorry
Snakes on the ladder, impeccable manners
Believe me you don't matter

Always be there
Count on me completely cause I'll always be there
What you want is what I want as well
Let's stick together baby, life could be swell
Always be there
Waiting for the moment that you're under my spell
Who can fight the feeling of a foe
Who gets you where you need to go, oh, oh

Hate to burst your, burst your bubble
The tide swept us out to sea
There's blood in the water
There's blood in the water
'Cause it was all a dream
Starting, starting, starting trouble
Don't you, don't you, don't believe that they're sorry
Snakes on the ladder with impeccable manners
Believe me you don't matter
