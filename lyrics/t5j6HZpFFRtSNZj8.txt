She blew my mind behind the wreckin' machine
She was a shitload of trouble called the subway queen
Had a hip with bad habits and a shake that was a bit obscene
One night I caught her rollin' out the cellar door
There was about a million people lying flat on the floor
For such a sweet little lady
I would swear she's rotten to the core
Oh yes
She got her hands in the cookie jar
Smiling like an alligator
Makin' headlines in the back of her car
Tight- lipped now but sink ships later
I know a thing or two about
Sweet little sister
Her mama kill her if she knew what she do
She's my sweet little sister
She'll love ya black and blue
Sweet little sister
She's Mona Lisa with a new tattoo
She's my sweet little, sweet little sister
Every quittin' time is another disease
Too many cowboys ridin' high shootin' low at the knees
The back hand boogie is the price you pay for being the squeeze
The pettin's getting heavy got his tongue in her ear
Her friend is doing time for kickin' ass on a queer
They're in a mental state and all their friends are here
Oh yess
She's tellin' lies through her burgundy lips
Angel on a mission of mercy
She'll get you dancin' with the crack of her whip
Take you up to heaven in her rocket ship
I know a thing or two about

Sweet little sister
Her mama kill her if she knew what she do
She's my sweet little sister
She'll love ya black and blue
Sweet little sister
She's Mona Lisa with a new tattoo
She's so sweet ooo sweet as candy!

She got her hands in the cookie jar
Smiling like an alligator
Makin' headlines in the back of her car
Tight-lipped now but sink ships later
I know a thing or two about
Sweet little sister
Her mama kill her if she knew what she do
She's my sweet little sister
She'll love ya black and blue
Sweet little sister
She's Mona Lisa with a new tattoo
She's my sweet little, sweet little sister
