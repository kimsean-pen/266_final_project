There's an ocean inside my head
Waves that don't ever rest
This kind of beauty ain't ordinary
You look, but do you really see?

Won't you take your time on me?
'Cause we got nowhere else to be

We'll go dancing in the kitchen
You fall in my arms
Baby won't you let your phone keep ringing
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Won't you take your time on me?
Oh, oh, oh
On me
Oh, oh

I let you figure me out
Tear all my fences down
We've been so tired
Asleep on our feet
Chasing things we'll never keep

Won't you take your time on me?
'Cause we got nowhere else to be

And we'll go dancing in the kitchen
You fall in my arms
Baby won't you let your phone keep ringing
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
We could walk away with nothing
We could go too far
I'll admit I never saw you coming
Now I see your colors running
Won't you take your time on me?
Won't you take your time on me?
Oh, oh, oh
On me
Oh, oh

And you know my heart, well it's waiting for your call
(Take your time on me)
And you know my heart, well it's waiting for your call
(Take your time on me)
And you know my heart, well it's waiting for your call
(Take your time on me)
And you know my heart, well it's waiting for your call
(Take your time on me)
And you know my heart, well it's waiting for your call
(Take your time on me)
And you know my heart, well it's waiting for your call
