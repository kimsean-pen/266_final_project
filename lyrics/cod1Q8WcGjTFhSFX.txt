We lay on the bed there
Kissing just for practice
Could we please be objective?
'Cause the other boys are queuing up behind us
A hand over my mouth
A hand over the window

Well, if I remain passive and you just want to cuddle
Then we should be okay and we won't get into muddle
We're seeing other people, at least that's what we say we are doing

So how are you feeling?
I don't think you can be dealing
With the situation very well
You take a lover for a dirty weekend, that's okay
But when it's over you are looking at the working week
Through the eyes of a gigolo

You're kissing your elbow
You're kissing your reflection
And you can't understand
Why all the other boys are going for the new, tall, elegant rich kids
You can bet it is a bitch, kid

But if they don't see the quality then it is apparent that
You're gonna have to change or you're gonna have to go with girls
You'd be better of, at least they know where to fit in

We lay on the bed there
Kissing just for practice
Could we please be objective?
'Cause the other boys are queuing up behind us
A hand over my mouth
A hand over the window
Well, if I remain passive and you just want to cuddle
Then we should be okay and we won't get into muddle
We're seeing other people, at least that's what we say we are doing
We're seeing other people, at least that's what we say we are doing
We're seeing other people, at least that's what we say we are doing
