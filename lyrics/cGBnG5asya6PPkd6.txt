I can pretend to hold you tight
You know I want to have you tonight
I've done these things with myself behind
Now I want to be here to do things right
Now I want to be here to do things right
Now I want to be hear to do things right

If you long to hold my hand
Girl step forward and I'll be your man
Things are moving too quickly
Girl I know but sometimes love comes swiftly
Girl I know but sometimes love comes swiftly
Girl I know but sometimes love comes swiftly
I can see the stars in your eyes
These feelings you hold to your heart this time
Don't let them keep us apart
Now lay down and I'll share my heart
Now lay down and I'll share my heart
Now lay down and I'll share my heart
Are you sure these feelinfs you have are love?
Girl with you things can't move fast enough
I want to be seen by your side
So take me now, we don't have to hide
So take me now, we don't have to hide
So take me now, we don't have to hide
