(Chorus:)
Down the road came a Junco Partner
Boy, he was loaded as can be
He was knocked out, knocked out loaded
He was a'wobblin' all over the street

Singing 6 months ain't no sentence
Yeah, and one year ain't no time
I was born in Angola
Serving 14 to 99

Well I wish I had me one million dollars
Oh, one million to call my own
I would raise me, and say, "grow for me baby"
Raise me a tobacco farm

Take a walk, Take a walk, Junco Partner

Well, when I had me a great deal of money
Yeah, I had mighty good things all over town
Now I ain't got no more money
All of my good friends they're putting me down

So now I gotta pawn my ratchet and pistol
Yeah I'm gonna pawn my watch and chain
I would have pawned my sweet Gabriella
But the smart girl she wouldn't sign her name

(Chorus)

Well I'm down, yes I'm getting thirsty
Pour me out a good beer, when I'm dry
Just, just give me whisky, when I'm thirsty
Give me headstone when I die.

Down the road.
