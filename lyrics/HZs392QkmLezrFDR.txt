Crazy how it feels tonight
Crazy how you make it all alright, love
Crush me with those things you do
And I'd do for you anything too, oh
Sitting, smoking, feeling high
And in this moment, oh, it feels so right

Lovely lady, I am at your feet
Oh, God, I want you so badly
And I wonder this could tomorrow be
So wonderous as you there sleeping

Let's go drive 'til morning comes
Watch the sunrise and fill our souls up
We'll drink some wine 'til we get drunk, yeah

It's crazy I'm thinking
Just knowing that the world is round
I'm here, I'm dancing on the ground
Am I right side up or upside down?
And is this real, or am I dreaming?

Lovely lady, let me drink you, please
Won't spill a drop, no, I promise you
Lying under this spell you cast on me
Each moment the more I love you
Crush me, come on, oh, yeah

It's crazy I'm thinking
Just knowing that the world is round
I'm here, I'm dancing on the ground
Am I right side up or upside down
is this real, or am I dreaming?

Lovely lady, I will treat you sweetly
I adore you, I mean you crush me
And it's times like these
When my faith, I feeling
I know how I love you
Come on, come on, baby

It's crazy I'm thinking
Just as long as you're around
I'm here, I'll be dancing on the ground
Am I right side up or upside down?
To each other we'll be facing my love, by love
We'll beat back the pain we've found
You know
I mean to tell you all the things I've been thinking
Deep inside, my friend
Each moment the more I love you
Crush me, come on, baby
So much you have given love
That I would give you back again and again
All, Good Lord, meaning I'll hold you
But please, please just let me always
