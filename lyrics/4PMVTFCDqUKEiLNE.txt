I'm driving in my car
Upon this crowded star
It's been my longest night
Under this full moon light
As her brother Sun begins to rise

The new year's passed it's almost done
My present situation is this song
It turns my life into a reel
I sit back and watch it play

The clock it ticks it never stops
Melting memories into teardrops
Shedding my past lives, loves, and everlasting pain and joy

But I'm in the future now
With feet on the earth and hands on the branches that I climb
Within the waves that carry me
And now I'm sinking deep into her soul
Like floating in the ocean we breathe to control
The rhythm of our place in time
In cycles of existential rhyme
