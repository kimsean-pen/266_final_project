You see it from the outside
You're running toward the wall
Swinging from your blind side
Cause you don't know me at all
I've been here too many times before
And your tears don't mean a thing
I only come
When you scream

I told you
Child don't follow me home
You're just too perfect for my hands to hold
If you choose to stay
You'll throw it all away
And I just want to take
Your innocence

Is this what you wanted?
Did I make your dreams come true?
You're sitting in a corner
Wondering what you got into
And you ache for things
You don't understand
That your tears don't mean a thing
And I only come
When you scream
And I told you

Child don't follow me home
You're just too perfect for my hands to hold
If you choose to stay
You'll throw it all away
And I just want to take
Your innocence

There's no such thing as fate
Only your self to blame
You never walked away

I told you
Child don't FOLLOW me home!
You're just too perfect for my hands to hold
If you choose to stay
You'll throw it all away
And I just want to take
Your innocence

Child don't follow me home
You're just too perfect for my hands to hold
If you choose to stay
You'll throw it all away
And I just want to take
Your innocence
I just want to take
Your innocence
I just want to take-
