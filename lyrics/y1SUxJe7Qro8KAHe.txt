I was hoping for an open door policy
For the rest to fall in with me
And baby then I could be well

None of my friends knew that there was something wrong with me

And in the Fog
Lie
Sleep

Everything fills, everything no...
Familiar Soul

Chameleon, show me your hand,
I'm old enough to give up on this Romance

I was hoping we deserved more

I turned away, I turned away, I turned away from all these moments
I turned away, I turned away, I turned away from all these moments
I turned away, I turned

xxxx

Spectre of
Familiar Soul

Chameleon, show me your hand,
I'm old enough to give up on this Romance
Oh to give up on this Romance
Oh to give up on this Romance

I turned away
I turned away
I turned away
I turned away
I turned away
I turned away
I turned away
I turned away
I turned away
I turned away
I turned away
I turned away
I turned away

I turned
