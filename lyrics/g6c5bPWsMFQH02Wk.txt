I let it go
Didn't i say so?
Yeah you should know,
It's no thanks to you though
When I come up
But you don't really get it
It freaks you out
Only 'cause you let it

Well the dumb industry blokes, spread shirts, firm punks
The raga-rich boys making poor boys noise
The living dead ain't down on luck
Don't pretend you don't give a fuck

'cause we're happening
We're happening
We're happening

Here, come sit down
But I don't wanna bore you
We don't hang out
Maybe we should do

When I go out,
I keep my mouth shut
I'm... all now
Everyone is cool but
I studied here two years ago,
But you know all the guys I know
Miles... and inches deep
And that ...

We are happening
We are happening
We are happening

Who are you, what do you do
Oh yeah, i like doing nothing too
All your friends like the gang of four
No nun or man've never heard 'em before

But we are happening
We are happening
We are happening
We are happening
We are happening
We are happening
We are happening
We are happening
Was it happening?
