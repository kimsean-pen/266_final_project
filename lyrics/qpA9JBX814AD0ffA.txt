Bathing In your private fears.
Held back by the need of control
You are conducting yourself by the proper manners.
Never let down by the cameras eye.
The custodian of your science sets the stage.
All the bravery are now lost for the fragile minds.

I am facing a new day with caution.
I'm paralyzed by the lack of surveillance.
I am crawling in the shadows. I'm hiding
Hiding behind the crumbling walls.
Becoming the trigger of your own tears.
You are the weakest of links in this chain reaction.

So tell me now,
What are your deepest fears?
So tell me now,
Why can't you let go.

A commotion in this mind, stifles a headless kind.
It is constant darkness in this legacy of shadows.
A marriage to suspiciousness, awake by senses.
The faceless watcher stalks in the corner of your eyes.

So you run from the secrets that is haunting you now.
The custodian of your science are in control
So you run from the secrets that is haunting you now.
The custodian of your science are in control.

So tell me now,
What are your deepest fears?
So tell me now,
Why can't you just let go.
