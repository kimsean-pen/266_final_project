Won't you come through?
Water on me
We gon' walk right through
And I'm swimmin' like Nemo
No caller ID, no
You don't really like me, no
And I don't really like people
But you're better by default

No, red rocks so bright (So bright)
You can open your eyes
Hell all rise
Make you so blind (So blind)
With a thousand teeth, like a Leviathan
Biting tightly on my wrist, it look like heaven
Weighin' tightly on my neck until it breaks
If I lived too long, you'd kill me with a stake
No mistake, no mistake, no mistake
No mistake
The reflection never point the same way
ABBA on repeat, yeah
Diamonds like a dancing queen, so...
