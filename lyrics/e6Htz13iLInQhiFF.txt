Grab the keys and let's go for a ride, on with the stereo get lost in the night
I been waiting to show you how right.
Let your hair fall out the window

Underneath the stars, a silver moon.
I will get to know you soon, sing all the songs I wrote the words to.
(ahh ahh)
One thing I know was you that going on, I'll only hear you all night long
Just keep the rhythm turn you oh-on.
So take me back real slow, never ever take me home, show me all I want of you in your road, ready go!

Drive
Drive

Constellation from the ... from you
Every fingertip will wind it what you do
Sing the heart out of the roof with you

Underneath the stars, a silver moon.
I will get to know you soon, sing all the songs I wrote the words to.
(ahh ahh)
One thing I know was you that ... going on ... i'll only hear you all night long
Just keep the rhythm turn you oh-on.
So take me back real slow, never ever take me home, show me all I want of you in your road, ready go!
