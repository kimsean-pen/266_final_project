In two more years, my sweetheart, we will see another view
Such longing for the past for such completion
What was once golden has now turned a shade of grey
I've become crueler in your presence

They say: "Be brave, there's a right way and a wrong way."
This pain won't last for ever, this pain won't last for ever

Two more years, there's only two more years
Two more years, there's only two more years
Two more years so hold on

Two more years, there's only two more years
Two more years, there's only two more years
Two more years so hold on

You've cried enough this lifetime, my beloved polar bear
Tears to fill a sea to drown a beacon
To start anew all over, remove those scars from your arms
To start anew all over more enlightened

I know, my love, this is not the only story you can tell
This pain won't last for ever, this pain won't last for ever

Two more years, there's only two more years
Two more years, there's only two more years
Two more years so hold on

Two more years, there's only two more years
Two more years, there's only two more years
Two more years so hold on

You don't need to find answers for questions never asked of you
(Two more years)
You don't need to find answers
(Two more years)

You don't need to find answers for questions never asked of you
(Two more years)
You don't need to find answers
(Two more years)

Dead weights, balloons
Drag me to you
Dead weights, balloons
To sleep in your arms

I've become crueler since I met you
(Dead weights, balloons, drag me to you.)
I've become rougher, this world is killing me
(Dead weights, balloons, to sleep
In your arms.)
