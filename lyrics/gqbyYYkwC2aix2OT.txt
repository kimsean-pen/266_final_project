I'm scared of huntsmans
Even though they're harmless I don't like their
numerous legs and find their eyes quite charmless
I'm scared of falling not the jump
Just the landing
A parachute is fine as long as I still end up standing

And I always think you when I was little
And all of the things I chose to love instead
I used to love dinosaurs when I was a kid
I wasn't afraid I was brave and courageous with everything I did

I'm scared of the fact I've been to more funerals in my
life than weddings yeah I've lost some close mates of mine
And I'm scared of surfing held underwater choking
Am I trying to impress you, is it working acting blokey

And I always think you when I was little
And all of the things I chose to love instead
I used to love dinosaurs when I was a kid
I wasn't afraid I was brave and courageous with everything I did

I used to love dinosaurs when I was a kid
I wasn't afraid I was brave and courageous with everything I did

And I feel like a loser I've forgotten how to imagine and pretend
So I'll just watch Jurassic Park for the 50th
time avoiding plans I've made with my own friends
