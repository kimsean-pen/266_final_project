I kept your picture in my shoebox [3x]

Right now is all we need
"cause this feels pretty good
And I would stop the world
Just to give us more time

I kept your photograph and sometimes I take a look
Do you think I should
Are you gonna leave
Is she a better girl
And does she know about me

Hey you
I think you're going in the wrong direction
Hey you
I could be everything you want
And it's true
You must have been something special to me
"cause after all this time
I kept your picture in my shoebox

Tonight was you and me
And it felt pretty good
Just like we stopped the world
For a minute in time
And then you made me laugh
About all the things we did
Do you think we should
Did you have to leave
And the other girl
Does she know about me

Hey you
I think you're going in the wrong direction
Hey you
I could be everything you want
And it's true
You must have been something special to me
"cause after all this time
I kept your picture in my shoebox

I hear you talk but your mouth is closed
You say the words and let me know
I can't speak I'm petrified
Wanna tell you what I feel inside

I kept your picture in my shoebox [2x]

Hey you
I think you're going in the wrong direction
Hey you
I could be everything you want
And it's true
You must have been something special to me
"cause after all this time
I kept your picture in my shoebox

I think you're going in the wrong direction
I could be everything you want
And it's true
You must have been something special to me
"cause after all this time
I kept your picture in my shoebox

I kept your picture in my shoebox [2x]
