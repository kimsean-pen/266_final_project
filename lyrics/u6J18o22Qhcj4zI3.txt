Mississippi river, so big and wide
A blond haired woman on the other side

Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world

I worked all summer, spring and fall
A blond haired woman the cause of it all

Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world

I saw her in Dallas and El Paso
Said come back baby, I need you so

Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world

Mississippi river, so big and wide
A blond haired woman on the other side

Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world
