Sowing the seeds
Roots dig deep while we sleep
Snakes in veins, valves decay
All the meaningless words we say

Cast the first stone from behind the throne
Crown of thorns now overgrown
All our wants and needs bring us to our knees
Can't turn back now, the seeds are sown

Seven billion, one of a kind
Collide together, intertwined
National lines used to define
Where we draw the enemy lines

Cast the first stone from behind the throne
Crown of thorns now overgrown
All our wants and needs bring us to our knees
Can't turn back now, the seeds are sown

Weapons aren't used in this war
Wait for the fallout from this absence of thought
All the things we can't afford to ignore
The sun doesn't shine anymore
Weapons aren't used in this war
Wait for the fallout from this absence of thought
All the things we can't afford to ignore
The sun doesn't shine anymore
