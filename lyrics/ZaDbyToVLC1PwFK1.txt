Step into the velvet of the morning
Let yourself lay back within your dreams
Take on the situation but not the torment
Now you know its not as bad as it seems

Well I know you'd like to come away
But baby you can't come
Your fortune is your life's love
Oh and anytime you think about leaving
Think about what you know
Well think about it...
Think about it before you go

Even when you feel like your life
is fading
I know that you'll go on forever
You're that good
Heartbreak of the moment is not endless
Now your fortune is your life's love
Well honey...
I know you'd like to come away
But baby you can't come
Your fortune is your life's love
Whoa and...
anytime you think about leaving
Think about what you know
Well think about it...
Think about it before you go

And the heart says danger
And the heart says whatever
It is... that you want from me
I am just one... small... part...
Of forever... (ever...)
Falling... (falling...)star...(star...)
Star...
Catcher

Even when you feel like your life
is fading
I know that you'll go on forever
You're that good
Heartbreak of the moment is not endless
Your fortune is your life's love
Well honey...
I know you'd like to come away
But baby you can't come
Your fortune is your life's love
Anytime you think about leaving
Think about what you know
Well think about it...
Think about it before you go...
Well think abou it
Think about it before you go...
And the heart says danger
The heart says whatever
Think about it...
Think about it before you go
