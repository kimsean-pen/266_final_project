Nomads plunging into the vast abyss
Unattached, fleeting through the chasm
Naked in pure darkness
Embracing the new dawn

We are gods here for the taking
Yield to the dragon's embrace
We are wolves and snakes
Yield to the dragon's embrace

As pawns in this secret game
No one knows nothing
Yet, in the realm of sacred play
Everyone knows everything

A winged and secret flame
Leaving this paradigm
A dimension we are set to flee

A winged and secret flame
Leaving this paradigm
A dimension we are set to flee

We are gods in the making
We are here for the taking
Yield to the dragon's embrace
We are of transcendence
We are wolves and snakes

A winged and secret flame
Leaving this paradigm
A dimension we are set to flee
The arrival is in the departure
We are sculpted into life
By the hands of death.

We are gods
Here for the taking
We are wolves and snakes
Yield to the dragon's embrace
