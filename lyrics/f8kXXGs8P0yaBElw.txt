Wildfire, wildfire
Wildfire, wildfire
Wildfire, wildfire
Hey, hey I've been wating
Waiting for the day, for the day to end
When I feel the night moving in, one thing on my mind
Here I go again ooh
Push up on my body put it on me, Dj, get me high
Work me over slowly baby show me, feel the flame ignite
This club is heavy, now I'm ready
You're the guy to do it right
Yeah, so do it right,
Get up in my face, we're burning the ground
There's no way, no way, of stopping it now
You're here to turn me on, I bet that all night long we go like wildfire, wildfire
Get all up on me, they're playing it loud
we started a blaze there's no putting out
You're here to turn me on, I bet that all night long we go like wildfire, wildfire
Hey, hey I see you looking,
honey, to the beat, what you waiting for?
Getting closer I like this feeling
Ooh you got the beat and you set me off
Ooh push up on my body, put it on me Dj. get me high
Work me over slowly, baby, show me, feel the flame ignite
This club is heavy, now I'm ready
You're the guy to do it right
Yeah, so do it right,
Get up in my face, we're burning the ground
There's no way, no way, of stopping it now
You're here to turn me on, I bet that all night long we go like wildfire, wildfire
Get all up on me, they're playing it loud
we started a blaze there's no putting out
You're here to turn me on, I bet that all night long we go like wildfire, wildfire
Wildfire, wildfire, wildfire, wildfire, wildfire, wildfire
Get this started hot like fire
Wildfire, wildfire, wildfire, wildfire, wildfire, wildfire
Get this started hot like fire
Wildfire, wildfire,
Get up in my face, we're burning the ground
There's no way, no way, of stopping it now
You're here to turn me on, I bet that all night long we go like wildfire, wildfire
Get all up on me, they're playing it loud
we started a blaze there's no putting out
You're here to turn me on, I bet that all night long we go like wildfire, wildfire
Get up in my face
Wildfire, wildfire, wildfire ooh ooh wildfire ooh ooh

Get it started hot like fire
