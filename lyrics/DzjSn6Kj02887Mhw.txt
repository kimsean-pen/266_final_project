Oh boy, you've got a knack for melody and
Oh boy, I know you think you're pretty
Oh boy, those lyrics do have meaning
I will prove it

And I know a few make you so jealous
And I heard that you can get pretective
Of the things most people have regarded
As trash or something of no use

I got a castle in my sky for you and I
And it's rumored there might be a prize
I'm gonna build myself a moat around our abode 'cause
Thieves made me shy

And if we fail together well
No, that's not really failure
And it's an A for eﬀort
Yeah?

At the sparks right on sight
I stepped straight into the bright
Got bent some but mostly did alright
We're like that movie we both liked

Oh boy, you've got a knack for melody and
Oh boy, I know you think you're pretty
Oh boy, those lyrics do have meaning
I will prove it

And I know a few make you so jealous
And I heard that you can get pretective
Of the things most people have regarded
As trash or something of no use

And if we fail together well
No, that's not really failure
And it's an A for eﬀort
Yeah?

At the sparks right on sight
I stepped straight into the bright
Got bent some but mostly did alright

Biting hands or holding tight
I'm tripping with you in mind
I get nerves 'cause we're doing so ﬁne
We're like that movie we both like

I got a castle in my sky for you and I
And it's rumored there might be a prize
I'm gonna build myself a moat around our abode 'cause
Thieves made me shy
