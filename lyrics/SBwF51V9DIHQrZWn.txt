Welcome to your eternal nightmare
Welcome to your eternal nightmare
My child, there is no other way
Every sight you never wanted to see
Everything you never wanted to be
Closed eyes, but you can not erase
Every sight you never wanted to see
Everything you never wanted to be
To be
Welcome to your eternal nightmare
Welcome to your eternal nightmare
Come with me
We'll sink into the soil, beside the maggots
All we need
Inside the gnashing of teeth, under the static
Now I can see all the misery
I can feel the night closing in on me
Closing in on me
Now I can see all the misery
Under my blood red vail in darkness we shall lay
Come with me
We'll sink into the soil, beside the maggots
All we need
Inside the gnashing of teeth, under the static
Welcome to your eternal nightmare
Welcome to your eternal nightmare
