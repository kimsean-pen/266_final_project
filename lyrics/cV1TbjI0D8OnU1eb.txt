Woke up early feelin' light
Shame, it's a shame
Somebody got to me last night
Shame, it's a shame

Sat down for a friendly duel
(Shame, it's a shame)
With one-eyed jacks 'n' jokers too
Shame, it's a shame

Oh, sailor man
Shame, it's a shame
Oh, sailor man
Shame, it's a shame

Poormouth Henry turned to me
Shame, it's a shame
Said, "Boy, I'm gonna pick you clean"
Shame, it's a shame

Oh, sailor man
Shame, it's a shame
Oh, sailor man
Shame, it's a shame

Henry said, "Don't you mess that pile"
Shame, it's a shame
Had three aces 'n' he had five
Shame, it's a shame

Oh, sailor man
Shame, it's a shame
Oh, sailor man
Shame, it's a shame
Oh, sailor man
Shame, it's a shame

Shame, it's a shame
Shame, it's a shame
Shame, it's a shame
Shame, it's a shame
Shame, it's a shame
Shame, it's a shame
