Here come broken bones
Where's your sticks and stones?
What'd you use to hurt me?
Something you should know
Cannot take no more
Time to settle scores
Feel the rage and fury
Blood I'll make it pour

Hypocrisy from jealousy
Hypocrisy from jealousy

Lies you spit are harmless to me
Your spite, your greed, your envy
Why do you stoop so low?
Am I the last to know?

Lies you spit are harmless to me!
Your spite, your greed, your envy
Why do you stoop so low?
Am I the last to know?

Where's your big mouth now?
Hope you're fucking proud
Do you like your bruises?
Now you make no sound
Is your lesson learned?
How the tables turn
What were your intentions?
To hell with you, now burn

Why do you stoop so low?
Am I the last to know?

Lies you spit are harmless to me
