Wait and see who'll wake up then
Always stars see what, once you're free
He hopes will be the very last time

He loves you more than this
The stars let you know all's right and bright and
He loves you more than this
Ego lets him know that's how much more was gained

Wait and see who'll wake up then
Always stars see what, once you're free
He hopes will be the very last time

He loves you more than this
The stars let you know all's right and bright and
He loves you more than this
Ego lets him know that's how much more was gained

With a yell to you, he yawed, he'd stay
With a yell to you, he yawed, he'd stay
With a yell to you, he yawed, he'd stay

What, once you're free, he hopes will be the very last time
Ego lets him know that's how much more was gained

What, once you're free, he hopes will be the very last time
Ego lets him know that's how much more was gained

What, once you're free, he hopes will be the very last time
Ego lets him know that's how much more was gained

What, once you're free, he hopes will be the very last time
Ego lets him know that's how much more was gained
