Home again, driven back
She's still waiting for a friend

Little purple organdy,
Remember what you've always meant to me

Something in the way your heart is nailed upon a hand
Swimming in the cold waters, head above the sand

Heaven, baby, is in an hour
With your heart in handfuls, forbidden flowers
Bread and bonnets along the way
Better take your chances while there's still a ray

Something in the way your heart is nailed upon a hand
Swimming in the cold waters, head above the sand

Constant heart of my devotion
Must be you, the door to open
Home again, be here, be with him
Will I swim out of your ocean?

Constant heart of my devotion
Must be you, the door to open
Home again, be here, be with him
Will I swim out of your ocean?

Constant heart of my devotion
Must be you, the door to open
Home again, be here, be with him
Will I swim out of your ocean?
