Sleep, sleep with the lights on
Shutter and shades drawn
There's too many windows
Noise, cars on the freeway
Tempting a clean break
There's nowhere left to go
Watching the room tweak
Through cracks in the concrete

Plates they will shift
Houses will shake
Fences will drift
We will awake
Only to find
Nothing's the same
Nothing's the same

Home, home is a fire
A burning reminder
Of where we belong, oh
With walls, built up around us
The bricks make me nervous
They're only so strong, though
They're only so strong, though

Plates they will shift
Houses will shake
Fences will drift
We will awake
Only to find
Nothing's the same
Nothing's the same
Nothing's the same
Nothing's the same
As yesterday
As yesterday
