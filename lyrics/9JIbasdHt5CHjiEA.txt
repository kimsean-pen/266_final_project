Crisis of all things but mine is the only one
Crisis of love, I can't believe this sin
Face it alone, open the gates of the vestibule
Mining the soulless, wanting to dig my way out

Wages ahead to protest what they show you
Or you'll lose yourself
I can't help you
Bracing for death won't protect
Or enthrone you
Abuse yourself
Use yourself
I can't help you

Canyons of Gods
Canyons of failing Gods
Statements of all in the setting sun
Canyons of steel
Canyons of tethered steel
And I know there's sun
But I can't feel it

Lead into sand where the dust
Will surround you
Better lose yourself
Abuse yourself
I can't help you
Curse of the land, where the truth
Will impound you
Better lose yourself
Abuse yourself
I can't help you

Planets will bloom
Planets will splinter and move out of line
And this day, you will be burned
You will be burned
This speaker is blown
This speaker is systematically blown
Better tonight than tomorrow
Just a memory now

Fade into sand
Can't believe what they've shown you
Release yourself
Unleash yourself
I can't help you
Bracing for death
The release will dethrone you
Better sooth yourself
Better lose yourself
I help you
