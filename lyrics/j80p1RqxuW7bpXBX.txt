This life will find you
Be there to blind you
This groove you'll die for
Lives on all along

If this ain't love
I'm tired of breathing
With you beside me
I'll keep dreaming
If this ain't love
I'll stop believing
That love conquers all

My delicious words have spoken
We get crazy way too soon
Our time has come
Under this blood crimson moon
