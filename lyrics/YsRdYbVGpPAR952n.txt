Loose change, that I don't have
And all the little things, that make you mad
Yes there's mountains out of molecules again
Yes there's mountains out of molecules til' the end
Missed calls, that I collect
When you see me, you'd wring my neck
Yes there's mountains out of molecules again
You could be so good for me
You could be just what I need
Like the salt that clings to your skin
When you spend your days at the beach
Ooh oh
These cr-cr-cracks between
Ooh oh
These cr-cr-cracks between
These cr-cr-cracks between us
Loose ends, won't tie themselves
Are you leaving? It's hard to tell
When there's mountains out of molecules again
Yes there's mountains out of molecules til' the end
You could be so good for me
You could be just what I need
Like the salt that clings to your skin
When you spend your days at the beach
Ooh oh
These cr-cr-cracks between
Ooh oh
These cr-cr-cracks between
These cr-cr-cracks between us
I could be good for you
I don't think you'll agree
Your mother told you not to swim
If your feet can't touch, the bottom, of the, sea
Ooh oh
These cr-cr-cracks between
Ooh oh
These cr-cr-cracks between
These cr-cr-cracks between us
Ohhh yeah
Ooh oh
These cr-cr-cracks between us
Ooh oh
These cr-cr-cracks between us
Ooh oh
These cr-cr-cracks between us
C-c-cool
