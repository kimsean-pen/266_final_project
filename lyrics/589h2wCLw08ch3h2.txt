He's still alone in the darkness
And the ways back home are endless
'Cause his life is out of fire
That's his one desire

That's his one desire
One desire

He's still alone in the darkness
And the ways back home are endless
'Cause his life is out of fire
That's his one desire

Comes a fairy close to his face
And gives him three / wishes for his helpless night
Situation gone at least back home
All the fairy wants is war

One desire

He's still alone in the darkness
And the ways back home are endless
'Cause his life is out of fire
That's his one desire

One desire

that's his one desire

He's still alone in the darkness
And the ways back home are endless
'Cause his life is out of fire
That's his one desire
