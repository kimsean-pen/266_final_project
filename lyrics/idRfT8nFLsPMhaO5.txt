i know you're a woman by the way you burn below
i'll tell you secrets so good, you'll never tell a soul
come closer, that bonfire holds his life like stones
my years, my life unknown

diamonds from the pavement broken glass had been.
just like these troubles that i'm leaving to the wind.
like sapphires in boxcars speeding towards the end.
like thieves, my bad luck grows.

jewel box of sadness, bring to catch your tear
crystallise illusion shine, forgot i'm here
jewel box of sadness, bring to catch your tear
oh, you left some stars in my belly

star crossed child's love on the bands of wedding gold
silver studs of promise hide in red crushed velvet folds.
inaction, intention, like emeralds i stole.
my speech of custom gold. i think i ought to know.

jewel box of sadness, bring to catch your tears
crystallise illusion shine, forgot i'm here
jewel box of sadness, bring to catch your tear
oh, you left some stars in my belly.

you left some stars in my belly.

you left some stars in my belly.
