Moonlit skies upon us
As they freeze over our sheets
And I'm drowned by lust, lawlessness
You saw my death in a dream

You're only harmless
You're only harmless
You're only harmless when you sleep
You're only harmless when you sleep

There's a wall of ice to crack through
Over time I've come to see
We're only lonely when we're in the same room
When you're standing next to me

You're only harmless
You're only harmless
You're only harmless when you sleep
You're only harmless when you sleep

Your every movement makes me stand so still
Your day is my night
I'm forever empty in what you're trying to film
And I've darkened your light

You're only harmless
You're only harmless
You're only harmless when you sleep
You're only harmless when you sleep

You're only harmless when you sleep
You're only harmless when you sleep
