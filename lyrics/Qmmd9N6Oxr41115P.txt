Ooooh
Oooh
Yeah
You're so bright
Like a dream

You burn up
Everything
We might
Make a scene

Ignite
Gasoline
When the music goes up and the sun goes down
Lightening strikes and I'm on the ground
Only one that I want around, (is you)
Yeah!

Spark
And it's like Gasoline!
I start
Pumping like a machine

My heart
Only runs on supreme
So hot!
Give me your gasoline

Yeah...
You're setting me on fire!
You're setting me on fire!
You're setting me on fire!

Yeah...
You're setting me on fire
You're setting me on fire
You're setting me on fire

Yeah...
Heatwave

On the floor
Escape
Exit door
Your touch

Burning me
It's too much
Gasoline
When the music goes up

and the sun goes down
Lightening strikes and I'm on the ground
Only one that I want around, (is you)
Yeah!

Spark
And it's like gasoline
I start
Pumping like a machine

My heart
Only runs on supreme
So hot
Give me your gasoline!
Yeah...

You're setting me on fire
You're setting me on fire
You're setting me on fire
Yeah...

You're setting me on fire

You're setting me on fire
You're setting me on fire
Yeah...
Yeah
Damn boy
What you doin' to me?
Yeah
You set me on fire (fire, fire, fire...)
Yeah
Ooh

Ooh
Ooooh
Aaaaaaah...
Spark!
And it's like gasoline
I start
Pumping like a machine
My heart
Only runs on supreme
So hot
Give me your gasoline!

You're setting me on fire
You're setting me on fire
You're setting me on fire
