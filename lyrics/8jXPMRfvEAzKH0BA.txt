I am just a girl

One among the others
Nothing much to say
Plain and simple girl

Not the special type in any way
Just one look and you will surely see

That the true Miss Nobody is me
It's an evil world

That has only made me a girl
I am just a girl

Not the kind of woman
Men would like to meet
Just another girl

No one ever looks at in the street
But today I can't believe it's true

When you smiled and whispered 'I love you'
Darling I could see I was meant to be your girl
It's a funny feeling when you get to love someone

And thinking that he'll never look your way
But then he say he loves you
And life has just begun
It's so much more than any words can say
I am just a girl

Not the kind of woman
Men would like to meet
Just another girl
No one ever looks at in the street
But today I can't believe it's true
When you smiled and whispered 'I love you'
Darling I could see I was meant to be your girl
But today I can't believe it's true
When you smiled and whispered 'I love you'
Darling I could see I was meant to be your girl
