Looking back at the beginning of this
And how life was
Just you and me and love and all of our friends
Living life like an ocean
But now the currents slowly pulling me down
It's getting harder to breathe
It won't be too long and I'll be going under
Can you save me from this

'Cause it's not my time,
I'm not going
There's a fear in me
It's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Oh, I won't go

I look ahead to all the plans that we made
And the dreams that we had
I'm in a world that tries to take 'em away
Oh, but I'm taking 'em back
All this time I've just been to blind to understand
What should matter to me
My friend, this life we live
Is not what we have, it's what we believe

It's not my time
I'm not going
There's a fear in me
It's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know

But, it's not my time
I'm not going
There's a wield in me
Now I know that
This could be the end of me
And everything I know

Oh, but I won't go
I won't go

There might be more than you believe
(There might be more than you believe)
There might be more than you can see

It's not my time
I'm not going
There's a fear in me
It's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know

But, it's not my time
I'm not going
There's a wield in me
Now I know that
This could be the end of me
And everything I know

There might be more than you believe
(There might be more than you believe)
There might be more than you can see

I won't go!
No, I won't go down!
Yeah!
