Getting my party started
By digging a hole in the market
If you can't get in, push harder

Keep that camera on me,
'Cause the people love a good story
But the truth is ever so boring

Yeah

It's the one and only
Budget trip to glory
Fake it 'till you make it
Legends are created

It's the one and only
Budget trip to glory
Fake it 'till you make it
And tell a different story

Tell a different story
Tell a different story

Photoshopping my psyche,
'Cause compliments are pricey
Polish it up and multiply me
(Polish it up and multiply me)

So I build my church with match sticks
Holding it together with death grips
Holiness at my fingertips

Yeah

It's the one and only
Budget trip to glory
Fake it 'till you make it
Legends are created

It's the one and only
Budget trip to glory
Fake it 'till you make it
And tell a different story
Tell a different story

Tell a different story
Tell a different story
Tell a different story

It's the one and only
Budget trip to glory
Fake it 'till you make it
Legends are created

It's the one and only
Budget trip to glory
Fake it 'till you make it
Fake it 'till you make it
