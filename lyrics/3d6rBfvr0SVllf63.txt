Daylight comes to those who live
But those who die, they never see the sun
Come shining throught their window pane
They pass away

Silly girl, to be a fool
You didn't play the golden rule
'Cause once you're through with one world
There's another waiting there

Help me, such a lonely soul
In dreams to leave behind the world
Mister Kingdom, help me, please
To find the rainbow's end

Looking from this empty room
The corridors of endless gloom
Go crawling through the night
To meet the dawn that's on its way

Oh, to sleep, per-chance to dream
To live again those joyous scenes
The laughter and the follies
That are locked inside my head

Help me, such a lonely soul
In dreams to leave behind the world
Mister Kingdom, help me, please
To find the rainbow's end

I can dream of flying high above the city's cares
And never be afraid of anyone
'Cause there ain't no one there

Help me, such a lonely soul
In dreams to leave behind the world
Mister Kingdom, help me, please
To find the rainbow's end

Help me, such a lonely soul
In dreams to leave behind the world
Mister Kingdom, help me, please
To find the rainbow's end
