When she calls me up
My voice it starts to shake
She says come right over
Over right away
Oh good god there's a fire
In my pants
Then lightening strikes and she
Laughs that evil laugh

She's so sticky so sticky so sticky
She's so sticky so sticky
She's so stick sweet

Sticky sweet
Sticky sweet

Now when i've done good
She slaps me on the ass
It takes more than ten seconds
To satisfy this lass
The way she walks, i swear
Should be a crime
Sirens scream everytime
She walks by

Sticky sweet
The way she walks
The way she talks
Stick sweet
Oooh all the time
Sticky sweet

(solo)

Sticky sweet
The way she walks
The way she talks
Sticky sweet
Oooh all the time
Sticky sweet
Sticky sweet (repeat with vocal adlib)
