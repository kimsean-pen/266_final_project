Any city, any street
Every road another beat
The heat is on gotta take care
Law and order everywhere

Cop cars in the city
In the city in the city
I sn't it a pity, in the city, in the city
Cop cars... cop cars

Long arm getcha so I hear
The hand is open they don't say
Which fool said crime don't pay
Keep running... gotta keep running
