I ain't trading my youth for no suit and jacket
I ain't giving my freedom for your money and status
So don't say I'm getting older
Cause I'll say it when I do

Cause everybody I know, everybody I know
Is growing old, is growing old too quickly
And I don't wanna go
So how am I supposed to slow it down so I can figure out who I am?

And I ain't trading my dreams for no 401k
And I ain't giving this fire for a cold, cold heart
So don't say I'm getting colder
Cause I'll say it when I do

Cause everybody I know, everybody I know
Is growing old, is growing old too quickly
And I don't wanna go
So how am I supposed to slow it down so I can figure out who I am?

Some of us surviving
Some of us just roaming
Some of us just hoping the world will move more slowly
And some of us alive
We're all gonna die one day
Yeah some of us surviving
Some of us just roaming
Some of us just hoping the world will move more slowly
And some of us alive
We're all gonna die one day
Yeah, some of us surviving
Some of us just roaming
Some of us just hoping the world will move more slowly
Some of us alive
We're all gonna die one day

Cause everybody I know, everybody I know
Is growing old, is growing old too quickly
And I don't wanna go
So how am I supposed to slow it down so I can figure out who I am?
