If I asked you now
Will you be my prince
Will you lay down your armour
When you open me
All the power in me moves
How you want to see
All the depths of me real
When you open me
All the power in me moves
I feel real
How I love you
When I look into your eyes
There's a danger inside
When I see the edge

I can never hide
See my running, running, to you from you to you
There's a strange love inside
It's getting louder
And louder and louder and louder and louder
There's a danger I can't hide
Who I am, it's who I am, it's who I am
I'm in love!
I'm in love!
I'm in love!
I'm in love!
I'm in love!
I'm in love!
I'm in love!
I'm in love!
Gonna build you up, gonna help you believe sonny
Gonna build you up, gonna help you be free honey

There's a strange love inside

It's getting louder
And louder and louder and louder and louder
There's a danger I can't hide
Who I am
It's who I am, it's who I am
I'm in love!
I'm in love!
I'm in love!
I'm in love!
I'm in love!
I'm in love!
I'm in love!
I'm in love!
We're just two men in love
