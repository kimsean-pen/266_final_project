When I was done dying, my conscience regain
So I became a struggle, a nothingness strange
I'm a flash made of time, I knew form blasted out
And it scarred on me so, and I burst out a shout out
Which my legs ran frantic like birds from a nest
And I ran until drained, leaving no choice but rest
So I feel asleep softly at the edge of a cave
But I should've gone deeper, but I'm not so brave
And like that I was torn out and thrown in the sky
And I said all my prayers because surely I'd die
As I crashed out and smashed into earth into dirt
How my skin did explode, leaving only my shirt
But from shirt grew a tree and that tree grew up root
And I became the seed and my teeth was uproot
And I watered the ground with my roots and my leaves
And I tore up the shirt and ate up the sleeves
And when I (?) and said what is your plan
And the question was more I did not understand

And it swallowed me down each time I head south

I woke up to see them, these two mighty steeds
With there mouths grinning wildly expressing my need
As they stood there above me, being flanked on each side
I felt no need to fear them
No reason to hide
So I reached up to touch
But they faded too soon
yet their mouth still remained
And stacked up towards the moon
How that latter of mouth wakes so soft in the night and i looked up in awe of that beautiful sight
As i dreamt about climbing into the night sky
But know if id touch them theyd mouth back
Bye bye
So i got up and walked down a path in the dark
And there deep in the distance my eye caught a spark
Of a crab twice my size with incredible strength
Though it greeted me kindly
And then we all drank
Yeah we drooled there together
Right onto the ground
And the ocean grew quickly
Right up all around
And the earth looked at me
And said
Wasnt that fun?
And i weeped while im sorry
If i hurt anyone
And without even thinking
Cast me into space
But before she did that
She wiped off my own face
She said better luck nextime
Dont worry so much
Without ears i couldnt hear
I could just feel the touch
As i fell asleep soft at the edge if a cave
But i couldnt go deeper
Cause im not so brave
