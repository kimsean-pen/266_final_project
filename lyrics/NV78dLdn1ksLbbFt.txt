You don't know me
Bet you'll never get to know me
You don't know me at all
Feel so lonely
The world is spinning round slowly
There's nothing you can show me from behind the wall
Show me from behind the wall
Show me from behind the wall
Show me from behind the wall

You don't know me
Bet you'll never get to know me
You don't know me at all
Feel so lonely
The world is spinning round slowly
There's nothing you can show me from behind the wall
Show me from behind the wall
Show me from behind the wall
Show me from behind the wall

Show me from behind the wall
Show me from behind the wall (Why don't you)
Show me from behind the wall
Nasci lá na bahia de mucama com feitor
O meu dormia em cama, minha mãe no pisador
Laia ladaia sabadana ave maria

You don't know me
Bet you'll never get to know me
(Eu voce na dois, jà temos un passado meu amor)
You don't know me at all (Um violao guardado)
Feel so lonely (Aquela flor)
The world is spinning round slowly
There's nothing you can show me from behind the wall
Show me from behind the wall
Show me from behind the wall
Show me from behind the wall (Why don't you)

Show me from behind the wall
Show me from behind the wall
Show me from behind the wall
Show me from behind the wall
Laia ladaia sabadana ave maria
Laia ladaia sabadana ave maria
Laia ladaia sabadana ave maria

Eu agradeço ao povo brasileiro
Norte, centro, sul, inteiro
Onde reinou o baião
Eu agradeço ao povo brasileiro
Norte, centro, sul inteiro
Onde reinou o baião
