I don't mind, if you're keeping someone else behind
I don't care
'Cause you've got something I can share
Hey, take your chance, even if it's only

Only while we're dancing in the light
Of your second sight
Because when you understand me
You might feel good around me now

I don't want your love to bring me down
I don't want your love so turn it around

I won't turn you out, if you've got someone else
Someone else you care about
Because you must realize
My obsessive fascination is in your imagination, now pick it up

I don't want your love to bring me down
(I don't what your love, I don't what your love)
I don't want your love so turn it around
(I don't what your love, I don't what your love)

Your rhythm is the power, to move me
It's something you control, completely
I don't want your love, I don't want your love
(I don't what your love)

I like noise, 'cause I like waking up the house
I cannot sit down, I can't shut my mouth
But when you understand me
You might feel good around me, now back it up

Your rhythm is the power, to move me
It's something you control, completely
I don't want your love, I don't want your love
(I don't what your love)

I don't want your love to bring me down
(I don't what your love)
(I don't what your love, I don't what your love)
I don't want your love so turn it around
(I don't what your love)
(I don't what your love, I don't what your love)

(I don't what your love)
(I don't what your love)
