For all of the world
I'd tell you tonight dear
That I pray for God for you to be here
I look for a sign, something to remind me you'll find me
So when I'm alone I know you're beside me
Cos you're never really gone
No, you're never really gone
I feel you everywhere
And when it rains
You're in the air
Touched by the sight like a memory
And when you're gone
I'm in your arms
Watch over me
I feel you everywhere
And all I can hope
Is that you have found peace
While I journey on
Your flame I will carry
Cos you're never really gone
No, you're never really gone
I feel you everywhere
And when it rains
You're in the air
Touched by the sight like a memory
And when you're gone
I'm in your arms
Watch over me
I feel you everywhere
I feel, feel it, I feel, feel you everywhere
I feel, feel it, I feel, feel you everywhere
For all of the world
I'd tell you tonight dear
I feel you everywhere
I feel you everywhere
I feel you everywhere
I feel you everywhere
I feel you everywhere
And when it rains
You're in the air
Touched by the sight like a memory
And when you're gone
I feel you everywhere
