On a clear day i can see far ahead in front of me,
the sky above imagines a god, but on another day i'm...
and when i fall the hurt won't show up on me i only hope.
And if i follow you along well then i'll rise up.

And when the burning sun it falls in my eyes,
is when i come upon another sunrise.
Well i will walk alone 'cause i'm not scared to die,
on a clearer day in the sunshine.

And when i hear the angels sing down from up above,
well i won't fear a thing or hear the things i've done.
Only know that you're in a place inside my heart,
and no matter where i go, we will never part.

CHORUS
