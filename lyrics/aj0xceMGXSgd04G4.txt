Don't fall in love with the midnight train
'Cuz it'll leave you in the Middle of Nowhere
The criminals have this all contained
That's why you shouldn't come back 'til it's over

The propaganda's oh-so soothin'
But I think you should aim a bit lower
You don't like what I have to say
But there's nothing you can say because
There's nothing you can do about it

'Cuz there's a right way
And there's a wrong way
And then there's my way
You better not forget it

She fell in love with a simple man
But he'll leave you in the Middle of Nowhere
She doesn't want what you're offering
That's why you shouldn't come back 'til you're older

The propaganda's oh-so soothin'
But I think you should aim a bit lower
You don't like what I have to say
But there's nothing you can say because
There's nothing you can do about it

'Cuz there's a right way
And there's a wrong way
And then there's my way
You better not forget it
You better not forget it
You better not forget it
You better not forget it
You better not forget it

Don't fall in love with the midnight train
'Cuz it'll leave you in the Middle of Nowhere
The criminals have this all contained
That's why you shouldn't come back 'til it's over
You better not forget it

The propaganda's oh-so soothin'
But I think you should aim a bit lower
You don't like what I have to say
But there's nothing you can say because
There's nothing you can do about it

'Cuz there's a right way
And there's a wrong way
And then there's my way
You better not forget it
You better not forget it
You better not forget it
You better not forget it
You better not forget it
