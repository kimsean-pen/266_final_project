Half of this city turning their lights on
Like half of this city has an idea
Cars slowly passing right down on main street
Don't keep on driving, let me say something

There's nothing wrong with a little space
But not right now, don't leave
There's nothing wrong with a little time
But for the memories, for the good things
Don't leave

The stars in the night sky, the distance between them
By the time that you'd reach them, they would be gone
But the distance between us is half of this city
Don't keep on driving, let me say something

There's nothing wrong with a little space
But not right now, don't leave
There's nothing wrong with a little time, a little space
For the memories, for the good things
Turn around now, turn around
Don't leave me now

(Don't push me, push me away)
(Don't push me, push me away)
Don't leave
(Don't push me, push me away)
There's nothing wrong with a little space right now
(Don't push me, push me away)
Don't keep driving
(Don't push me, push me away)
Don't leave me
(Don't push me, push me away)
Call me
(Don't push me, push me away)
Turn around, turn around now
(Don't push me, push me away)
(Don't push me, push me away)
Don't run away from me
(Don't push me, push me away)
(Don't push me, push me away)
Don't leave, don't leave
(Don't push me, push me away) Oh
(Don't push me, push me away)
(Don't push me, push me away)
(Don't push me, push me away)
