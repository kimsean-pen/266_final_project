It would be the best
Everyone could go to Hell
Turn into yourself
Always someone else

Don't need sympathy
Smile it's nothing but teeth
I'll keep my integrity
Even if I have to sleep on the street

Look around, what you're doing?
You think God's in you
Telling people what to do
You don't know who are you

Look around, what you're doing?
You think God's in you
Telling people what to do
You don't know who are you â€“ Fuck!

It would be the best
Everyone could go to Hell
Turn into yourself
Always someone else

Look around, what you're doing?
You think God's in you
Telling people what to do
You don't know who are you

I don't need sympathy
Smile it's nothing but teeth

Look around, what you're doing?
You think God's in you

You don't know who the fuck are you

I don't need sympathy
