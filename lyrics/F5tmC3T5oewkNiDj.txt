Erica and her Isadore
climbed aboard a balloon
I want more than this kite will soar
I've set our sights on the moon

You can't just leave I've given everything
I can't believe your taking everything,
your taking everything, ohh...
Its not who you were, its who you are
and we've come this far lover, no?
I won't rest until the world knows the name Isadore

Blinded by their unbridled height
our lovers turned dissolute

You can't just leave, I've given everything
I can't believe your taking everything,
your taking everything, ohh...
Its not who you were its who you are
and we've come this far lover, no?
I won't rest until the world knows the name Isadore
knows the name Isadore

Then with eyes wide, a splintered sight
there's just one parachute
goodbye Erica now I see
that my worst fears were in tune

Its not who you were, its who you are
and we've come this far lover, no?
I won't rest until the world knows the name Isadore
knows the name Isadore

Won't rest until the world knows the name Isadore
