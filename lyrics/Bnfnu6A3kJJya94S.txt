True, true confessions, I lied
True, true confessions, I lied
Spent all night with Candy's eyes
Dragged myself 'cross the warm blind side
Spent all night with Candy's eyes
Dragged myself 'cross the warm blind side

True, true confession, she cried
True, true confession, she cried
Stand in the doorway in a jealous rage
Drag myself 'cross her wild terrain
Stand in the doorway in a jealous rage
Drag myself 'cross her wild terrain
We're never sorry, we're never sad
We're modern lovers, what fun we had

True, true confessions, we tried
True, true confessions, we tried
Naked, exposed like fine rock-n-roll
Perfect as strangers, imperfect as love
Naked, exposed like fine rock-n-roll
Perfect as strangers, imperfect as love
We're never sorry, we're never sad
We're modern lovers, what fun we had
