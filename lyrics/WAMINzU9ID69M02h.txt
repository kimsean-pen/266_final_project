Someone has got to go on believing
Someone has got to speak of a feeling
Someone has got to Let down their guard
for someone
And I'll be the one, be the one
I do not mind
and if you should touch me know that I made
that I'm made of fire

Drunk and with dreams I'm lost at the seams
My only map I have memories
How else do you suggest I get back to that place
with only one memory I never seen
it's face

Though I keep it alive
I fell underwater
Rings in my head and as long as it's ringing
It was once said, It was once said

I'll be the one be the one I do not mind
And if you should touch me know that I made
that I made up that I made up my mind
oh lift me up oh lift me up lift me up just to bury me under
lift me up oh lift me up lift me up just to bury me under
