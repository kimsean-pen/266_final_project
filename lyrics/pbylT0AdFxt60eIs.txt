Every morning when i wake up yawning
i'm still far away
trucks still rolling through the early morning
to the place we play
boy you'r home, you're dreaming, don't you know
the tour's still far away
boy you'r home, you're dreaming, don't you know
you're having just a break
dream we're going out on stage, it feels like
coming home again
dream we're going out on stage, it feels like
coming home again
dream we're going out on stage, it feels like ...
year after year out on the road
it's great to be here to see you all
i know, for me it is like
coming home
day after day out on the road
there's no place too far that we wouldn't go
we go wherever you like
to rock'n roll
jump on the seats, put your hands in the air
give me a shout, let me hear you're out there
the wilder you scream for some more rock'n roll
the higher we'll go
year after year out on the road
it's great to be here to rock you all
i know, for me it is like
coming home
like coming home ...
