Don't hear, don't deem
Drown in before you dive
Don't care, commit
To your self destruction drive

I kiss the ground with
Love beyond forever
Flip off the sky with
Bleeding fingers till I die

Enemy, take one
Good look at me
Eradicate what
You will always be
Your tainted flesh
Polluted soul
Through a mirror I behold

Throw a punch, shards
Bleed on the floor
Tearing me apart but
I don't care any more
Should I regret or ask myself
Are you dead yet?

Wake up, don't cry
Regenerate to deny the truth
The fiction you live
In blindfold your eyes

Disclosure, self loathing
This time you've gone too far
Or could it be, my nemesis
That you are me?

Enemy, take one
Good look at me
Eradicate what
You will always be
Your tainted flesh
Polluted soul
Through a mirror I behold

Throw a punch, shards
Bleed on the floor
Tearing me apart but
I don't care any more
Should I regret or ask myself
Are you dead yet?

Enemy, take one
Good look at me
Eradicate what
You will always be
Your tainted flesh
Polluted soul
Through a mirror I behold

Throw a punch, shards
Bleed on the floor
Tearing me apart but
I don't care any more

Should I regret or ask myself
Are you dead yet?
Are you dead yet?
Are you dead yet?
