Dream of the night
Dream of the days gone by

A knife in the light
Looks how brightly it shines

Eternity
Oblivion
Eternal light
For us to see

So bring us hope
Beyond the gloom
And let us live
Until the dawn

There is no justice
There is no higher truth
Staring at a god

Dream of the day
The nightmare in which you die
Die
You die
The knife wasn't right
We had to cut down your crown
Your crown

Eternity
Oblivion
Eternal light
For us to see

So Bring us hope
Beyond the gloom
And let us live
Until the dawn

There is no justice
There is no higher truth

Why does the lifeblood in his veins continue to pulse?
Why must they be the ones to die?

Eternity
Oblivion
Shame on you
Red white and blue

Life blood flows
Like a red red rose

Shame on you
Red white and blue

Let us grow
To the afterlife
