Down in the old town
When my mind is wandering
Round empty hallways
When will I be one again?

You're just making it harder for yourself
Making it easy for everyone else
Making it easy for me

In the old town
You'll never be in
And you never get out
You learn from the family
You'll never be in
And you never get out
To run to the end of the earth

Under the archways
When my mind is wallowing
Down to the country
Where I will be well again

You're just making it harder for yourself
Making it easy for everyone else
You're making it easy for me

In the old town
You'll never be in
And you never get out
You learn from the family
You'll never be in
And you never get out
To run to the end of the earth
To run to the end of the earth

Build me a home underground
Free from light and sound
Build me a home in the air
I will run to the end, to the end
And run to the end, to the end
And run to the end of the earth
