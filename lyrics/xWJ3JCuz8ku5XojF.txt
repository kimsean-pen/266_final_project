when everything you say to me resounds so sweetly,
it ferments in mind
and when you kiss me you're thinking of the city,
ms. pretty don't be so kind

oh what's the use in staying here
it'll never be alright for you and i

and when you kiss me you're thinking of the city,
it ferments in mind
you say our love can make it so what's the use in breaking--
tell me what you're waiting for
while i'm staying here you're slipping out the back door

and so there's nothing left in michigan

oh what's the use in staying here
it'll never be alright for you and i
