Well all you ladies gather 'round
That good sweet candy man's in town
It's the candy man
It's the candy man

He likes a stick of candy just nine inch long
He sells as fast a hog can chew his corn
It's the candy man
It's the candy man

All heard what sister Johnson said
She always takes a candy stick to bed
It's the candy man
It's the candy man

Don't stand close to the candy man
He'll leave a big candy stick in your hand
It's the candy man
It's the candy man

He sold some candy to sister Bad
The very next day she took all he had
It's the candy man
It's the candy man

If you try his candy, good friend of mine,
you sure will want it for a long long time
It's the candy man
It's the candy man

His stick candy don't melt away
It just gets better, so the ladies say
It's the candy man
It's the candy man
