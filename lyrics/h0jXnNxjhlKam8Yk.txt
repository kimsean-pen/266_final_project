Enthusiastic
Beyond belief
In a busy room
You are all I see
I fear this admiration
Will be the end of me
Blurring the lines between what I want
And what I need

Calm down
Calm down
Don't let her see
How fast your heart is beating
Calm down
Calm down
Control your breathing

If you don't want me
Well it's just a flook
I think about you but I know
I'm not good enough
I built you up to much
Now I can't say it
What's on my mind
In case I go and scare you away

Calm down
Calm down
Don't let her see
How fast your heart is beating
Calm down
Calm down
Control your breathing

Well the people you'll meet
Will have thoughts optimistic and sweet
And how could I compete
With the world at your feet

Would it be cruel be cruel be cruel
To let my eyes return to you
Would it be cruel be cruel be cruel
To give me thoughts my thoughts to you
Feelings for friends turn to hate
When I see what they are willing to throw away
Now I envy a fool who only negates
Anything with deeper meaning he tries to say
Would it be cruel be cruel be cruel
To let my eyes return to you
Would it be cruel be cruel be cruel
To give my thoughts my thoughts to you

I wouldn't want to hurt you
By letting you hurt me
You don't deserve to feel guilty
I'm an overly sensitive
Impatient little freak
you'd do better to turn your back on me
Why do I think these stupid thoughts
I want to fight my own advice
For I will only feel remorse
I just want you in my life
