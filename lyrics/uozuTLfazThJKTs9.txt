Make me dance, I want to surrender
Your familiar arms, I remember
We've been going transcontinental
Got no car, we just take a rental

But we don't have the money
(money makes the wheels and the world go round)
Forget about it, honey

Make me dance, I want to surrender
Your familiar arms, I remember
Everybody's talking about you
Every word's a whisper without you

But we don't have the money
(money makes the wheels and the world go round)
Forget about it, honey
Trouble's never far away when you're around

'Cos we don't have the money
(money makes the wheels and the world go round)
Forget about it, honey

I didn't see it coming
I'm just not in the running

Take me on a train 'cos I'm not flying
I can see the world from a different side
Read about us in the morning papers
When we make it
When we make it alive

I didn't see it coming
(Make me dance, I want to surrender)
I'm just not in the running
(Make me dance, I want to surrender)

And we don't need a lifetime
(Make me dance, I want to surrender)
We're following the right line
(Make me dance, I want to surrender)

And we don't need a lifetime
(Make me dance, I want to surrender)
We're following the right line
(Make me dance, I want to surrender)

I didn't see it coming
(Make me dance, I want to surrender)
I'm just not in the running
(Make me dance, I want to surrender)
