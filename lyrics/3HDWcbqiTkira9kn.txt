Are you gonna
Live your life wonderin'
Standing in the back
Lookin' around?
Are you gonna
Waste your time
Thinkin' how you've grown up
Or how you missed out?

Th-Th-Th-Things are never gonna
Be the way you want
Where's it gonna
Get you acting serious?

Th-Th-Th-Things are never gonna
Be quite what you want
Or even at 25
You gotta start sometime
I'm on my feet
I'm on the floor
I'm good to go
Now all I need is just

To hear a song I know
I wanna always feel like
Part of this was mine
I wanna fall in love tonight

Are you gonna
Live your life
Standing in the back
Looking around?
Are you gonna waste your time?
Gotta make a move
Or you'll miss out
Someone's gonna ask you

What it's all about
Stick around nostalgia
Won't let you down
Someone's gonna ask you
What it's all about
Whatcha gonna have
To say for yourself?
I'm on my feet
I'm on the floor
I'm good to go
Now all I need is just
To hear a song I know
I wanna always feel like
Part of this was mine
I wanna fall in love tonight
Crimson and clover
Over and over
Crimson and clover
Over and over
Our house in the
Middle of the street
Why did we ever meet?
Started my rock 'n roll fantasy
Don't don't, don't let's start
Why did we ever part?
Kick start my rock 'n rollen heart
I'm on my feet
I'm on the floor
I'm good to go
So come on Davey
Sing me somethin'
That I know
I wanna always feel like
Part of this was mine
I wanna fall in love tonight
Here tonight
I wanna fall in love tonight
Here tonight
I wanna always feel like
Part of this was mine
I wanna fall in love tonight
I wanna fall in love tonight
I wanna fall in love tonight
