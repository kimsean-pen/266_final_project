Destroy and cast away
Blue, translucent days
Relapse and ricochet
Everybody's waiting

Cautiously optimistic
It's infamy's [?]
Falsetto echolalia
Falling into mania
And it's bleak and incomplete
Every siren is on repeat
Get the hell out of the street

The persistence of monotony is blowing out the Sun
This swift precision's killing you, it's killing everyone

And it's bleak and incomplete
Every siren on repeat
Get the hell out of the street
