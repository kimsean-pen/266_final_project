Sky black and blue
Blue turn to red
There's quiet in the streets now
But it's screaming in your head

I ain't a fool
But I've got my doubts
Say it doesn't hurt
It doesn't matter anyhow, anyhow...

Saying, hey, you're just bleeding for nothing
It's hard to breathe when you're standing on your own
We'll kill ourself to find freedom
You'll kill yourself to find anything at all

So lock all the doors
And put your child to rest
it's quiet in the streets now
But it's crying in your head

We're passing the time
We're breaking apart
We're damned at the end
And we're damned at the start

Blame it on the roses
Blame it on the red
We're running out of time
And I'm running out of breath

Saying, hey now, we're bleeding for nothing
It's hard to breathe when you're standing on your own
We'll kill ourself to find freedom
You'll kill yourself to find anything

You say good-bye
Every day and night
With writing on the walls
Everybody's gonna need somebody
To take our troubles, and our worries, and our problems all away

'Cause, hey you're just bleeding for nothing
It's hard to breathe when you're standing on your own
We'll kill ourself to find freedom
You'll kill yourself to find anything at all

Hey now we're bleeding for nothing
It's hard to breathe when you're standing on your own
We'll kill ourselves to find freedom
You'll kill yourself to find anything

Hey now, hey now, hey now
We say goodbye, every day and night
We write it on the walls
Well, everybody's gonna need somebody
To take our troubles and our worries
And our problems all away

Hey now, hey now, hey now, right now...
Hey now, hey now, hey now, right now...
Hey now, hey now, hey now, right now...
Hey now, hey now, hey now
