My stupid mouth
has got me in trouble
i said too much again
to a date over dinner yesterday

and i could see
she was offended
she said "well anyway..."
just dying for a subject change

Oh, another social casualty
score one more for me

how could i forget?
mama said "think before speaking"
no filter in my head
oh, what's a boy to do
i guess he better find one soon

We bit our lips
she looked out the window
rolling tiny balls of napkin paper
i played a quick game of chess with the salt and pepper shaker

and i could see clearly
an indelible line was drawn
between what was good, what just slipped out and what went wrong
Oh, the way she feels about me has changed

thanks for playing, try again.
how could i forget?

mama said "think before speaking"
no filter in my head
oh, what's a boy to do
i guess he better find one
I'm never speaking up again

it only hurts me
i'd rather be a mystery
than she desert me
Oh i'm never speaking up again

starting now
One more thing
why is it my fault?

so maybe i try too hard
but it's all because of this desire
i just wanna be liked
i just wanna be funny

looks like the jokes on me
so call me captain backfire
I'm never speaking up again
It only hurts me
i'd rather be a mystery
than she desert me
Oh i'm never speaking up again
I'm never speaking up again
I'm never speaking up again
Starting now
Starting now
