The earth is burnin'
Can't feel my feet
Yeah come on'

The floor is sinking
Through holes in the street
Yeah come on

Your eyes have ferried
My nightmares to sleep
So come on

Tonight is stolen
And sharpened like teeth
Yeah come on

I'm a ghost, hesitating
I bite my tongue at your throne

Meet me here half way
Across elation
I get off this way
When I'm in love

Your eyes are poison
Your making me sweat
So come on

I keep a crucifix
Hung on my neck
Yeah come on

Back to the cradle
Your chasin' a rat
So come on

Don't activate that-
That Plan of attack
Yeah come on

I'm a ghost, salivating
I crave your soul, like my own

Meet me here half way
Across elation
I get off this way
When I'm in love

When you scream my name,
I feel I'm dying.
I get off this way,
when I'm in love.

I get off this way,
when I'm in love.
