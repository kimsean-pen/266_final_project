Going over in my head
What seems like everything
Remembering commitments
That nowadays just blend.

I don't know where I'm going
And I don't think that I care
I had my taste wound up misplaced
Bounced off those troubles clear.

Did I trip myself up again?
Did I see more than you did?
Did I trip myself up again?
Did I see more than you did?

Decisions made without reguard
Returning as regret
I knew they could but thought they would
Come crashing with success.

They know nothing about me
And I really doubt they care
But that's alright cause by myself
I do fine anywhere.

Did I trip myself up again?
Did I see more than you did?
Did I trip myself up again?
Did I see more than you did?

Seems like I shouldn't have pushed it
Hid myself and lost focus for a change
Shouldn't have made myself committed
Got to know that one by now
I'm better off without.
