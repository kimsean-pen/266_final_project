It came across like you were mad
Holding in your breath
with everything you had
Until you face began to turn red
This is why I turn and walk away from everything
I need to feel it closer now
This is why I turn and walk away from everything
and I never thought it would be like this

Between the seal a church is revealed
and I would rather be
lonely along the way
Something set us off into the wrong direction but within this particular space,
Time goes to waste.
Time goes to waste
Time goes to waste
Time goes

It came across like you were mad
Holding in your breath
with everything you had
Until you face began to turn red

Between the seal a church is revealed
and I would rather be
lonely along the way
Something set us off into the wrong direction but within this particular space,
And time starts to slow down and all of these patterns never change
So slow down, because nobody looks at life the same
And no one was like this 'til you came along and reset our dials wrong.

lonely along the way
Something set us off into the wrong direction but within this particular space,
Time goes to waste (lonely)
along the way
Something set us off into the wrong direction but within this particular space,
Time goes to waste.
