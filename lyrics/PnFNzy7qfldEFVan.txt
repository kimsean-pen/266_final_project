All your rockin' chair wisdom
Just keeps rockin' my system
I could sit here for hours
At your feet and just listen

You know we're young and I'm able
Looking for clues on your table
I got a head full of noise now
Come on, come on make a choice now

Oh yeah, I Need To Know
Need To Know, yes or no
Got an aching soul
Oh yeah, I Need To Know
Need To Know, yes or no
Oh my soul

Oh yeah, I Need To Know
Need To Know, yes or no
Got an aching soul
Oh yeah, I Need To Know
Need To Know, yes or no
Oh my soul

On a sleepless corner
I see a speeding train
Ride out through the city
And right out of my brain

So many places I've never been
And every one of them calls
If I walk I'm with you now
A brand new rains gonna fall

Oh yeah, I Need To Know
Need To Know, yes or no
Got an aching soul
Oh yeah, I Need To Know
Need To Know, yes or no
Oh my soul

Oh yeah, I Need To Know
Need To Know, yes or no
Got an aching soul
Oh yeah, I Need To Know
Need To Know, yes or no
Oh my soul

I've been told whats new and old
I've heard yes, and I've heard no
And if you can't make up your mind
I'm gonna find someone who can

Oh yeah, I Need To Know
Need To Know, yes or no
Got an aching soul
Oh yeah, I Need To Know
Need To Know, yes or no
Oh my soul

Oh yeah, I Need To Know
Need To Know, yes or no
Got an aching soul
Oh yeah, I Need To Know
Need To Know, yes or no
Oh my soul
