I've been thinking 'bout you all day, baby
Waiting on that sun to go down
Whatcha say I pick you up after work
Slide over, we slip out to the outskirts of town

I got a blanket and a fifth of Comfort
A little something to knock off the edge
It's supposed to get a little cool tonight
Looks like I'm going to have to hold you tight, yeah

About a mile off Old Mill Road
In that spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up, girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby, let's go listen to the night train

Yeah, I hope it's gonna be a long one
And if we're lucky, it's moving slow
I wouldn't mind if it lasted all night
Lying next to you on that hillside
Let's go

About a mile off Old Mill Road
In that spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up, girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby, let's go listen to the night train

Let's go listen to the night train

About a mile off Old Mill Road
That spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up, girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars

Come on baby, let's go listen to the night train

Let's go listen to the night train
