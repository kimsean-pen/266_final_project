If I were brave enough to
Ask you to stay
Would that scar upon your lip
Move and come my way

Watch your eyes change from
Blue and back to green
Something deep inside of me is
Telling me to leave
Cause I don't want to have to let you go

Let this part of me
Remember how lovely we are, we are

If you saw in my mind
How I felt
You would hold me tight
And ask nothing else

I want you but I hate to say those words
But here I am

Standing right in front of you
Asking for a hand
Cause I don't want to have to let you go

Let this part of me
Remember how lovely we were, we were, we were, we were

If I don't get out
If I don't get out
If I don't get out
I have to leave somehow
But I'll never leave this town

Help me with all this
Help me with all this
Help me with all this
Help me

You said you would be waiting
You said you would be waiting
You said you would be waiting
You said you would be waiting
