Front door's locked, locked up tight
Tried to get in with all my might

Goin' in the backdoor
Gettin' in no matter what
Goin' in the backdoor
Little bit muddy but it sure ain't shut

Shops closed up for service today
But I'm coming in no matter what they say

Goin' in the backdoor
Gonna be a tight squeeze
It's the daddy Mac door
Gonna bring that witchy woman to her knees, yeah
Oh baby to your knees, uh

Sometimes, the backdoor is the only way in
Sometimes, the backdoor is the only way in
But you have to get in for the love to begin

Backdoors never got a welcome mat
But that never stops me 'cause I'm a gutter rat

Goin' in the backdoor
Gonna make a lot of noise
Gonna pay it forward
When I leave the door open for the rest of the boys
The rest of my boys

Hey Satchel! Stix! Lexxi!
Come get a piece of this man!
Hehey! Ooooh! Ah I love it man
Hey baby, you mind if I dip my nuts in your chocolate?
Haha!
