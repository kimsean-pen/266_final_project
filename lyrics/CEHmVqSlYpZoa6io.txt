Walk of life
Walk of life

Let me care for someone else
I don't wanna talk about myself
I need to shed the light on you
To understand the things you do

Could we share a little time?
Break the bread and sip the wine
Now's no time to hesitate
Save me from this heavy weight

Are you gonna walk the walk of life with me?
Are you gonna see more than you dreamed you'd see?
Are you gonna walk hand in hand with me?
Can you be the one who sets my shadow free?

Are you gonna try and understand with me?
Are you gonna be the best that you could be?
Are you gonna walk the walk of life with me?

Walk of life
Walk of life

Losing my reality
You could bring this back to me
With you I wanna spend my youth
With you I wanna live the truth

Could we pass a golden hour?
Sow the seed and grow the flower
Reap reward and clear our sins
This is where our life begins

Are you gonna walk the walk of life with me?
Are you gonna see more than you dreamed you'd see?
Are you gonna walk hand in hand with me?
Can you be the one who sets my shadow free?

Are you gonna try and understand with me
Are you gonna be the best that you could be
Are you gonna walk the walk of life with me?

Don't let me walk alone
Now that I have touched my home
There'll always be a place for you
A time, a perfect space for you

You can rest your tired mind
My body's temple, you will find

Walk the walk of life with me
See more than you dreamed you'd see
Walk the walk of life with me
Yeah, yeah

Are you gonna walk the walk of life with me?
Are you gonna see more than you dreamed you'd see?
Are you gonna walk hand in hand with me?
Can you be the one who sets my shadow free?

Are you gonna try and understand with me
Are you gonna be the best that you can be
Are you gonna walk the walk of life with me?

Are you gonna walk the walk of life with me?
See more than you ever dreamed you'd see
Be the one to set my shadow free

Are you gonna walk the walk of life with me?
Be more than all the best to me
Are you gonna walk the walk of life with me?

Are you gonna walk the walk of life with me?
See more than you ever dreamed you'd see
Be the one to set my shadow free

Are you gonna walk the walk of life with me?
Be more than all the best to me
Are you gonna walk the walk of life with me?

Are you gonna walk the walk of life with me?
Be more than all the best to me
Are you gonna walk the walk of love with me?
