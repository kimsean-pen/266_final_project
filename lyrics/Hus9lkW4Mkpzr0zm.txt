All my lovers surround me
Like virgins clean today
Waist deep in the water
Pushing my body away

Oh, what lengths we go
To put the past away!
Oh, how many drops can you squeeze out to explain
What happened one day?

Here one of them stayed behind
And trailed me from afar
I saw her eyes lit up
Like colors in the dark

But when our gazes met
I was half a world away
It still shortens my breath
As I turn to say

When we meet another way
You won't recognize my face
When we meet one way or another
You won't, you won't speak up, speak up, speak up

When we meet one way
You won't recognize my face
When we meet one way or another
You won't, you won't speak up, speak up, speak up

And one day it soothes me
The next it bleeds me dry
It plays out like a lifetime
Before the morning light

How beautiful it was to be anything at all
But somehow it strikes me
That time can't beat all

When we meet another way
You won't recognize my face
When we meet one way or another
You won't, you won't speak up, speak up, speak up
When we meet one way
You won't recognize my face
When we meet one way or another
You won't, you won't speak up, speak up, speak up
You won't speak up, speak up
You won't speak up, speak up
You won't speak up, speak up
