No handouts
No thanks
No strength to burn my bridges
Sentenced life in hell

I've been ashamed all my life
But I have never felt like this
I put myself in my grave
And the dirt is spilling in

I need answers to the questions
That I've never had the words to ask
To embarrassed to ask for help
But to slow to run from my past

So I'm left with the pain I feel
Sentenced a life in hell

So you may see me
I may look different
The stress has weighed on my bones
And I can't fix it

Time has passed
I still feel the same
No handouts
No thanks

No strength to burn my bridges down
Down
