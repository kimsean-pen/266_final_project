Dawn is a feeling
A beautiful ceiling
The smell of grass just makes you pass into a dream

You're here today
No future fears
This day will last
A thousand years
If you want it to

You look around you
Things they astound you
So breathe in deep
You're not asleep
Open your mind

You're here today
No future fears
This day will last
A thousand years
If you want it to

Do you understand that all over this land there's a feeling?
In minds far and near things are becoming clear with a meaning

Now that you're knowing
Pleasure starts flowing
It's true life flies faster than eyes could ever see

You're here today
No future fears
This day will last
A thousand years
If you want it to
