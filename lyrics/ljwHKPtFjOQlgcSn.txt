Lost in the burning sun
Lost in a void so black
Forsaken by destiny
Amidst this empty night
IN THE TEMPLE OF MY DISEASE, I SPILL BLOOD TO FIND MY BLISS
I wander through the fields of pain
I live for my endless disdain

Torment - Is it a blessing or a curse?

In the eye of blasphemy
Where the essence speaks to me
Can your hear silence stare?
Can you see riverbeds rise?
A place where the essence dwells
Elusive and hard to trace

Torment - Is it a blessing or a curse?

I retreat into my disease
Thousand ways to erase this life
Never find salvation from Hate
I will show you what it is...
A wound hard to heal!

When the seas turn into blood
Every word of mine comes true
In the name of the antichrist
My end will be fall of man

Torment - Is it a blessing or a curse?
I retreat into my disease
Thousand ways to erase this life
Never find salvation from Hate
I will show you what it is...
A wound hard to heal!

The soul exile immune to pain
Get the gun! Get the knife! Cleanse this waste!
A sequence of stabs, a sequence of shots thrills the air
In the silence's stare sadness will last, last forever!
