We were kids, we played with matches
Well we grew up, we started bands
Yeah, we skipped school, but played the dances
And when we started making fans
We blew off college, toured the country in a van
And sometimes at the grocery store,
The people say they knew me back when

We were teenage rockstars
Made our hometown proud
When we were teenage rockstars
We taught ourselves to play
And we played loud

We signed a deal and made some records
Sold out shows and married young
The money came, we started fighting
We partied hard, and had our fun

We blew off deadlines, and forgot to call our friends
And sometimes at the shopping mall,
The people say they knew me back when

We were teenage rockstars
Made our fathers proud
When we were teenage rockstars
We taught ourselves to play, and we played loud

Ooh la la laa la la
La la laa la la...

And now I sit at this piano
I watch my daughter in the yard
I think about those days in high school
My best friend playing his guitar

In my parents' living room, where all of this began
And when I leave the shows these days
The people say they knew me back when

We were teenage rockstars
So young and so strong out
When we were teenage rockstars
We taught ourselves to play, we took the stage
And we played loud

Ooh la la laa la la, la la laa la la
Ooh la la la la
Ooh la la laa la la, la la laa la la
Ooh la la la ooh la ooh
