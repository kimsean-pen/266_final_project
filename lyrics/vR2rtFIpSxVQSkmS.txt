And we can't control this honeymoon phase
But that's when my heart said baby
And I know if you left I'd be okay
But I don't wanna be okay
I wanna be crazy

Sippin' on a Lexus
Looking at our pictures
I should've never kissed her
That's what he said when he missed her

And I don't wanna be there
No we can never be there
Hopelessly stuck to you baby
I'm the honey in your bee trap

And I won't budge if you don't stay
Ya I would be the same bitch baby
'Cause I'm not perfect any day
Hopelessly stuck to you baby
I'm the honey in your bee trap

And we can't control this honeymoon phase
But that's when my heart said baby
And I know if you left I'd be okay
But I don't wanna be okay
I wanna be crazy

And we can't control this honeymoon phase
But that's when my heart said baby
And I know if you left I'd be okay
But I don't wanna be okay
I wanna be crazy
