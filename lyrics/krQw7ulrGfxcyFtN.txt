Faced with such stern symmetry
Weathered skin turn burgundy
The most handsome man you ever saw

That smirk like sour razor jaw
Hold your rose and see the fingers starting to bend
We can move
We can't miss out, no
Before we are gone
You meant the most
I said it all now

Faced with soft tendency
Saved a man withdrawn like me
Love you more and I'm on my way home
Forgot everything I'll ever know

Hold your rose in bitter red buried him like a fact
We can move
We can't miss out, no
Before we're gone
You meant the most
I say it all now

Pure as they come
I was after the same light you drew
It's been too much
And I could never say aloud
That's enough

Mercy now, Mercy now, Blood
Mercy now, Mercy now, Blood
Mercy now, Mercy now, Blood
Mercy now, Mercy now, Blood
Mercy now, Mercy now, Blood
Mercy now, Mercy now, Blood
