I'd like to be somebody else and not know where I've been
I'd like to build myself a house out of plasticine
Ah, shake along with me
Ah, shake along with me

I've been driving in my car with my friend Mr. Soft
Mr. Clean and Mr. Ben are living in my loft
Ah, shake along with me
Ah, shake along with me

I'm sorry but I just don't know
I know you said I told you so
But when you're happy and you're feeling fine
Then you'll know it's the right time
Then you'll know it's the right time
To shake along with me
Shake along with me
Shake along with me
Shake along with me

Mr. Sifter sold me songs when I was just sixteen
Now he stops at traffic lights, but only when they're green
Ah, shake along with me
Ah, shake along with me
Ah, shake along with me
Ah, shake along with me
Shake along with me
Shake along with me
Shake along with me
Shake along with Gem
Shake along with me
Shake along with Gem
Shake along with me
