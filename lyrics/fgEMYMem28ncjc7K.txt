Moses
Can you carry
Heavy
Cause i can't
Take it
Can't hold on
Much longer

Moses
Can you
Help me
Carry the burden

Moses
Lift my arms cause i can't
Hold on and carry
All the weight

Can you
Guide me
Cause you're so strong
Cause i can't see nothing at all
Cause my eyes are burning like the sun
Burning like the sun
Burning like the sun

Moses
Moses can you
Guide me o teacher
Show me the way we'll make it
Hold on o Moses
Can you guide me
Cause you're so strong
Cause i can't see nothing at all
Cause my eyes are
Burning like the sun
Burning like the sun
Burning like sun
Burning like the sun, like the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun
