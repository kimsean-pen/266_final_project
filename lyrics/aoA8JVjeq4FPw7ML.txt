Your face, my face
You breathe, I breathe
You fail, I fake
I pray, I pray
You lose, I lose
You bruise, I bruise
I hunt, you stay
My prey, my prey

My masquerade (my masquerade)
My masquerade (my masquerade)
If you're not afraid (if you're not afraid)
To take a step into my realm
My masquerade (my masquerade)
My masquerade (my masquerade)
If you're not afraid (if you're not afraid)
To take a step into my realm
My masquerade

A ball, tonight
Cover your eyes
By touch and taste
We'll find our way
Your secrets deep
Yes I will keep
I hunt, you stay
My prey, my prey

My masquerade (my masquerade)
My masquerade (my masquerade)
If you're not afraid (if you're not afraid)
To take a step into my realm
My masquerade (my masquerade)
My masquerade (my masquerade)
If you're not afraid (if you're not afraid)
To take a step into my realm
My masquerade

Take of your mask
And you will see
The freak in you
The freak in me
Tonight we hide
From judging eyes

Take of your mask
And you will see
The freak in you
The freak in me
Tonight we hide
From judging eyes
We'll dance until the sunrise

My prey, my prey

My masquerade (my masquerade)
My masquerade (my masquerade)
If you're not afraid (if you're not afraid)
To take a step into my realm
My masquerade (my masquerade)
My masquerade (my masquerade)
If you're not afraid (if you're not afraid)
To take a step into my realm
My masquerade
