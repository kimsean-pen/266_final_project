I want you to want me
For all that I am
I hope that you will try to understand
Do you feel the same
Do you feel the same

I want you to want me
For all that I am
And I'll never leave you behind
I want you to be by my side
You're always on my mind
Baby am I the only

We've got to stop this game
Tell me do you feel the same

I want you to want me
For all that I am
I hope that you will try to understand
Do you feel the same
Do you feel the same

Now take a good look
What you see is for real
You know I've got nothing to hide
The way that I am is the way
that I feel for you now
Baby am I the only

We've got to stop this game
Tell me do you feel the same

I want you to want me
For all that I am
I hope that you will try to understand
Do you feel the same
Do you feel the same

Everybody knows that I need you
There ain't nothing in the world I wouldn't do

Tell me now
Am I the only baby

Everybody knows that I need you
There ain't nothing in the world I wouldn't do

Please understand
This is what I am

Do ya do ya baby

I want you to want me
For all that I am
I hope that you will try to understand
Do you feel the same
Do you feel the same

Am I the only

I want you to want me
For all that I am
I hope that you will try to understand
Do you feel the same
Do you feel the same

And do you feel the same
