My hair down, head back
Move slow, slowly over
Watching you, you like that
The way I move a little closer
We don't talk much, barely speak
Caught my attention so easily
I try to stare less obviously
Roll my eyes, take a minute, make a move then breathe

Take a minute, make a move then breathe
No one around, it's just you and me
Take a minute, make a move then breathe
You try to make it easy for me
Take a minute, make a move then breathe
No one around, it's just you and me
Take a minute, make a move then breathe
You try to make it easy for me

You try to make it easy for me
You try to make it easy for me

Take a minute, make a move then breathe
No one around, it's just you and me
Take a minute, make a move then breathe
You try to make it easy for me
Take a minute, make a move then breathe
No one around, it's just you and me
Take a minute, make a move then breathe
You try to make it easy for me

Warm skin, your touch
Pulls me in and holds me speechless
Too much is not enough
Little more so I can think less
We don't talk much, barely speak
Caught my attention so easily
I try to stare less obviously
Roll my eyes, take a minute, make a move then breathe

Take a minute, make a move then breathe
No one around, it's just you and me
Take a minute, make a move then breathe
You try to make it easy for me
Take a minute, make a move then breathe
No one around, it's just you and me
Take a minute, make a move then breathe
You try to make it easy for me

You try to make it easy for me
You try to make it easy for me

Take a minute, make a move then breathe
No one around, it's just you and me
Take a minute, make a move then breathe
You try to make it easy for me
Take a minute, make a move then breathe
No one around, it's just you and me
Take a minute, make a move then breathe
You try to make it easy for me

You try to make it easy for me
You try to make it easy for me
