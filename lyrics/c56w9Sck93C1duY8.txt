I'm going it alone
Did my time and now I'm done
It's so easy

All the faces that I see don't mean anything at all to me
But you got me going now out of my mind
And it's all a hell of a time

I don't wanna say what I don't mean
But I'm trying just to let you know
That I don't wanna cause a scene
But I'm sorry girl it's time for you to go

I'll tell you everything that you know you never wanna hear
Cause it's true
I'd give you all I got but there's nothing there that you could use
But you got me going now out of my mind
And it's all a hell of a time with you know

I don't wanna say what I don't mean
But I'm trying just to let you know
That I don't wanna cause a scene
But I'm sorry girl it's time for you to go

I don't wanna say what I don't mean
But I'm trying just to let you know
That I don't wanna cause a scene
But I'm sorry girl it's time for you to go

I'll tell you anything that you know you never wanna hear
Cause it's true
I'd give you all I got but I'm the only thing you use
So you got me going now

I don't wanna say what I don't mean
But I'm trying just to let you know
That I don't wanna cause a scene
But I'm sorry girl it's time for you to go

I don't wanna say what I don't mean
But I'm trying just to let you know
That I don't wanna cause a scene
But I'm sorry girl it's time for you to go.
