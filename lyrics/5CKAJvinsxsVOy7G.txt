No way to turn back clocks stuck in real time
Appraising my life's worth I'll wait a life time
Play back all my mistakes in real time
Shuffling through memories these are not mine
These are not mine
These are not mine
These are not mine look away
Hurting cause of nothing they say
I picked myself up
So this is love this is enough
You should know me best
Held you close ignored the rest
Held your heart to my chest
And kept it safe within this mess
