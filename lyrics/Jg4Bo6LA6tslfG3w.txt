I see you swimming there again
I'm waiting for you in the sand
Will we ever escape again?
Ooh Is it all
Is it all
Is it all
Is it all good?

Do we still have to pretend?
Should we wait until they understand?
I always miss you do you feel the same
Ooh Is it all
Is it all
Is it all
Is it all good?

Away, away, do you know?
Away, we could go
Away, away, do you know?
Away, we could go

You launch inside of me a desire
You understand me, like I understand you
I don't wanna wake up and realize that it's over
You understand me, like I understand you

I see you swimming there again
I'm waiting for you in the sand
Will we ever escape again?
Ooh is it all
Is it all
Is it all
Is it all good?

Away, away, do you know?
Away, we could go
Away, away, do you know?
Away, we could go

You launch inside of me a desire
You understand me, like I understand you
I don't wanna wake up and realize that it's over
You understand me, like I understand you
