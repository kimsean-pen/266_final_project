Underneath a setting sun
Something wicked your way comes
Who am I? Just a dream
Sent to take you, shake you, make you scream

Try to see - there - behind my eyes
Be in me - ah - you're hypnotized
Such a moon - rare - we shouldn't waste
Very soon - ah - I'll have a taste

Should I let you awaken?
I can't resist!
Look around you
You're forsaken

You scream
But there's nobody to hear
It doesn't matter
It's only you and me and all of your fears
So scream
A Halloween serenade
Illusions shattered
Wait 'till you're really afraid
You're gonna - ah - ah!

Run and hide - please - from my embrace
In the night - ah - I love a chase
Tell me no - tease - before we kiss
Nice and slow - ah - I live for this

Should I let you remember?
I can't resist!
Gonna haunt you forever

You scream
But there's nobody to hear
It doesn't matter
It's only you and me and all of your fears
So scream
A Halloween serenade
Illusions shattered
Wait 'till you're really afraid
You're gonna - ah - ah!

Underneath the setting sun
Something wicked your way comes
Who am I? Just a dream
Sent to take you, shake you, make you scream

Try to see - deep - behind my eyes
Destiny - ah - won't be denied
Don't you know - sweet - you're what I need
Flesh and bone - ah - you're gonna bleed

Should I let you awaken?
I can't resist!
Look around you
You're forsaken

You scream
But there's nobody to hear
It doesn't matter
It's only you and me and all of your fears
So scream
A Halloween serenade
Illusions shattered
Wait 'till you're really afraid
You're gonna - ah - ah!

You scream
But there's nobody to hear
It doesn't matter
It's only you and me and all of your fears
So scream
A Halloween serenade
Illusions shattered
Wait 'till you're really afraid
You're gonna - ah - ah!
