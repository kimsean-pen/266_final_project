I don't mind the pain, or the joker's cold refrain
The days pass by so slowly, I count them all again
Silence of a basement, shades all closed at noon (loser gone wild)
Lie awake for fear of strangers.

Darkness comes on slowly, twilight is the ecstasy
Like a candle burning bright, shadows dance until the night
Empty rooms and chilling smiles, ooh (loser gone wild)
They go on for miles and miles...

But in the evening when the sun goes down
Crawl from the shadows, got to get into town
Where the music is playin' all across the night
And every cloud disappears from sight

There goes a loser (loser), another loser gone
There goes another (loser), another who's alone
There goes a loser (loser), another loser gone wild.

I don't mind if violins don't play
I won't listen to them anyway
I don't care what people say (loser gone wild)
Some things just can't be arranged.

But in the evening when the sun goes down
Crawl from the shadows, got to get into town
Where the music is playin' all across the night

There goes a loser (loser), another loser gone
There goes another (loser), another who's alone
There goes a loser (loser), another loser gone wild.

But in the evening when the sun goes down
Crawl from the shadows, got to get into town
Where the music is playin' all across the night
And every cloud disappears from sight

There goes a loser (loser), another loser gone
There goes another (loser), another who's alone
There goes a loser (loser), another loser gone wild.

Icy fingers touching you
Silent voices calling too
What else is there to lose (loser gone wild)?
I am here, but where are you?

(But in the evening when the sun goes down
Crawl from the shadows, got to get into town...)

(There goes a loser)

Loser...
