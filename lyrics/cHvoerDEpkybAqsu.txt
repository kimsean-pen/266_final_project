Becoming a resistance, ignition coil tightening
Elevating tension, reached the point of fragmententing

As I turn to dust in the atmosphere
Floating from gravity
I set off like a trigger pulse
Shattering into space
Trigger pulse

Elemental patterns, woven too deep to remove
Convoluted fabric, this body's hardly bullet proof

As I turn to dust in the atmosphere
Floating from gravity
I set off like a trigger pulse
Shattering into space

Rise! Rise against the pulse
Rise! Triggered no more
Colour me encouraged!

As I turn to dust in the atmosphere
Floating from gravity
I set off like a trigger pulse
Shattering into space
