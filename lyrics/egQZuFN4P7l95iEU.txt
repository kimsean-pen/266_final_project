I met you
Before the fall of Rome
And I begged you
To let me take you home
You were wrong
I was right
You said, goodbye
I said, good night
It's all been done
It's all been done
It's all been done, done before
I knew you
Before the west was won
And I heard you say
The past was much more fun
You go your way
I'll go mine
That I'll see you
Next time
It's all been done
It's all been done
It's all been done, done, done before
If I put my fingers here
And if I say, I love you dear
And if I play the same three chords
Will you just yawn and say
It's all been done
It's all been done
It's all been done before

Alone and bored
On a thirtieth century night
Will I see you
On the Price is Right
Will I cry
Will I smile
As you run
Down the aisle
It's all been done
It's all been done
It's all been done, done before
It's all been done
It's all been done
It's all been done
It's all been done
It's all been done
It's all been done, before
