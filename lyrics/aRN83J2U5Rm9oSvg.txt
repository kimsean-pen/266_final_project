It's alright to fear the worm.

[It's all right to fear the worm. The worm, the worm is our friend.
Um, but not all of the properties of the worm can be, uh, fully, fully,
well, appreciated by the, uh, the human body itself, but, um it's,
it's, it's, it's ok to, to fear the worm. Um, I, myself, have had no,
uh, problems with the worm but in a certain situation, uh, I would
feel like, what, what, uh, ramifications, um, could occur? Uh, there's,
there's really no need to, uh, to fear much of anything, you know.
Fear of the, fear of the temptation is a, more, probably, more, more,
appropriate word in this particular scenario. Um, the, uh, well, It,
depends on what you want, I suppose. It really depends on, on
what you want.]
