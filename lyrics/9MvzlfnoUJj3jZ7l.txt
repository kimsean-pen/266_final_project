I don't want to see your smile
I want you in the morning
Before you go performing
Tell me something I don't know
And lead me to the place where no one ever goes
Let me go under your skin
And let me find the demon that drives those heavenly limbs

You know you're beautiful
But that ain't half the gold treasure in your soul that you got
'Cause I want it all
With your fingers in my mouth, the fantasy of us
So please, don't let me fall
So please, don't let me fall

I think we'd survive in the wild
And we'd make plants and roots and dream about electric fans
Baby, could you kill a man?
Could you look in his eyes and feel the fire drain out of his hands?
Baby, do think about the past?
Do you wonder if every stupid little thing has led us to this?

You know you're beautiful
But that ain't half the gold treasure in your soul that you got
'Cause I want it all
With your fingers in my mouth, the fantasy of us
So please, don't let me fall
So please, don't let me fall

You know you're beautiful
But that ain't half the gold treasure in your soul that you got
'Cause I want it all
With your fingers in my mouth, the fantasy of us
So please, don't let me fall
So please, don't let me fall

(Don't let me fall)
(Don't let me fall)
(Don't let me fall)
(Don't let me fall)
(Don't let me fall)
