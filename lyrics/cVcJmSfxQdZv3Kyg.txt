It could be a fast car, flying down a dirt road
It could be a slow song, playing on the radio
It could be a picture of a place you love
Or some memory that you hold
It doesn't matter what it is
If it gets you where you wanna go

It could be a jet plane, flying through the blue sky
It could be a weekend, walking on the wild side
It could be a candlelight with emerald eyes
Or a single red rose
It doesn't matter what it is
If it gets you where you wanna go

If you wanna go back, if you wanna move on
If you wanna get lost, if you wanna go home
If there's a will then there's a way to get there
If you wanna stay close, if you wanna go far
Go on ahead and follow your heart
One thing I know is we're all going somewhere

It could be a cold beer, talking to an old friend
It could be your mama's house, and how it hasn't change one bit
It could be a silent prayer to the man upstairs
That lightens up your soul
It doesn't matter what it is
If it gets you where you wanna go

If you wanna go back, if you wanna move on
If you wanna get lost, if you wanna go home
If there's a will then there's a way to get there
If you wanna stay close, if you wanna go far
Go on ahead and follow your heart
One thing I know is we're all going somewhere

You're on the right road
If it gets you where you wanna go
Yeah you're on the right road
If it gets you where you wanna go
