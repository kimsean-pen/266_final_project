There's no escape on the spell you have placed
Leaving my heart and my mind
Foolish am I if I was to try
To ever leave you behind

(Chorus)
I wanna rock wit u
(Come give me all your love)
No matter what we do
(I wanna rock wit u)
With you and only you
(I wanna rock wit u)
I wanna rock wit u
(Rock wit u babe)

I'll stay and walk this life with you
No matter what we may go through
Dead broke, no job, no house, no ride
I'm gonna stay right by your side

Chorus

Don't question where
you're headed to my love
Don't be afraid,
just believe in love

I wanna rock wit u
No matter what we do
With you and only you
I wanna rock wit u

Chorus x2

Do your thing, do your thing
Do your thing, do your thing
(fade out)
