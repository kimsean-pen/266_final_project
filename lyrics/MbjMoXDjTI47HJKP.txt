This ain't gon' be easy
You got it? You got it?
Put it in

Tables turnin' to a situation
Now you standin' in my face and you been patiently waitin'
I'm rollin' over words, forget the conversation
Thinkin' maybe we can make a combination

Wanna see me lose my breath and wanna hear me moan
Better be ready, we'll enable when we get alone
You was talkin' confident upon the telephone
So you gotta put it in when we get it on

No turnin' back from this party
Put you through enough to complain
Ain't no comin' down from this side
My love, don't go nowhere the sunset

Look at what you got yourself into
Best take advantage, be all that you can be
Best take advantage, see all that you can see
'Cause this could be your last opportunity to move me

(Put it in)
Check it, baby, get it, baby, check it, baby, get it
(Work)
Do it, baby, do it, do it, baby, get it

(Put it in)
Check it, baby, get it, baby, check it, baby, get it
(Work)
Do it, baby, do it, do it, baby, get it

(Go on)
Check it, baby, get it, baby, check it, baby, get it
(Work)
Do it, baby, do it, do it, baby, get it

Don't come around if you gon' let me down
You gotta get it all the way in
I wanna see you work

Now you lookin' like you're lookin' for an explanation
Use the curves in my body for your motivation
Skip the petty games, no need for complication
Useful things for sure, I reach my destination

Better leave a good impression 'fore you hit the door
'Cause you don't want me talkin' 'bout your business on the low?
If you show it off, I had to fit you in my schedule
So you better put it on, but when it's time to go

No turnin' back from this party
Put you through enough to complain
Ain't no comin' down from this side
My love, don't go nowhere the sunset

Look at what you got yourself into
Best take advantage, be all that you can be
Best take advantage, see all that you can see
'Cause this could be your last opportunity to move me

(Put it in)
Check it, baby, get it, baby, check it, baby, get it
(Work)
Do it, baby, do it, do it, baby, get it

(Put it in)
Check it, baby, get it, baby, check it, baby, get it
(Work)
Do it, baby, do it, do it, baby, get it

(Go on)
Check it, baby, get it, baby, check it, baby, get it
(Work)
Do it, baby, do it, do it, baby, get it

Don't come around if you gon' let me down
You gotta get it all the way in
I wanna see you work

I ain't acceptin' no excuses, baby
To brag about it, it'd be useless, baby
You better blow me away
Make a girl wanna stay
At your spot, go another round

Here's your chance to prove
Don't forget your move
There's nothing to lose for me

(Put it in)
Check it, baby, get it, baby, check it, baby, get it
(Work)
Do it, baby, do it, do it, baby, get it

(Put it in)
Check it, baby, get it, baby, check it, baby, get it
(Work)
Do it, baby, do it, do it, baby, get it

(Go on)
Check it, baby, get it, baby, check it, baby, get it
(Work)
Do it, baby, do it, do it, baby, get it

Don't come around if you gon' let me down
You gotta get it all the way in
I wanna see you work (work, work, work...)
