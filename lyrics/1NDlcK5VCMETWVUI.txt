Do you like the dark?
Do you like the way it moves?
Do you come alive when neon kills the sun?
Are you hypnotised?
Part of the illusion
Oh see how they run

It's the mystery
Poetry and passion
Innocence and fashion
Revolution, evolution ways

Night people

Are you satisfied
With the lessons that you're learning?
Is the fire really burning?
Do you know?
Hey, dream child

Promises are spoken
And promises are broken
Electric eyes that never let you
See them in the day

Night people
Night people

Do you like the dark?
Do you like the way it moves?
Do you come alive when neon kills the sunshine?

Are you hypnotised?
Innocence and fashion
Promises and passion
Evolution, revolution ways
And everybody stays

Night people
Night people, yeah

Do you like the dark?
Do you like the way it moves?
Are you hypnotised?
Paralysed
Revolution
Hey, dream child
You got electric eyes
Hey, dream child
Night people
Night, night people
