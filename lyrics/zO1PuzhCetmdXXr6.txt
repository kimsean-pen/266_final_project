I, am a little tin soldier
that wants to jump into your fire
you are a look in your eye
a dream passing by in the sky
But I don't understand
And all I need, is treat me like a man
'cause I ain't no child
take me like I am
I got to know that I belong to you
I do anything that you want to do
I'll sing any so song that you want me to sing to you

I don't need no aggravation
I just got to make you
Got, I said listen, i just got to make you, yes, my occupation
I got to know that I belong to you
I'd do anything that you want to do
