And it's no fun when I'm freaking out
And it's no fun when I'm always down
And it's no fun what I'm putting inside of me is making me crazier

And it's no fun when I'm always alone
And it's no fun when I'm always at home
And it's no fun when you're laughing at me, always laughing at me

You gotta keep me away from what they say about me
You gotta keep me away from what they say about me, say about me
'Cause I want to be a better girl

And it's no fun when I'm staying up late
And it's no fun when you're breaking the date
And it's no fun what I'm putting inside of me is making me crazier

And it's no fun when I'm always alone
And it's no fun when I'm always at home
And it's no fun when you're sitting without me, always sitting without me

You gotta keep me away from what they say about me
You gotta keep me away from what they say about me, say about me
'Cause I want to be a better girl
Yeah I want to be a better girl, a better girl
A better girl, a better girl
A better girl, a better girl
A better girl, a better girl
