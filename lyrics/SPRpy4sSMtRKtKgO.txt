Light, burning in your eyes, telling all your lies
Leading me to Hell, and I just hope and pray
That I'll be there some day, I'm going all the way

If Heaven is Hell
You'll never get me down
If Heaven is Hell
You'll never get me down

Run, fighting to the end, just what did we learn?
Will we burn away? Is this what you want?
It's too late to change, stare it in the face

If Heaven is Hell
You'll never get me down
If Heaven is Hell
You'll never get me down

If Heaven is Hell
You'll never get me down
If Heaven is Hell
You'll never get me down

If Heaven is Hell
You'll never get me down
If Heaven is Hell
You'll never get me down

Don't, don't turn it away, we fought it so hard
Now we can't, turn it away

If Heaven is Hell
You'll never get me down
If Heaven is Hell
You'll never get me down

If Heaven is Hell
You'll never get me down
If Heaven is Hell
You'll never get me down
