Doomsday, I am not prepared to go
It's no way I' going
I'm never gonna show

Some say it gets better after this
Waiting for a better life
I'm waiting to get this

What you see is what you get with me
What you see is what you get with me
What you see is what you get with me
What you see is what you get

I'll take you to places where you've never seen
I'll take you to a world where you've been inside dreaming
If you wanna go, I will take you to the top
Leave it off cause it never gonna stop

We live and in the meantime
We reach for the sky
We hold our heads high
We hold our heads

We live and in the meantime
We reach for the sky
We hold our heads high
We hold our heads

What you, what you got to say to me?
The dead won't be alive
But dead will always be

So here is, here is everything you need
But at the time you realize
I'll be shakin' it all and erase

What you see is what you get with me
What you see is what you get with me
What you see is what you get with me
What you see is what you get

What you see is what you get with me
What you see is what you get with me
What you see is what you get with me
What you see is what you get

I'll take you to places where you've never seen
I'll take you to a world where you've been inside dreaming
If you wanna go, I will take you to the top
Leave it off cause it never gonna stop
It never gonna stop, never gonna stop, never gonna stop

We live and in the meantime
We reach for the sky
We hold our heads high
We hold our heads

We live and in the meantime
We reach for the sky
We hold our heads high
We hold our heads

What you see is what you get with me
What you see is what you get with me
What you see is what you get with me
What you see is what you get

What you see is what you get with me
What you see is what you get with me
What you see is what you get with me
What you see is what you get
