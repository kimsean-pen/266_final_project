I've got a hole in my sock
I've got a stain on my shirt
I've got a scar on my knuckle
From where I got burnt

There's a hair on my chin
And ink on my face
And bruises on both of my knees

Broken doll, broken doll, broken doll
Broken doll, broken doll, broken doll

There's mud on the rug
And a ring around the tub
Calcification and dust on the TV
There's a lump in my chest
And a spider
And crumbs between the computer keys

Broken doll, broken doll, broken doll
Broken doll, broken doll, broken doll

There's blood in the bathroom sink
When I brush my teeth
There's a moth in the closet
And cracks all over my feet

Broken doll, broken doll, broken doll
Broken doll, broken doll, broken doll

There's sand on my Popsicle
There's drool on my pillow
I prop myself up
And I fall over

Broken doll, broken doll, broken doll
Broken doll, broken doll, broken doll

Broken doll, broken doll, broken doll
Broken doll, broken doll, broken doll
