Remember the days
In a story that ended
Post mortem scars
Unable to heal

Deliberate words
Brought to silence
Taking the step
Into the unreal

Try to be selfish
Try not to stay
Secondary to imagine
How to slip away

Scars
They lie
Where we can keep them safe

Deaf screams
As our story shatters
No one to catch me
Better not fall

Beating my head on a rock
Nothing matters
Could not forget
Still after all

Try to be selfish
Try not to stay
Mutual days
Separate ways

Nothing ever seems to happen
I believe it's you
Buried under our revival
You believe it's true
