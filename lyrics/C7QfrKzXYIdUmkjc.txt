My baby don? t love me
My baby? s gone and made me sad
My baby don? t love me
My baby? s gone and made me sad

A hard hearted woman
A hard hearted woman true
My baby don? t love me
My baby don? t love me

Oh baby
Let the flags fly at half mast
Let this darkened hour drift past
Oh baby
You don? t know how much I? m missin' you

All my tears are falling
All my tears are falling
All slow blues is calling
Oh baby
You don? t know how much I? m missin' you

Oh baby, baby, baby, baby
Go tell this crazy world the true tale
Please let loose this lover? s ship to sail
Oh baby
You don? t know how much I? m missin' you

You don? t know how much I love you
Oh no no no no no no no

My baby don? t love me
My baby? s gone and made me sad
My baby don? t love me
My baby? s gone and made me sad

A hard hearted woman
A hard hearted woman true
My baby don? t love me
My baby don? t love me
