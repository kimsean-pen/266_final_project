It's a state of mind that's bringing me down
So tell me one will get you out
You haven't left your bed in days
And I know we've all seen better days

I know
You know, who's gonna pick you up
Who's gonna take you home (take you home)
I know
You know, who's gonna pick you up
Who's gonna take you home (take you home)

I know
I know
I know
You know
I know

It takes some time just to learn someone
Like the way you write under the sun
Your light is fading out too soon
Maybe if I could somehow feel this too?

I know
You know, who's gonna pick you up
Who's gonna take you home (take you home)
I know
You know, who's gonna pick you up
Who's gonna take you home (take you home)

I know
I know
I know
You know
I know

Who's really gonna care about tomorrow?
It's gonna be fine
Who's really gonna care about tomorrow?
It's gonna be fine
You're gonna be fine
We're all gonna be fine

I know
You know, who's gonna pick you up
Who's gonna take you home (take you home)
I know
You know, who's gonna pick you up
Who's gonna take you home (take you home)

I know
I know
I know
You know
I know
