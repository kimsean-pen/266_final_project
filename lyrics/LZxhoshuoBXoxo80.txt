Queue stretches on a mile ahead
Everybody's waiting for their daily bread
I will never step out, I might lose my place
I've got my reservation in the human race

Make roo-oo-oo-oo-oom

I'm sure that I've been standing in this corridor before
Waiting for my turn to go and knock on the door
My heart's pumping, beating eight-to-the-bar
It's much too late so drink up now, and sink so far

Make roo-oo-oo-oo-oom

Euuuurghhhna na na na na

Ask Samuel Beckett about the human condition
I'm not in the position to talk about that
I've been standing on my head
but the world looks no different
Stupid parliaments with arguments
and idle chatchatchatchatchat

Make roo-oo-oo-oom

You took the stand in line
as they stamp you on the head
Everybody's waiting for their daily bread
It makes no difference who you are,
they'll put you in your place
I've got my reservations on the human race

Make roo-oo-oo-oom

Euuuurghhhna na na na na
