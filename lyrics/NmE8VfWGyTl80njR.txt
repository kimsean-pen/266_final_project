I study nuclear science
I love my classes
I got a crazy teacher
He wears dark glasses

Things are goin' great
And they're only gettin' better
I'm doin' all right
Gettin' good grades
The future's so bright
I gotta wear shades
I gotta wear shades

I got a job waitin'
For my graduation
Fifty thou a year
wWill buy a lotta beer

Things are goin' great
And they're only gettin' better
I'm doin' all right
Gettin' good grades
The future's so bright
I gotta wear shades
I gotta wear shades

Well I'm heavenly blessed
And worldly wise
I'm a peeping Tom techie
With x-ray eyes

Things are goin' great
And they're only gettin' better
I'm doin' all right
Gettin' good grades
The future's so bright
I gotta wear shades
I gotta wear shades

I study nuclear science
I love my classes
I got a crazy teacher
He wears dark glasses

Things are goin' great
And they're only gettin' better
I'm doin' all right
Gettin' good grades
The future's so bright
I gotta wear shades
I gotta wear shades
I gotta wear shades
I gotta wear shades
