Stop reading into things
You're twisting off my fingers
You're what the winter brings
Your scent will never linger
You're drowning me in smooth caramel
It's sweet but I can't breathe
You ring me like a dinner bell
You'll stay but you won't leave

But I don't want you to know
I don't want you to know
That I don't know where to go
I don't know where to go

Am I bleeding on your sheets?
Am I painting this all red?
Is it not my heart that beats?
Are you the voice inside my head?

But I don't want you to know
I don't want you to know
That I don't want you to go
I don't want you to go

I guess I'll just sink back down into the ground
And I'll burn for the sins that you have found
In the corner of my room where anger sits
With clouded minds
Yeah, souls will split
Down the middle of my life where I just stare
At the wall of contempt that stands so bare
Amongst the stars we are just the specks of dust blown in by the wind and turned to rust
There are eighteen steps till I walk by
And the cosmic colours will make you cry
And every tear you shed will feed my thoughts
And our hands will touch and turn into knots

I guess I'll sink back down into the ground
