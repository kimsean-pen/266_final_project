Someone may have called, my line
from down below
When shadows are to find
the traces, I walk by your door
things change
I can't see you anymore
and you go the places that we've gone

never changing

Oh the light
in my life

now it's midnight
the twilight

and we fly
ever higher
in these streets of mine

And these streets, were our streets
and these streets, were mine.
