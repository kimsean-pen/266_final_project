I'm singing in the rain
Yes, singing in the rain
What a glorious feeling
I'm happy again

I'm laughing at clouds
So dark up above
The sun's in my heart
And I'm ready for love

Let the stormy clouds chase
Everyone from the place
Come on with the rain
I've a smile on my face

I walk down the lane
With a happy refrain
Just singin', singin' in the rain!

Dancing in the rain, da-da-dada

I'm happy again

I'm singing and dancing in the rain

I'm dancing and singing in the rain
