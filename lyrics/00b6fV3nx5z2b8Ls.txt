You went to school to learn, girl
Things you never, never knew before

I got I before E except after C

And why two plus two makes four
Now, now, now I'm gonna teach you (Teach you, teach you)
All about love, dear, (All about love)

Sit yourself down, take a seat
All you gotta do is repeat after me
