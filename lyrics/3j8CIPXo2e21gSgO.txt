She lives in pans at the end of this prism
The love sprouts from the decay
The night's pulsing, streets are convulsing
Dark libations through the bray

I stop trying to make sense of it all
Start sniffing around the continous strife
Grab fear by a strange hand
Sweet neglection in her own right

I wouldn't change her, trade or ditch
I love her just the way she is
I'll love her flaws and frizz
Don't care what anybody says about her

she has a spear and a vow of mother nature
You'll never know what she'll do
Hardened from her mysterious sun
I'm not a muse, I play the fool

I stop trying to make sense of it all
Start dancing around the continous strife
Grab fear by a strange hand
Keep her cool under the pale moonlight

I wouldn't change her, trade or ditch
I love her just the way she is
I'll love her flaws and frizz
Don't care what anybody says

I wouldn't change her, trade or ditch
I love her just the way she is
I'll love her flaws and frizz
Don't care what anybody says about her
