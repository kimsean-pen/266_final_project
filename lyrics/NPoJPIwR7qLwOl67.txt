Through summers long and winters cold
May you always have someone good to hold
May good fortune weigh on you every day
And may your winning streak never end

Roll the dice, boy 'cause my money is on you
Take my advice now, put your money down too
Because there's something in you that I just can't pretend
And may your winning streak never end

And may the sign of the southern cross
Be some comfort to you when you're lost
And may the devil's evil evil eye
Pass you by

Well it's not for glory, I tell you true
That I do these things that I do for you
For a promise I may not much defend
And may your winning streak never end

For a promise I may not much defend
But may your winning streak never end

And may the sign of the cross be some comfort when you're lost
And help you when you're all broke down
May the spirit of St. Christopher turn you around
And may the devil's evil eye pass you right by
Don't you look back my friend
And may the sisters of good charity take you in

Through summers long and winters cold
May you always have someone good to hold
May good fortune be your constant and a loyal friend
And may your winning streak never end

May your winning streak never end
May your winning streak never end
May your winning streak never end
May your winning streak never end
