Told me, darling, that you had to go
find somebody, I don't care no more, baby
I know you're happy, you better try to get along
(get along without)

Cause money won't change you
I said money won't change you (yeah)
No money won't change you
But time is taking you on (come on, yeah, yeah)

There were times when I'd been hurt
I sure know what it is to be treated just like dirt
Go ahead, baby, and tell the world
Tell 'em I'm your sweetie, I'm your only girl.

Money won't change you (no, no)
I said, "Money won't change you
But time is taking you on
Time, yes it is
Time, oh

I'm a little happy now that you're gone
(get along without)

But money won't change you
I said money won't change you (yeah)
Oh money won't change you no, no
(Can you do it without me)
Money won't change you (yeah)
I tell you, "Money won't change you
But time will take you on"

Oh people I feel the blues*
I told myself that I knew that I would oh
Money

Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get down
Money won't change you
Get it, get it, get it, get down with
Get it, get it, get it,
Money won't change you
Get it, get it, get it, get down with
Get it, get it, get down with it baby
Get it, get it, get it,
Money won't change you (oh no)
Get it, get it, get it, get down with
(Till fade)
