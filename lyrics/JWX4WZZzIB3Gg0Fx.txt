Village waiting
Nice and easy, gently does it now
But rest is never allowed
'Cause the kingsmen, they wanna know
How much gold's enough to reach God
But God won't speak till the land is dead
So capital is on our heads

Don't wake Hatsune
She fell asleep and she dreams of war
Miku sleep with you

And as the day turns over
When in our evening slumber
In a half-lit squander
We'll stay inside
Because we're torn and dumb
Kept warm in little smart houses
Little smart houses

Pleasant forest
Long forgotten, distant memories
Herbal tea remedies
Are ridiculous, only believe
In what the human eye can see
But free yourself and you will conceive
A life beyond your wildest dreams

People flee to stars
Far away stars

And as the day turns over
When in our evening slumber
In a half-lit squander
We'll stay inside
Because we're torn and dumb
Kept warm in little smart houses
Little smart houses
Little smart houses
Little smart houses

And as the day turns over
When in our evening slumber
In a half-lit squander
We'll stay inside
Because we're torn and dumb
Kept warm in little smart houses
Little smart houses
Little smart houses
Little smart houses
