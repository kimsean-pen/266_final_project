You walk into love
You're running out of luck
You're in the place nobody can touch
The fog upon the bridge
And all the things you did
Before you closed the door
You closed the door

Ring on a finger dig in the dust
The old dying bell
You left out to rust
Into the sheets of gold
You're sunk like a stone
And now you've closed the door
You've closed the door

Stone through the fields
Deep inside your heart
Could be beautiful from here to the stars
Or does the empty platform wait
My train arrives too late
And now you've closed the door
You've closed the door

Boats in the harbour leaving for the light
Touching the abysmal tomorrow in your sights
Like flesh clings to the bone
It's you and you alone
Who stands behind the door
You've closed the door

Just like once before
I will keep on knocking
At your door
