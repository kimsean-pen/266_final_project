You tried a couple times
Runnin' away from home
Couldn't make it to Friday on your own!
I've drawn a million lines
Just to erase them all
Ain't no sense in compromising on the low

What's a few mistakes
When we've made them all?
If it's make or break
Baby, we should make love!

And now that we've found it and this is the one
And gone through the struggle that we've overcome
If it can't work when it's sent from above
Then I'm giving up
I'm giving up
I'm giving up on love!

Tried to cut me loose
We never come undone
When you're chased down by the truth
Got nowhere to run!
Oooh, what we gotta do
Just to keep holding on?
After everything we've been through
Indestructible, yeah!

What's a few mistakes
When we've made them all?
If it's make or break
Maybe we should make love!

And now that we've found it and this is the one
And gone through the struggle that we've overcome
If it can't work when it's sent from above
Then I'm giving up
I'm giving up
I'm giving up on love!

If there is no us, then I don't know love
Yeah, I'll just give up, I'm giving up, giving up
If there is no us, I don't know love
Yeah, I'll just give up, I'm giving up, giving up

Now that we've found it and this is the one
Gone through the struggle that we've overcome
If it can't work when it's sent from above
Then I'm giving up
I'm giving up
I'm giving up on love!
I'm giving up on love!
