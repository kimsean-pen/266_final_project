Someone crying in the dead of the night
Was it me or was it just in my mind
Reaching deep into the soil I find
I'm stirring awake a fury

Maybe I'm the only one who survived
Crawled out of the dark and into the light
As I turn my face and look to the sky
A tear in my eye is forming

Shaking off all those heavy chains
Now I will find my own way

Turning the ground underneath me to show what I am
Pushing and breaking my way from the hand of the man
Nothing to fear being here, now that I'm overgrown, overgrown

When they try to lay me low
Down into the dirt I go
But don't fight it
They were just giving me
The very thing I would need
Try to tell me what I can and cannot do

Who to be and do not be
It'll drive me to the brink
Any dead ended road
One step closer to home

Shaking off all those heavy chains
Now I will find my own way

Turning the ground underneath me to show what I am
Pushing and breaking my way from the hand of the man
Nothing to fear being here, now that I'm overgrown, overgrown

And I've hiding for so long
With only darkness everyday
I'm gonna crawl to the morning sun
And let it warm every part of me

And I've hiding for so long
With only darkness everyday
I'm gonna crawl to the morning sun
And let it warm every part of me

Turning the ground underneath me to show what I am
Pushing and breaking my way from the hand of the man
Nothing to fear being here, now that I'm overgrown, overgrown
