I take the car and drive the night
The white stripes blur and ease my mind
When all that's left's a single line
Instead of this confusion

And I'm not certain of the way it was
And I'm not sure what I could've done
Oh, I wonder if it had been enough
To stop her from leaving
And I realize the only thing I know is

She said, I'm in love with some one else
She said, I fell in love with some one else
And I, I'm in love with some one
And that's all that I know for sure

I stop the car and close my eyes
I can see her face but it takes a while
And it feeds it like the morning light
Slow and unfocused so I go home and

She's sitting on the kitchen chair
Oh, a suitcase waiting by the stairs
Oh, they're both worn out from all the years
They're ready to let go
And I realize the only thing that's sure is

She said, I'm in love with some one else
She said, I fell in love with some one else
And I, I'm in love with some one
And that's all that I know for sure

She's in love with some one else
She said she fell in love with some one else
And that she's in love with some one
And that's all that I know for sure

And I'm on my knees
And I'm on my knees
And I'm on my knees
And I'm on my knees
Yes, and I realize the only thing I know is

She said, I'm in love with some one else
She said, I fell in love with some one else
And I, I'm in love with some one
And that's all that I know for sure

She's in love with some one else
She said she fell in love with some one else
And that she's in love with some one
And that's all that I know for sure

I'm in love with some one else
She said I fell in love with some one else
And I, I'm in love with some one
And that's all that I know for sure

She's in love with some one else
She said she fell in love with some one else
And that she's in love with some one
And that's all that I know for sure
