You have taken hostage of my mind
Overstayin' your designated time
You're invading this lonely heart of mine
And ignorin' all the exit signs

Maybe one day I will wake up
And be okay in my bed
Maybe one day I will wake up
And you're no longer in my head
Finally I'll have my peace of mind
Finally I'll have my peace of mind

You are making a fool of my disguise
And betraying my childish sense of pride
You keep pullin' me into the light
Leavin' nowhere else to hide
And I'm fallin', pretending I could fly

Maybe one day I will wake up
And be okay in my bed
Maybe one day I will wake up
And you'll stop fucking with my head
Finally I'll have my peace of mind
Finally I'll have my peace of mind

Yet I was found
In your arms again
A familiar mistake I always seem to make
I pilot my plane
When you beg for space
You ring out my name
That I'd come passin' through L.A
It's not like I'm still in love
I'm just used to bein' yours
It's not like I'm still holdin' onto you
I'm just so used to bein' us

Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
