I see you walk
Nothing, that I can't do
I hear you boy
It ain't that, my babe
I see you walk
Nothing, Nothing, that I can't do

(Do) I love it, then come and get it
I know that you fuckin' wid it
You see me, you like it, huh?
Heels Givenchy, huh?
Love it, then play it back
Plus where the 40 at?
I'm fucking you cheap thrill on top of my 50 mill
He eating-the-cake-killa!
He on it, but don't kill her!
My jewelers are diamond rollers!
My rock... Chinchilla!
Some more raw fun, I'm rolling like rock stars
I got 50 mothafuckers in my watch with my bandz down

How could you be so hood, but you so fucking pop?
How could you be so fun, and sound like you selling rocks?
What's on my chain dollars? What's on my chain dollars?
All of the bank dollars got change for small dollars
Everything plain dollars I was in the back
Line I'm standing in the back line, you're goin' up against now
