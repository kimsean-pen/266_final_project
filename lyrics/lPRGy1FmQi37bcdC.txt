To a girl who you mind
A starry sky memory
When Eros spurns Rococo
Rouge thus far

She's spark run away for you
Do you know what we call the moon

There is no end
Ca candle blown, she'll doubt
Faced with past losing

She's spark run away for you
Do you know what we call the moon

And you my god
Can't give show
Can't give
Til you go dancing
Forgive my love
Ca candle blown
she will not

And you my god
Can't give show
Can't give
Til you go dancing

She's spark run away for you
Do you know what we call the moon

So she'll decide
To marry can we come to be
