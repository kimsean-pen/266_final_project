Tonight my eyes were hurting much
As I had strained them all day long
I don't remember waking up
My memory is not that strong
The day was spent walking about
And asking questions blindly
And silently and not without
A sense of lapsing dignity

Today I was an evil one
Who suffered dumbly having fun
Tomorrow god will make me good
If I allow her to, she would

I was found again in need
And mostly unprotected
As I had spent good time with greed
And giving was rejected

Today I was an evil one
Who suffered dumbly having fun
Tomorrow god will make me good
If I allow her to, she would

The skin of all my fingers split
Painfully receding
My hands were dry and itched and hurt
And also they were bleeding
I can fix it by withdrawing
Claim from false completeness
And by humboly allowing
God to grant me sweetness
