I've given you no reason
Just the silent treatment
While I've given myself the benefit of my own doubt
For it's far too way from crying
Living and slowly dying
Despite all our efforts to shut it down

I never seen someone like you
The one that I made you into

I want you to come closer
Maybe a dream made better
Maybe a little meaner
Does it take work?
I hate when you can resist me
Don't step on my fantasy
Don't come to life
Don't come to life
Don't come alive

In the comfort of my daydream
You're everything that I need
Even when you're back in your local time
Week spent into an ocean
A story unspoken
And my name is always in the piling

I never seen someone like you
The one that I made you into

I want you to come closer
Maybe a dream made better
Maybe a little meaner
Does it take work?
I hate when you can resist me
Don't step on my fantasy
Don't come to life
Don't come to life
Don't come alive

I want you to come closer
Closer, closer
I want you to come closer
Closer, closer, closer

I want you to come closer
Maybe a dream made better
Maybe a little meaner
Does it take work?
I hate when you can resist me
Don't step on my fantasy
Don't come to life
Don't come to life
Don't come alive
