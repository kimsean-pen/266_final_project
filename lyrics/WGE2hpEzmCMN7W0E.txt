Since you left me I've been out with other guys
But they don't see the love light shining in my eyes
And when they want to kiss goodnight
I just can't seem to do it right

My heart's not in it, oh no
My heart's not in it, oh no
Cause my heart still belongs to you

Cause when I think that someone else has won my heart
I find it's only wishful thinking on my part
And there's just nothing I can do
To get that feeling I had with you

My heart's not in it, oh no
My heart's not in it, oh no
Cause my heart still belongs to you

I don't know just what my friends are telling you
But if they say I'm doing fine, it's just not true
I may run with the crowd and stay out late
But baby let me set you straight

My heart's not in it, oh no
My heart's not in it, oh no
Cause my heart still belongs to you

My heart's not in it, oh no
