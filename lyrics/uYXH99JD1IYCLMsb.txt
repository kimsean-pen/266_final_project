A glass a view a mirror
which one
distracts like open windows in the gusts
a calm day will come

this dream is in a telescope now

Fever in bedtime covers go unknown
This fright it grows and misses, sinks and floats
A calm day will come
My calm day will

this dream is in a telescope now

Fever in bedtime covers go unknown
Until two eyes out of the darkness bring hope close

This childish heart can't wait, it dances keeps me awake
to think on
You're the greatest light the greatest shade
It means that I can be happy for you
happy for you
