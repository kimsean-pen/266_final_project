Well, you gassed her up
Behind the wheel
With your arm around your sweet one
In your Oldsmobile
Barrelling down the boulevard
You're looking for the heart of Saturday night

And you got paid on Friday
Your pockets are jingling
Then you see the lights
And you get all tingling
'Cause you're cruising with a six
And you're looking for the heart of Saturday night

Then you comb your hair
You shave your face
Trying to wipe out every trace
Of all the other days
In the week
You know that this will be the Saturday
You're reaching your peak

Stopping on the red
Going on the green
'Cause tonight'll be like nothing you've ever seen
And you're barrelling down the boulevard
And you're looking for the heart of Saturday night

Tell me, is it the crack of the pool balls
Neon buzzing
Telephone's ringing, it's your second cousin
And is it the barmaid that's smiling
In the corner of her eye
Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye

Makes it kind of quiver
Down in the core
'Cause your dreaming of them Saturdays that came before
And now you're stumbling
You're stumbling onto the heart of Saturday night

And you gassed her up
And you're behind the wheel
With your arm around your sweet one
In your Oldsmobile
Barrelling down the boulevard
You're looking for the heart of Saturday night

And is it the crack of the pool balls
Neon buzzing
Telephone's ringing, it's your second cousin
And the barmaid that's smiling
In the corner of her eye
Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye

Makes it kind of special
Down in the core
And you're dreaming of them Saturdays that came before
It's found you stumbling
Stumbling onto the heart of Saturday night
And you're stumbling
Stumbling onto the heart of Saturday night
