Our hearts
Are free
So tell me what's wrong with the feeling
I'm a flower, you're my bee
It's much older than you and me
I'm in love, I'm alive
I belong to the stars and sky
Let's forget who we are for one night
We're not animals baby
It's the people who lie

I want real love baby
Ooh, don't leave me waiting
I've got real love maybe
Wait until you taste me
I want real love baby
There's a world inside me
Got the preacher's music
Just if for a minute

Our hearts
Are free
So tell me what's wrong with the feeling
I'm a flower, you're my bee
It's much older than you and me
I'm in love, I'm alive
I belong to the stars and sky
Let's forget who we are for one night
We're not animals baby
It's the people who lie

I want real love baby
Ooh, don't leave me waiting
I've got real love maybe
Wait until you taste me
I want real love baby
There's a world inside me
Got the preacher's music
Just if for a minute

I want real love baby
Ooh, don't leave me waiting
I've got real love maybe
Wait until you taste me
I want real love baby
There's a world inside me
Got the preacher's music
Just if for a minute

Our hearts
Are free
So tell me what's wrong with the feeling
I'm a flower, you're my bee
It's much older than you and me
I'm in love, I'm alive
I belong to the stars and sky
Let's forget who we are for one night
We're not animals baby
It's the people who lie

I want real love baby
Ooh, don't leave me waiting
I've got real love maybe
Wait until you taste me
I want real love baby
There's a world inside me
Got the preacher's music
Just if for a minute

I want real love baby
Ooh, don't leave me waiting
I've got real love maybe
Wait until you taste me
I want real love baby
There's a world inside me
Got the preacher's music
