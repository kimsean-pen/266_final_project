Pop that muh'fucker fuck you mean, what you doin'
Yeah pop that shit
Hittin' that-that-that-that-that taro
Sippin' that-that-that-that-that mer, merlot
Sippin' that-that-that-that-that-that-that
Met her once, fucked twice
Bitch with the funk, p-funk, if she plump Imma thump thump thump
I ain't nothing nice

Hey
Hey hey
Hey
The blacker the berry, the blacker the berry
The blacker the be- merlot, I

The blacker the berry, the blacker the berry
The blacker the be- merlot, I
Sip and I swerve on your curves
It appears I'm absurd, it's the merlot
Ándale
Eva, she tryna get me out my Levi's
I gotta B-Y she off the merlot
Like, "you sure?" I mean you drunk enough to three four
Don't want to creep up, she said "Leggo"

Shketit, shketit, shketit
I fuck a cougar I'm Freddy
Make the thang reindeer, we go sleddin'
Slip and slide take you to my house, trick daddy
Drunk like a unc' off the skunk in my bunk on
the bus eating lunch met her once, fucked twice
Bitch with the funk, p-funk, if she plump Imma thump thump thump
I ain't nothing nice
No clean cup styrofoam double up pre-roll with on this merlot
I said, no clean cup styrofoam double up pre-roll with on this merlot

My boo don't like designer shit
All she want is that Rihanna shit
Plenty Fenty, she buying black
Marilyn Merlot, pearl in the dope
"I wish we had more time and shit"
Killa on the cam, I gotta dip, huh
Least we made some memorabilia
Reflect and hit it in the mirror
Different strains for different pains
Som'n' like a ganja-sseur
I go pecan, just played two shows in Europe
Still made my nephew's party in St. Louis
They want me in eatin' hardly, just can't do it
I need the scallops with the classic music
Fuck up her balance deep dick I'm a scuba diver
MacGuyver, yeah, then I maneuver move around
Move around, move around, move around
I'm off the, merlot
I'm off the, I'm off the, I'm off the, aw shit

Sip and I swerve on your curves
It appears I'm absurd, it's the merlot
Ándale arriba, she tryna get me out my Levi's
I gotta B-Y she off the merlot
Like, "you sure?" I mean you drunk and off the treefour, uhh
Don't want to creep up, she said "Leggo"
Alright
