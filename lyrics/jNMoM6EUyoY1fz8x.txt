Heard you getting married (Get low)
Everybody said (Get low)
Greatest man alive (Get low)
I've been told (I could never show, I could never show)
Bought yourselves a diamond (Get low)
Finally getting paid (Get low)
Buying people silence (Get low)
They're afraid (I could never show, I could never show)
Constant threat of violence, it works
It can get you so far
End up feeling worse, it's cold
And you're left with no one

I love the way your heart had no rule
Loving what your heart becomes
Even when you smile, you're still cruel
Loving what your heart becomes
Remember when my hands had turned blue
Loving what your heart becomes
I love the way you hang with no fool
Loving what your heart becomes
What your heart becomes
What your heart becomes

How'd we get invited? (Get low)
Out there in L.A. (Get low)
Try to be the man you need (Get low)
Every day (I could never show, I could never show)
Thought I'd write a novel (Get low)
Didn't like the weight (Get low)
It's hard to stay inspired (Get low)
And stay awake (I could never show, I could never show)

And struggling in darkness, it works
It can get you so far
But digging in the dirt, it gets old
Then you're left with no one

I love the way your heart had no rule
Loving what your heart becomes
And even when you smile, you're still cruel
Loving what your heart becomes
Remember when my hands had turned blue
Loving what your heart becomes
I love the way you hang with no fool
Loving what your heart becomes
What your heart becomes
What your heart becomes

Gather in a circle
Dropping to your knees
Praying for forgiveness from you
Begging please
Clapping like we mean it
And nothing's ever changed
Everything about it
Always it stays the same

I love the way your heart had no rule
Loving what your heart becomes
Even when you smile, you're still cruel
Loving what your heart becomes
Remember when my hands had turned blue
Loving what your heart becomes
I love the way you hang with no fool
Loving what your heart becomes
What your heart becomes
What your heart becomes
