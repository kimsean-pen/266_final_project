There's a light, and I can see it in your eyes
There's a memory of the way you used to be
Nothing's gone, it still shines, every time you turn it on
And when you slow it down...

People working every night and day
Never give yourself no time
Got too many bills to pay
Slow down, nothing's gonna disappear
If you give yourself some room
To move to the music you hear

Gotta get up, listen to me
Clappa your hands, stompa your feet

People looking for the great escape
Looking to the greener side
Trying to find a better way
Slow down, open up your big brown eyes
Feel the rhythm in your heart
You don't even need to try

Gotta get up, listen to me
Clappa your hands, stompa your feet
Nothing is wrong, if you move to the beat
Clappa your hands, stompa your feet
Stompa your feet

When you can't seem to shake off all the feelings that are breaking
Little pieces of the music that are in you
All the pain that you feel, I can prove it's not real
There's just one thing you gotta do

Gotta get up, listen to me
Clappa your hands, stompa your feet
Nothing is wrong, if you move to the beat
Clappa your hands, stompa your feet
Stompa your feet
Stompa your feet
Stompa your feet
