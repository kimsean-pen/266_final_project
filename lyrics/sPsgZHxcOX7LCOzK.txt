So glad to see you well
Overcome and completely silent now
With heaven's help
You cast your demons out

And not to pull your halo down
Around your neck and tug you off your cloud
But I'm more than just a little curious
How you're plannin' to go about makin' your amends
To the dead
To the dead

Recall the deeds as if they're all
Someone else's atrocious stories
Now you stand reborn, before us all
So glad to see you well

And not to pull your halo down
Around your neck and tug you to the ground
But I'm more than just a little curious
How you're plannin' to go about makin' your amends
To the dead
To the dead

With your halo slippin' down
Your halo slippin'
Your halo slippin' down
Your halo slippin' down

But I'm more than just a little curious (Your halo slippin' down)
How you're plannin' to go about makin' your amends
But I'm more than just a little curious (Your halo slippin' down)
How you're plannin' to go about makin' your amends

But I'm more than just a little curious (Your halo slippin' down)
How you're plannin' to go about makin' your amends
But I'm more than just a little curious (Your halo slippin' down)
How you're plannin' to go about makin' your amends

Your halo slippin' down
Your halo slippin' down
To choke you now
