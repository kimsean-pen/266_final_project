the dark brown shades of my skin
only add color to my tears
that splash aganst my hollow bones
that rocks my soul
looking back over my past dreams that i once knew
wondering why my dreams never came true

somebody tell me
what can i do

something is holding me back,
is it because i'm black.

in this world of no pitty
i was raised in the ghetto of the city
momma she worked so hard
to earn every penny

something is holding me back cause
is it because i'm black

something is holding me back cause
i'm wondering if it's because i'm black

like a child steeling his first piece of candy and got caught
