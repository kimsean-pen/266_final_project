Nobody knows when there's clouds in the skies
When there are tears in your eyes
Nobody knows when you're hurting so bad
So what if they had?

Far away where the hills turn to plains
I sit and I wonder where you are
I dream at night of the memories that we share
I feel your touch I see your stare

Chorus:
Nobody knows when you're down and out
Nobody cares what it's all about
When it comes to you babe
You know I'll always be there
It just seems
Nobody knows when you're down and out

Silent words a whispered song
Will you still love me when I'm gone?
Now nobody knows what really matters
Only fools who don't belong

Nobody knows when you're down and out
Nobody cares what it's all about
In my dreams it never seems that
Nobody knows

Solo

Chorus

Whoa, down and out
Whoa, whoa
(Nobody knows)
