You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast

Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun
Look out the saints are comin' through
And it's all over now, baby blue

The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence

The empty-handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheet
This sky, too, is folding under you
And it's all over now, baby blue

All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
All your reindeer armies are all going home

Your lover who just walked out your door
Has taken all her blankets from the floor
The carpet, too, is moving under you
And it's all over now, baby blue

Leave your stepping stones behind you, something calls for you
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you

A vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore
Strike another match, let's start anew
And it's all over now, baby blue
Oh, it's all over now, baby blue
