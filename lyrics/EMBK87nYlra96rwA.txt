I though I met a man who said he knew a man
Who knew what was going on
I was mistaken, only another stranger that I knew

And I thought that I'd found the light
To guide me through my night and all this darkness
I was mistaken, only reflections of a shadow that I saw

And I thought I've seen someone who seemed at last
To know the truth
I was mistaken, only a child laughing in the sun

Ahhhhhhhhhhhh in the sun
