Suburban days
They last so long
In shop and office
We sing our song, we all sing

We ain't got nothing
Nothing to do
A big fat nothing
Nothing for me, nothing for you

Suburban dreams
Just out of reach
Work 'till you die
That's what they teach you at school

With that in mind
What's there to lose
My friends and I
Doped up on TV fags and booze

Hear them all singing!

We're the ones that you've forgotten
But we will not be denied!
Coming out of the shadows
Yeah, we rock the satellites!

Suburban Nights
They get so hot
People get angry
We sing our song, we all sing

But global terror, they say
We are at war
But ain't got time for that, 'cos
These bills keep dropping through my door

Hear them all singing!

We're the ones that you've forgotten
Out of mind, out of sight
Coming out of the shadows
Yeah, we rock the satellites!

All these people who criticise us
Well, we're only sayin' what we're seeing with our own eyes
This one way system ain't paradise
Not everybody wants to race, wants to fight

Hear them all singing!

We're the ones that you've forgotten
But we will not be denied!
Coming out of the shadows
Yeah, we rock the satellites!

We're the ones that you've forgotten
Out of mind, out of sight
Coming out of the shadows
Coming out via satellite
