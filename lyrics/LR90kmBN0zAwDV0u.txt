I found a hole in the wall
See me take, bending then I break it off
Now you're home for the fall
You're in, you're out, you're in, you're out again

I can't stop thinking of the hole in the wall
There's something wicked about the hole in the wall
You got me thinking around the hole in the wall
I'll just stay inside until I make my own goodbye

Leave your skin at the door
Make the hole in shapes and as it was before
Your head on the floor
You're in, you're out, you're in, you're out again

I can't stop thinking of the hole in the wall
There's something wicked about the hole in the wall
You got me thinking around the hole in the wall
I'll just stay inside until I make my own goodbye

I just wanna be whole
Never wanted to be for
I just wanna be whole
Never wanted to be for
I just wanna be an hour

I can't stop thinking of the hole in the wall
There's something wicked about the hole in the wall
You got me thinking around the hole in the wall
I'll just stay inside until I make my own goodbye
'Cause I'm thinking about the whole in the wall
There's something wicked about the hole in the wall
You got me thinking around the hole in the wall
I'll just stay inside until I make my own goodbye
