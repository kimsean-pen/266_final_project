High tales, and low tales,
Love has no part in.
Story upon story,
Would you marry me?

23 lies you told.
Many more lives you hold.

Thought I could believe.
Thought I could believe.

How long can you play this?
How long can you last?
Gaze up, you're so restless,
On your way down fast.

23 lies you told,
Many more lives you hold.
23 lies you told,
Many more lives you hold.

Thought I could believe.
