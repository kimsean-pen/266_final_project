Cut yourself in conversation
Cut the line to make me feel alive
'Cause you know I'm not alive
And leave me with your complications
Take your life, you feel like taking mine
Meeting God, we stand in line, not alone

Nowhere to go
I'm not leaving, not going
I'm not kissing you goodbye
On my own
I'm nothing, just bleeding
I'm not kissing you goodbye

Trust you'll take the right to leave me
Waiting under dark clouds for the rain
Praying lightning strikes a change
As history gets lost and as I
Took that final breath I felt alive
Meeting God to stand in line, all alone

Nowhere to go
Not leaving, not going
I'm not kissing you goodbye
On my own
I'm nothing, just bleeding
I'm not kissing you goodbye

Don't let me go
Don't say goodbye
'Cause you know that I'm not alive
Don't let me go
Don't say goodbye
Don't let this love die
Don't let me go (cut yourself in conversation)
Don't say goodbye (cut the line to make me feel alive)
'Cause you know I'm not alive
Don't let me go (and leave me with your complications)
Don't say goodbye (take your life, you feel like taking mine)
Don't let this love die

Nowhere to go (not going)
I'm not leaving, not going (not going)
I'm not kissing you goodbye (not going)
On my own (not leaving)
I'm nothing, just bleeding (not going)
I'm not kissing you goodbye
I'm not kissing you goodbye
I'm not kissing you goodbye
