Yeah, I'll keep breaking
I'll keep breaking my heart
Until it opens again
Yeah, I'll keep falling
I'll keep falling apart
Until I'm whole again
Yeah, I'll keep dropping
I'll keep dropping the ball
Until it's rolling again
Yeah, I'll keep breaking
I'll keep breaking my heart
Until it opens again

I write it down, but to read it doesn't work
Take it to town, but to be seen doesn't work
Smack it around, but that only make it worse
I make it worse

I meditate for a day but it doesn't help
Get down and pray, I gotta say, what a living hell
I could escape but I know that all too well
It doesn't help

'Cuz I'll keep breaking
I'll keep breaking my heart
Until it opens again
Yeah, I'll keep falling
I'll keep falling apart
Until I'm whole again
And I'll keep dropping
I'll keep dropping the ball
Until it's rolling again
Yeah, I'll keep breaking
I'll keep breaking my heart
Until it opens again, yeah

I say sweet things to myself but it doesn't work
Live, laugh, love, puke, man, that shit really doesn't work
So I get rude but that only makes it worse
I make it worse
La di da di

'Cuz I'll keep breaking
I'll keep breaking my heart
Until it opens again
Yes, I'll keep falling
I'll keep falling apart
Until I'm whole again
And I'll keep scratching at the cracks on the wall
Until I make it again
Yes, I'll keep breaking
I'll keep breaking my heart
Until it opens again, yeah

Yeah
Yeah
