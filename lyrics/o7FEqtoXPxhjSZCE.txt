Come to me
While I'm sleeping,
So their wagging tongues
Might not find you, my love!

All the while
they lie down,
our lighter souls fuse,
fly and dive, my love.

So, stamp this night so strong,
that I will remember
and have it ever after!

Come to me
while I'm sleeping,
so their wagging tongues
might not find you, my love!

Come to me
in my dreaming,
so their wagging tongues
might not find you, my love!

'Round the corner,
back of hands,
they'll still be talking
whether or not we'd ever,
whether we'd ever, my love."
