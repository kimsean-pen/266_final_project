This vacation's useless these white pills aren't kind
I've given a lot of thought on this 13 hour drive
I miss the grinding concrete where we sat past 8 or 9
And slowly finished laughing in the glow of our headlights

I've given a lot of thought to the nights we use to have
The days have come and gone, our lives went by so fast
I faintly remember breathing on your bedroom floor
Where I laid and told you but you sweared you loved me more

Do you care if I don't know what to say?
Will you sleep tonight? Will you think of me?
Will I shake this off? Pretend it's all okay
That there's someone out there who feels just like me
There is

Those notes you wrote me
I've kept them all
I've given a lot of thought of how to write you back this fall
With every single letter in every single word
there will be a hidden message about a boy that loves a girl

Do you care if I don't know what to say?
Will you sleep tonight? Will you think of me?
Will I shake this off? Pretend it's all okay
That there's someone out there who feels just like me
There Is

Do you care if I don't know what to say?
Will you sleep tonight? Will you think of me?
Will I shake this off? Pretend it's all okay
That there's someone out there who feels just like me

Do you care if I don't know what to say?
Will you sleep tonight? Will you think of me?
Will I shake this off? Pretend it's all okay
That there's someone out there who feels just like me
There is
