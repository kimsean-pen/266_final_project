If you love someone
If you love someone

Wake up in the morning take a breath and let it out
Just forget tomorrow's ever gonna come around
Everybody's medicating taking time and waiting
For the right time in this short life
But it's your life

We can run around in circles we make
Or we can run straight ahead
Never ever let the moment pass by
When all that matters in the end

If you love someone
Then tell them right now
'Cause your heart won't rest
'Til you let it out
Let the words you dream
Come out of your mouth
If you love someone
You gotta make a sound

If you love someone
You gotta make a sound
If you love someone

When true love is staring you in the face
But the words that you're feeling never find their way
You're so invisible to the one you want
And you'd give anything to win their love

We can get lost in fears that we make
For days that feel black as night
But there in the dark you'll find that the stars
Are shining their brightest light

If you love someone
Then tell them right now
'Cause your heart won't rest
'Til you let it out
Let the words you dream
Come out of your mouth
If you love someone
You gotta make a sound

If you love someone
You gotta make a sound
If you love someone
if you love...

If you love, someone
If you love, someone
Yeah

If you love someone
Then tell them right now
'Cause your heart won't rest
'Til you let it out
Let the words you dream
Come out of your mouth
If you love someone
You gotta make a sound
If you love someone
You gotta make a sound
If you love someone
Someone
You gotta make a sound
If you love someone
If you love someone
If you love someone
If you love someone
