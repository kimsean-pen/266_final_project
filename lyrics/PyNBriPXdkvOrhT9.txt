Wide open eyes are blind to everything, to everything
But I hear your voice and it's the only thing, the only thing

There's been times when I'm under
There's been times when I'm feeling low
Now you're here, you're my answer
If we come down then we're not alone
'Cause there's been times when I'm feeling.

I don't know what I'm doing, but I know how to do it
Do it, but I know how to do it

So sweet to me, so numb to everything, to everything
But I feel your touch and it's the only thing, the only thing

There's been times when I'm under
There's been times when I'm feeling low
Now you're here, you're my answer
If we come down then we're not alone
'Cause there's been times when I'm feeling.

I don't know what I'm doing, but I know how to do it
Do it, but I know how to do it

There's been times when I'm under
There's been times when I'm feeling low
Now you're here, you're my answer
If we come down then we're not alone
'Cause there's been times when I'm feeling.

I don't know what I'm doing, but I know how to do it
Do it, but I know how to do it
I don't know what I'm doing, but I know how to do it
