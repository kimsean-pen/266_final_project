When it comes down to it
Would you stand in front of a bullet?
When you hear it go bang, bang
When you hear it go bang, bang (When you hear it)
When it comes down to it
If I put it in your hand, could you pull it?
Could you make it go bang, bang?
Could you make it go bang, bang?
Could you make it?

I'm prepared to give you all of me
If you're prepared to ride when you're called upon
If so, I'll treat you like royalty
Like a queen, baby, not a pawn
When they plottin' on me, would you let me know? (Let me know)
Would you load the magazine?
Would you let it go?
When it bang, is your aim incredible?
How high will your name be when the credits roll?

Would you be my killer? (Would you be?)
When I'm low, would you be my dealer? (Would you be?)
Would you do it by surprise?
And when he turn around, could you look him in his eyes?

When it comes down to it
Would you stand in front of a bullet?
When you hear it go bang, bang
When you hear it go bang, bang (When you hear it)
When it comes down to it
If I put it in your hand, could you pull it?
Could you make it go bang, bang?
Could you make it go bang, bang?
Could you make it?

Bang, bang
Bang, bang

If you're not afraid of the darkness
I'ma be there 'til the end, love
I promise I'll be there regardless
Anywhere in the world that you end up
I won't ever let 'em take what we have
I could make 'em disappear, if you need that
Catch 'em while they walking home, make 'em see black
Now they gone forever, I don't think they'll ever be back

All I ask of you is to be there when the time comes
(When the time comes)
Even if it kills you, baby
Do not hide or run

When it comes down to it
Would you stand in front of a bullet?
When you hear it go bang, bang
When you hear it go bang, bang (When you hear it)
When it comes down to it
If I put it in your hand, could you pull it?
Could you make it go bang, bang?
Could you make it go bang, bang?

When it comes down to it
Would you stand in front of a bullet?
When you hear it go bang, bang
When you hear it go bang, bang
When you hear it
(Bang, bang)
(Bang, bang)
