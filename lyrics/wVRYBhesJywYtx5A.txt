Put on your coolest dress
And your hottest pair of shoes
Come on, let's go
Oh
(Let's go)
Get in my car
Turn the radio on up high
I said high
At the red light
Boys trying to get the digits
But we sneak by
Uh, buh-bye
'Cause we're headin' to the club
Nothing's gonna stop us now
Let's go
(Let's go, let's go)
Oh

Are you ready, are you ready
Are you ready
Let's go
Are you ready, are you ready
Are you ready
Let's go
Are you ready
Are you
Yeah

Comin' up with all my girls
We're gonna party like there's never a worry, 'cause
Good times rules, so no curfew
We're showing off our moves
The breeze so cool
Let your hair down
Tonight you get to be a superstar
You're livin' like a superstar

So we're flirting with the dude
At the door 'til he says we're okay
Hey
(Say word: okay)
Move the velvet rope
Back off
Get out of our way
Hey
(Come on, come on)
All the guys got their eyes on us
As we're moving up to the floor
Oh
Trying to waste some time
But we're doing what we came here for
Oh

Are you ready, are you ready
Are you ready
Let's go
Are you ready, are you ready
Are you ready
Let's go
Are you ready
Are you
Yeah

Comin' up with all my girls
We're gonna party like there's never a worry, 'cause
Good times rules, so no curfew
We're showing off our moves
The breeze so cool
Let your hair down
Tonight you get to be a superstar
Are you ready

We get red carpet love
When we come steppin' up
The boys keep droppin' their jaws
Can never get enough

We make 'em stop and stare
We see them everywhere
And now you know who we are
Tonight your living like a superstar

Are you ready, are you ready
Are you ready
Let's go
Are you ready, are you ready
Are you ready
Let's go
Are you ready
Are you
Yeah

Comin' up with all my girls
We're gonna party like there's never a worry, 'cause
Good times rules, so no curfew
We're showing off our moves
The breeze so cool

Comin' up with all my girls
We're gonna party like there's never a worry, 'cause
Good times rules, so no curfew
We're showing off our moves
The breeze so cool
Let your hair down
Tonight you get to be a superstar
You're livin' like a superstar

Tonight you get-get-get to, get to, be a, be a
You're livin' like a superstar
