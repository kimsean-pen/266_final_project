It's my primary instinct to protect the child,
Girl singing in the wreckage,
My dress is torn,
My hair is wild,
Girl singing in the wreckage,
My first car,
My early boyfriends,
Girl singing in the wreckage,
Wet weekends,
New Years Eve parties,
Girl singing in the wreckage,

Hour after hour after hour,
Hour after hour after hour,

My eighteenth birthday I'll die of boredom,
Girl singing in the wreckage,
My private world is smashed wide open,
Girl singing in the wreckage,
My first trip,
My expectation,
I had a dream that it would end like this,
No destiny,
No destination,
You hit the ground and then it stops,

Hour after hour after hour,
Hour after hour after hour,
Hour after hour after hour,
Hour after hour after hour,

I miss my hometown it's nothing special,
Call my parents let them know I'm alright,
My primary instinct is to protect the child,
Send a postcard from the airport,
