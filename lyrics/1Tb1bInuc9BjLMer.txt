When I wake up, I'm thankful I slept through the night
'Cause that is the only time I feel alright
Keep my eyes closed so I sleep the sadness away
When I wake up, I'm sure that it won't be the same

All the panic, depression, the hurt and regret
Lying to myself: "I don't think of Death"
All the ups, all the downs, all the petty concerns
My whole world's imploding, I can't find the words
'Cause the truth is, I'm fucked up

The truth is that I'm all fucked up like you
Yeah, we're all fucked up, it's true
The truth is that I'm all fucked up like you
Yeah, we're all fucked up
And the truth is, they don't hear the words we say
Yeah, they all just turn away
The truth is, they don't hear the words we say
Yeah, they're all fucked up

If I wake up tomorrow, just know that I've tried
To find a way out without saying goodbye

All the panic, depression, the hurt and regret
Lying to myself: "I don't think of Death"
All the ups, all the downs, all the petty concerns
My whole world's imploding, I can't find the words
'Cause the truth is, I'm fucked up

The truth is that I'm all fucked up like you
Yeah, we're all fucked up, it's true
The truth is that I'm all fucked up like you
Yeah, we're all fucked up
And the truth is, they don't hear the words we say
Yeah, they all just turn away
The truth is, they don't hear the words we say
Yeah, they're all fucked up

Will you save my life?
Or just say goodbye?
Will you save my life?
Or just say goodbye?
Will you save my life?
Or just say goodbye?
Will you save my life? Will you save my life?
Or just say goodbye? Say goodbye
Will you save my life? Will you save my life?
Or just say goodbye? Say goodbye
