Big train down the track
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Coming back
It's time
Jump onboard
There is room for many more

Big train down the track
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Coming back
It's time
Jump onboard
There is room for many more

Take me for a ride
Take me for a ride

So many pieces
A shattered life
I try to put together everything
So many faces I have to wear
Sick of everything I have to fight

Sit with me
I'll take you for a ride
Tick-tock time
It will be so fine
Stay with me
I'll take you for a ride
Tick-tock time
We will be alright

Sit with me
I'll take you for a ride
Tick-tock time
It will be so fine
Stay with me
I'll take you for a ride
Tick-tock time
We will be alright

I can't find the words to say
And what to do
It's like I've lost control of everything
A tragic ride
A state of mind
Sick of everything I have to fight

Sit with me
I'll take you for a ride
Tick-tock time
It will be so fine
Stay with me
I'll take you for a ride
Tick-tock time
We will be alright

Sit with me
I'll take you for a ride
Tick-tock time
It will be so fine
Stay with me
I'll take you for a ride
Tick-tock time
We will be alright

Sick of everything but I still fight
I don't give up where I stand in life
There is nothing left on the other side
I save myself giving up on the lies

Sit with me
I'll take you for a ride
Tick-tock time
It will be so fine
Stay with me
I'll take you for a ride
Tick-tock time
We will be alright

Sit with me
I'll take you for a ride
Tick-tock time
It will be so fine
Stay with me
I'll take you for a ride
Tick-tock time
We will be alright

Sit with me
I'll take you for a ride
Tick-tock time
It will be so fine
Stay with me
I'll take you for a ride
Tick-tock time
We will be alright

Take me for a ride
Ride
Ride
Ride
Take me home
