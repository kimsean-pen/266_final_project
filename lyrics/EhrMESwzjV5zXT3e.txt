I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know

Your eyes were covered in sunglasses
When they first met mine
I sat there and stared at you
You didn't seem to mind
The awkward ways we meet

First comes heavy breathing
Staring at the ceiling
What will happen next?
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know

I never cared how I dressed before
But I cared that night
Anticipation ran through my bones
And my clothes never fit right
I can't wait till we meet again

First comes heavy breathing
Staring at the ceiling
What will happen next?
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know

Framed pictures start to be put on the walls
Constant visits while I'm out on the road
It's hard to leave sometimes
But you know where I lay my head at night

First comes heavy breathing
Staring at the ceiling
What will happen next?
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
(I don't wanna know)

First comes heavy breathing
Staring at the ceiling
What will happen next?
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
