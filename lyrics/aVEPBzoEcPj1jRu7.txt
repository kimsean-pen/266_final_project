Looking back I still have so many questions.
So many things unanswered.
Like what did I do?
What could I do?
Was there ever a moment you cared,
or was I always ugly and abandoned?
Remembering all the times you wish me harm,
you wished me dead.
How could I have changed to make it better?
And would I?
Would I?
Why?
I still feel so much hate inside of me.
Seems like you were just waiting for me to fail.
I'm sorry I can't forgive you.
Do you blame me?
You never forgave me.
I've tried to grow from this.
Every day is a new challenge.
Because with you, there's just no winning.
Like it or not, I still a part of you and you're still a part of me.
Like it or not, you're still a part of me.
Yeah!
So this is how it ends.
All the tears,
All the blood,
It's all been for nothing.
As the candle dwindles and flickers out.
The End.
