I pity the country
I pity the state
And the mind of a man
Who thrives on hate.

Small are the lives
Of cheats and of liars
Of Bigoted newspress
Fascist town criers

Deception annoys me
Deception destroys me
The Bill of rights throws me
Jails they all know me

Frustrated are churchmen
The saving-of-soul men
The Tinker the tailor
The Colonial governor

They pull and they paw me
They're seeking to draw me
Away from the roundness
of the life

Instrumental Break:

Silly Civil Servants
They thrive off my body
Their trip is with power
Back bacon and welfare

Police they arrest me
Materialists detest me
Pollution it chokes me
Movies they joke me

Politicians exploit me
City life it jades me
Hudson's Bay fleeces me
Hunting laws freak me

Government is bumbling
Revolution is rumbling
To be ruled in impunity
Is tradition continuity

I pity the country
I pity the state
And the mind of a man
Who thrives on hate
