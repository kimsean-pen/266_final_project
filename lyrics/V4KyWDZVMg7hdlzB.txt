I'm your garden of Eden
I'm your promise land
You deny me the freedom
Still
I'm innocent

You can't even
Look at me
Hide the shame
In your eyes
You can't even
Look at me
Hide the shame
I see tonight

Hide the shame
I see tonight
You can't even look at me
Hide the shame that's in your eyes
You can't even look at me
Hide the shame that's in your eyes
I can't bear to look at you
Only love I ever knew
You can't even look at me
Oh I know your shame is true
You don't understand the things that you do

Get up in the morning
It's a constant dread
Once you've had your fix
Once your bible is read
Oh living fear
I think I'd rather
Be
Dead

Look at me
Look at me
Don't hide the shame that's in your eyes
Hide the shame that's in your eyes
Father do you forgive the one
Who beats his son?
Knows not what he's done?

Father do you forgive the one who beats?
Look at me
Look at me
Look at me
Look at me
Don't hide the shame that's in your eyes
Hide the shame that's in your eyes

Look at me
Don't hide the shame that's in your eyes
Hide the shame that's in your eyes
