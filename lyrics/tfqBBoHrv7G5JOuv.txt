It goes around in my heart
Hey, hey, what a criminal man
Life will go in circles all around my heart
Hey, hey, it's such a dangerous game
I'm afraid you'd lose your trust in love

Some time back in '85
In July when the summer was high
We've been alright
You know what money can't buy
One kiss on a flatbed truck
A hot rain has completed our luck
You said, words don't mean nothing
But you will be mine
It goes around in my heart
Hey, hey, what a criminal man
Life will go in circles all around my heart
Hey, hey, it's such a dangerous game
I'm afraid you'd lose your trust in love
Good friend in the darkest night
You feel blind but my love is cateyed
Just follow it's light
You've got to follow the light
Some day you'll be face to face
And you'll see human nature can't waste my love
Words don't mean nothing
As long as you're mine
It goes around in my heart
Hey, hey, what a criminal man
Life will go in circles all around my heart
Hey, hey, it's such a dangerous game
I'm afraid you'd lose your trust in love
It goes around in my heart
Hey, hey, what a criminal man
Life will go in circles all around my heart
Hey, hey, it's such a dangerous game
I'm afraid you'd lose your trust in love

Around in my heart
Hey, hey, what a criminal man
Life will go in circles all around my heart
Hey, hey, it's such a dangerous game
I'm afraid you'd lose your trust in love
It goes around in my heart
Hey, hey, what a criminal man
Life will go in circles all around my heart
Hey, hey, it's such a dangerous game
I'm afraid you'd lose your trust in love

It goes around in my heart
