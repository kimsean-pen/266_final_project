Our love is rock steady
Rock steady, rock steady
Our love is rock steady

Love is like a punishment
Homegirl here to represent
So innocently you seem to come my way
While Tinkerbell and Cupid play
They sit there and laugh
I sit here and I can't believe my eyes
You found me at last
But wait and see how it'll agonize

A real love survives a rock steady vibe
A real love survives a rock steady vibe
Rock steady, rock steady
Our love is so rock steady
Rock steady

Steady now, stop rocking it
It's a delicate environment
Retire the sleeping is a Shanti love
Be careful now don't wake it up
It's never gonna last
It's never gonna make it back alive
So how can we relax
I really hope that we will actually survive

A real love survives a rock steady vibe
A real love survives a rock steady vibe

It's never gonna last
It's never gonna makes it back alive
So how can we relax
I really hope that we will actually survive

A real love survives a rock steady vibe
A real love survives a rock steady vibe

Rock steady
Our love is so rock steady
Rock steady, rock steady
