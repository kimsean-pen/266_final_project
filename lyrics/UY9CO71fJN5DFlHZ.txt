I'm not sure what this is like
Four steps farward, two steps right
Round in circles, i don't mind
I said this before 'cause I know what you're like
Take me down or take me out
Take me down or take me out

You talk too much I can't keep up
'Cause you took my hand when you took my hands
I'm all choked up that's close enough
'Cause you took my hand when you took my hands
Oh-oh

Your lips taste like 2 A.M.
Same old story different end
Is that the reason you keep on feelin'
All of this empty thoughts you believe in?
This one's on me, though 'cause I keep on feelin'
Sure this is fun, but that's all it is
So, take me down or take me out

You talk too much I can't keep up
'Cause you took my hand when you took my hands
I'm all choked up that's close enough
'Cause you took my hand when you took my hands
Oh-oh

My hands
Oh, you took my hands
Oh, you took my hands
Oh, you took my hands

Oh, you took my hands
Oh, you took my hands
Oh, you took my hands
Oh, you took my hands

You know it's heavy on your chest, oh, man
It's happening all over again, oh, damn
It's nothin' we can never bear to stand
It started when you took my hands, oh
Take me down or take me out
Take me down or take me out

You talk too much I can't keep up
'Cause you took my hand when you took my hands
I'm all choked up that's close enough
'Cause you took my hand when you took my hands
Oh-oh
Took my hands
Oh-oh
