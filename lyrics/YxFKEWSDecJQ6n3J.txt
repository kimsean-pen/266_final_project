You're my favourite daydream
I'm your famous nightmare
Everything I see looks like gold
Everything I touch goes cold
Castles in the snow

Here's all I know
Your checkered room and your velvet bow
Your Elvis song in my ear
That moonlit voice that I hear

Now we are old as bread
We walk along our golden crest
We hide away for a week
We only look and don't speak

You're my favourite daydream
I'm your famous nightmare
Everything I see looks like gold
Everything I touch turns cold
Castles in the snow

You're my favourite daydream
I'm your famous nightmare
Everything I see looks like gold
Everything I touch turns cold
Castles in the snow

Here's all I know
Your checkered room and your velvet bow
Your Elvis song in my ear
That moonlit voice that I hear
