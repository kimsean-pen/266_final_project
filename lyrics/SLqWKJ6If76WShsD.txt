Down here the river
Meets the sea
And in the sticky heat I feel ya'
Open up to me
Love comes out of nowhere baby, just like a hurricane
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain

Lying here
Underneath the stars
Right next to you
And I'm wondering who you are
And how do you do?
How do you do, baby?
The clouds roll in
Across the moon
And the wind howls out your name
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain

We never
Going to make that bridge tonight, baby
Across lake Ponchartrain
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain

So batten down the hatch, baby
And leave your heart up your sleeve
It looks like we're in for stormy weather
That ain't no cause for us to leave
Just lay here
In my arms
Let it wash away the pain
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain

(Feels like rain) (feels, feels like rain)
(And it feels like rain) (oh yeah, oh yeah) (feels like rain)
(Heey) (rain) (feels) (rain) (you know it feels
like rain) (oh yeah) (sometimes, but it feels like rain)
