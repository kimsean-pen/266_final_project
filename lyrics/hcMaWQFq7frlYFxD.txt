Thinking about our loneliness
As well as our togetherness
Rather die as us than you and I
Let me take pictures of your shadows
Capture your counters, edit them in might
Save them in my heart
Run away, Lucifer
Run away, Lucifer
We're choosing darkness over lightning
Can I get my heart beating together with yours?
Can I feel your last breath in my neck?
Can I leave my body inside of yours?
Get your body with the color of our lost
Run away, Lucifer
Run away, Lucifer
We're choosing darkness over lightning
Run away, Lucifer
Run away, Lucifer
We're choosing darkness over lightning
Run away, Lucifer
Run away, Lucifer
We're choosing darkness over lightning
Run away, Lucifer
Run away, Lucifer
We're choosing darkness over lightning
