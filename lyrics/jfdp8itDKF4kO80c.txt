My heart is burning with jealousy
You lit the flame
You blinded me
You let me smolder
Then pulled me out
You stepped right on me
You left no doubt

After all you've done
I deserve some peace
I'm on my knees

There's a fire in your eyes
When you're holding a cigarette
But you hold me
You don't hold me
Keep blowing smoke till you fade to a silhouette
You should've told me
You didn't want me (ayy, ayya, ayya)
You should've told me
You didn't want me (yeah, ayya, ayya, yeah)
You should've told me
You didn't want me

You wear my heart down under my belief
You're in my chest and
It's hard to breathe
It's like addiction
It's all I know
I'm just so used to not letting go

After all you've done
I deserve some peace
I'm on my knees

'Cause there's a fire in your eyes
When you're holding a cigarette
But you hold me
You don't hold me
Keep blowing smoke till you fade to a ailhouette
You should've told me
You didn't want me (ayy, ayya, ayya)
You should've told me
You didn't want me (yeah, ayya, ayya, yeah)
You should've told me
You didn't want me

Oh it's a dark and twisted fate
'Cause I'm the one you never crave
And you'll never text, you'll never crave
'Cause you'll never change

There's a fire in your eyes
When you're holing a cigarette
But you don't hold me,
No you don't hold me
You keep blowing smoke till you fade to a silhouette
You should've told me
You didn't want me (ayy, ayya, ayya)
You should've told me
You didn't want me (yeah, ayya, ayya, yeah)
You should've told me
You didn't want me
