Time is the promise
It turns and tells them what to do
It makes them dishonest
They let the suspicion kill the truth

Broken Heart, Broken Mind
When you let me in
Did you not know where I had been?

And love's what they wasted
A lie that makes their dreams come true
They're hiding their faces
Their smiles can break the heart in two

Broken Heart, Broken Mind
When you let me in
Did you not know where I had been?
