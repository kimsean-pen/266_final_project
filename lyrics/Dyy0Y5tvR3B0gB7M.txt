Rise - shining blank
Scars burn way down
It parts ways of the
Serpent view - cast
Stones where to stop
Calling you - they all
Lower me to the ground
Stick him - they all
Lower me to the soil
Stick him

Star - reign down
On you

You'll starve
Bright star in the
Dripping sun
Writhe on - saints
Steal from your actions
Step in right on it's
Function - stick him

Star - reign down
On you

You all lower me
Christ's shine blinds
Your world
Your belief is scars

The will to power
Ascension manifest
That which is above
Is as that which is below
Thy will be done
Thy kingdom come
On earth as it is in heaven
So mote it be
