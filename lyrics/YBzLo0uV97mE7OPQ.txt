Buring from the inside out
Bloody foam spews from your mouth
Smell the putrid stench of flesh
As it burns you to your death

Feel the flesh drip from your face
Turing black, vision fades
Eyeballs melt into their sockets
Involuntarily set ablaze

Gutwrenching screams fill the air
The rancid smell of burning hair
Screaming in excruciating pain
Blood boils over, warping veins
Burnt skull collapses onto melting brains
Spontaneous death, up in flames
Twisting and writhing as life burns away
Until nothing is left but charred remains
