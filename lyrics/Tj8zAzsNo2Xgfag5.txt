Woman, never before
Without a word, I hear so much
Woman, under the spell
Every sin holy in your touch

It's all I feel, it's all I see
And all I know is it must be you
You're the spell I'm under
It must be you
You're the spell I'm under

Woman, how deep can I go?
Every inch born a new obsession
Woman, how did you know?
That I couldn't have helped myself from comin' closer

To the oracle of faith taboo
All my temptation hooked on you
You're the spell I'm under
I know it must be you
You're the spell I'm under

Feels like a drug
My will revealed in your spell
I remember

You're all I feel, you're all I see
Revolving in the need for you
You're the spell I'm under
I know it must be you
You're the spell I'm under

Feels like a drug from long
You're the spell I'm under
Feels like a drug
Feels like a drug
Didn't take very long
