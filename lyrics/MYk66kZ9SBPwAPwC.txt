I apologized for what I said
But I still meant it
I know that I live in my head
You won't let me forget it
I promised that I tried
But walls don't break, and words don't mean enough
I swear I never meant to lose my grip on something that I loved

I'll be laying on my deathbed
And I'll tell you that I fucked it up
Yeah, I'll be laying on my deathbed
'Cause I love you but it's not enough

I'm praying something's gonna give
Yeah, I know I feel it
And the pendulum is gonna swing
And rotate the seasons
I promise that I'll try
To be a person you deserve at all
'Cause maybe if I change
You'll let me in when I wanna come home

I'll be laying on my deathbed
And I'll tell you that I fucked it up
Yeah, I'll be laying on my deathbed
'Cause I love you but it's not enough

I promised that I tried
But walls don't break, and words don't mean enough
I swear I never meant to lose my grip on something that I loved
