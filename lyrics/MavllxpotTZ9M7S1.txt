It's a kind of dream
It's a kind of dream
It's a kind of dream, no way to wake up from

Though you cannot trust instinct that will break or fail
Feel the body bend now running off the cliff to fly
It's a kind of pain
It's a kind of pain
it's a kind of pain, nothing brings relief from

Become a tower
A concrete tower
Become a picture
A pretty picture

It's a kind of lie
It's a kind of lie

Black blood flowing through your bones too weak to
It's a kind of lie
It's a kind of lie

Make the brain bend cant do without my
Gives me a cold stare
That man standing there
Becomes a (unknown)
Become an empty chair

It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind

Become a tower
A concrete tower
Become a picture
A pretty picture

It's all in my mind
