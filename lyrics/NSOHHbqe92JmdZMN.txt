After all these years
I know I've said my piece
But still when I think of you
It makes me grind my teeth and cry
Can't help but picture you with someone other than me
Such a sickening image
It makes me grind my teeth and cry
I can't stop, can't stop grinding my teeth
I can't stop, can't stop grinding my teeth
I can't stop, can't stop
Everything is a stresser
Grind your teeth threw the pressure
