your virgin light is a golden flame
but it's burning it's burning fast now
you crossed the line and you made a choice
you hurt the one you love now he needs you

mercy i can't see your heart
i can't feel your love
mercy i can't see your heart
i can't feel your love

your life is like a song you're living like a fool
you're living like a fool but i can't tell you right
you're taking all the time you're taking all my time
you're living like a fool
and i can't tell you right

mercy i can't see your heart
i can't feel your love
mercy i can't see your heart
i can't feel your love
