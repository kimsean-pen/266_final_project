Well... I won't be caught living in a dead end job (job)
While praying to my government, guns, and God (God)
Now it's us against them
We're here to represent
And spit right in the face of the establishment
And now I don't believe (In having faith in nothing!)
Stand on my own (Got no sympathy!)
Wasting the youth (While being young and useless!)
Speak for yourself (And don't pray for me!)

Well because we're doing fine
And we don't need to be told
That we're doing fine
Cause we won't give you control
And we don't need anything from you.
Cause we'll be just fine
And we won't be bought and sold
Just like you

(A call across the underclass)
Calling out loud with no respect (spect)
I'm not the one, just another reject (ject)
I'm the voice to offend
All those who pretend
Unsung against the grain I'm here to rise against
And now I'm desensitized (I state my place in nowhere!)
Burning the flag (Of the degeneration!)
Everyone sing (The anthem of no future!)
Down with the mass ('Cause we're not listening!)

Well because we're doing fine
And we don't need to be told
That we're doing fine
Cause we won't give you control
And we don't need anything from you
Cause we'll be just fine
And we won't be bought and sold
Just like you

(May I have your attention please...)
(I pledge allegiance to the underclass as your hero at large.)

We're the saints of, degeneration
We don't owe anyone an explanation
Fuck elitists
We don't need this
We're the elite of just alright
And well because, we're doing fine
And we don't need to be told
That we're doing fine
Cause we won't give you control
And we don't need anything from you
Cause we'll be just fine
And we won't be bought and sold
Just like you
