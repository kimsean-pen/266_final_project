No one haunts me like you do
And the darkness of my bedroom
It's hard when what we went through
Chases me round, chases me round

How do you stay there in my mind
Doin' everything to fill my time
When you choose to walk out of what you
Hitting me now, hitting me now

Oh my, Oh my God, I'm freaking out
Like, what the, what the, what you calling 'bout
Been like, seven months since we, since we kicked it now
I just need to kick you out of my head

Oh my, Oh my God, I'm freaking out
Haven't even seen you since our falling out
Been like, seven months since we, since we kicked it now
I just need to kick you out of my head

What did I do to deserve this
These feelings makin' me nervous
Please teach me how to unlearn this
Don't want it back, don't want it back

Somehow in the conversation
Friends talk about you, and i hate it
Wish I could just erase,
Stop thinking about you, thinking about you

Oh my, Oh my God, I'm freaking out
Like, what the, what the, what you calling 'bout
Been like, seven months since we, since we kicked it now
I just need to kick you out of my head

Oh my, Oh my God, I'm freaking out
Haven't even seen you since our falling out
Been like, seven months since we, since we kicked it now
I just need to kick you out of my head

Kick you out of my, yeah
And kick you out of my,
Kick of out of my,
Ah, ah, ah, ah
oh my, oh my God, I'm freaking out
Like, what the, what the, what you calling 'bout
Been like, seven months since we, since we kicked it now
I just need to kick you out of my head

Oh my, Oh my God, I'm freaking out
Haven't even seen you since our falling out
Been like, seven months since we, since we kicked it now
I just need to kick you out of my head

(Kick you out of my head)
Kick you out of my
