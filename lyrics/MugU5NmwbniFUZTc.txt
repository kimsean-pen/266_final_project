We should be headin' for the top now
We've have a hundred thousand years
We should've found a little heaven in our soul
That should've washed away the tears
Instead we're wasted all the time
And there's a thousand ways to cry
And in our haste to find a little more from life
We didn't notice that we'd died
And we'll be losin' all the time
We'll be choking back the tears
And we'll be seein' only white light in our mind
And it's been blinding us for years
She got a rhythm in her soul
She got a rainbow in her eyes
She gotta little bit of hurtin' deep inside
And its hurt you're gonna try

And I've been shooting up my time
I've been holdin' down the fear
We should be headin' for the top now little child
But I've been rotting here for years
And we'll be calling the dark
I'll be holding back the shame
We should be headin' for the top now little child
But she'll be dancing on your grave
And I'll be calling for a god
I'll be calling out for more
And I've been given all the riches in my heart
That she'll be selling at the door
She got a heavy duty soul
She got a twinkle in her eye
And she's polluting all the air waves with her song
And it's a song I'm gonna buy

And then she comes into my room
She caught me messin' on the floor
She got a little bit of heaven in her soul
That got me crawlin' back for more
She got a rumour in her heart
She got a twinkle in her eye
She got a little bit of hurtin' deep inside
And it's a hurt I'm gonna try
But her ambition's such a drag
She made a coffin for my dreams
And now I'm losing all I had now
To stay in love by any means
And I'm forgettin' all the time
I should've photographed my mind
She got a little bit of heaven deep inside
And its a heaven I should find

And there's a stagger in our walk
And there's a stutter in our name
And you'll be seeing only white light
And there'll be nothing more to gain

We should be headin' for the top now
We've had a hundred thousand years
Instead we're losing all we got now
To cry a hundred thousand tears

We should be heading for the top now
But we'll be crawling on the floor
Instead we're losing all we got now
To cry a hundred thousand more

Mary, Mary quite contrary
How does your future go?
Backstreet dealin'
Midnight stealin'
Oh does your mother know?

Sadie, Sadie
Quite the lady
How does your fortune grow?
Fixin' hustlin'
Pimpin' cussin'
Don't let the damage show
