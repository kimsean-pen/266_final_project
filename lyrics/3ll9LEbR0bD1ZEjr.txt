It's the mask you hide behind
But I can change your mind
It can bring us back from wrong
Bring it back to where we belong
There's a pressure to do what's good
I'd only did everything we could, we could

Let's disappear, let's disappear
Let's get outta here, let's get outta here
We're movin' on, we're movin' on

I went out blind in the night
A silhouette to the light
Even before the dead at sea
I saw your eyes had strength in me
And the pressure to do what's good
I wanna do everything I should, I should

So let's disappear, let's disappear
Let's get outta here, get outta here
We're movin' on, we're movin' on
We're movin' on, we're movin' on

Let's disappear, let's disappear
Let's get outta here, get outta here
We're movin' on, we're movin' on

Let me disappear away, away with you
We can run and get away to something new
Let me disappear away, away with you

Ya we're movin' on
Let's disappear, let's disappear
Let's get outta here, let's get outta here
We're movin' on, we're movin' on
We're movin' on, we're movin' on

Let's disappear, let's disappear
Let's get outta here, get outta here
We're movin' on, we're movin' on
