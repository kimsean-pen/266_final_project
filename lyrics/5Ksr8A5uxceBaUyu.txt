Vesuvius, I am here
You are all I have
Fire of fire, I'm insecure
For it is all been made to plan

Though I know I will fail
I cannot be made to laugh
For in life as in death
I'd rather be burned than be living in debt

Vesuvius, are you ghost
Or the symbols of light
Or a fantasy host?

In your breast I carry the form
The heart of the Earth
And the weapons of warmth

Vesuvius, the tragic oath
For you have destroyed
What the elegants know

Oracle, I've fallen at last
But they were the feast
Of a permanent blast

Vesuvius, oh, be kind
It hasn't occurred
No, it hasn't been said

Sufjan, follow the path
It leads to an article of imminent death
Sufjan, follow your heart
Follow the flame or fall on the floor
Sufjan, the panic inside
The murdering ghost that you cannot ignore

Vesuvius, fire of fire
Follow me now
As I favor the ghost

Vesuvius, fire of fire
Follow me now
As I favor the ghost

Vesuvius, fire of fire
Follow me now
As I favor the ghost

Vesuvius, fire of fire
Follow me now
As I favor the ghost

Vesuvius, fire of fire
Follow me now
As I favor the ghost

Vesuvius, fire of fire
Follow me now
As I favor the ghost

Vesuvius, fire of fire
Follow me now
As I favor the ghost

Follow me now
Or follow me down
Why does it have to be so hard?

Follow me now
Or follow me down
Why does it have to be so hard?

Follow me now
Or follow me down
Why does it have to be so hard?
