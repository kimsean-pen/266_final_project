Eight-oh-five
I guess you're leaving soon
I can't go on without you
it's useless to try

To love you is so good
keep you would be so wonderful
Here is my heart that I give
it's all that I have

Please change your mind
before my sunshine is gone
Do you think you could try?
Do you think you could try?
Do you think you could try?
(solo)
Please change your mind
before my sunshine is gone
Do you think you could try?
Do you think you could try?
Do you think you could try?

See it through
until I can prove it to you
Don't fill my world with rain
You know your tears
would only bring pain in my heart

Eight-oh-five
I guess you're leaving, goodbye
