This house
she's holding secrets
I got my change behind the bed

in a coffee can
I throw my nickels in
just in case I have to leave

and I will go if you ask me to
i will stay if you dare
and if I go i'm goin shameless
I'll let my hunger take me there

This house
she's quite the talker
she creeks and moans
she keeps me up

And the photographs
know I'm a liar
they just laugh

as I burn her down
and i will go if you ask me to
i will stay if you dare
and if i go i'm goin on fire

let my anger take me there
the shingles man they're shaking
the back door's burning through
this house she's quite the keeper
quite the keeper of you
i will go if you ask me to
i will stay if you dare
and if i go, i'm goin crazy
i'll let my darlin take me there
