Thank you for your silence, your continuing compliance
It's your head buried so deep in sand that ushered in the virus
Oh no please don't lift a finger
Don't get up, just sit right there, don't worry about the thoughts
Inside your pretty little head, so we stick to the script and recite your lines
Don't break from the character just keep it inside

But this is bullshit, it's finally coming into focus
You're lying and I think you know it
But you're too afraid to face the storm you helped create
Yeah this is bullshit and did you think I wouldn't notice?
Cracks in your theory are showing like a broken vase
Your grip around me dissipates

And we are separated only by division and the walls that we create
But we are more alike than different
When we stop and take a minute face to face
They say we're divided and we are conquered
Yeah, but our enemies have never been each other, no

Because this is bullshit, it's finally coming into focus
You're lying and I think you know it
But you're too afraid to face the storm you helped create
Yeah this is bullshit and did you think I wouldn't notice?
Cracks in your theory are showing like a broken vase
Your grip around me dissipates

So we scale the walls and fire escapes, a wheat paste brush and cans of paint
To cover up your walls with something new
Because we all know
Your signs say we're not good enough, not cute enough, not smart enough
Not worth your love, out with the old and in with something new

Bullshit, I'm not sorry to say
That this is bullshit, you been lying to me
Bullshit and it always was
And you know and you know and you know and you know

Yeah this is bullshit coming right at you
Bullshit coming home to roost, bullshit and you're too afraid
To face the storm you helped create
This is bullshit, this is bullshit, bullshit and you're too afraid to face the storm you helped create
