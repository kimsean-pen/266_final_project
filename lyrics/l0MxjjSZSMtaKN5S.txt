Said I'd moved on and I'd leave it alone
But before I walk out there is something that I need you to know
I got lost in a blink of an eye
And I can never get back

No, I never got back
You were not there when I wanted to say
That you were everything right
And it wasn't you but me that changed
Now I got to go it alone

But I'll never give up
No, I'll never give up
What am I fighting for?
There must be something more

For all these words I sing
Do you feel anything?
Said I'm okay but I know how to lie
You were all that I had
You were delicate and hard to find

Got lost in the back of my mind
And I can never get back
No, I never got back
You were not there when I needed to say
I hit the bottom so fast
That my head was spinning 'round for days

Now I gotta go it alone
But I will never give up
No, I'll never give up
What am I fighting for?

There must be something more

For all these words I sing

Do you feel anything?
What am I fighting for?
What am I fighting for?
Never give up on this

Never give up on this
Never give up on this

Never give up on this
Said I'm okay but I know how to lie
I will never give up
No, I'll never give up

What am I fighting for?
There must be something more

For all these words I sing
Do you feel anything?
What am I fighting for?
(No, I'm never gonna give up, give up)
What am I fighting for?
(No, I'm never gonna give up, give up)
Said that I'd fight for the one that I've found
I'm gonna stay here while I wait
For you to come around
I fight, you're a part of me now
And I will never give up
No, I'll never give up
