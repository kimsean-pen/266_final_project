Could it be you, calling me down
My foolish heart, turns out the stars
All that I am, is all that you see
You don't need nobody else
And you're putting this all on me
Forgetting that
There's no greater love, just open your eyes
Just hold out your hand, and place it in mine
Forever it's you, forever it's me,
You don't need nobody else it's all yours but you fail to see

It's all yours,
It's all yours,
It's all yours,
You don't need nobody else because all that you need is me

You give to me, body and soul
Reading between the cracks in the walls
So we have no time, times all we need
You don't need nobody else and I know that you still believe
You never come, come when I call
You never run, when I trip and fall
I lie awake, I lie awake forever more
You don't need nobody else, it's all yours but you fail to see

It's all yours,
It's all yours,
It's all yours,
You don't need nobody else because all that you need is me
