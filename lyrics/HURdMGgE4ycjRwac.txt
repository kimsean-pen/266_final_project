I am caught, tangled in, wrapped and quartered
Shipping out and over
Time, lived again
For just a moment
Missing pieces find me
I sweat and I ache for your eyes and the way you breathe

And I wake, say your name
And I wake, saying your name

You are more than warm belief
Melting skywards
Walled in silence broken
I'm whole again
For just a moment
'Till the morning comes

And I wake, say your name
And I wake, saying your name

Oh she said you better believe it, and I said you don't love
Oh you said you better be there

Time, lived again
For just a moment
Missing pieces find me
And I'm whole again
For just a moment
Missing pieces find me

Time, lived again
For just a moment
Missing pieces find me
And I'm whole again
Whole again
Whole again
