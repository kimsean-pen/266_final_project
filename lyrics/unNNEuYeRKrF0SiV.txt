Is this happening to me?
Have I lost all my defenses?
Should I wait around and see
What it's like to lose my senses?

Always looking for the chase
From the high ground to the ditches
But the chase I'll never miss
Now I know what happiness is

This love's delicious
Like home-cooked dishes
I'm tasting mischievously

Step 1, come a little closer
Step 2, rest upon my shoulder
Step 3, I'm calling you "baby"
Three steps away from me (Three steps, three steps)

Step 4, we can get married
Step 5, top it with a cherry
Step 6, as good as it gets
Now come along and step with me (Three steps, three steps)

Sun is shining up my head
In thirty years we'll still be happy
Making movies in my head
Making Hoolywood look tiny

Don't know why but all your words
Sound just like a melody
From the pieces that I've heard
I could build a symphony

This love's delicious
Like home-cooked dishes
I'm tasting mischievously

Step 1, come a little closer
Step 2, rest upon my shoulder
Step 3, I'm calling you "baby"
Three steps away from me (Three steps, three steps)

Step 4, we can get married
Step 5, top it with a cherry
Step 6, as good as it gets
Now come along and step with me (Three steps, three steps)

Step 1, I don't even know ya
Step 2, come a little closer
Step 3, you can't even see you're three steps away from loving me

Step 1, come a little closer
Step 2, rest upon my shoulder
Step 3, I'm calling you "baby"
Three steps away from me (Three steps, three steps)

Step 4, we can get married
Step 5, top it with a cherry
Step 6, as good as it gets
Now come along and step with me (Three steps, three steps)

Step 1, come a little closer
Step 2, rest upon my shoulder
Step 3, I'm calling you "baby"
Three steps away from me (Three steps, three steps)

Step 4, we can get married
Step 5, top it with a cherry
Step 6, as good as it gets
Now come along and step with me (Three steps, three steps)
