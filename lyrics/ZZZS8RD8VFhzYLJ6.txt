Men in white coats
Ring the changes
Call us Fathers
Call us strangers

Men in white coats
Making white heat
Kill or cure you

We know what is best for you
Run just one more test for you
We know what we're doing don't we
We know what we're doing don't we

Men in white coats
Used to hiding
In the spotlight
Brightly shining

Brainwave heatwave coming on
Men in white coats can't go wrong
We know what we're doing don't we
We know what we're doing don't we

Stripped down naked
People question
Power's ours without election
Won't forget our broken promise
Turn to gods for sweeter solace
Don't ask questions
Call us Fathers
Loyal servants to your masters

We know what is best for you
Run just one more test for you
We know what we're doing don't we
We know what we're doing don't we

Men in white coats
Push the limits
Count you down
The final minutes

Men in white coats
Push the limits
Count you down
The final minutes

Men in white coats
Push the limits
Count you down
The final minutes
