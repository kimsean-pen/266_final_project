Run to the hills you should trust me
You doubt
Anyway we would lost it
You try to figure out
Run to the hills you should trust me
You doubt
There is no time for reflection
'Cause you have to shout

I trust myself always
I'm paranoid all day
What can i do
Nothing
But can you just
Shut your mouth
I trust myself always
I'm paranoid all day
It's all the same
My hit
When things are wrong
We need rouse

I won't have a decision
You go
And I know that's the reason
To lose any goal
And I say you're vampire
You go
Can change only nothing
But you have to know

I trust myself always
I'm paranoid all day
What can i do
Nothing
But can you just
Shut your mouth
I trust myself always
I'm paranoid all day
It's all the same
My hit
When things are wrong
We need rouse
