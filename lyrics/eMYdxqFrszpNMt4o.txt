We're walking within a shadow
Where echoes of different times resound
Looking for memories to relive
In yesterdays that can't be found

Through different eyes we keep looking for what we lack
Changing minds take us away, and you can't go back

And staring into ageless eyes
That shared secrets too dark for light
We're searching for old bonds in places
That lie forever out of sight

Through different eyes we keep looking for what we lack
Changing minds take us away and you can't go back
To different times or ageless eyes, free from sorrow
Changing hearts will hide the past from tomorrow

Through different eyes we try to find
People and places we've left behind

Through different eyes we keep looking for what we lack
Changing minds take us away, and you can't go back
To different times or ageless eyes, free from sorrow
Changing hearts will hide the past from tomorrow

Through different eyes we keep looking for what we lack
Changing minds take us away, and you can't go back
Through different eyes we keep looking for what we lack
