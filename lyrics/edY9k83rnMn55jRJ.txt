Something about you that makes me feel bad
I wasn't there when a thin line destroyed your soul

I search every corner, there's nowhere to hide
How I feel, ignorant sacrifice
Some days, it's harder
Let's face it, it's all about me
Deeply into your own

Deep within me
Life's crawling and wasting my days
Another night gone
And I know there will be another way
I'm leading myself to be free
In this eternal goodbye

Something about you will make me stronger
Now I'm aware when a man falls rebound, my fault

I search every corner, there's nowhere to hide
How I feel, ignorant sacrifice
Some days, it's harder
Let's face it, it's all about me
Deeply into your own

Deep within me
Life's crawling and wasting my days
Another night gone
And I know there will be another way
I'm leading myself to be free
In this eternal goodbye, goodbye

Here I wanna be
No more lies
Here I wanna be
Here I wanna be
No more lies
Here I wanna be
Deep within me
Life's crawling and wasting my days
Another night gone
And I know there will be another way
I'm leading myself to be free
In this eternal goodbye
