I make love to mountain lions
Sleep on red-hot branding irons
When I walk the roadway shakes
Bed's a mess of rattlesnakes

Voodoo child, black cat bone
Scratch your back, can hear your moan
Get me up, you go down
Tall building, single bound

War and peace, peace and love
Say it if you dare
Iron fist, velvet glove
I'm so bad, baby I don't care

Black-hearted to the bone
Older than The Rolling Stones
Been to Heaven, been to Hell
Bought the farm and I won't sell

Give and take, rise and fall
Rise up and take it all
Secret love, I won't tell
Knock you up and ring your bell

Kiss the whip, eat the gun
Tell me it ain't fair
Midnight victim, hit and run
I'm so bad, baby I don't care

I make the blind to see
Shoot them full of R&B
I make the lame to walk
Come round, I'll pop your cork

Wham, bam, thank you ma'am
I thought I heard the back door slam
Overkill, walk the line
Kill the lights, it's lampshade time

On the road, on the lam
People running scared
I'm everything they say I am
I'm so bad, baby I don't care
