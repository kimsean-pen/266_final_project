I just want some closure
But then that means it's over
Sometimes I push away
But then you pull me closer
Cause you want a love like this with, no goodbyes
Then you wanna go back and forth, press rewind
Can't tell you I'm the one
Maybe we'll fall in love again
I just wanna say what's on my mind
Where do we go from here
If the feelings right
But it's not the time
Where do we go from here
When it feels too much
But then it's not enough
Where do we go from here
Where do we go from here
Where do we go from here
If the feelings right
But it's not the time

You gave me countless options
So many sacrifices
I threw so many dices
But none of them work for me
Cause you want a love like this with, no goodbyes
You wanna go back and forth, press rewind
Can't tell you I'm the one
Maybe we'll fall in love again
I just wanna say what's on my mind
Where do we go from here
If the feelings right
But it's not the time
Where do we go from here
When it feels too much
But then it's not enough
Where do we go from here
Where do we go from here (Where do we go)
Where do we go from here
If the feelings right
But it's not the time

Love like this with
Love like this
You wanna go back and forth
Go back and forth
Can't tell you I'm the one
Can't tell you I'm the one
Where do we go from here
If the feelings right
But it's not the time (Not the time yeah)
Where do we go from here (Where do we go)
When it feels too much
But then it's not enough (Not enough)
Where do we go from here (Where do we go from here)
Where do we go from here (Where do we go)
Where do we go from here
If the feelings right
But it's not the time (Not the time)
