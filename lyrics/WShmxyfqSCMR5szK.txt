Days behold
Lives unfold
Can't move on
So much untold
Shades of gold
We've been sold
Been deceived
While we believe

If today is all we see
Then tomorrow seems to me
Is just an illusion we believe

Strive to see
Hope to be
To be some small part of eternity

If today is all we see
Then tomorrow seems to me is
Just an illusion we believe
