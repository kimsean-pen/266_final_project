I think I saw you in a magazine
Your airbrushed face was looking back at me
I don't know what part of you is real, when they bathe you in their sex appeal

Oh, how I wonder what it's like to be living in your life
It must be kinda nice
Everyone wants a piece of you, even if it isn't true
They're in love with what you do

I wanna rock up in the red dress
Say my name, I'm on the guest list
I wanna stay right here in my fantasy
I wanna live like you in vanity
The possibilities are endless
Over time I'm feeling reckless
I wanna stay right here in my fantasy
I wanna live like you in vanity

I think I saw you in a limousine, tinted windows and leather seats
And I wanna know where you've been
And what's happening behind the scenes

Oh, how I wonder what it's like to be living in your life
It must be kinda nice
Everyone wants a piece of you, even if it isn't true
They're in love with what you do

I wanna rock up in the red dress
Say my name, I'm on the guest list
I wanna stay right here in my fantasy
I wanna live like you in vanity
The possibilities are endless
Over time I'm feeling reckless
I wanna stay right here in my fantasy
I wanna live like you in vanity
I wanna stay right here in my fantasy
I wanna live like you in vanity
I wanna stay right here in my fantasy
I wanna live like you in vanity

Vanity is my favourite T

I wanna rock up in the red dress
Say my name, I'm on the guest list
I wanna stay right here in my fantasy
I wanna live like you
The possibilities are endless
Over time I'm feeling reckless
I wanna stay right here in my fantasy
I wanna live like you in vanity
I wanna stay right here in my fantasy
I wanna live like you in vanity
I wanna stay right here in my fantasy
I wanna live like you in vanity
