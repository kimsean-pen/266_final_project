I got a girlfriend
she said she loves me
she likes to hold hands
she once told me

cos she don't mind
nothing, nothing
yeah she don't mind
nothing, nothing

she's got a blue car
she said I can use it
let's take the guys out
I like to loose it

cos she don't mind
nothing, nothing
well she don't mind
nothing, nothing
