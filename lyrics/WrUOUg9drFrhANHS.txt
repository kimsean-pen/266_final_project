There you go flashing fever from your eyes
Hey baby, come over here and shut them tight
I'm not denying, we're flyin' above it all

Hold my hand, don't let me fall
You've such amazing grace, I've never felt this way

Oh, show me heaven
Cover me, leave me breathless

Oh, show me heaven please
Here I go, I'm shakin' just like the breeze

Hey baby, I need your hand to steady me
I'm not denying, I'm frightened as much as you

Though I'm barely touching you

I've shivers down my spine and it feels divine
Oh, show me heaven
Cover me, leave me breathless
Oh, show me heaven please
If you know what it's like to dream a dream
Baby, hold me tight and let this be oh heaven
Cover me, leave me breathless
Oh, show me heaven please
Leave me breathless
Leave me breathless
Cover me, oh yeah
Leave me breathless
