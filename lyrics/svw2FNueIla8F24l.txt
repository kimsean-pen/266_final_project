Walking in the rain but I'm still calling out your name
You say you tryna leave but babe I know you wanna stay
It's colder in Alaska so I'll meet you in the bay
I'm on the way to catch the track I'll meet you on the plane

Walking in the rain but I'm still calling out your name
You say you tryna leave but babe I know you wanna stay
It's colder in Alaska so I'll meet you in the bay
I'm on the way to catch the track I'll meet you on the plane

You tryna smoke so babe I'm on the way
I know you want my love so babe you know I'm here to stay
No matter what you need know I'll get right on the bay
We in between the sheets and now I'm kissing on your face
Sometimes I really wonder why you make me act this way
While geeking out with shorty I be cooling in the shade
And other news, you know I know I tend to complicate
My phase it didn't go, singing oh, I hit the hay
Hit the crossroads and now I'm dodging in them lanes
Perpetrating ass n*ggas think I'm hard but they at stake
Keep a skully out cuz n*iggas out here robbing every day
They the reason of the problem I don't even gotta say

Walking in the rain but I'm still calling out your name
You say you tryna leave but babe I know you wanna stay
It's colder in Alaska so I'll meet you in the bay
I'm on the way to catch the track I'll meet you on the plane

Walking in the rain but I'm still calling out your name
You say you tryna leave but babe I know you wanna stay
It's colder in Alaska so I'll meet you in the bay
I'm on the way to catch the track I'll meet you on the plane

Fuck, two Js piece but I don't need it man
She tryna fuck but I don't really need her, damn
I don't need an AC, just need a ceiling fan
These haters talking down on me I'll be like f*cking fag
I'm finna be overseas with my f*cking fan
Say fuck n*gga you is not in my f*cking band
We rolling 60 ain't that sheepish we don't give a damn
Pop a molly at a show cuz I don't f*ck wth xanex
Sipping lake while out most days cuz I'm gon' get it in
Step in the mall but don't buy shit cuz I'm not with a bitch
You won't ever catch me cooling with a normal bitch
I just running up the benz she tryna stuck my chips
Counting hundreds and them fifties all up on my wrist

Walking in the rain but I'm still calling out your name
You say you tryna leave but babe I know you wanna stay
It's colder in Alaska so I'll meet you in the bay
I'm on the way to catch the track I'll meet you on the plane

Walking in the rain but I'm still calling out your name
You say you tryna leave but babe I know you wanna stay
It's colder in Alaska so I'll meet you in the bay
I'm on the way to catch the track I'll meet you on the plane
