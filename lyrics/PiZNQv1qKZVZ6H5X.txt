Bad boys / Sad girls
Death sure makes a fuss
What are we gonna do when it comes for us?
Nite descends moonlessly / Cops are humming tunelessly
Walking in a straight line
Cold pistol in the inner coat pocket
I hope he don't hear commotion in the park
I hope he don't hear strange animal in the dark

I'm walking alone / The streets are so wet
I'm walking alone / The only thing bright is the streetlight
The only thing warm is the blood in our veins
So I think of warm days as a getaway
Like Valentino in Blood & Sand
It's another sleet nite / The only thing bright is the streetlight
I'm walking alone / The streets are so wet
I'm walking alone / The only thing bright is the streetlight
The only thing warm is the blood in our veins
So I think of warm days as a getaway
It's another sleet nite / The only thing bright is the streetlight
I'm walking alone
Life is borrowed / Sometimes blue
