If we all fall down, we
Fall before moving wheels
Crushed between the gears
If we fall in line, we
See that this path leads straight
Into the great machine
If we all fall down, we're
Swallowed by hopelessness
Digested by their need
If we fall in line, we're
Cycled through as the blood
Keeping it alive

I cannot take it anymore (I cannot take it anymore)
I feel it bleed out on the floor (I feel it bleed out on the floor)
You are a lost cause (You are a lost cause)
You are a lost cause

Watch the world burn
It sets the air on fire
Watch the world burn
We are the arson
Watch the world burn
It sets the air on fire
Watch the world burn
We are the arson

If we break their hold, we
Open our arms to fight
Unleashing the light
If we stand our ground, we
Become the enemy
The revolution sounds
If we break their hold, we're
Faced down by everything
Challenged with a war
If we stand our ground, we're
Sacrificing ourselves
To save so much more

I cannot take it anymore (I cannot take it anymore)
I feel it bleed out on the floor (I feel it bleed out on the floor)
You are a lost cause (You are a lost cause)
You are a lost cause

Watch the world burn
It sets the air on fire
Watch the world burn
We are the arson
Watch the world burn
It sets the air on fire
Watch the world burn
We are the arson

Holding the breath now
Don't make a sound, don't make a sound
We are the arson
We burn it down, we burn it down

I cannot take it anymore (I cannot take it anymore)
I feel it bleed out on the floor (I feel it bleed out on the floor)
You are a lost cause (You are a lost cause)
You are a lost cause

Watch the world burn
It sets the air on fire
Watch the world burn
We are the arson
Watch the world burn
It sets the air on fire
Watch the world burn
We are the arson

We are the arson
We are the arson
We are the arson
Watch the world burn
We are the arson
We are the arson
We are the arson
Watch the world burn
