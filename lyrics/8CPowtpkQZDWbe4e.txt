Wake up in the dead of night
Dogs are turning wild
Run into what's wrong each time
Fail to get it right
Fighting off this heavy heart
Keeping your head high
Oh, won't you please forget
Won't you please forget

These are the dog days, these are the dog days
Leading our hearts astray
These are the dog days, these are the dog days
Soon they will fade away
One, two, three, four, what are you waiting for?
One, two, three, four, what are you waiting for?
These are the dog days, these are the dog days

Awakened by the dreams at night
Chills run down your spine
The brightest star in summer skies
Brings madness to our minds
Fighting off the darkest thoughts
Fighting to survive
Oh, won't you please forget
Won't you please forget

These are the dog days, these are the dog days
Leading our hearts astray
These are the dog days, these are the dog days
Soon they will fade away
One, two, three, four, what are you waiting for?
One, two, three, four, what are you waiting for?
These are the dog days, these are the dog days
These are the dog days

Embracing the highs to fight the lows
Running down the path that I think I need to go
When you think you've won, you're still losing after all
These are the dog days, these are the dog days

These are the dog days, these are the dog days
Leading our hearts astray
These are the dog days, these are the dog days
Soon they will fade away
One, two, three, four, what are you waiting for?
One, two, three, four, what are you waiting for?
These are the dog days, these are the dog days
These are the dog days

These are the dog days, these are the dog days
These are the dog days, these are the dog days
These are the dog days, these are the dog days
These are the dog days, these are the dog days
These are the dog days
