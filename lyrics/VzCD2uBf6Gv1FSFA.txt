So, tell me is it right?
To feel like we're only getting smaller
And if we were to find the feeling
But I'm only treading water
We've made a few mistakes, it's not worth it to say
(we are far from the town)

'Cause we are the only ones, we will get up
And we are aware, 'cause we've been through it
'Cause we are the only ones, we will carry each other on our own

Bleed the sound wave, the truth will send you falling
You feed the lies but your mind isn't open
Now I hear you calling
We've made a few mistakes, it's not worth it to say
(we are far from the town)

'Cause we are the only ones, we will get up
And we are aware, 'cause we've been through it
'Cause we are the only ones, we will carry each other on our own

Open your eyes and let all the light in
Open your eyes, up a little more and show your bliss and come out

'Cause we are the only ones, we will get up
And we are aware, 'cause we've been through it
'Cause we are the only ones, we will carry each other on our own
Open your eyes and let all the light in
Open your eyes, up a little more and show your bliss and come out
