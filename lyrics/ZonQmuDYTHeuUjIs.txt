And now dear listener, we crossed the foe
The foe with the weapons and heavy cargo
I am the sabre, the catapult, and bat
The top of the food chain in my habitat
I am the demon bearing misery and fear
And I spy you convulsing from way over here
I could pull you apart or I could cut you to pieces
I could make you bleed crimson tears from the lesions
But the thing that I lust for and the thing that I'll get
Is to take over your body and to be in your head

I see you
I want to
Break your head
Crusty bread

I won't quit
If you quit
See to it
That you slip

I see you
I want to
Seize your brain
I'd like to put it in my head

To me you are game, just a sweet bit of meat
Come closer and drink malevolence from my teat

Tell me would you honestly
Dare to face up next to me
Sugar coated pills won't keep
You from feeling so woozy
I am an Altered Beast

What harm could a mere mortal like you do?
I am the golden wolf and you are caribou
My left hand is a mouth and my right is a fork
I will pull you apart like a butcher pulls pork

I see you
I want to
Make a waste
Of your home

I won't leave
I might tease
I'll be there
Await your death, oh

I see you
I want to
Seize your brain
I'd like to put it in my head

I see you're nervous, I see you're fumbling
Come hither my friend, my stomach is rumbling

Tell me would you honestly
Dare to face up next to me
Sugar coated pills won't keep
You from feeling so woozy

Tell me would you honestly
Dare to face up next to me
Sugar coated pills won't keep
You from feeling so woozy

I am an Altered Beast
