She didn't mean to deceive you, believe me
But sometimes, the hardest part is conceiving
The good intentions that you had, now only came to this
And although she saw the mark, the arrow missed
It isn't exciting reciting the stories
Of kind words turned hurting when routine gets boring
Both getting tired of punk rock clubs and both playing in punk rock bands
The start was something good but some good things must end
And she said, "It could never survive with such differing lives
One home, one out on tour again we may never come back
The strike of a match, the candle's burning at both ends"
And now she knows too much and I'm too fucked up
It's awkward trying to make my move, I'll pretend that I'm fine
Show up right on time but I know I'll never be that cool
I never wanted to hold you back
I just wanted to hold on
But my chance is gone
I know, just where, I stand, a boy trapped in the body of a man and
I'll take what you're willing to give and I'll teach myself to live
With a walk-on part of a background shot from a movie I'm not in
She's so important and I'm so retarded
And now I realize I should have kissed you in L.A.
But I drove home all alone as if I had a choice, anyway
Where are you coming from? What are you running from?
Is it so hard to see?
And if you're feeling scared remember the time we shared
You know it meant everything, you know that it meant everything to me
You know that it meant everything to me
