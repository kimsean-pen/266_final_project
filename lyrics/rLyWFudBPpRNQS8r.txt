Well, I've been waiting
Waiting here so long
But thinking nothing
Nothing could go wrong
Well, now I know
She has a built-in ability
To take everything she sees
And now it seems I'm falling, falling for her

She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
She reaches in, and grabs right hold of your heart
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
It takes control and slowly tears you apart

I don't really know her
I only know her name
But she crawls under your skin
You're never quite the same
And now I know
She's got something you just can't trust
And it's something mysterious
And now it seems I'm falling, falling for her

She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
She reaches in, and grabs right hold of your heart
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
It takes control and slowly tears you apart

She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
She reaches in, and grabs right hold of your heart
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
It takes control and soon it tears you apart

Well, she don't like losing
To her it's still a game
And though she'll mess up your life
You'll want her just the same
Now I know
She has a built-in ability
To take everything she sees
And now it seems I've fallen, fallen for her

She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
She reaches in, and grabs right hold of your heart
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
It takes control and slowly tears you apart

She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
She seems to have an invisible, oh-oh-oh
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
She seems to have an invisible, oh-oh-oh
She seems to have an invisible, oh-oh-oh
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
She seems to have an invisible, oh-oh-oh
