One voice heard low across the water
through ocean roar.
(One chance out between two worlds, walk with me)

Lost in thought
the mind wandering again
drifting west over the hills
(pulled out to sea)

Sitting in the car
after the music stopped abrupt
we arrived in the dark
lost and disoriented

(Through a dark stretch of trees,
the roar of the beach
calling.)

As the car cooled down
the sound of waves rose and blanketed.
Our minds grew into a vast night air.
We made beds in the ditch.

The loud breath of surf
exhaling and constant.
Sleeping on the wet ground.
In a dream I swim.

(I thought I heard some voice returning)

Out past waves rolling
broad deep sky.
