Even though I'm on my own,
I know I'm not alone
'Cause I know there's someone, somewhere
Praying that I make it home
So here's one from the heart,
My life right from the start
I need a home sweet home
To call my own

To call my own
To call my own

It was you that told me I could do this
You put the music in my heart
And how you sang with the band in memphis
It's hard just to be strong
Not knowing if I've done you proud
I like to imagine you smile
When you hear my songs

Even though I'm on my own,
I know I'm not alone
'Cause I know there's someone, somewhere
Praying that I make it home
So here's one from the heart,
My life right from the start
I need a home sweet home
To call my own

A letter home and
I know we don't speak much
And we both know I'm not keen to
But I think there's things I've left unsaid

I'm okay don't worry
I wish I'd been a better kid
I'm trying to slow down
I'm sorry for letting you down

Even though I'm on my own,
I know I'm not alone
'Cause I know there's someone, somewhere
Praying that I make it home
So here's one from the heart,
My life right from the start
I need a home sweet home
To call my own

Yeah!

You know it's just rock and roll
I know you're by my side through it all
My terror twin and I
Let's take over the world

Even though I'm on my own,
I know I'm not alone
'Cause I know there's someone, somewhere
Praying that I make it home
So here's one from the heart,
My life right from the start
I need a home sweet home
To call my own

Even though I'm on my own,
I know I'm not alone
'Cause I know there's someone, somewhere
Praying that I make it home
So here's one from the heart,
My life right from the start
I need a home sweet home
To call my own
