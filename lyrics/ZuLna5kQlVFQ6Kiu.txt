I–I–I
I–I–I
I–I–I

There's a dark side to every ray of light
There's a shadow on my other side
It's a balance, nothing wrong, nothing right
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

I–I–I
I–I–I
I–I–I
Living is learning to love

We are more than an echo of the past
We're a feeling that will last
Burning in the league of light
Flying away from darker sides
Over mountains, over ice
Through the fire to unite
In the league of light

Uummatitta puigunngilaa
Nunagisarput toqqortarivaa
Siunissamut ammasumut (Yeah-ih-yeah)

I–I–I
I–I–I
I–I–I
Living is learning to love

We are more than an echo of the past
We're a feeling that will last
Burning in the league of light
Flying away from darker sides
Over mountains, over ice
Through the fire to unite
In the league of light

Asanninneq, asanninneq
Inunni tamani, asanninneq
Qaamanermi
Inuuneq una

We are more than an echo of the past
We're a feeling that will last
Burning in the league of light
Flying away from darker sides
Over mountains, over ice
Through the fire to unite
In the league of light

More than an echo of the past
(I am learning to love)
It's a feeling that will last
(I am learning to love)
Fly away from darker sides
Over mountains, over ice
Through the fire to unite
In the league of light
