How did I try
To get you off my mind?
How did I try
To get you off my mind?

Could this be the end
Of you and I for now?
Hope that I see you soon
Don't know what I would do

My heart is under the weather
I know that I'm the only one who can heal it
I'm on my own, I'm on my own
I'm on my own, I'm on my own

I try to beat the struggle for you
But that's just too hard for anyone to do

(Ooh)
(Mmm)
