Thinking 'bout the things that you said to me last summer
Thinking 'bout the memories, last summer, last summer
All I'm trying to do, is to get a little rewind
Go back to the first time, I look to my girl's eyes
Saw her wayside, chilling in a Levi's
Love at first sight, blessing in a disguise

Remembering how she made me feel
That kind of love instantly, so real
I just wanna go back to last summer
Last summer, Last summer

If I could I'd never leave
I'm still burning in the heat
Of you and me and last summer, last summer
If I could I'd hit repeat
I would build a time machine
Take me back to last summer, last summer, last summer

I wonder if she ever got my letters
We got a story for the masses
The kind of love that'll never turn to ashes
It's drastic, summertime classic
Staring up at the moon in June
Mesmerized by her in July
Wish we didn't have to end so soon
What a bummer, last summer, last summer

If I could I'd never leave
I'm still burning in the heat
Of you and me and last summer, last summer
If I could I'd hit repeat
I would build a time machine
Take me back to last summer, last summer, last summer

Remembering how she made me feel
That kind of love instantly, so real
I just wanna go back to last summer, last summer, last summer

If I could I'd never leave
I'm still burning in the heat
Of you and me and last summer, last summer
If I could I'd hit repeat
I would build a time machine
Take me back to last summer, last summer, last summer

Take me back, take me back
Last summer
Take me back, take me back
Take me back to last summer
Last Summer
Last Summer
