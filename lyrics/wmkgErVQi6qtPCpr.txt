Slow heart
Dark weight
Down love
Black canvas
Revolve within
You understand

Fragile
Earthware
Cracks in
The temperature
Keep it cool to give
You understand
Keep it cool to give
You understand

'Cause I just can't find the strength
To pull you up and keep you taut
No, I just can't find the strength
To haul you up and keep you taut

Hijacked
Lost track
Light fades
Another day lapsed
Long shadows lure you in

The more you look
The less you see
So close your eyes
And start to breathe
Oh, you said yourself,
"This wasn't easy"
Mm, you said yourself,
"This wasn't easy"

Oh, I just can't find the strength
To pull you up and keep you taut
No, I just can't find the strength
To haul you up and keep you taut

'Cause I just can't find the strength
To keep you taut
