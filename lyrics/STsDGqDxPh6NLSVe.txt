Gazing past the planets
Looking for total view
I've been laying here for hours
You've gotta make the journey out and in

Wonders of a lifetime
Right there, before your eyes
Searching with this life of ours
You've gotta make the journey out and in
Out and in
Out and in

If you think it's a joke
Well, that's all right, do what you want to do
I've said my peace
And I'll leave it all up to you
