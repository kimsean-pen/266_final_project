Let the penny, let the penny, let the penny drop
Does she love you, does she love you, does she love you not?
You're in trouble if you think you're gonna need your brain pain
Your brain pain

I don't need anymore of this
(I don't need anymore of this)
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
You look so tired and I know you're feeling hella bereft
The reasons she left you - Augh!
It's your birthday, it's your death day
It's a war, it's a war, it's a war, it's a war
Oh Anna I've done, oh Matthew I've done
The worst, the worst, the worst, the worst

A good thing
Now you think about it, don't you make it real?
The bad thing
Maybe it's a feeling I don't want to feel

But love is all you need to know
But love is all you need to know
Are you trying to be clever? Cause you're better when you don't
Are you trying to be clever? Cause you're better when you don't

I don't need anymore of this
(I don't need anymore of this)
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
You look so tired and I know you're feeling hella bereft
The reasons she left you - Augh!
It's your birthday, it's your death day!
It's a war, it's a war, it's a war, it's a war
Oh Anna I've done, oh Matthew I've done
The worst, the worst, the worst, the worst

A good thing
Now you think about it, don't you make it real?
The bad thing
Maybe it's a feeling I don't want to feel

But love is all you need to know
But love is all you need to know
Are you trying to be clever? Cause you're better when you don't
Are you trying to be clever? Cause you're better when you don't
But love is all you need to know
But love is all you need to know
Are you trying to be clever? Cause you're better when you don't
Are you trying to be clever? Cause you're better when you don't

Shake the money, shake the money, shake the money tree
Leave the city, leave the city, leave the city be
So terrified of anything that makes you haunt
Make a living selling brollies as you forget
But your heart between a horror and a parapet
Your bodies going to levitate above the road

But love is all you need to know
But love is all you need to know
Are you trying to be clever? Cause your better when you don't
Are you trying to be clever? Cause your better when you don't
But love is all you need to know
But love is all you need to know
Are you trying to be clever? Cause your better when you don't
Are you trying to be clever? Cause your better when you don't
