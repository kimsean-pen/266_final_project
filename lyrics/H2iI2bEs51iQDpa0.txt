Touch by touch, you're my all time lover
Skin to skin, come undone my cover
When I feel the time is right and your staying by my side
And the love you give to me makes my heart beat
When my fantasies fly away but my feelings make me stay
I see the fire in your eyes, it makes my heart beat
Do it, we'll still do it night and day
You're my all time lover
Do it, we'll still do it anyway
Like there is no other

Touch by touch, you're my all time lover
Skin to skin, come undone my cover
When my heart full of love it makes me a turtle in dove
Love the game that we play night and day
When our love is clear and bright it's our way to see the light
There's a fire in our heart night and day
Do it, we'll still do it night and day
You're my all time lover
Do it, we'll still do it anyway
Like there is no other
Touch by touch, your my all time lover
Skin to skin, come undone my cover
Do it, we'll still do it night and day
You're my all time lover
Do it, we'll still do it anyway
Like there is no other
Touch by touch, you're my all time lover
Skin to skin, come undone my covers
Do it, we'll still do it night and day
You're my all time lover
Do it, we'll still do it anyway
Like there is no other
Touch by touch, your my all time lover
Skin to skin, come undone my covers
