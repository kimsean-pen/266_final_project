Conversation don't come easy
But I've got a lot to say
If you look at what we once had
Well, it feels many moons away

But I came for you
I've dreamt names for you
It's true
No one makes me high like you do
And I craved for you
I lost sleep with you
Who knew?
No one loves me quite like you do

Read me wrong, you won't be the first
And sure as hell not the last
No one told us this was easy
We felt like it should've been

But I came for you
I've dreamt names for you
It's true
No one lets me down like you do
And I craved for you
I lost sleep with you
Who knew?
No one loves me quite like you do
But no one lets me down like you do

And this is your last chance
To figure it out

That I came for you
And I've dreamt names for you
It's true
No one makes me high like you do
And I craved for you
I lost sleep with you
Who knew?
No one loves me quite like you do
But no one lets me down like you do
