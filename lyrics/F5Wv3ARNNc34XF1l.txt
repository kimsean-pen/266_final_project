Touch me I want to be with you
The more I get, the more I want of you
Makes my mind and body blue.
Yeah I'm filled with you

And I dreamed of you
I've been dreaming of the times we never knew
I dreamed of you
In the distance fading from view

Touch me I am numb with you
It makes it so beautiful
And it all starts pouring from my eyes
And you know, did you know?
Still precious to me
Did you know it's pouring from my eyes?
And I know it's somewhere buried deep inside

You're the only thing I ever know
But now I feel it's time to go
You're the only thing I ever need
But now I feel it's time to leave

Touch me I want to be with you
The more I get, the more I want of you
Makes my mind and body blue
Everyday, any day I can think of you
And my mind and body feel together

I feel weak when I dream of you
Feel weak I don't know what I'm going to do
Feel weak when I dream of you
Feel weak don't know what I'm going to do

You're the only thing I ever need
But now I feel it's time to leave
You're the only thing I've ever known
But now I feel it's time to go...
