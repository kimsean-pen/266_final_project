I don't wanna be a fool
I don't wanna be a fool for love
No, no, I won't, no, hey, no

I know that people do go through changes, yeah
But this just don't make no damn sense
If we're gonna keep sayin' we love one another, yeah, yeah
Well, then we better stop fightin' and arguin'

'Cause baby, I've heard "I'm sorry"
Too many, many times before, now I know better
It hurts to hold on to this kind of love even more
No, I'm not crazy

I won't be a fool, a fool for our love
'Cause I know I'd rather be alone than be here unhappy
I'm not gonna choose, choose for you
'Cause I know I'd rather be alone than be here unhappy, yeah

I know it's time to go when I feel lonely
When I'm layin' in your arms and it don't feel right, oh
'Cause every time I feelin' up you try to bring me down
So I feel good knowin' I don't need you around

'Cause I know, I know that I can feel this bad all by myself, yeah
And maybe that's my best bet
Startin' this time I'm gonna think selfishly
And never depend on someone else for keepin' me happy, oh, no, no

I won't be a fool, a fool for love
'Cause I know I'd rather be alone than be here unhappy, oh no
I'm not gonna choose, choose for you
'Cause I know I'd rather be alone than be here unhappy, oh

I, I, I, I won't be a fool, a fool for love
'Cause I know I'd rather be alone than be here unhappy
I'm not gonna choose, choose for you
'Cause I know I'd rather be alone than be here unhappy, ooh yeah

I'm never gonna be a fool for love
I'd rather be alone, just give it up
Don't make no sense to be in love
And be here unhappy, oh no
It might feel good on a lonely night
But layin' in your arms today ain't right
I'd rather lose you than lose my mind
And be here unhappy with you baby
Hey no, no, no, no, no, no
I don't wanna be a fool
I don't wanna be a fool
