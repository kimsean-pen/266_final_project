Care for me cause I'm thinking bout leaving
Got you baby, do you got me baby?
Cause I'm still thinking bout leaving
Care for me cause I'm, care for me, maybe I'll come on back
I want you to feel blue, and if you ask maybe I'll come on back
I try to let it show, try to think about others
Ask me baby,
then I tell you baby that I would never think about others
I want you to call me on it
I'm lonely babe when you don't read my mind
I want you to feel blue, and if you ask maybe I'll come on back
