Fourth quarter babe
I'll hit the game winner
It's not over babe
I'll hit the game winner
Baby believe in me
I'll hit the game winner
Baby believe in me
Take a chance on me
Take a chance on me
I can make anything
You would mean everything to me
Give me the call
I'll hit the game winner
Baby would you get enough for me
I'll hit the game winner
Baby believe in me
I'll hit the game winner
Take a chance on me
