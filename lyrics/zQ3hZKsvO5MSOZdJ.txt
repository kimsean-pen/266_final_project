For every taste, for every try
For every tear that never dried
I need your touch for you to take
Away the pain

Through every fall, through every flame
Through every trial along the way
I hope you'll wait behind those clouds
Just like the sun

I'd climb to the edge of a mountain for you
I'll go to the ends of the world to find you
We'll dance in the shadows
Until we reach a break thru, break thru, oh
What we need is a break thru
What we need is a break thru

I lose my way, I lose my trust
I lose myself when I lose us
I find my strength to start again
When you're with me, oh yeah

I'd climb to the edge of a mountain for you
I'll go to the ends of the world to find you
We'll dance in the shadows
Until we reach a break thru, break thru, oh

What we need is a break thru
What we need is a break thru
What we need is a break thru
Oh, that's what we need

We ought to break thru, I've tried everyday
All we need, all we need is a break thru, yeah
Ha, ha, oh

I'd climb to the edge of a mountain for you
I'll go to the ends of the world to find you
We'll dance in the shadows
Until we reach a break thru, break thru, oh
What we need is a break thru
What we need is a break

We'll do whatever it takes
We'll do whatever it takes
We'll do whatever it takes
