I love the Lord, but sometimes it's like that I love me more
I love the peace and I love the war
I love the seas and I love the shore
No love for no beach, baby that's law
But she doesn't see therefore I spoil
I trip, I fall, run up in raw
I love her with all my heart
Every vein, every vessel, every bullet lodged
With every flower that I ever took apart
She said that she would give me greatness,
Stat-us, placement above the others
My face would grace covers of the magazines of the hustlers,
Paper, the likes of which that I had never seen
Her eyes glows green with the logo of our dreams
The purpose of our scene, our obscene obsession for the bling
She would be my queen, I could be her king, together
She would make me cool and we would both rule forever
And I would never feel pain
And never be without pleasure ever again
And if the rain stops and every thing's dry
She would cry just so I could drink the tears from her eyes
She teach me how to fly
Even cushion my fall if my engines ever stall
And I plummet from the sky
But she would keep me high
And if I ever die she would commission my image on to her bosom
Or maybe she'd retire as well
A match made in Heaven, set the fires in Hell and I'll be

And so began our reign
The Trinity, her and I came
No weather man could ever stand where her and I can **Hurricane**
Hella hard, umbrella whatever, put plywood over Pella pains
And pray to God that the flood subside
'Cause you gonna need a sub 'til he does reply
And not one of Jared's, you think it's all errant
And everything's ivory, another supply
That means anotha July inside my endless summer
That was just the eye of the Unger
Felix, 'cause he is the cleanest
Amongst the younger outstanding achieving up-and-comers
The ones that had deadbeat daddies and well-to-do mommas
But not well enough to keep 'em from us
The ones that were fightin' in class who might not pass
Rap record pressured the lab, had a life not fast
"Can you feel it? Can you feel it?" That's what I got asked
"Do I love her? Do I love her?" Said, "I don't know"
Streets got my heart, Game got my soul
One times when sunshine would never hurt your soul
To a cryin' dishonored baby momma
Who's a momma to her daughter that I had fathered from afar
My new lady gave me a Mercedes and a necklace with a solid gold key like the starter of a car
The opener of a door, or two pounds of raw
You gave me a baby, but what about lately?
Then ha ha ha ha ha ha ha right up in her face
G there's more fish in the sea
I'm on my mission to be

Come, these are the tales of The Cool
Guaranteed to go and make you fail from your school
And seek unholy grails like a fool
And hang with the players of the pool
Fast talkin' all the hustle
No Heaven up above you
No Hell underneath ye
And no one will receive thee
So shed no tear when we're not here
And keep your faith as we chase The Cool
