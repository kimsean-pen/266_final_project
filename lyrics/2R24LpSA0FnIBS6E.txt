She screams when I'm away
She's been gone before
I worried all the time, why worry anymore?
Now I go, away, now I know, today

I picked out your star, turned night to day
A simple whisper from your voice and I fade away
You wish for love, you pushed me away
Your love for me was everything, I need the air I breathe

She, now she's all alone
Her eyes, they drown in tears
The love was meant to last but she is blind with fear
Now I go, away, now I know, today

I picked out your star, turned night to day
A simple whisper from your voice and I fade away
You wish for love, you pushed me away
Your love for me was everything, I need the air I breathe

Leave me be, now I'm free
Love reflecting everything
You want space, I need you
To help me see this through

There she goes
There she goes
There she goes

I picked out your star, turned night to day
A simple whisper from your voice and I fade away
You wish for love, you pushed me away
Your love for me was everything, I need the air I breathe

I picked out your star, turned night to day
A simple whisper from your voice and I fade away
You wish for love, you pushed me away
You're everything to me
