I'm thinking about
leaving
how I should say goodbye
with a hand shake
or an embrace
or a kiss on the cheek
possibly all three

Well maybe I've been wrong
maybe my intentions
are irrelevant
but honestly it's not just for me
we've both been so unhappy
so let's just see
what happens
when the summer ends
