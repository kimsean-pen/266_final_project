Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!

We're lost, your mind was on the road
Your call, maybe it's time to go!
Claim back what is mine!
Same track, I'm losing time
Take in the rules of game
Sinking, It's time to make a change!

Wake up!

And now I see what I never saw before
You gotta wake up baby!
And now I feel what I never felt before
You gotta wake up baby!

Wake up!

I'll wait, but can you see what's wrong?
Like you, I fell into the problem
Had faith that everything's ok.
I don't believe what you say
Turn it, turn it all around
Learn it, starting from the ground!

Wake up!

And now I see what I never saw before
You gotta wake up baby!
And now I feel what I never felt before
You gotta wake up baby!
And now I've stayed where I never stayed before
You gotta wake up baby!
And now I've gone where I never went before
So wake up! wake up baby!

Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!

And now I see what I never saw before
You gotta wake up baby!
And now I feel what I never felt before
You gotta wake up baby!
And now I've stayed where I never stayed before
You gotta wake up baby!
And now I've gone where I never went before
So wake up! wake up baby!

Wake up!
