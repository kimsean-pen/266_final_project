Day after day
I'm waking up to find that you're slipping away
Night after night
I can't fight the emptiness inside

There's nothing I can say
Now I know you're turning me away
It's only a disguise
But you don't have to hide
The truth is in your eyes tonight

I don't want to live a lie
But I don't want to say goodbye

And I can't let you go
Even though it's over
I just can't let you go
I know your love is growing colder

One look in my eyes and you'll realise
That you got my heart in your hands
Won't you let me know something more
Where did we go wrong?

I don't want to fight
All I want to do is try and understand
I'm reaching out for you
Babe, what can I do
I've been holding on so long

I don't want to live a lie
But I don't want to say goodbye

I can't let you go
Even though it's over
I just can't let you go
Though your love is growing colder
And I can't let you go
Even though it's over

I don't want to live a lie
But I don't want to say goodbye
I want you by my side

And I can't let you go
Even though it's over
I just can't let you go
I feel your love is growing colder
And I can't let you go
Even though it's over
I just can't let you go
I feel your love growing colder

Don't go
