I'm done with doubt
I'm done with your game
Cause I've been away
And I've been thinkin'
I may not always have
The comfort of you
As you tread and I fall like a fountain
Falling for you
Oh, but what have I done?
Tell me what have I done

Oh, oh, what have I done for your love?
Oh, oh, I'm selfish and dumb for your love

I've dealt with doubt
I've dealt with your game
And I hear your pain
And I hear you thinkin'
You haven't always had
The comfort of truth
But comfort had never had you
Oh, oh, ain't it true?
Oh but what have I done?
Tell me what have I done

Oh, oh, what have I done for your love?
Oh, oh, I'm selfish and dumb for your love
Oh, oh, what have I done for your love?
Oh, oh, I'm selfish and dumb for your love
Oh, oh, what have I done for your love?
Oh, oh, I'm selfish and dumb for your love
Oh, oh, what have I done for your love?
Oh, oh, I'm selfish and dumb for your love
