Hear these words that I sing to you
I will make it clear, it's me and you
We can have this love that we'll never lose
It's bigger than us, mhm

Take my hand and I'll lead you home
Can you understand?
You will never be alone

It's bigger than us
It's bigger than you and me
It's bigger than us
It's bigger than everything we see
'Cause I can feel the universe
When I'm feeling you breathe
It's bigger than us
And it's bigger than you and me
It's bigger

I won't give up and I won't let go
'Cause this kind of love is gonna be our only hope

It's bigger than us
It's bigger than you and me
It's bigger than us
It's bigger than everything we see
'Cause I can feel the universe
When I'm feeling you breathe
It's bigger than us
And it's bigger than you and me

It's bigger (bigger)
Bigger (bigger)
Bigger (it's bigger than, it's bigger than)
Oh, it's bigger (bigger)
Bigger (bigger)
Bigger (it's bigger than, it's bigger than)
It's bigger than us
It's bigger than you and me
This kind of love
It's bigger than everything we see, yeah, ooh
So much bigger
Yeah, bigger than us

(It's bigger than us)
(It's bigger than you and me)
(It's bigger than us) I can feel it
(It's bigger than everything we see) everything we see
'Cause I can feel the universe
When I'm feeling you breathe
It's bigger than us
And it's bigger than you and me

It's bigger (bigger)
Bigger (bigger)
Bigger (it's bigger than, it's bigger than)
Ooh (bigger)
Bigger (bigger)
Bigger (it's bigger than, it's bigger than)
It's bigger
