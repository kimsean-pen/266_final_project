Don't want it
Don't want it 'cause I'd fake it
But you better hurry
For you and I to make it
It'd be a good story
If you came back as the underdog (rah)
If you came back as the underdog
I'll call it
Your drunken words were honest and maybe you worry
They came out like a faucet, and dripping with words still spraying
But you came back as the underdog (rah)
But you came as the underdog (rah)

Come in my bed, come back to heaven
Back in my bed, come back to heaven
Back in my bed, come back to heaven
Back in my bed

Why don't you step to me?
You know I like it in the bed when it's bubbly
And I wanna come up but your kisses are like gluttony
Even though I got a reputation in the company
Baby, you gon' make this
Baby, you gon' make it as the underdog
Baby, you gon' make this
Baby, you gon' make it as the underdog

I'm cheating
I want you when you mean it
But you better back it up
My breath is getting heated
Baby, just hurry
As you come back as the underdog (rah)
As you come back as the underdog (rah)

Come in my bed, come back to heaven
Back in my bed, come back to heaven
Back in my bed, come back to heaven
Back in my bed

Why don't you step to me?
You know I like it in the bed when it's bubbly
And I wanna come up but your kisses are like gluttony
Even though I got a reputation in the company
Baby, you gon' make this
Baby, you gon' make it as the underdog
Baby, you gon' make this
Baby, you gon' make it as the underdog

You got what you wanted
I'll do what you say
We've already started
I'd throw it away
You know that you got me
Let's do this today

Why don't you step to me?
You know I like it in the bed when it's bubbly
And I wanna come up but your kisses are like gluttony
Even though I got a reputation in the company
Baby, you can make this
Baby, you can make it as the underdog
Why don't you step to me?
You know I like it in the bed when it's bubbly
And I wanna come up but your kisses are like gluttony
Even though I got a reputation in the company
Baby, you gon' make this
Baby, you gon' make it as the underdog
Baby, you gon' make this
Baby, you gon' make it as the underdog
Baby, you gon' make this
Baby, you gon' make it as the underdog
