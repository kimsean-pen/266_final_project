Bitch, I am me (oo-wee-oo)
Bitch, I am, bitch, I am me (weee)
Bitch, I do me (bling, bling, bling!)
Bitch, I do, bitch, I do me (what?)

Oh, you don't like how I'm talkin'? (yeah)
Oh, you don't like how I'm ballin'? (yeah)
Watch me go hood like Robin (yeah)
Watch me go dumb like culkin' (yeah)

Ever since I was six, people tryna have control of me
Now I'm five feet with a networth, they suck a D
Oops, I said that a lot, maybe too frequently
But it's the truth maaannn...
I have the right to be

'Cause I work my ass off, twentyfour-seven no fuckin' day off
I ain't got no time to just spend my dime
One time, I even wished I could be laid off
But they still tryna change me
Still wanna dress me to be girly
Still saying if I switch it up a bit and extend my hair a bit
I'm gonna change to be pretty (eww)

Yeah, so I pray, I pray
And then I slay, I slay
'Cause if I didn't, then the average is winning
And that's just not okay, okay
Well, I'll be damned if I did that
Might as well cut my toe, like tic-tac
I don't fuck with you, so no chit-chat
Still drunk of that one lil' mix max? (oo-wee)

Bitch, I am me (oo-wee-oo)
Bitch, I am, bitch, I am me (weee)
Bitch, I do me (bling, bling, bling!)
Bitch, I do, bitch, I do me (what?)

Oh, you don't like how I'm talkin'? (yeah)
Oh, you don't like how I'm ballin'? (yeah)
Watch me go hood like Robin (yeah)
Watch me go dumb like culkin' (yeah)

Bitch, I am me (oo-wee-oo)
Bitch, I am, bitch, I am me (weee)
Bitch, I do me (bling, bling, bling!)
Bitch, I do, bitch, I do me (what?)

Oh, you don't like how I'm talkin'? (yeah)
Oh, you don't like how I'm ballin'? (yeah)
Watch me go hood like Robin (yeah)
Watch me go dumb like, dumb like

Yea, hello? Who dis?
Nobody, but I just wanna comment on your act silly
You've been a bad girl, plus you talk dirty
Why you can't be normal and be a lady?
Stop adding more inks on your skin already
Daddy really don't like your vocabulary
And they...
Siapa sih nih telpon-telpon? Bangsat!

I do just what I wanna do, end of story
And I always get what I want, call me bossy
If you really hate my guts then why you all on my pussy?
Don't ever try to change me, 'cause bitch, I am me (oo-wee)

Bitch, I am me (oo-wee-oo)
Bitch, I am, bitch, I am me (weee)
Bitch, I do me (bling, bling, bling!)
Bitch, I do, bitch, I do me (what?)

Oh, you don't like how I'm talkin'? (yeah)
Oh, you don't like how I'm ballin'? (yeah)
Watch me go hood like Robin (yeah)
Watch me go dumb like culkin' (yeah)

Bitch, I am me (oo-wee-oo)
Bitch, I am, bitch, I am me (weee)
Bitch, I do me (bling, bling, bling!)
Bitch, I do, bitch, I do me (what?)

Oh, you don't like how I'm talkin'? (yeah)
Oh, you don't like how I'm ballin'? (yeah)
Watch me go hood like Robin (yeah)
Watch me go dumb like, dumb like

Bitches got me feelin' like OJ
Got me feelin' like I wanna kill a bitch with my gauntlet
Talkin' shit about me on Skype and laugh about it
How about I poison you on site and post about it?

Yeah, I still remember every single one of y'all
Used to blame everything and everyone
When they ain't got no fault
How you lookin' now with me standin' at the top?
Look who's ass lickin' now that one time we met at the mall?

Now let's shed a light for the girls who think I'm weird
You Dum Dum, lickin' bitches so dumb, I'm aware
I bet you thought I wasn't going anywhere, oo, scare
What about that venture you was tryna make? bitch, where?

Yea right, it didn't happen 'cause you done waste your savings
On some cheap lookin' item you ain't got no sense of fashion
Now all the ugly bags you bought is sittin' in the corner
And you tryna sell your preloved while your lover playin' poker, ah

I do what I want (sigh), I say what I want (bitch)
I do what I want (sigh), I say what I want (bitch)
I do what I want (sigh), I say what I want (bitch)
I do what I want (sigh), I say what I want (bitch)
