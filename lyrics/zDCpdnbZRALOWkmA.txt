Another day break and we face the sun
You are everything to me
And I am overcome, I can taste it now
I know we have become single minded

And have I told you, oh, how I want to breathe you in
You're so far beneath my skin

Darling, I'd be nowhere without you
You're the only one I have ever loved
I'd be nowhere without you
You're the only one I can really trust

Let my loving surround you
You are safe inside, this is paradise
I'd be nowhere without you
And I want to be beside you always

Heaven help me, oh how I pray you stay
I would die without your love
And I am stunned today, so far fallen now
Another choice is made, I want you forever

I couldn't bear it if we had never felt the same
Could I have ever found my way

I'd be nowhere without you
You're the only one I have ever loved
I'd be nowhere without you
You're the only one I can really trust

Let my loving surround you
You are safe inside, this is paradise
I'd be nowhere without you
And I want to be beside you always
Always, always, always

And have I told you, oh how I want to breathe you in
You're so far beneath my skin

Darling, I'd be nowhere without you
You're the only one I have ever loved
I'd be nowhere without you
You're the only one I can really trust

Let my loving surround you
You are safe inside, this is paradise
I'd be nowhere without you
And I want to be beside you always
Always, always, always
