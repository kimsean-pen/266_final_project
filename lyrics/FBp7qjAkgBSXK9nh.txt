Hey*
Hey
Hey
Hey

This conversations over
It makes no sense to me
You could have stopped the suffering
You could have stopped the screams

But now your reign is over
It to me
I'm going to show you what I mean

Bury me with my guns on
So when I reach the other side
I can show him what it feels like to die

Bury me with my guns on
So when I'm cast out of the sky
I can shoot the devil right between the eyes

Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey

The pearly gates are broken
And its the strangest thing
The angels could have warned you
But no one said a thing

The shot was quick and painless
And did change everything
It's time to choose a better king

Bury me with my guns on
So when I reach the other side
I can show him what it feels like to die

Bury me with my guns on
So when I'm cast out of the sky
I can shoot the devil right between the eyes

The castles falling down
Beneath the deep blue sea
They've seen my face before
Will they remember me?

I scream the words out loud
Our souls are finally free
Its time to open up our eyes

Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey

Bury me with my guns on
So when I reach the other side
I can show him what it feels like to die

Bury me with my guns on
So when I'm cast out of the sky
I can shoot the devil right between the eyes

Bury me with my guns on
So when I reach the other side
I can show him what it feels like to die

Bury me with my guns on
So when I'm cast out of the sky
I can shoot the devil right between the eyes

The castles falling down
Beneath the deep blue sea
They've seen my face before
Will they remember me?

I scream the words out loud
Our souls are finally free
Its time to open up our eyes
