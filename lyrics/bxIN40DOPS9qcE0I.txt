Sunrise
Wake up stand up look into
Red eyes
Stayed up all night thinking of
Reasons why
I can't feel your skin

Is this plaguing your brain?
Is this plaguing your brain?

Couldn't brace yourself in the morphine hallway
Lying on the ground with a heart as a ball and chain
Message to the bird I know your wings will be fine
Spread them on the floor, learning to heal will take time

Close the hatch and lock us inside (Now breath in wide I'll forgive you later)
Close the hatch and lock us inside (Come on it's time just stand aside)

All these reasons why
I am reaching wide
I am sticking to all these one liners
And all this means
And all I have to say

Stay till my word
Because I can send you to the side

Cut off these ties
Till this is why
We were holding to one night
Breathe in without love
Hear me form these lines
Falling in love
I have been reading lies.

Watch this turn to dust
I won't know when you've fallen
Now it all takes shape
I won't go until you follow

Couldn't brace yourself in the morphine hallway
Lying on the ground with a heart as a ball and chain
Message to the bird I know your wings will be fine
Spread them on the floor, learning to heal will take time

I don't even get the movie
Cold ice feels so soothing
I don't even get the movie
Cold ice feels so soothing

Watch this turn to dust
I won't know when you've fallen
Now it all takes shape
I won't go until you follow

I don't feel anything, stuck in the passing lane
I don't feel anything, stuck in the passing lane
Break, wait, stop, back off the bitch
Break, wait, stop, back off the bitch
Break, wait, stop, back off the bitch
Break, wait, stop, back off the bitch

Block out the sound of the police beckoning
Duck in the back and the lights will shut off again
You can go for it just don't ignore it
Ration the wine, laughing in revelry
You can go for it just don't ignore it
Caution I'm drugged, we'll here comes the symphony
The rapist gives God a hug.
