These sidewalks, this silence
It's all around me
This chaos, so quiet
But I feel it rising

Don't close your eyes
Don't be scared tonight
Change is coming

Stand up and hold your ground
Face the ending
We'll burn this whole world down
Build a new beginning now

Been waiting for this moment
We'll leave our memories
The past is like poison
This fire is all we need

Stand up and hold your ground
Face the ending
We'll burn this whole world down
Build a new beginning now
This fire keeps getting closer
Draw the line we're crossing over
We'll burn this whole world down
Build a new beginning now
