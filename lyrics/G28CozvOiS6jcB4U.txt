Young enough to feel it
Young enough to feel it
My body's young enough to feel this
Hey
Young enough to feel it
My body rolls
My body rolls

I could see it gleaming from the back of my dinnerware
Your eye cream sprayed all over little bear
You could reconsider definition of childcare
14 shapes and you pick the giant square

Young enough to feel it
Young enough to feel it
My body's young enough to feel this
Hey
Young enough to feel it
My body rolls
My body rolls

I couldn't face the fact that my ass ain't a plaque
There's a wall and my behind is not there
I couldn't wait to tap into the brain of my cat
And let him know he's my widdle baby meow meow boo

Up in the casino, ain't no doubt I'm 'bout to let it all go
You used to call me on my cellphone
But now you're petting all my friends for sure

Since 2005 I've been living a lie
I'm not even a man I'm just a cat in disguise
I was born by surprise in the Egyptian times
Bring me a treat and I'll imprint your face forever

And I
I just want to be in my zone
I just want to be in control
No time for you
And God
Doesn't have a plan for me
Gonna be who I'm gonna be
No thanks to you

I fuck them bright clothes
The white guy guy code burnt all the bridges
It's just a pile of wood
I couldn't wait though
Admit I ate those
Book flavored pavement endorphin tongues

Shy fiction cloud absorbing pictures
Appearence shining
Eclipse a culprit ear intake
A pillapliption mixed in soap and whipped in dear face cloak
To steep me peefers with needle bop
I think of things that I haven't done
Packer Wilita, Tilly, Billy, block blood

Don't let go
I know you want a little more
Don't be gross and I'll be good to you
Call my phone
I know you want a little more
Let it flow, I can be good to you
You and I
We can linger under starlit skies
Help me survive
