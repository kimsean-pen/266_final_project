Oh my love please don't cry
I'll wash my bloody hands

And we'll start a new life.
I ripped out his throat
And called you on the telephone

To take off my disguise
just in time to hear you cry
When you

You mourn the death of your bloody valentine
The night he died
You mourn the death of your bloody valentine
One last time
Singing
Oh my love
Please don't cry
I'll wash my bloody hands

And we'll start a new life
I don't know much at all, I don't know wrong from right
All I know is that I love you tonight

There was police and flashing lights
The rain came down so hard that night

The headlines read a lover died
No telltale heart was left to find

When you

You mourn the death of your bloody valentine

The night he died
You mourn the death of your bloody valentine
One last time

Singing
Oh my love
Please don't cry
I'll wash my bloody hands

And we'll start a new life
I don't know much at all, I don't know wrong from right

All I know is that I love you tonight
tonight...

He dropped you off
I followed him home
Then I stood outside his bedroom window
Standing over him, he begged me not to do
What I knew I had to do
Cause I am so in love with you
Oh my love please don't cry
I'll wash my bloody hands
And we'll start a new life
I don't know much at all
I don't know wrong from right
All I know is that I love you tonight
tonight...
