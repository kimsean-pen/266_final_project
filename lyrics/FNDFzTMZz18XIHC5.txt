Casted shade across landscape
Stuck to the bottom
That's how they want you
Telephone call
In the bathroom stall
Just out of earshot
But you still got caught
Every corner that you turn
You'll never learn
Pattern missing in the grass
Hard to discern
Every corner that you turn
You'll never learn
Pattern missing in the grass
Hard to discern
Every corner that you turn
You'll never learn
Pattern missing in the grass
Hard to discern
Every corner that you turn
You'll never learn
Misplace your faith
In empty space
Is it a hard sight
Or the harsh light
Suspicious ties
Guilt by design
The world spins
Before it falls
So softly spoken
Every corner that you turn
You'll never learn
Pattern missing in the grass
Hard to discern
Every corner that you turn
You'll never learn
Pattern missing in the grass
Hard to discern
Every corner that you turn
You'll never learn (you'll never learn)
Pattern missing in the grass
Hard to discern (say so)
Every corner that you turn
You'll never learn
Every corner that you turn
You'll never learn (say so)
Pattern missing in the grass
Hard to discern
Every corner that you turn
You'll never learn (you'll never learn)
Pattern missing in the grass
Hard to discern
Every corner that you turn
You'll never learn (you'll never learn)
Pattern missing in the grass
Hard to discern (say so)
Every corner that you turn
You'll never learn
