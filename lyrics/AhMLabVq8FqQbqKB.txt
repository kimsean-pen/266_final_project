Ain't this a pity, people ain't this a cryin' shame
Ain't this a pity, people ain't this a cryin' shame
Well you know it's nine below zero, she put me down for another man

Gave her all of my money, all of my love and everything
I gave her all of my money, all of my love and everything
Nine below zero, she put me down for another man

She lied to me, she didn't tell me everything
She lied to me, the woman didn't tell me everything
Well you know its nine below zero cousin, she put me down for another man

Ain't this a pity, people ain't this a cryin' shame
Ain't this a pity, people ain't this a cryin' shame
It's nine below zero, she put me down for another man
(Well alright!)

I'm gonna retire on the delta, layin' out there in the fallin' rain
I'm gonna retire on the delta, layin' out there in the fallin' rain
You know it's nine below zero people, and my love don't mean a thing
