Small city streets, small city of woes
It's coming on, it's coming everyday
I see the change, I see the walk
There's a key, there are stars
And they're all there above of me

She said there's no
Common truth in fibbing, what a day
Hold on, beat street
Getting all the words 'til they get through to you

The chosen few are witness to
The things we know they're yours to demonstrate
It's not a thing that's a part of me
Who writes a script alone and follows everyday

He said, no scene
Street legal rules inside our dreams
Hold on, beat street
Getting all the words 'til they get through to you
