I awoke, cold and alone
Adrift in the open sea
Caught up in regrets and tangled in nets
Instead of your arms wrapped around me

And I wept but my tears are anathema here
Just more water to fill my lungs
I hear someone scream:
"God what is it we have done?"

I am drowning in a digital sea
I am slipping beneath the sound
Here my voice goes to ones and zeroes
I'm slipping beneath the sound

A song, somewhere below
Deadly and slow begins
Sickly and sweet, now picking up speed
Ushering in the world's end

And the ghost of Descartes screams again in the dark
"Oh how could I have been so wrong?"
But above the screams
Still the sirens sing their songs

I am drowning in a digital sea
I am slipping beneath the sound
Here my voice goes to ones and zeroes
I'm slipping beneath the sound

Here my voice goes to ones and zeroes...
