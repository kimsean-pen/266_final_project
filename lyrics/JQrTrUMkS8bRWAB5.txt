I'm in a van,
And you're holding my hand
And you were travelling with me through forest and sands

I've been ever so needy learning your language
And you've been taking full advantage, haven't you?
Oh, don't say it's true

I've been so afraid,
I'm a sadness again
And we kissed once, even that was the last

I know I need more than given
Moments and sentimental stories
Words only spoken seemingly
That I'm warming your heart that way

Oh, it feels like none of this is real
I'll pretend that my heart and my head are well
But if the blood pumping through my veins could freeze,
Like a river in Toronto,
Then I'd bleed please,
You said I made you feel warm, said I made you feel warm inside

Oh, it feels like none of this is real
I'll pretend that my heart and my head are well
But if the blood pumping through my veins could freeze,
Like a river in Toronto,
Then I'd bleed please,
You said I made you feel warm, said I made you feel warm inside

It feels like none of this is real
I'll pretend that my heart and my head are well
But if the blood pumping through my veins could freeze,
Like a river in Toronto,
Then I'd bleed please,
You said I made you feel warm, said I made you feel warm inside
