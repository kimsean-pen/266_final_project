Across the desert sands I watch a caravan
And dream it could take me to you
As the east wind blows
I shiver to my bones
Cos all I can think of is you

I still feel you here
The memories so clear
So don't go forgetting my love
How we learned to be free
How we dreamed the same dream
Now nothing's what it seems

Paradise lost is a place without you
In the shadow of love there's no room with a view
Walking alone on the sand
Wish you were here again...
(I wish you were here again)

I watch the sun go down and head back into town
The same way I used to with you
Up and down these streets
The music sounds so sweet
But it always reminds me of you

I still feel you here
The memories so clear
So don't go forgetting my love
How we learned to be free
How we shared everything
Until you come back to me

Paradise lost is a place without you
In the shadow of love there's no room with a view
Walking alone on the sand
Wish you were here again...

(do you remember)

Do you remember
Laying here with me
Do you remember...
The way we used to be...

Paradise lost is a place without you
In the shadow of love there's no room with a view
Walking alone on the sand
Wish you were here again... again
I wish you were here again

And tell me baby
Do you remember...
Do you remember...
Do you remember...
