Don't leave me this way
I can't survive, I can't stay alive
Without you love, oh baby
Don't leave me this way
I can't exist, I will surely miss
Your tender kiss
So don't leave me this way

Oh babyn, my heart is full of love and desire for you
So come on down and do what you've got to do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning, out of control
So come down and stisfy the need in me
Cos only your good loving can set me free
Don't leave me this way
I don't understand how I'm at your command
So baby please don't leave me this way

Don't leave me this way
Cos I can't exist
I will surely miss
Your tender kiss
So don't leave me this way

Oh babyn, my heart is full of love and desire for you
So come on down and do what you've got to do
You started this fire down in my soul
