I don't need to need you
Tell me what to do, tell me what to say
Don't you wanna help me?
Tell me what to do, help me find a way

If I was not me
I would hate me too just like you do
I don't need to need you
Tell me what to do, tell me what to say

It's all made worse by a simple scheme
You're slipping away from me
Can't decide sometimes if it's worth the point
The point is the struggle, insecurity

Hopefully, you make no mistake
If you learn from what you've got to take
Good or bad, it's all gonna add up in the end
But you can never win

I don't need to need you
Tell me what to do, tell me what to say
Don't you wanna help me?
Tell me what to do, help me find a way

If I was not me
I would hate me too just like you do
I don't need to need you
Tell me what to do, tell me what to say

And it's the desperation to hold on to
Something that can't be held on to
So don't waste your time filling up my words
Don't tell me why, assume the worst

Hopefully, you make no mistake
If you learn from what you've got to take
Good or bad, it's all gonna add up in the end
But you can never win

Don't thank me, don't tell me how
Don't break me down, don't help me make it
Don't thank me, don't tell me how
Don't break me down, don't help me make it

Don't thank me, don't tell me how
Don't break me down, don't help me make it
I don't need to need you
Tell me what to do, tell me what to say
Don't you wanna help me?
Tell me what to do, help me find a way
I don't need to need you
Tell me what to do, tell me what to say
Don't you wanna help me?
Tell me what to do, help me find a way
