I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you

But it's gonna take money
A whole lotta spendin' money
It's gonna take plenty of money
To do it right, child

It's gonna take time
Whole lot of precious time
It's gonna take patience and time, mmm
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
To do it right, child

I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you

And this time I know it's real
The feelin' that I feel
I know if I put my mind to it
I know that I really can do it

I got my mind set on you
Set on you
I got my mind set on you
Set on you

But it's gonna take money
Whole lotta spendin' money
It's gonna take plenty of money
To do it right, child

It's gonna take time
Whole lot of precious time
It's gonna take patience and time, mmm
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
To do it right

I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you

And this time I know it's real
The feelings that I feel
I know if I put my mind to it
I know that I really can do it

But it's gonna take money
A whole lotta spendin' money
It's gonna take plenty of money
To do it right, child

It's gonna take a-time
A whole lot of precious time
It's gonna take patience and time, mmm
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
To do it right
(Set on you)
(Set on you)

Set on you
Set on you
Set on you
Set on you
Set on you
Set on you
I got my mind on you
I got it set on you
