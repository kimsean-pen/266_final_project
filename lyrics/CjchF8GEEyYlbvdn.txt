I bought you death by what you say
I can feel the whole thing eat away
I will never be the same again
Now it's time to break it out

Your life is now a different fate
Your life is now a different fate

I know the one you used to be
You'll never be the same but your the only one to blame
You're not afraid
You're such a shame
It's time to figure out your life
For everything I hate to everything I want to find
This is your fate
Forget my name

So we know that
Let everything change
I am nothing like you
I bet that you'll feel like, each time I lie while seconds
Bitch I'm not I'll anymore, are you afraid I'll forget?

I know the one you used to be
You'll never be the same but your the only one to blame
You're not afraid
You're such a shame
It's time to figure out your life
For everything I hate to everything I want to find
This is your fate
Forget my name

I bought you death by what you say
I can feel the whole thing eat away
I will never be the same again
Now it's time to break it in
Now it's time to break it in
This is a breaking time for me
Bitch you will not be here to say
I'm not my enemy
I'll fall again
I pray that when I do
Your now the worst piece of shit
You're just a piece of shit
