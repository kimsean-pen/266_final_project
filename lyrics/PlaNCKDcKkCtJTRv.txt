If I had my own world...
I'd build you an empire...
(echo off)
If I had my own world

I'd fill it with wealth and desire
A glorious past to admire
And voices of kids out walking dogs
Birds, planes, cleanest cars
If I had my own world
I'd love it for all that's inside it
There'd be no more wars, death or riots
There'd be no more police
Packed parking lots, guns, bombs sounding off
If I had my own world

I'd build you an empire
From here to the far lands
To spread love like violence
If I had my own world
I'd build you an empire
From here to the far lands
To spread love like violence
Let me feel you

Carry you higher
Watch our words spread
Hope like fire
Secret crowds rise up and
Gather
Hear your voices
Sing back louder
If I had my own world

I'd show you the life that's inside it
The way that it glows when you find it
The way it survives with its families
Friends or its enemies
Let's make this a new world
I swear you can go if you'd want to
I know that you have that within you
Inventing the first clean and usable
God's greatest miracle
If I had my own world

I'd build you an empire
From here to the far lands
To spread love like violence
If I had my own world
I'd build you an empire
From here to the far lands
To spread love like violence
Let me feel you

Carry you higher
Watch our words spread
Hope like fire
Secret crowds rise up and
Gather
Hear your voices
Sing back louder
Let me feel you

Carry you higher
Watch our words spread
Hope like fire
Secret crowds rise up and
Gather
Hear your voices
Sing back louder
Let me feel you

Carry you higher
Watch our words spread
Hope like fire
Secret crowds rise up and
Gather
Hear your voices
Sing back louder
Let me feel you
Carry you higher
Watch our words spread
Hope like fire
Secret crowds rise up and
Gather
Hear your voices
Sing back louder
