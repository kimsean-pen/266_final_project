It's every day
I'm in this place
I feel this way
I feel the same

It's every day
I'm in this place
I feel this way
I feel the same

Is it all inside my head
Is it all inside my head

I view the list
And take my pick
I view my fate
And make a choice
'Cause it's nobody else's but mine

But You're in my heart
I can feel Your beat
And You move my mind
From behind the wheel

When I lose control
I can only breathe Your name
I can only breathe Your name

So many days
Within this race
I need the truth
I need some grace

I need the path
To find my place
I need some truth
I need some grace

The part of You
That's part of me
Will never die, will never leave
And it's nobody else's but mine

You are in my heart
I can feel Your beat
And you move my mind
From behind the wheel

When I lose control
I can only breathe Your name
I can only breathe Your name

You'll view the list
And take Your pick
You'll view my fate
And make the choice
'Cause I'm nobody else's but yours

And You're in my heart
I can feel You're beat
And you move my mind
From behind the wheel

When I lose control
I can only breathe Your name

'Cause You're in my heart
I can feel Your beat
And you move my mind
From behind the wheel

When I lose control
I can only breathe Your name
I can only breathe Your name

I can only breathe Your name
I can only breathe Your name
