Did you really carry me when I was asleep.
Did you try to defend me when I was weak.
Did you pick me up that lonely night
When the lights died out
And it turned to the gray side

Did you carry me when I was asleep
Now you're out on the bottomless sea
So it's time for you to lean on me
Lean on Me

Now you're out on the bottomless sea
So it's time for you to lean on me

Did you lie for me
To keep me safe
Did you bare with me
When I misbehaved

Far from here could you feel my fear

When the lights died out
And it turned to the gray side

Did you lie for me
To keep me safe

Now you're out on the bottomless sea
So it's time for you to lean on me (*2)

What's that falling down
Frozen on the ground
I'm trying to stop the light

Now you're out on the bottomless sea
So it's time for you to lean on me (*2)
Lean on me (*4)
