CITADEL, OF HOPE AND WHITE FIRE
HEARKEN, A CHOIR FOR KINGS... TRANSCENDENCE
CROWNED IN TEETH AND SEVERED WINGS
IS THIS THE END OF THE FLESH?

my prison and my salvation

A CALL FROM THE VOID, PALE TENTACLES
ENTHRONED, ALONE, DYING
DOWN WITH MY DRAPED LEECHES... OH LOVER
MELANCHOLIA...

you fill my lungs
am i undone?
where i swallow the light
drown me in your arms, so deep
drown me in your arms
ABYSSAL WYRMWELL
fathomless...
DROWN ME IN YOUR ARMS...

ANATOMY OF SPACE AND TIME
GATHERED IN VEILED DEPTHS... DESCENDANT
ARE THESE GOD'S TEARS IN THIS PITCH BLACK TOMB OR THE PAIN OF MY MEMORIES?
OF ALL SUFFERING, AWAKE ARCHITECTS
THE MOTHER, THE FATHER, THE EYE
TRUMPETS BELLOW, THE RIPPLES TRANSFIGURE
WRETCHED AM I...

white eyes and blue lips, lover
devour me...
drown me in your arms
ABYSSAL WYRMWELL
fathomless...
DROWN ME IN YOUR ARMS...
DROWN ME IN YOUR ARMS
ABYSSAL WYRMWELL
fathomless...

A BURNING GAUNTLET HELD TO HER BREAST
IN HER ARMS THE PHOENIX LAY BLACKENED IN MOURNING
A PURGING OF ASHES DOWN HER HOURGLASS FIGURE
INSCRIBED ON MY HEART, -DEVOUR ME, COLOSSUS-

scent of the earth
touch of the light
here, where colours collide
this blackhole ignites
my world in bloom

FLESH TO FLOWERS, BLOOD TO RIVERS
MY BREATH TO THE WIND
THE STARS STEAL MY EYES AND THE SUN SEARS MY MIND
THIS BLACKHOLE IGNITES
MY WORLD IN BLOOM
HERE I STAND, CITADEL... HERE I STAND...

HERE WHERE COLOURS COLLIDE
THIS BLACKHOLE IGNITES
MY WORLD IN BLOOM
scent of the earth
touch of the light
here, where colours collide
this blackhole ignites
my world in bloom
my world in bloom
IN BLOOM...
