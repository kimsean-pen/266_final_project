All the white lights falling
The blue lights are falling
Night is warm
Came down with a promise
I have my best shirt on
I lower myself now
It is a way to forget
Of last year's failure

Will the streetlights reflect me well enough
Am I transparent when I am clean
Will the darkness around me be so strong
That there is no way I can be seen

Boys will we become
Heroes of this night
Or am I just happy
Whenever not sober
I cleaned myself well
Clean today

Will the streetlights reflect me well enough
Am I transparent when I am clean
Will the darkness around me be so strong
That there is no way I can be seen

Will the streetlights reflect me well enough
Am I transparent when I am clean
Will the darkness around me be so strong
That there is no way I will be seen

And when I pause for one breath
I see millions like me

And when I pause for one breath
I see millions like me

Will the streetlights reflect me well enough
Am I transparent when I am clean
Will the darkness around me be so strong
That there is no way I can be seen

Will the streetlights reflect me well enough
Am I transparent when I am clean
Will the darkness around me be so strong
That there is no way I will be seen
