Musing through memories
Losing my grip in the grey
Numbing the senses
I feel you slipping away
Fighting to hold on
Clinging to just one more day
Love turns to ashes
With all that I wish I could say

I'd die to be where you are
I tried to be where you are

Every night I dream you're still here
The ghost by my side, so perfectly clear
When I awake, you'll disappear
Back to the shadows
With all I hold, dear
With all I hold, dear
I dream you're still here

I dream you're still here
Hidden companion
Phantom be still in my heart
Make me a promise that
Time won't erase us

That we were not lost from the start
I'd die to be where you are

I tried to be where you are
Every night I dream you're still here
The ghost by my side, so perfectly clear
When I awake, you'll disappear
Back to the shadows
With all I hold, dear
With all I hold, dear

I dream you're still here,(Every night i dream you're still)
I dream you're still here
Ever slightly out of reach
I dream you're still here
But it breaks so easily
I try to protect you

I can't let you fade
I feel you slipping

I feel you slipping away
Every night I dream you're still here
The ghost by my side, so perfectly clear
When I awake, you'll disappear
Back to the shadows
With all I hold, dear
With all I hold, dear
I dream you're still here
I dream you're still here
(Every night i dream you're still)
(Every night i dream you're still here)
I dream you're still here
(Every night I dream you're still)
(Every night i dream you're still here),
Ever slightly out of reach
(I dream you're still here)
(Every night I dream you're still)
(Every night I dream you're still here),
But it breaks so easily .
