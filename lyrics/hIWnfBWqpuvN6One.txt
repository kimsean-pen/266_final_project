The boy looked at Johnny and said
My word that was fun
Oh when he did it with his hat on
And a saddle and a gun
Please slow motion eating your breakfast
At the Side View hotel
Oh sipping down wine
Everything's going so well

And New York City's very pretty in the night time
But aha don't you miss Soho
Where everybody goes
La dee dii, la dee dii, la la la
La dee dii, la dee dii, la la la
La dee dii, la dee dii, la la la
La la la

And the boy looked at Johnny
He said "Don't you know who I think I am?"
He said "I did it once before
Now I'm trying all I can"

Lord she says no no no
Oh yeah yeah yeah
I said no no no
Oh yeah yeah yeah

And New York City's very pretty in the night time
Aha don't you miss Soho
Where everybody goes
La dee dii, la dee dii, la la la
La dee dii, la dee dii, la la la
La dee dii, la dee dii, la la la
La la la

Yes New York City's very pretty in the night time
Aha, don't you miss Soho
Where everybody goes
La dee dii, la dee dii, la la la
La dee dii, la dee dii, la la la
La dee dii, la dee dii, la la la
La la la
