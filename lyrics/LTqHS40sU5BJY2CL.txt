Is there a part of me that's part of you?
If I shed a tear, baby do you bleed?
Is there a heart in me that's close to you?
Is there a path to you I haven't seen?

I can't ever
Ever tell you why
You are my horizon
I'll just hold my tongue
I really wanna show you how I'm loving you
In my life
In my life
In my life

New innocence
Awakening in me, in me
Awakening
New innocence
Awakening in me, in me
Awakening

Crystal sparks when I spotted you
Ricocheting colours in a cavalcade
Eye of the storm is a part of you
The Empire's Sun the eternal flame

I can't ever
Ever tell you why
You are my horizon
I'll just hold my tongue
I really wanna show you how I'm loving you
In my life
In my life
In my life

New innocence
Awakening in me, in me
Awakening
New innocence
Awakening in me, in me
Awakening

Awakening
Awakening

There's a higher way from here
There's a higher way from here
There's a place we run from here
There's a place that's far from here

New innocence
Awakening in me, in me
Awakening
New innocence
Awakening in me, in me
Awakening ...

Awakening
