Press play on the day
That you came into my life, yeah
Felt our eyes, harmonize
it was strange, it was paradise, oh

'Cause when I look back on it, life lacked the sonic
A quiet kinda solitude
Tell me how'd you do it, you added the music
I never heard a song like you
'Cause you're my boombox baby, you can say anything
Blow my speakers out with you

Yeah, you're my boombox baby you can sing anything
And I'mma sing along with you
And if I push the right button will you show me something?
Little melody that I can groove to

Crusin' with my boombox baby, you can say anything
Blow my speakers out with you
Yeah, you're my boom-boom-boombox baby

Press pause just because all I want is to stay right here
I, want you to spin me round, right round, right round
Till we disappear, yeah

'Cause when I look back on it, life lacked the sonic
A quiet kinda solitude
Tell me how'd you do it, you added the music
I never heard a song like you

'Cause you're my boombox baby, you can say anything
Blow my speakers out with you
Yeah, you're my boombox baby you can sing anything
And I'mma sing along with you
And if I push the right button, will you show me something?
Little melody that I can groove to

Crusin' with my boombox baby, you can say anything
Blow my speakers out with you
Yeah, you're my boom-boom-boombox baby

You make me wanna move my feet, shake shake my hips
Making brand new moves to you
You make me wanna move my feet, shake shake my hips
Making brand new moves to you

'Cause you're my boombox baby, you can say anything
Blow my speakers out with you
Yeah, you're my boombox baby you can sing anything
And I'mma sing along with you
And if I push the right button, will you show me something?
Little melody that I can groove to

Crusin' with my boombox baby, you can say anything
Blow my speakers out with you
Yeah, you're my boom-boom-boombox baby
