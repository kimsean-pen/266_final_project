Pretty Ballerina
Left Banke

I had a date with a pretty ballerina
Her hair so brilliant that it hurt my eyes,
I asked her for this dance and then she obliged me
Was I surprised, yeah, was I surprised, no not at all

I called her yesterday, it should have been tomorrow
I could not keep this joy that was inside,
I beg for her to tell me if she really loved me,
Some where a mountain is moving
Afraid it's moving without me.
(Instrumental Break)
La La La La La La

I had a date with a pretty ballerina
Her hair so brilliant that hurt my eyes
I asked for this dance and then she obliged me
Was I surprised, yeah, was I surprised, no not at all.

And when I wake on that dreary Sunday morning,
I open up my eyes to find there's rain,
And something strange within says go ahead and find her
Just close your eyes, yeah, just close your eyes
And she'll be there
She'll be there
She'll be there
