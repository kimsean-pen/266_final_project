The world is a vampire,
Sent to drain
Secret destroyers,
Hold you up to the flames

And what do I get
For my pain?

Betrayed desires
And a piece of the game
Even though I know,
I suppose I'll show

All my cool and cold like old Job
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Then someone will say what is lost can never be saved

Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Now I'm naked,

Nothing but an animal
But can you fake it
For just one more show?
And what do you want?

I want to change
And what have you got,
When you feel the same?
Even though I know,
I suppose I'll show

All my cool and cold like old Job
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Then someone will say what is lost can never be saved

Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Tell me I'm the only one
Tell me there's no other one

Jesus was an only son
Tell me I'm the chosen one
Jesus was an only son for you

Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Then someone will say what is lost can never be saved
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Tell me I'm the only one
Tell me there's no other one
Jesus was an only son for you
And I still believe that I cannot be saved
And I still believe that I cannot be saved
And I still believe that I cannot be saved
And I still believe that I cannot be saved
