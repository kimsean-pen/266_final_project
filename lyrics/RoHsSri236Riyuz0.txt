What's the time?
Seems it's already morning
I see the sky

it's so beautiful and blue
The tv's on
but the only thing showing
Is a picture of you

Oh I get up
and make myself some coffee
I try to read a bit

but the story's too thin
I thank the Lord above
You're not here to see me
in this shape I'm in

Spending my time
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small
I stare at the wall
Hoping that you
think of me too.
I'm spending my time

I try to call
but I don't know
what to tell you
I leave a kiss

on your answering machine
Oh help me please
Is there someone
who can make me

Wake up from this dream?

Spending my time
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small
I stare at the wall
Hoping that you
are missing me too
I'm spending my time
Watching the sun go down
I fall asleep to the sound
Of "Tears of a clown"
A prayer gone blind
I'm spending my time

My friends keep telling me:
Hey, life will go on
Time will make sure
I'll get over you
This silly game of love
You play, you win only to lose
I'm spending my time
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small
I stare at the wall
Hoping that you
think of me too
I'm spending my time
(I'm spending my time)
Watching the sun go down
I fall asleep to the sound
Of "Tears of a clown"
A prayer gone blind
I'm spending my time
