We'll meet again on Friday and
Go sing in them bars
It won't be the same as it once was but
Nothing says goodbye hard

You'll tell me that this is a mistake and
You've fallen too fast
Find your happiness in this place
Stop reaching too far

Two lines of thought
Makes me wonder what I'm missin'
Towns low in the back of your head
It leads me away from the life I'm living x

I wanna feel that thrill of the night
Feel the stillness stripped from the light
Oh, dreams of dust crumble x

Two lines of thought
Makes me wonder what I'm missin'
Towns low in the back of your head
It leads me away from the life I'm living

Lines of bamboo
See what you do to me x

I wanna feel that thrill of the night
Feel the stillness stripped from the light
Oh, dreams of dust crumble x

Memories of the streets and subway lines
I see them weigh like misspent time

Lines of bamboo
See what you do to me x
