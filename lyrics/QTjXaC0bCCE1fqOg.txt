The part that hurts me is when they try to work me
But I could never let ya jerk me

Steady sticking to the wall, give it up
Sneaking through the back door, live it up
Got the champagne, pour me a cup
Got the girls looking raw in the front

Tell the bar, "Another round"
Got all my mans holding me down
Kinda thick ma, let's get down, so get wit it

Got playas on the grind, wanna skip wit it?
Backstage you mine, I'm'a spit wit it, hey
