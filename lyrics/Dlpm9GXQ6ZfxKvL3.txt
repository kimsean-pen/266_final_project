Have I established a pattern
Perhaps a bi-annual mental collapse?
And is every day a thousand years
For anyone with ears to hear?

Someday I'll find me
Someday I'll find me

Can you really make all things new?
I have reason to believe you do, nothing new
Break on through, to the other side, part two

Someday I'll find me
Someday I'll find me

If the briar or wheat grow
Cloven tongues of fire aglow
Or of snow, bond or free
In whatever you may be

Someday I'll find me
Someday I'll find me
