Didn't I make you feel
Like you were the only man
Didn't I give you everything
That a woman possibly can
Lord - But with all the love I give you
It ain't never enough
Well, I'm gonna show you baby
That a woman can be tough
So, come on, come on, come on, come on and

Break it
Break another little piece of my heart now baby
Take it
Take another little piece of my heart now honey
You can have it
Have another little piece of my heart now baby
You know you've got it
If it makes you feel good

You're out on the street looking good
And you know, deep down in your heart
That it ain't right
No... You never ever hear me when I cry at night
Though I tell myself that I can't stand my pain
But when you hold me in your arms, I say it again
So, come on, come on, come on, come on and

Break it
Break another little piece of my heart now baby
Take it
Take another little piece of my heart now honey
You can have it
Have another little piece of my heart now baby
You know you've got it
If it makes you feel good

Break it
Break another little piece of my heart now baby
Take it
Take it little piece of my heart now honey
You can have it
Have another little piece of my heart now baby
You know you've got it
If it makes you feel good
