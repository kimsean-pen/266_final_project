There you are
standing with all your friends
So I wait
till your alone again
...

And the minutes feel
like eternity
...
All these words

buried inside my heart

Every step
feels like the hardest spark

...
But the last six feet
are gonna kill me
...

So just take this chance
...
I've got it all planned

...

I'll pick you up at 8
and we can drive around
Take you to the beach
and we can head downtown

While
you

hold
my
hand
We're parking late out on the hood
of my car

Listen to the air ways
as we count the stars
Tonight
I'll
be
your

man
And tomorrow we can do it again
...
(and tomorrow we can do it again)
If i could

give you the world tonight
Then I would

still give you all my time
...
And I'd be wish
cause love is everything
...

So just take this chance
I've got it all planned
I'll pick you up at 8
and we can drive around
Take you to the beach
and we can head downtown
While
you
hold
my
hand
We're parking late out on the hood
of my car
Listen to the air ways
as we count the stars
Tonight
I'll
be
your
man
And tomorrow we can do it again
...
Lets take this moment
It's ours to own it
So come with me dont let it go to waste
No you dont wanna
Then miss out on us
Im telling you that girls dont fade away
...
I'll pick you up at 8
and we can drive around
Take you to the beach
and we can head downtown
While
you
hold
my
hand
We're parking late out on the hood
of my car
Listen to the air ways
as we count the stars
Tonight
I'll
be
your
man
And tomorrow we can do it again

I'll pick you up at 8
and we can drive around
Take you to the beach
and we can head downtown
We're parking late out on the hood
of my car
Listen to the air ways
as we count the stars
Tonight
I'll
be
your
man
I'll
give
you
all
I
can
...
And tomorrow we can do it again
