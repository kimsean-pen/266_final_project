Hold on
Money can't buy 'em love now
Got no blood run below now
Where you at now
Where have you gone right now

Told me I never go loud
I won't share no blood with low clowns
Where you at now
Where you at

Them beasts
Far east
They know where the gold is
Wet dreams
Sometimes it seems
Like what I been told
Them beasts
Far east
They know where the gold lord is

Deep in deep in with you
Deep in deep in with you
Deep in deep in with you
Deep in deep in
Deep in deep in with you
Deep in deep in with you
Deep in deep in with you
Deep in deep in

I'll be the sinner when I rock with ya
I said all I wanna do is get down with ya
I be the sinner when I rock with ya
I said all I wanna do would ya

Them beasts
Far east
They know where the gold is
Wet dreams
Sometimes it seemns
Like what I been told
Them beasts
Far east
They know where the gold lord is
Where you at

Deep in deep in with you
Deep in deep in with you
Deep in deep in with you
Deep in deep in
Deep in deep in with you
Deep in deep in with you
Deep in deep in with you
Deep in deep in

I dreamed of buttlerflies
Or the buttlerflies dreamed of me
I recognize the wings I realized
Our dreams never reply
I dreamed of buttlerflies
Or the buttlerflies dreamed of me
I recognize the wings I realized
Our dreams never reply

I'm awake huh
I'mma wake huh
I'm awake huh
I'mma wake huh
I'm awake huh
I'mma wake huh
