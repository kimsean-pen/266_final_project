Well it's Saturday night and I just got paid
A fool about my money don't try to save
My heart says go, go have a time
'Cause it's Saturday night babe and I'm feelin' fine

I'm gonna rock it up, I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up, gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rip it up and ball tonight

Well I got me a date and I won't be late
I picked her up in my '88
Shag on down by the social hall
When the joint starts jumpin', I'll have a ball

I'm gonna rock it up, I'm gonna shake it up
I'm gonna rip it up, gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rip it up and ball tonight

Along about 10 I'll be flying high
I walk on out in the open sky
But I don't care if I spend my dough
'Cause tonight I'm gonna be one happy soul

I'm gonna rock it up, I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up, gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rip it up and ball tonight

Well it's Saturday night and I just got paid
A fool about my money don't try to save
My heart says go, go have a time
'Cause it's Saturday night babe and I'm feelin' fine
I'm gonna rock it up, I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up, gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rip it up and ball tonight
