I saw a UFO, on a horse in Mexico
In the lonely night time, where my dog died
ET it called my name, I never heard that thing again
On the zombie mountain, where the dead die

They don't eat people
They don't watch TV
Or worship Satan

Strange days moving on, AI and the Higgs Boson
And the looming deadline, murder suicide
I pray for everyone, as a godless sapien
As the zoo, impound us all

They don't eat people
They don't watch TV
No, or worship Satan
Or read astrology
They don't eat people
They don't watch TV
No!
Or worship Satan

I saw a UFO, oh I don't see the sun no more
In eternal darkness, where the dark die
ET it called my name, I never heard that thing again
On the zombie mountain
Where the dead die

No!
