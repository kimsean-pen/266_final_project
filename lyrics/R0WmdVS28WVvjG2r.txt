Uh, uh

I can feel the bass, from the ceiling to the basement
I don't feel a thing, get the fuck up out my face, bitch
I don't feel a thing, yeah I'm faded, yeah I'm shaded
I don't feel a thing, I can feel the bass, I can feel the bass

Distorted, distorted records
Distorted, distorted records
Distorted, distorted records
Distorted records

First things first, I done heard the worst things
Like if I'm in your top 10, mine's better be the first name
Out your mouth, ain't even worth saying
Little niggas is my offsprings
They deserve a nigga' first name, middle name, third name
From another planet, birthplace
Cloud 9, hello earthlings
Our newest president an asshole
I guess that's why I'm leaving turd stains
My exes used to stay bad tings
All they listened to was bird things
My girl never liked the bad brains
Foreign hoes got the fur brains
Everything I do groundbreak
Big body make the floor break
Big bass make the world shake
Flacko out here causing earthquakes

I can feel the bass, uh, I can see the fakes
Word to T.D. Jakes, uh, word to Pastor Ma$e and Kirk Franklin
Fuck what niggas think, I'm about the bank
Comma, dollar signs, I'm about my Franklins
I can feel the bass

Distorted, distorted records
Distorted, distorted records
