I never saw this coming
Since the beginning you were in control
And now my heart is drumming
Believe this love could maybe save my soul

I hear a voice out of the silence
That can always bring me home

Don't let me go
Now i'm right where i want to be
Don't let me go
You cut straight to the heart of me

Forever want for nothing
Caught in a place where i'm released from fear
So in my dreams i'm running
Towards the light that came and brought us here

I hear a voice out of the silence
That can always bring me home

Don't let me go
Now i'm right where i want to be
Don't let me go
You cut straight to the heart of me

The heart of me
Straight through the heart of me
