Feeling funny in my mind, Lord
I believe I'm fixin' to die
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord
I believe I'm fixin' to die
Well, I don't mind dyin'
But I hate to leave my children crying

Well, I look over yonder to that burying ground
Look over yonder to that burying ground
Sure seems lonesome, Lord
When the sun goes down

Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord
I believe I'm fixin' to die, fixin' to die
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord
I believe I'm fixin' to die
Well, I don't mind dyin'
But I hate to leave my children crying

Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord
It's rising up above my head, up above my head
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord
It's rising up above my head
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed

Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord
I believe I'm fixin' to die, fixin' to die
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord
I believe I'm fixin' to die
Fixin' to die, fixin' to die
Well, I don't mind dyin'
But I hate to leave my children crying
