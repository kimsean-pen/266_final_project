He made the world a grassy road before our bare, wandering feet,
(He made the world a grassy road before our bare, wandering feet)
and crushed the stones into the softest sand between our toes,
(and crushed the stones into the softest sand)

But we're wondering where to sleep,
all the clever words on pages turn to fragments;
Circles, points and lines, and cover them like carpets, with graceful,
meaningless ornamental designs,
come quick,
you light that knows no evening
Come, alone to the alone!
I have a thousand half-loves well worth leaving for you to take your madness home,
and you dance inside my chest where no on sees you,
but sometimes I see you.

(And with you light that knows no evening
Come, alone to the alone!
I've a thousand half-loves well worth leaving for you to take your madness home,
and you dance inside my chest, et cetera,
et cetera,
et cetera!)

Oh rejoice, the cleansing of my lips!
Rejoice, salvation of my soul!
I still have a thousand half-loves
Oh my God, I want to shoot myself just thinking about it!
And you think I don't mean what I say?
Well I mean every word I say.

I threw a stone down at the reflection of my image in the water,
(I threw a stone down at the reflection of my image in the water)
and it altogether disappeared.
I burst as it shattered through me like a bullet through a bottle,
and I'm expected to believe that any of this is real?
