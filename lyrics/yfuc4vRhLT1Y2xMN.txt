Hypocrite reader, my double, my brother
Your daddy really took it outta you
Until you're speaking in tongues
Until you're speaking in tongues.

Sneaking out the windows now
You got the spirit now.

Hypocrite reader my double, my brother
Where did we lose our way?
It's like we're speaking in tongues
It's like we're speaking in tongues

Sneaking out the windows now
You got the spirit now

You got the spirit now!

You got the spirit now!

Hypocrite reader, my double, my brother
Now I can't understand the words
Now you're speaking in tongues
Now you're speaking in tongues
Now you're speaking in tongues
Now you're speaking tongues

Come out of your head and into my world now
Come out of your head and into my world, my world, my world now

(speaking in tongues ah-ah)
(speaking in tongues ah-ah)
(speaking in tongues ah-ah)
(speaking in tongues ah-ah)
(speaking in tongues ah-ah)
(speaking in tongues ah-ah)
