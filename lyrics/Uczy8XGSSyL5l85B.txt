Awaiting my last breath
the mirror calls my name
it's showing me the way
into the dark
the bridge appears
I jump into the dark side
and hear the voice it's cold as ice
"Welcome to reality"

Where am I now?
Darkness surrounds
can't go forward
can't go back

Kai: I see planets dying
Hansi: I fall into the light
K: a new universe awakes
H: I'm a Traveler in Time
K: pray for the light
H: Where's the key
K: to the gate
H/K: of a new life - no
H: I search for deliverance
K: but I cannot find

Look behind the mirror
I'm lost in the twilight hall
once I'll be back for a moment in time
that's when the mirror's falling down

Take me away
from the place I've been
to another life
in another world
a sign of life
surrounds me now
the bridge appears in the dark
I'm free
I fly alone
leaving the darkness now, forever?
the memories of children
and the wisdom of many lifes
burns deep in me
Where will the light go to?
Where will the light go to?
Is this deliverance?
Is it the end?

Look behind the mirror
I'm lost in the twilight hall
once I'll be back for a moment in time
that's when the mirror's falling down

I'm back there's a new chance for me
and all my memories are gone
I can feel what's happening to me
and the mirrow will burst

Look behind the mirror
I'm lost in the twilight hall
once I'll be back for a moment in time
that's when the mirror's falling down

Look behind the mirror
I'm lost in the twilight hall
once I'll be back for a moment in time
that's when the mirror's falling down
