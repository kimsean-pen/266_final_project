Do you recall its name?
As it suggested beck and call
This face and heel
Will drag your halo through the mud
Ash of Pompeii
Erupting in a statue's dust
Shrouded in veils
Because these handcuffs hurt too much

Still scalping these ticketless applause
And when they drag the lake there's nothing left at all

Sutured contusion
Beyond the anthills of the dawning of this plague
Said I've lost my way
Even if this cul-de-sac would pay
To reach inside a vault
Whatever be the cost
Sterling clear blackened ice
And when they drag the lake there's nothing left at all

I defected
I defected
I defected
I defected

Sutured contusion
Beyond the anthills of the dawning of this plague
Said I've lost my way
Even if this cul-de-sac did pay
To reach inside a vault
Whatever be the cost
Sterling clear blackened ice
And when they drag the lake there's nothing left at all

I defected
I defected
I defected
I defected

Beyond the anthills of the dawning of this plague
Said I've lost my way
Even if this cul-de-sac did pay
Beyond the anthills of
Beyond the anthills of of of of of of of
Said I've lost my way yeah
Even if you
Even if you
Even if you reach inside a vault
Whatever be the cost
Sterling clear blackened ice
Whoa they drag the lake there's nothing left at all

I defected
I defected
I defected
I defected
