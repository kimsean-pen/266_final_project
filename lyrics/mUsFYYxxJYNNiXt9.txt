Ricky was a young boy
He had a heart of stone
Lived 9 to 5 and he worked
His fingers to the bone

Just barely out of school
He came from the edge of town
Fought like a switchblade
So no one could take him down, oh no

He had no money
No, no good at home
He walked the streets a soldier
And he fought the world alone and now it's

18 and life you got it
18 and life you know
Your crime is time and it's
18 and life to go
18 and life you got it
18 and life you know
Your crime is time
And it's 18 and life to go

Tequila in his heartbeat
His veins full of gasoline
He kept his motor running
But it never kept him clean

They say he loved adventure
"Ricky's the wild one"
He married trouble
And had a courtship with a gun

Bang-bang shoot 'em up
The party never ends
You can't think of dying
When the bottle's your best friend and now it's

18 and life you got it
18 and life you know
Your crime is time and it's
18 and life to go
18 and life you got it
18 and life you know
Your crime is time
And it's 18 and life to go, ye-yeah

"Accidents will happen?"
They all heard Ricky say
He fired his six-shot to the wind
That child blew a child away, ye-yeah

18 and life you got it
18 and life you know
Your crime is time and it's
18 and life to go
18 and life you got it
18 and life you know
Your crime is time
And it's 18 and life to go
