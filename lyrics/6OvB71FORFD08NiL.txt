The clouds move over Pontiac skies
Their silent thunder matches mine
I know this feeling from long ago
I wondered was it gone, but now I know

So when she calls, don't send her my way
When it hurts, you'll know it's the right thing

Michigan's in the rear-view now
Keep your hands, where I could see 'em
It took the words right out my mouth
When you knew that I would need 'em
What am I supposed to do now?
Without you, without you

It's unannounced, like you'd expect it
I'm on broke down brake lines and Motown records
And all that's left is a blind reflection
But you know what's coming and you regret it

So when she calls, don't send her my way
When it hurts most it's the right thing

Michigan's in the rear-view now
Keep your hands, where I could see 'em
It took the words right out my mouth
When you knew that I would need 'em
What am I supposed to do now?
Without you, without you

Michigan's in the rear-view now
Keep your hands, where I could see 'em
It took the words right out my mouth
When you knew that I would need 'em
What am I supposed to do now?
Without you, without you
