A spirit seeks to rise above
(A spirit seeks to rise above)
But the routine brings it down
Brings it down
Mind is eager to open wide
(Mind is eager to open wide)
But constraint's gotta cork it up

Up to the tomb of broken dreams
Down to the top of false believes
Up to the cooling iron core
Down to the stairs that lead to the heaven's door

Up, down. If there's no difference
Down, up. Let's levitate between plus and minus
Of all the sins people possess
Indifference must be the deadliest

Decide!

Decompose into good and evil
Divide chaos and order
Separate hot from cold
Disjoint light and darkness
Plus and minus

No more duality
The vision of what is right becomes crystal clear
No bipolarity
The vision of what is right becomes crystal clear
No bipolarity
The vision of what is right becomes crystal clear
No more duality
The vision of what is right is not crystal clear

Find all the answers to the question never asked
Don't skip the blanks. Plus or minus?
