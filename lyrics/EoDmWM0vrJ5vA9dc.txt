Dreaming of palm trees tonight
This is the season, the city is sleeping
Gleaming and glistening white
But it's always summer with you
Outside, it's cold and gray
All the streets shine like silver lakes
And the stop lights are blinking red and green
Like something in a movie scene
Snow babe, it's in the air
And I'm frozen but I don't care
Cuz I'm golden as long as I'm with you

Cuz when I'm in your arms it's like a california winter
Yeah, your love can keep me warm
When it's storming outside
And you're holding me tight
It's like you take me to paradise
California winter
Yeah, your touch is like sunshine
And on my holiday
Feels like I'm in l.a.
Cuz I'm yours and I know you're mine, yeah baby
(California-california winter, california-california winter)
When it's storming outside
And you're holding me tight
It's like you take me to paradise

Dark skies, december hail
But I'm bright eyed and bushy tailed
Like I'm pool side and soaking up the sun
Even though my toes are numb
You are my angel wings
You are my north star, watch over me
And when it gets dark you always light me up
Cuz when I'm in your arms it's like a california winter
Yeah, your love can keep me warm

When it's storming outside and you're holding me tight
It's like you take me to paradise
California winter
Yeah, your touch is like sunshine
And on my holiday
Feels like I'm in l.a.
Cuz I'm yours and I know you're mine, yeah baby
(California-california winter, california-california winter)
When it's storming outside

And you're holding me tight
It's like you take me to paradise
Sparkling icicles freeze
You light a fire inside of me and it feels like a tropical breeze
Melting my heart like a cinnamon candle
Burning on christmas eve
Sweeter than candy and cozy as flannel
Hot like I'm out at the beach when you dance with me baby

(California-california winter, california-california winter)
When it's storming outside
And you're holding me tight
It's like you take me to paradise
(California-california winter, california-california winter)
And on my holiday
It feels like I'm in l.a.
Cuz I'm yours and I know you're mine, yeah baby
