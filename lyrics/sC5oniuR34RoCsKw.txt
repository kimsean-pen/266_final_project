I gave him a cigarette
So he opened up his head
The man forever on the corner
He called it his pre-vision:

Unhorse for me, dear sir
The marble emperor
Defenestrate the king

The howling waves of people crashing through the first blockade
The guards - they washed away
They thundered up the stairwell until they reached that golden door
They knocked upon the golden door

Knock it down

The portraits in the hallway look better smashed upon the floor
Gaudy baubles - turned to dust
The hatred he brewed within us is now crashing loud upon his shore
The vultures returned to roost

What a lovely view
Horizon looks like fire
Open up the window, let the light in

Throw him out

What a lovely view
From the window
What a lovely dream
