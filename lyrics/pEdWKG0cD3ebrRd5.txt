When silence betrays

We've tried to find a reason
To go on and cross the line
Tell me
How can we justify the act
We've tried to look around and
Search for ways to shift the blame
The escape
From moral sense we drift away
When we can't have it all
We want it all

With money segregating
The centers are degrading
The devastation
We feared we'd befall
But soon we'll realize that
We can get reunited
This could apply to us all, after all

We'll never find our peace of mind
If we don't leave the past behind
Make up your mind

When silence betrays

We spilled the tears for wretches
And for human sacrifice
Look at them
We've pushed them through the tiny holes
Yet still we know we're all responsible

With money segregating
The centers are degrading
The devastation
We feared we'd befall
But soon we'll realize that
We can get reunited
This could apply to us all, after all

We'll never find our peace of mind
If we won't leave the past behind
Make up your mind

Counting down

The road to perdition
Driving fast and without vision

Parva notes circum te
Incorrupta nitidaque
Vide, gusta, senti, bibe
Formam ex eis captes

We're failing we're ailing
Collapse is now drawing nearer
Derailing, the end is nigh

Unravelled, dishevelled
The answer's never been clearer
Unlevelled we're standing by

When we finally find the reason to exist
We will be able to appreciate the fundamental gifts

Drown, bury, erase
All that is dividing us
Down, parry, negate
All that's keeping us from growth
Feel the energy enclosed within us

Try to keep on searching for the meaning of our lives
Find the only values that can help us in our strife
Keep on searching and be ready when the tides are high

Try to find the philosopher deep within you
Trigger and motivate all that matters along your way
Seek and find the answers

With money segregating
The centers are degrading
The devastation
We feared we'd befall
But soon we'll realize that
We can get reunited
This could apply to us all, after all

We'll never find our peace of mind
If we won't leave the past behind
Wake up your troubled mind
