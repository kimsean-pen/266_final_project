Oh, yeah, you're pretty good looking for a girl, but your back is so broken.
And this feeling's still gonna linger on until the year 2525 now.

Yeah, you're pretty good looking for a girl, your eyes are wide open.
And your thoughts have been stolen by the boys,
Who took you out and bought you everything you own now.

Yeah, you're pretty good looking, oh yeah, you're pretty good looking.
Yes, you're pretty good looking, oh yeah, for a girl.

Lots of people in this world, but I want to be your boy.
To me that thought, it sounds so absurd, and I don't wanna be your toy.

Cause you're pretty good looking for a girl, my future's wide open.
But this feeling's still gonna linger on, until I know everything I need to know now.

Yeah, you're pretty good looking, oh yeah, you're pretty good looking.
Yes, you're pretty good looking, oh yeah, for a girl.
