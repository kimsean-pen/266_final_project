You won't find a friendly face in the crowd
It's quite amusing to see how you suffer now!
I refuse to let you steal my daylight
Barely awake, but it strengthens my night rage
I've seen you kill many dreams, but I've got brand new armour,
And your weapons are way out of reach

How does it feel to be demolished
Vaporized into thin air?
Strange new feeling, to be nothing

All the words I hear, they don't mean a thing
All the words I hear, they don't mean a thing
All drenched in fear and the hate you bring

Make me bother, I dare you
I've got the strength I need
But I'll await my darkest moment
When the guilt doesn't get to me

All the words I hear, they don't mean a thing (all drenched in fear)
All the words I hear, they don't mean a thing
All drenched in fear and the hate you bring

All the words I hear, they don't mean a thing (all drenched in fear)
All the words I hear, they don't mean a thing
All drenched in fear and the hate you bring

All the words I hear, they don't mean a thing (all drenched in fear)
All the words I hear, they don't mean a thing
All drenched in fear and the hate you bring
