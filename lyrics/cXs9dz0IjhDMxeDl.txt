I saw pictures from the space shuttle
North America at night
I could almost see my house
I could almost see the rest of my life
Now my mothers in the hospital
And my friends are in the news
Collecting trophies for the songs they wrote
When we lived in the shadow of the moon

Guess I never make a gold record
And I have never been to Mars
But I've traveled around this world
Shooting fireworks at falling stars (and prison bars)
And my fathers got a decent job
I hear he's finally pulling through
There's more to life than singing songs we write

When we are in the shadow of the moon

And I see colors
When I hear your voice
Grab your wings they're putting gravity on trial

I see colors,
I don't hear the noise
Because we're only flying for a while
Because we're only flying for a while

I saw this picture of my niece
Twisting high above the narrow beam
And my brother looked so proud

Like he woke up in this perfect dream
And I've know you all my life
But I knew you long before that too
Let's go dancing to the songs we wrote
When we lived in the shadow of the moon

And I see colors
When I hear your voice
Grab your wings

They're putting gravity on trial
I see colors
I don't hear the noise
Sometimes we're only flying for a while
And I could love you in the falling rain
Go grab your things
This is a storm we're meant to ride
Like synesthesia, aboard a stalling plane
It's like we're only flying for a while

Flying for a while

And I see colors
When I hear your voice
Grab your wings
They're putting gravity on trial
I see colors
I don't fear the choice
Sometimes we're only flying for a while
And I could love you in the falling rain
Go grab your wings
This is the storm we're meant to ride
Like synesthesia, a board a stalling plane
Sometimes we're only flying for a while
Flying for a while
Flying for a while
Flying for a while

I can see the colors running
When I hear the music play
I can see the colors running
When I hear the music play
I can see the colors running
When I hear the music play
I can see the colors running
When I hear the music play
I can see the colors running
When I hear the music play
I can see the colors running
When I hear the music play
