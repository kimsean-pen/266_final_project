Thoughts are coming
Double time
Isn't there a way to slow things down?
Constant traffic
Never ends
Maybe you could fill my thoughts instead
Keep descending
Submarine life
Till everything is so dark and quiet

In my mind
Nothing but an empty sea
But you're somewhere
In my mind
I've got you coming back sometime
You're still somewhere
In my mind

In my mind
Nothing but an empty sea
But you're somewhere
In my mind
I've got you coming back sometime
You're still somewhere
In my mind

Thoughts are coming

Submarine life
Till everything is so dark and quiet

In my mind
Nothing but an empty sea
But you're somewhere

You're still somewhere
