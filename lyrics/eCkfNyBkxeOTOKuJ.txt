Kiss me in a dream scene
Remember when we drove your car down the road?
It was just like in the movies
It was just like in the movies

And dancing in my bedroom
To Hounds of Love, we were so fucked up
It was just like in the movies
It was just like

Could you be the rebel without a cause?
Could you be the woman I'm falling for?
Well, could you?
Well, could you baby?
Could you be the rebel without a cause?
Could you be the woman I'm falling for?
Well, could you?
Well, could you baby?

You, me
We're stealing the show
We're stealing the show
You, me
We're stealing the show
We're stealing the show

So kiss me in the last scene
Remember when we drove your car down the road?
It was just like in the movies
It was just like in the movies

And here's looking at you, kid
I say goodbye for one last time
It was just like in the movies
It was just like in the movies

Could you be the rebel without a cause?
Could you be the woman I'm falling for?
Well, could you?
Well, could you baby?
Could you be the rebel without a cause?
Could you be the woman I'm falling for?
Well, could you?
Well, could you baby?

You, me
We're stealing the show
We're stealing the show

It was just like in the movies
It was just like in the movies
It was just like in the movies
It was just like

Could you be the rebel without a cause?
Could you be the woman I'm falling for?
Well, could you?
Well, could you, baby?

Could you be the rebel without a cause?
Could you be the woman I'm falling for?
Well, could you?
Well, could you, baby?

You, me
We're stealing the show
We're stealing the show
You, me
