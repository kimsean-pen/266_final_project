I'm trapped, and my back's up against the wall
I see no solution or exit out
I'm grinding it out, no one can see
The pressure's growing exponentially

I'm trying to keep up to speed with you
Your lane changing is oscillating me
I'm hitting the ground and I'm sprinting
I'm falling behind now I'm tuning out

Pressure building
Pressure building
Pressure building

Don't push me
Don't push me
Let me get off the ground
To you I'm no longer bound

Don't stop me
Don't choke me
I need you out of my head
You've got me close to the edge

I'm feeling the pressure, I can't break out
No one can hear me scream and shout
Get out of my face, out of my mind

I see your corruption, I'm not blind
I'll carry the burden and take the strain
And when I am done, I will make you pay

Pressure building
Pressure building
Pressure building

Don't push me
Don't push me
Let me get off the ground
To you I'm no longer bound

Don't curb me
Don't thwart me
I need you out of my head
You've got me close to the edge

Pressure building

Pressure building
Don't push me
Don't push me

Let me get off the ground
To you I'm no longer bound
Don't stop me

Don't block me
I need you out of my head
You've got me close to the edge

Pressure building
