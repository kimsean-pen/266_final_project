When you've gone about things all wrong,
Bury them here, with a lifetime you would never regret
In savoring sleep, what do you mean I toss and turn everywhere?
I'll miss you when you're gone
With pretending that you weren't the world to me
With that you'd call me a liar and in making mistakes
You'll rest incomplete...

In graver mistakes (I'll be home)
Dear mom and dad, I'll write you in this letter that states (I'll be moving on)
When the new day's begun, (new day's begun)
Forget your son when he's out on his own

The hand reads seven-thirty
And your night begins to sink in the short but faster fall
Anxious but calm retort to a mirror that frames your face
Baring the finest swell

And the day begins to break,
Like the tears that run across your cheek
Stand straight and imagine you then
In things and the way they could have been
When the thoughts they race across your chin
Here in the neverend

In graver mistakes (I'll be home)
Dear mom and dad, I'll write you in this letter that states (I'll be moving on)
When the new day's begun, (new day's begun)
Forget your son when he's out on his own

Point your gun in another direction
Now that you've cried yourself to sleep
Point your gun in another direction
Now that you've cried yourself to sleep
Here and there
After the fire

(Before you walk home)
When he's found figuring, will he be home again?
(Signal loss and stereo)
With wide open windows will she be waiting for
(The sounds surround the overpass)
With severed arm placement when the day's dark, old and dead
(A dead man against you)
We'll write her a letter with long time passing by

In graver mistakes (I'll be home)
Dear mom and dad, I'll write you in this letter that states (I'll be moving on)
When the new day's begun, (new day's begun)
Don't forget son when he's out on his own

Point your gun in another direction
Now that you've cried yourself to sleep
Point your gun in another direction
Now that you've cried yourself to sleep
Here and there
After the fire
After the fire

(Send my love, and I'll be moving on...)

And I'll be bigger...
And I'll be bigger...
