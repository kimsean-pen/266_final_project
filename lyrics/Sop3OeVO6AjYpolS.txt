When we were walking in that rainy day
You said "I don't want you to change while I'm not with you"
Well, I'd like to hear what you want, you want me to do
I won't let you down
Today is coming to the end
Nobody's going to tell you who you are
Today is coming to the end
Nobody's going to know who I am.
(Instrumental)
