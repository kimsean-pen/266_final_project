Remember when we read a magazine in the park
You then took off your coat and the you made a remark
You said December time
It was a better time
I won't remember time with you

I don't know
But maybe that's the point if I just
Don't know
Maybe I'll be safe just knowing I don't know
I could be happy but I don't know
I don't know

When I see what's happening
I realise I cried my life away
Maybe in another world
Be a time, a week, another day
I could be your coffee shop
And you could fall in love with every drink
I just want to talk to you
Be a call, a call, or anything

Well I'd probably trade up my days
Just for a slap in the face
Maybe a kick in the teeth
On my bed you're underneath
You want blood in lovers veins
I want love that sits on trains
Looking at me from afar
I fall in love every car
That I see, maybe
That's how it always should be
'cause I'm just a static on your TV dinner
(eat up, eat up) and we'll drink it down
(eat up, eat up) and we'll drink it down

When I see what's happening
I realise I cried my life away
Maybe in another world
Be a time, a week, another day
I could be your coffee shop
And you could fall in love with every drink
I just want to talk to you
Be a call, a call, or anything

When I see what's happening
I realise I cried my life away
Maybe in another world
Be a time, a week, another day
I could be your coffee shop
And you could fall in love with every drink
I just want to talk to you
Be a call, a call, or anything

When I see what's happening
I realise I cried my life away
Maybe in another world
Be a time, a week, another day
I could be your coffee shop
And you could fall in love with every drink
I just want to talk to you
Be a call, a call, or anything

When I see what's happening
I realise I cried my life away
Maybe in another world
Be a time, a week, another day
I could be your coffee shop
And you could fall in love with every drink
I just want to talk to you
Be a call, a call, or anything
