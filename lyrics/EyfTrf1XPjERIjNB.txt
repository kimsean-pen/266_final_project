I never did things by the book
If you trust me than you'll just have to take a look
I got a different plan for me
Just wait around and you will see
I'm taking on the world
I'm taking on the world
Strike me up. Take a breath full of doubt
Spin back at the walls
Brace yourself for the backlash
You better believe it
It's falling on you
From everything that I have learned
I got to take what I can get and not what I earned
But since I cannot stomach to lose
I'll take it all so that there's nothing left for you
I'm taking on the world
I'm taking on the world
Strike me up. Take a breath full of doubt
Spin back at the walls
Brace yourself for the backlash
You better believe it
It's falling on you
Ignite the fight deep down inside of you
You've got a lot to prove
DON'T STRIKE ME DOWN
I'm taking on the world (4x)
Strike me up. Take a breath full of doubt
Spin back at the walls
Brace yourself for the backlash
You better believe it
It's falling on you
It's falling on you
DON'T STRIKE ME DOWN
