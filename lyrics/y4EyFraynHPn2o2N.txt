Tell me what you want
What you like
It's okay
I'mma little curious, (too)
Tell me if it's wrong
If it's right
I don't care
I can keep a secret, could (you)?

Got my mind on your body
And your body on my mind
Got a taste for the cherry
I just need to take a bite

Don't tell your mother
Kiss one another
Die for each other
We're cool for the summer

Cool for the summer, cool for the summer...
(Jump Smokers)
We're cool for the summer

(Take me down...)
Take me down into your paradise
(Don't) Don't (be) be (scared) scared Cause I'm your body type
Just something that we wanna try
(Wanna try)
Cause you and I
(You and I)
We're cool for the summer

(Take me down)
We're cool for the summer
(Don't be scared)
Cause I'm your body type
Just something that we wanna try
Cause you and I
(You and I)

We're cool for the summer
We're cool for the summer
We're cool for the summer
