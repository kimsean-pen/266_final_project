Well I hope, when you can't hear what I am thinking, you know I can't always talk
But I'm always listening in an absence, where you hate to feel uncared for
Pretending there's nothing that you're not prepared for

Who are you lapping when you're running from surrender if life is a fatal race for all contenders?
To find the peace within the combat where we're standing, we have to make our history less commanding

Well, our mercy is a boundary we'll surrender when love is a safer place we both remember

Like an old estate that stands in no location at the edge of an age of endless renovation
And while all that noise competes for our attention, we'll meet on a quiet .eld in our own dimension

We'll step inside a world far less demanding when we allow for something less commanding
