It's all about a secret I had or kept or stole from you.
It's all about not knowing if I missed out on something new
You only know what I know.
I never meant to keep you in the dark
I know it doesn't mean much coming from me.
You want to laugh like they laugh?
Go ahead and laugh your face off, faker.
Just make sure to leave me home.
This is all about a secret I had.
