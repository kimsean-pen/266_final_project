It feels good
To say what I want
It feels good
To knock things down
It feels good
To see the disgust in their eyes
It feels good
And I'm gonna go wild
Spray paint the walls

I don't want
To see the plan succeed
There won't be room
For people like me
My life is their disease
It feels good
And I'm gonna go wild
Spray paint the walls

It feels good
To say what I want
It feels good
To knock things down
It feels good
To see the disgust in their eyes
It feels good
And I'm gonna go wild
Spray paint the walls
It feels good
And I'm gonna go wild
