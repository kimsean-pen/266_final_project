can sell my body if I wanna
God knows you already sold your mind
I may sell my body for money sometimes

But you can't stop the fire that burns
inside of me
You think I don't know
I'm here to tell you
I do

You think I don't know
I know the truth
about you

Jigsaw, jigsaw youth
We go with the kids
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

Jigsaw, jigsaw youth

We know there's not
one way, one light, one stupid truth
Don't fit your definitions
Don't need your demands
Not into
win lose reality
Won't fit in with
your plan
