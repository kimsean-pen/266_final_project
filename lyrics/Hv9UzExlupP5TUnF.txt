You like the smell of blood
When it's pumpin' like a factory
Ooh, you like your words to cut
You like to choose the best artillery
I wonder who you're thinkin' of
Who am I
Am I the epitome
Of everything you hate
And you desire
You love me like an enemy
You can run, you can hide
But sooner or later
It's gonna cut like a knife
Sooner or later
Nowhere to go
I'm already inside
You know
No one'll love ya like I love ya
'Cause love is a suicide
Love is a suicide
'Cause love is a suicide
Love is a suicide
It feels so surgical
How you dissect every mistake I make
You're like an animal
You bite me hard with every breath I take?
And when I'm on the edge?
You won't let me fall
Rope around my neck

But you won't take it off
And I'm hearin' voices sayin'
It's time that you know it
Go ahead if you mean it
Go 'head if you mean it
You can run, you can hide
But sooner or later
It's gonna cut like a knife
Sooner or later
Nowhere to go
I'm already ready
You know
No one'll love ya like I love ya
'Cause love is a suicide
Love is a suicide
'Cause love is a suicide
Love is a suicide
Close your eyes
Count to 10
Take the bullet out again
Say my name
Hit me hard
Put that gun right to my heart...
Bang
'Cause love is a suicide
Love is a suicide
'Cause love is a suicide
Love is a suicide
