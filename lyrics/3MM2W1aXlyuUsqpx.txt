I wanted love the most
But it never stays long
Add knots to my bedpost
Pretend they're mine

Sundress wrinkled on the floor
I'm naked you're not here no more
To keep me warm keep me warm
Crack the door with the trash bin
Maybe you will come back in
And keep me warm keep me warm

My love my love my love
My love my love my love
Pour the salt in the wound
My love my love my love
My love my love my love
Pour the salt in the wound

Just hanging on the phone
Wishing it's too good to be true
Just me and my lonesome
Ashes on the tray long overdue

For my to pry myself away
From nonchalant toying games
Won't keep me warm keep me warm
Crack the door with the trash bin
Maybe you will come back in
And keep me warm keep me warm

My love my love my love
My love my love my love
Pour the salt in the wound
My love my love my love
My love my love my love
Pour the salt in the wound
