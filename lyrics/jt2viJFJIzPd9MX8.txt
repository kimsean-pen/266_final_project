All of us are victims confined by enigmas without solution
Your frozen thoughts don't let you evolve
A prisoner of your own trap, slaves of an infinite pain
What will be the limit? What will be the end?

Life ends
Feeling death
Slaves of pain

Life ends
Feeling death
Slaves of pain

Seeking new paths, don't be tied to your mistakes
Run away from this uncured sickness
Open your eyes, don't lose your steps
Liberty is a dream and it also is real

To die to run away
To forget what I've been
To erase my past
To kill my guilt

Life ends
Feeling death
Slaves of pain
