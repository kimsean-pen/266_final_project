Crawling under a jealous sun
I fear the ghost you could become
So I called upon the clouds
Raindrops fell as I hit the ground
Higher than the vultures fly
Deeper than the blue in the desert sky
The oasis in the sands
Bringing life to the barren lands
We are waterborne
We are waterborne
You were my, you were my lifeline
The blood that runs in my veins
Without you, everything fades away
You were my, you were my lifeline
The blood that runs in my veins
Without you, everything fades away
The river now changes course
Timeless reflections of our discord
A generation taught upstream
I don't need you
But you need me
Higher than the vultures fly
Deeper than the blue in the desert sky
The oasis in the sands
Bringing life to the barren lands
We are waterborne
We are waterborne
You were my, you were my lifeline
The blood that runs in my veins
Without you, everything fades away
You were my, you were my lifeline
The blood that runs in my veins
Without you, everything fades away
Nowhere to run
When the worlds run dry
Nowhere to go
When the waters rise
You were my, you were my lifeline
The blood that runs in my veins
Whithout you, everything fades away
You were my, you were my lifeline
