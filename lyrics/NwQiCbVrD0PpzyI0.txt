It's not easy
But try to picture this too
Do you remember
That we were once together?

Isn't it strange, isn't it?
I'm sorry it's come to this but
Why are we here bothering?
What was it we talked about? So

Just remind me
Of why I'm wasting so much
Time pretending
That there is something more than

Only this, only the
This pointless accusation
Tell me again
Why are we here?

I'm not offended
By the things that you say
'Cause it's such a predictable
Way to behave

Talk and insult me
'Til you're blue in the face
You were right, I was wrong
Now does that make you happy?

I'm quite aware
Of all the bad things I did
You don't have to remind me
Of why you dislike me

There's no solution
To the mess that we're in
It's so sad and so boring
I wish you'd just leave me alone

But I understand the games you play
I'm ashamed of all the things I did to you

I'm not offended
By the things that you say
'Cause it's such a predictable
Way to behave

Talk and insult me
'Til you're blue in the face
You were right, I was wrong
Now does that make you happy?

I'm not offended
By the things that you say
'Cause it's such a predictable
Way to behave

Talk and insult me
'Til you're blue in the face
You were right, I was wrong
Now does that make you happy?

I'm not offended
By the things that you say
