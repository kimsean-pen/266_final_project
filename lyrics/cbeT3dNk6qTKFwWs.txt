Sailing in-between
The land, the air and me
Confusion never dawns
'Cause frame of mind tells me that I am free
I am free

Doors are open wide
No credits to be seen
Sail with me, my friend
I need someone, it's dark and it could get lonely
I am free

I am free
I don't care to be
Assembler mass machine
To wait the gong tone
And convalesce when society doesn't need me

I am free-ee-ee
