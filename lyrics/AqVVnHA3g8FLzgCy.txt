sounding in mono
broking kimonos
playing the bingo
Shaking the roots
dancing the manbo
Fighting like Rambo
playing the bongo
Digital shoots
Digital shoots
Digital shoots
There is the gosht hunters
Chaising the rats
that's dodo sound
under his hat
Call me Iseo
I'm the big cat
This is my music
solid as a rock
There is the gosht hunters
Chaising the rats
that's dodo sound
under his hat
Call me Iseo
I'm the big cat
This is my music
I think is fat
nobody move
don't turn around
we came to burn the place down
nobody move
don't turn around
we came to burn the place
nobody move
don't turn around
we came to burn the place down
nobody move
don't turn around
we came to burn the place
