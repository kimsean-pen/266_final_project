She moves the street way
A hitched up skirt, a symptom of the heatwave.
She lets go lowgrade
We can stay closed 'til 4am the next day

If it's for 5 years
I get a fantasy breeding babies in my nightmares
- My nightmares
If she goes the street way
I get a peepshow free and a pressure drop to get laid

If you're asking, well
I've just started on my breakdown
If you need to know
I've just started on my breakdown

She moves the street way,
A pretty sweet blonde, an illusion of the heatwave
I see her legs and shoulders
And picture myself as a missionary soldier

She kicks my mouth shut,
Make me go down, take a pleasure pill, just throw up
- Goin' down, down, down
She moves the street way,
Anything goes to release me from the heatwave
- Release me from the heatwave

If you're asking, well
I've just started on my breakdown
If you need to know
I've just started on my breakdown

- Release me from the heatwave
- From the heatwave
- A pretty sweet blonde, an illusion of the heatwave
