Hey girl do you wanna be mine
Ask you ten times to stay
With me so I can feel fine
And leave the bad things all behind
For us because it feels right
Uh yes to fix a ride I could die (I could die)
Loving you (Loving you)

Loving you makes me blind
Makes me blind
Blind (you)
Blind (you)

Hey girl you are like the police
You tell me get on your knees
Baby please don't crucify me
Don't break it up don't break it down
I feel a controversy
Lets fix a ride I could die (I could die)
Loving you (Loving you)

Loving you makes me blind (uh)
Makes me blind
Blind (you)
Blind (you)
Blind (you)
Blind (you)
