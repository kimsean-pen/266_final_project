Do you worry that you're not liked
How long till you break?
You're happy 'cause you smile
But how much can you fake?
An ordinary boy, an ordinary name
But ordinary's just not good enough today

Now ah-ooo
Now ah-ooo
Alone, alone, alone, alone
Alone, alone, alone, alone

I'm thinking why, yea, Superman's dead?
Ai yea, is it in my head?
Ai yea, we'll just laugh instead
I worry about the weather
Whether you can or can not hate

Now you worried about your faith
Kneel down and obey
You're happy you're in love
You need someone to hate
An ordinary girl, an ordinary waist
But ordinary's just not good enough today

Alone, alone, alone, alone
Alone, alone, alone, alone

I'm thinking why, yea, Superman's dead?
Ai yea, is it in my head?
Ai yea, we'll just laugh instead
I worry about the weather
Whether you can or can not hate

Now ah-ooo
Now ah-ooo
Now ah-ooo

Why, ai yea, hey hey?
Why?
Why, ai yea, hey hey?
Why?

Doesn't anybody ever know?
Doesn't anybody ever know?
Doesn't anybody ever know?
That the world's a subway, subway

Doesn't anybody ever know?
Doesn't anybody ever know?
Doesn't anybody ever know?
That the world's a subway, subway
That the world's a subway, subway

Doesn't any, any, any, any, any
Doesn't any, any, any, any, any
Doesn't any, any, any, any, any
That the world's a subway, subway
That the world's a subway, subway
