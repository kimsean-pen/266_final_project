Screaming headline, have you heard the news
Rumour has it that it ain't the truth
We used to trust, now we have to be shown
The seeds of deception grown into their own

Hate me, know me, poison the wells
Make your sheep start to think for themselves

It gets better and better as we burst with excitement
Entering a new stage of enlightenment

Fake news
On the run, on the loose
Fake news
Hot on the wire
Fake news
Trumped up truth
Fake news
Spread like wildfire

Quote, unquote all ducks in a row
You are what you eat and that's all you need to know

Detached from opposing points of views and values
The top of the food chain will decide what they'll tell you

Weaponized words, the truth ain't real
Monetized content to sweeten the deal

Addicted to news, we hinge upon it
Like a dog will always return to his vomit
