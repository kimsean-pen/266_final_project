It's not like you knew me
I live in the world in a screen
And two gotta paint the dream
But if you really knew me
The spark faded out in a flash
I'm here 'cause I'm getting it back
I'm gonna turn the tide
I'm gonna live my life
The way I want, the way I want to
No matter what they say
I'll do it on my way
The way I want, the way I want to
I've come undone but now
I've pulled myself together
And I'm breaking free to fly
Because it's now or never

Because it's now or never
I thought that I knew me
But now I can see it so clear
I'm stronger than all the fear
The sun shining on me
It feels like I'm walking on air
Finally I do declare
I'm gonna turn the tide
I'm gonna live my life
The way I want, the way I want to
No matter what they say
I'll do it on my way
The way I want, the way I want to
I've come undone but now
I've pulled myself together
And I'm breaking free to fly
Because it's now or never

Sometimes you gotta let it fall down
To build it back up again
Sometimes you gotta go a little crazy
To find your way back home
And I've come undone but now
I've pulled myself together
And I'm breaking free to fly
Because it's now or never

Because it's now or never
