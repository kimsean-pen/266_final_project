I can not live
Peacefully without you
For even a moment
I miss you terribly
When you're away
He's away
This ain't right
I'm alone
I'm taking an aeroplane
Across the world
To follow my heart.

How come
Out of all the people in the world
Only one
Can make me complete

One word, one word on the phone
Makes me happy
One touch, but one touch directly
Makes me ecstatic
He's away
This ain't right
I'm alone
I'm taking an aeroplane
Across the world
To follow my heart
