There's something in the silence
I never used to feel
There's something about knowing
That tells you this is real
When you're close
all I know I don't want to let you go

Hello happiness
Tell me where you've been
I missed the sound of your voice
missed the touch of your skin
It's no secret I'm not who I used to be
Anyone can see
You're the difference in me
Oh the difference

I'm standing at your doorstep
Let me look into your eyes
We could strip away the secrets

Between you and me tonight

Won't you say it's OK
Let the world just fade away

Hello happiness
Tell me where you've been
I missed the sound of your voice

missed the touch of your skin
It's no secret I'm Not who I used to be
Anyone can see
You're the difference in me
Yeah the difference

The difference
When you're close all I know I don't want to let you go
Hello happiness
Tell me where you've been
I missed the sound of your voice
missed the touch of your skin
It's no secret I'm Not who I used to be
Anyone can see
You're the difference in me

Yeah the difference in me
Oh the difference
There's something in the silence I never used to feel
