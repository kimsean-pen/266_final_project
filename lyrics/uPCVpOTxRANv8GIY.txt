It happens every time,
If it counts I'll lose my courage when I need it the most.
Then it comes crawling up after,
Begs me to ask her what I already know.

Singing, "Oh, love, get me out of the cold."
If I promise that I'd take you there with me,
Would you go?
I found, in one step, I'll get closer to heaven than you'll ever know,
You may never know.

Feel it out again,
Go and try to be your man when there's a gun to your head,
After you've found out your "good enough" wasn't good enough for everyone else.

Singing, "Oh, love, get me out of the cold,"
Pull me right up by your fire and I'll show you what home means now.
The words came with a new kind of sadness,
They meant everything, you mean everything to me.

I'll take the first train out of this town
With a glare in my eye and my pockets full, ready to die.
And when I get hazy, I will think, just maybe, you're out there somewhere

Singing, "Oh, love, get me out of the cold."
If I promise that I'd take you there with me,
Would you go?
I found, in one step, I'll get closer to heaven than you'll ever know,
You may never know.

Singing, "Oh, love, get me out of the cold,"
Pull me right up by your fire, and I'll show you what home means now.
The words came with a new kind of sadness,
They meant everything, you mean everything to me.
