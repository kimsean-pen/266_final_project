Making me so hot, oh, when we hit the spot
Yeah, you and the music is all that I got
Oohhoo, turn it on, turn it on
I wrote it for you, you're the title of my song

Me and my, me and my
Microphone

We've been around the world on a disco beat
Been floating on a feeling of believing, rocking from Paris to Fiji
In Swedish, Espanole, German, French and Swahili
Champagnes are popping, matching my white stretch limousine
The world is so glimmering, ing, ing, ing, ing

Come, join us if you need our love CPR
'Cause we got the music that leads to the stars
Now turn up the volume and pump this song loud
'Cause, love is a love, is a love, from above, love from above
Love can you hear me, I want you near me, oh

Making me so hot, oh, when we hit the spot
Yeah, you and the music is all that I got
Oohhoo, turn it on, turn it on
I wrote it for you, you're the title of my song

Me and my microphone phone
Microphone phone
Me and my microphone phone
Microphone

Microphone phone
Me and my microphone phone
Microphone phone
Me and my microphone phone

Put your hands in the air now, oh
Put your hands up in the air now

Me and my microphone phone
Microphone phone
Microphone phone, microphone

Put your hands up in the air
Put your hands up in the air
Put your hands up in the air
Put your hands up in the air

Making me so hot, oh when we hit the spot
Yeah, you and the music is all that I got
Oohhoo, turn it on, turn it on
I wrote it for you, you're the title of my song, song

Making me so hot, oh when we hit the spot
Yeah, you and the music is all that I got
Oohhoo, turn it on, turn it on
I wrote it for you, you're the title of my song

Me and my microphone phone
Microphone phone
Me and my microphone phone
Microphone

Microphone phone
Me and my microphone phone
Microphone phone
Me and my microphone
Me and my microphone, phone
