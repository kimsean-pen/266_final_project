Your story only tells one side
It's based on fact but filled with lies
(You'd be rich if each was worth a dime)
I played my part and that's defined
You played the field on borrowed time
(And I know that fault was all but mine)

And I chose to let you in
(You chose to pull away)
I jumped right out of my skin
When I heard you say

"Everything I said was true
Everything except that I love you"
If it's not me then who?
I think I deserve to know
Now we're through and through

No glory resides inside my mind
At least I never crossed the line
('Cause I don't need the distraction)
But an angel appeared on your devil's side
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
(I'm just a nickel with traction)

So should we say goodnight
(And give it one more try?)
This isn't worth the fight
So let's just say goodbye

Everything I said was true
Everything except I love you too
And if it's not me, it's you
I thought you deserved to know
Now we're through and through

Sad to see forethought after me
'Cause that's not fair
Put yourself in my shoes and become
The fractured one 'cause I no longer care

Everything I said was true
Everything except that I love you
And if it's not me, fuck you
I thought you deserved to know now
I'm through with you

And if it's not me, it's you
And if it's not me, it's you
And if it's not me, it's you
And if it's not me, it's you
