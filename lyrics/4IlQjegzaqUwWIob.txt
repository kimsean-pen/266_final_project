I wish I could be there
See you everyday
I don't have to call you
I don't have a lot
Plus you get to see my life
Pretty sure you were gone ahead
Do you think we did it right
You weren't lying when you said just wait
Some days slip right by me
And I think I know why
I make it through
Some days you find me
And I think I know why
