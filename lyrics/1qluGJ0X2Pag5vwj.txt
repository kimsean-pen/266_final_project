Heat death, big rock
Torrid, Chakra
Heat death, how do you
See flames? Smell smoke?

My house is green
You know what I mean
My house was blue
It cooked right through

Come meet me inside
Greenhouse, we will fry

Heat death, hormones
Good broth, cooked bones

My house is fried
All life has died
My house was blue
Beautiful too

Come meet me inside
Greenhouse, we will fry

Heat death, big rock
Torrid, Chakra
Heat death, how do you
See flames? Smell smoke?

Come meet me inside
Greenhouse heat death

My house is green
