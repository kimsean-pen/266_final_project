Leaving the choirs behind to sing
Of anything fair
Of lilac spring
A dream of truce behind my eyes
A life of journeys will unwind.

Emergence through idle air.

Born under a trouble sign
Will it hurt to see me find
The long lost peace of mind
Darling
You had me here for a while
It breaks my heart to see you cry
In the wake of incomplete time.

Darkness overthrows.

Map of nowhere is in my hand
The roads are blurred
Sojourners land
So take however long you want
But don't forget my love
You've pledged yourself to coming along.

You're lost in reveries
Holding back the tears
Faint sound of the wires
The butterfly is in the fire now
Lost in a memory you're holding my hands
One heart is in the ground
The other is veiled in the silver all around.

Born under a trouble sign
Will it hurt to see me find
The long lost peace of mind
Darling
You had me here for a while
It breaks my heart to see you cry
In the wake of incomplete time.
