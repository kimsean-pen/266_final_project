I'm taking off again, it feels like is a sin,
Am I excited or am I just so confused?

My head is numb and my hands are tied
And I can't remember what it's like
Get out of this place, going through,
I'm taking off and I'm asking where are you?
Where are you? Where are you?
Where are you?
I can't be found somewhere.

Think of times I used to know you
Growing up, I thought about you.
Trying not to see where are you taking me
Holding on to, is that true?

Where are you? Where are you?
I can't be found somewhere,
Somewhere.
I can't be found somewhere,
Somewhere.
I can't be found somewhere.
