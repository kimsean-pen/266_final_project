I whisper in your ear the words you want to hear
You feel the wind and it reminds you
it happens everytime you stop and close your eyes
you can't deny what lives inside you
well i know it's hard to see
what is meant to be when yesterday is so far behind you

deep inside your soul i'm always there

you made me believe the day you surrendered to me
the memory will never die
the love that you gave i'll never throw it away
the memory will never die

the ties take a turn
another lesson learned
i'm right here but still you wonder
would you say that you need more and it's known
it was before you were on your own and going under

deep inside your soul i'm always there

you made me believe the day you surrendered to me
the memory will never die
the love that you gave i'll never throw it away
the memory will never die

whenever you wake up
whenever you gave up all that you had for nothing at all
the bed that you lay in remember you made it
and nobodys there to catch you when you fall

you made me believe the day you surrendered to me
the memory will never die
the love that you gave i'll never throw it away
the memory will never die

you made me believe the day you surrendered to me
the memory will never die
the love that you gave i'll never throw it away
the memory will never die
