I'm cold and broken

It's over
I didn't want to see it come to this
I wonder
If I will ever see your face again
And I know
That I will find a way to shed the skin
It's simple
I know that I will suffer in the end

Fast I fade away
It's almost over
Hold on
Slow, I suffocate
I'm cold and broken
All alone

It's hopeless
The end will come and wash it all away
Forsaken
I live for those I lost along the way
And I can't
Remember how it all began to break
We suffer
I live to fight and die another day

Fast, I fade away
It's almost over
Hold on
Slow, I suffocate
I'm cold and broken
All alone

Fast, I fade away
It's almost over
Hold on
Slow, I suffocate
I'm cold and broken
All alone
I'm cold and broken
