Little queenie
I got lumps in my throat
when i saw her comin down the aisle
i got the wiggles in my knees
when she looked at me and sweetly smiled
well there she is again
standin over by the record machine
well she looks like a model
on the cover of a magazine
but she's too cute
to be a minute over seventeen
Meanwhile i was thinkin'
Well if she's in the mood
no need to break it
i got the chance and i oughta take it
if she can dance we can make it
c'mon queenie let's shake it
I said go, go, go, little queenie
i said go, go, go, little queenie
i said go, go, go, little queenie
Won't someone tell me
who's the queen standin over by the record machine
well she looks like a model
on the cover of a magazine
but she's too cute
to be a minute over seventeen
i said go, go, go, little queenie
i said go, go, go, little queenie
i said go, go, go, little queenie
Meanwhile, i was still thinkin, hmmmm,
well if it's a slow one
we'll omit it
if it's a rocker, then we'll get it
if it's a good one, she'll admit it
c'mon queenie, let's get with it

I said go, go, go, little queenie
i said go, go, go, little queenie
i said go, go, go, little queenie
I said go, go, go, little queenie
i said go, go, go, little queenie
i said go, go, go, little queenie...
