I'm back

So let's rewind back to the time
2005, I almost died
I overdosed, I did not know
That I'd provoke this evil ghost

Disaster

Magically, I turn tragedy
Into melodies over catchy beats
It comes so naturally, so smooth and casually
That's why they call me king of the music scene

I dug a hole ten miles wide
So I can throw all of you inside
You're such a dumb fuck, you need to shut up
You bring a picture of me every time you get your haircut

Impostor

Magically, I turn tragedy
Into melodies over catchy beats
It comes so naturally, so smooth and casually
That's why they call me king of the music scene

Oh, bruised and broken
My eyes are open
I won't lose focus
My eyes are open
Can you see in the distance?
Can you see the resistance?
We will march, rise against them
From the start, rise against them

Magically, I turn tragedy
Into melodies over catchy beats
It comes so naturally, so smooth and casually
That's why they call me king of the music scene
Magically, I turn tragedy
Into melodies over catchy beats
It comes so naturally, so smooth and casually
That's why they call me king of the music scene
