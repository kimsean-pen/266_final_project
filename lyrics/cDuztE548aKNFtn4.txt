Life goes on
We got all night
If you got rock and roll
You're gonna be alright

Friday night at the bar
Where everybody knows my name
And I don't know what she's doing here
But I'm glad she came

From her cowboy boots
Up to her little black dress
I need a Jameson shot of confidence
Then I'll let her do the rest

She's kinda like a scene in a movie
I can hear music when she speaks
She says, "I can't sleep alone.
I really like The Stones and I hate TV."

Well I must confess
I'm a little obsessed with Dawson's Creek
Yeah I know what you think
It's not what it seems
Can I buy you a drink?

Then she said life goes on
We got all night
If you got rock and roll
You're gonna be alright

So give me one more drink
And play my favorite song
Put a quarter in the jukebox
And sing along

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na

Last call on the round
And now I'm seeing stars
We're invincible
Don't matter who you are

Well a tattooed biker
And the bartender got into a fight
Then they both sang along
To a Springsteen song
And they're alright

Cause life goes on
We got all night
If you got rock and roll
You're gonna be alright

So give me one more drink
And play my favorite song
Put a quarter in the jukebox
And sing along

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na

If you got a drink put it in the air
Here's a toast cause we just don't care
If you got a voice then sing
Cause life goes on and on and on

Cause life goes on
We got all night
If you got rock and roll
You're gonna be alright

So give me one more drink
And play my favorite song
Put a quarter in the jukebox
And sing along

Cause life goes on
We got all night
If you got rock and roll
You're gonna be alright

So give me one more drink
And play my favorite song
Put a quarter in the jukebox
And sing along

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
