I see you
Under there, behind your hair
Everywhere
I see you
I see you
Turned on eyes can't tell lies
Empathize
I see you
Warm sliding sun through the cave of your hair
Wind washing fields, kind of space living there
I see you
I know you
Met before, seventh floor
First World War
I know you
Who lives there?
Tell old fair I'm aware that she care
Who lives there?
Green specks bright, spiraling out in the sky
Catch my mind, turn my head
Have to look, don't know why
Who lives there?
We thought talked
For a while they just smile
Just a silent thought talk
I see you
Under there, behind your hair
Everywhere
I see you
I see you
