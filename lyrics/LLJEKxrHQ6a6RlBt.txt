We're spinning. The thread unwinds and holds me under.
I've lost the time and locked myself inside my room.
Within the walls your company, it keeps me sane. Hypnotized.
I strive to keep a level head.
When I am lost I keep my head in the clouds.
The shelving falls and from the top the ceiling crumbles.
Across my bed we lay sprayed out, I've lost myself.
Beneath the sheets I hide away from all my hunger.
Here I'll stay until I wake then repeat.
