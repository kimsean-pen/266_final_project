There is movement in these depths.
There's a place for everything.

Try to make sense out of what we've been through.
And I still justify the things I used to do.
I don't believe in nothing - but I believe in you.
Take my word and move on.

I've chosen to embrace all the things that I cannot change
But I'm not sure if this helps to relieve you from bitterness.

I wish I could recall every word, everything you said.
You're digging in the past: a deep hole that will wolf you down.
I've chosen to embrace all the things that I cannot change
But I'm not sure if this helps to relieve you from bitterness.

How much control do we have over what we wish for?
