Oh, I can't explain
Every time it's the same
Oh, I feel that it's real
Take my heart

I've been lonely too long
Oh, I can't be so strong
Take the chance for romance
Take my heart

I need you so
There's no time I'll ever go

Cheri, cheri lady
Goin' through a motion
Love is where you find it
Listen to your heart

Cheri, cheri lady
Living in devotion
It's always like the first time
Let me take a part

Cheri, cheri lady
Like there's no tomorrow
Take my heart, don't lose it
Listen to your heart

Cheri, cheri lady
To know you is to love you
If you call me baby
I'll be always yours

I get up, I get down
All my world turns around
Who is right? Who was wrong?
I don't know

I've got pain in my heart
Got a love in my soul
Easy come, but I think
Easy go

I need you so
All the times I move so slow

Cheri, cheri lady
Goin' through a motion
Love is where you find it
Listen to your heart
Cheri, cheri lady
Living in devotion
It's always like the first time
Let me take a part

Cheri, cheri lady
Like there's no tomorrow
Take my heart, don't lose it
Listen to your heart
Cheri, cheri lady
To know you is to love you
If you call me baby
I'll be always yours

Cheri, cheri lady
Like there's no tomorrow
Take my heart, don't lose it
Listen to your heart
Cheri, cheri lady
To know you is to love you
If you call me baby
I'll be always yours

Cheri, cheri lady
Like there's no tomorrow
Take my heart, don't lose it
Listen to your heart
Cheri, cheri lady
To know you is to love you
If you call me baby
I'll be yours.
