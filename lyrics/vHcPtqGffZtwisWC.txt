We are ready for the siege
We are armed up to the teeth
Be careful how you live and breathe
Release what's broken underneath

How many times do you want to die
How many ways do you want to die

To feel safe again look over your shoulder
Very carefully look over your shoulder

We can laugh about it now
We hope everything works out
Be careful how you lick your wounds
Believe the change is coming soon

How many times do you want to die
How many ways do you want to die

To feel safe again look over your shoulder
Very carefully look over your shoulder

You used to do a little but a little won't fly
And right before you hit your prime
That's when we fell in love but not the first time

Can it please you still
Remain in your father's will
Or does it make you ill
Let us bruise their knees
We will aim straight for the feed
You'll be relieved
So relieved so relieved

Turn on full desire
Feel the sparks of the friendly fire
Misery inspires
Your throat has been cut
Several times before
Never noticed the size of the flow
Make it be ignored

To feel safe again look over your shoulder
Carefully look over your shoulder

You said you believed it but believing won't fly
And right before you hit your prime
That's when we fell in love but not the first time

And when it's all over and you open your eyes
To see the room turned on its side
You'll be lying by a note on the floor signed...

...the royal we
The royal we
The royal we
The royal we
The royal we
The royal we
The royal we
The royal we
Love, the royal we
