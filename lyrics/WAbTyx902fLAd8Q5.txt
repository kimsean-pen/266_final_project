She likes chocolate in the morning
She drinks her coffee late at night
You can sense that she is guarded
But that's alright
She'll fall asleep while
You're still talking
With unfinished books beside her bed
She'll cancel all of her appointments
And go shopping instead

And in spite of what is right
Far beyond what she'd except
When the moon begs the question
Will you have the answer yet?
Can't you just adore her?
Can't you just adore her?

She loves to watch the sunset
But she is partial to the rain
With those tears and that umbrella
Her allure goes unexplained
You made dinner in your apartment
You both assume that she'll be late
She always has the best intentions
Her goodness is innate

And in spite of what is right
Far beyond what she'd except
When the moon begs the question
Will you have the answer yet?
Can't you just adore her?
Can't you just adore her?

And in spite of what is right
Far beyond what she'd except
When the moon begs the question
Will you have the answer yet
Can't you just adore her?
Can't you just adore her?

Why can't you just adore her?
I like chocolate in the morning
I drink my coffee late at night
