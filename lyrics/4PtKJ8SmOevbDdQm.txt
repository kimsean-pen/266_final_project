waiting for the sun
its a lie
heat will never come
waiting for the sun
for tonight
i can be the one

and im never late again
and im never not on time
but you'll always wait for him
and i dont know why

back against the wall
in your mind
you can have it all
back against the wall
tease your thigh
let me see you home

and im never late again
and im never not on time
but you'll always wait for him
and i dont know why
