We shared a bed but never touched
Next time we compensated in a rush.
We're showing no signs of fatigue
I've got a friend to act as a go-between.

There's a distant draw to your delivery
You delivered me.
And when I'm dry you resuscitate me
You resuscitate me.

This bed's too tight
I stepped upon your records in the night.
Put on your favorite skirt
I've got a plan that will never work.

This isn't the first time but it still feels innocent
I just want to kiss you.
There won't be a time when my mind strays to you
No, I'm not going to miss you.

Onto fireworks in Brixton
Two carousel hearts spinning
If it's a grower
Why can't we take things slower?

She brings up the roller disco
Head full of curls on the pillow
If it's a grower
Then why can't we take things slower?

I don't know if you've made it but you accommodated me
When my mind was elsewhere.
Out on deck the dawn arrived.
Your grey sweater over sized.
The rooftops glimmered before our eyes.

Onto fireworks in Brixton
Two carousel hearts spinning
If it's a grower
Why can't we take things slower?

She brings up the roller disco
Head full of curls on the pillow
If it's a grower
Then why can't we take things slower?

We were straying at the lock-in after hours
If it's a grower
Why can't we take things slower?
