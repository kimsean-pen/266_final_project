Welcome to the brave new world
The Future's here or haven't you heard?
The sons of man have fell from grace
Till the Smasher comes to save his race

Here it comes, there it goes
Just a flash in the sky
Atom Smasher, here he comes
Better run for your lives

He is the hero of the atom age
Born in a test tube, raised in a cage
A reaver king, his throne defiled
Roaming the streets to the call of the wild

As upstarts strive to rule the world
Against them chaos legions hurled
The Smasher's force has swept the land
Again begins the dawn of man
