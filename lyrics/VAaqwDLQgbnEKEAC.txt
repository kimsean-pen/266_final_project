It's getting late
It's getting dark
In the end of the night I can feel your warmth
Come up close
Close to me
Coz In the end of the night I can feel you breathe
Don't be afraid
Don't be alarmed
In the end of the night you're in my arms
I'm on my bed
My bed of stones
But in the end of the night we'll rest our bones
So don't you worry
Just rest your head
Coz in the end of the night we'll be together again
You don't need to worry
I'll make your bed
And in the end of the night I can hold your hand
So come close, close to me
And I'll come closer to you
Coz in the end of the night when all we have is gone
Yes in the end of the night when I can be with you
