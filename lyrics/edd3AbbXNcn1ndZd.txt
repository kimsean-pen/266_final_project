Lashing out the action
Returning a reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power
Crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery

Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery

Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me

Battery
Battery

Crushing all deceivers
Mashing non-believers
Never ending potency
Hungry violence seeker
Feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery

Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery

Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me

Battery
Battery

Circle of destruction
Hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury
Dominating flurry
We create the battery

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery

Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery

Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me

Battery
Battery
Battery
Battery
