Open me, with your kiss of steel
End my pain - set me free

For we are enslaved, forever enslaved

Open me, with your kiss of steel
End my pain - set me free
Live only to die some more
Need - killing yourself to live

For we are enslaved, forever enslaved

Lay your fears to rest, let your dreams awake

For we are enslaved, forever enslaved

Lay your hate to rest - open me
