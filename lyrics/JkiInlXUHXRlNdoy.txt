I bring that fire, when I walk in
They see me comin, they see me shining shining shining
You see designers, you see that skin
You see me glowin', that's how you win

If you wonder why I'm so happy and I'm not stressin' at all
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be, yeah I'm just having a ball

I'm focused on myself, no one else
I'm out here living sugar-free
I know you see this love and it look good
But I'm just out here doing me

And I know, I know you love to pay attention
I see you but I'm only focused
on myself, no one else
I'm out here living sugar-free
I'm sugar-free
living sugar-free

They say I'm spoiled, but I don't care
I'll be spending when I'm spending on myself
Ain't no shade, I don't need no help
I just mind my business, if I want it then I get it

If you wonder why I'm so happy and I'm not stressin' at all
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be, yeah I'm just having a ball

I'm focused on myself, no one else
I'm out here living sugar-free
I know you see this love and it look good
But I'm just out here doin me

And I know, I know you love to pay attention
I see you but I'm only focused
on myself, no one else
I'm out here living sugar-free
I'm sugar-free
living sugar-free
