I packed my suitcase with myself
But I'm already gone
I cleanse myself with vitamin health
But I'm already gone

I saw a rising though the river rising
And I saw it fall
The Jesus fever is falling all over you
Believers and lovers

But Jesus fever's fallin' all over
You believers and lovers

In a black bowl, I found a broken skull
Now I'm already gone
You can write my whole life down in a little book
When I'm already gone

I started shakin' and my heart breaking
And my belly crawls
The Jesus fever is falling all over you
Believers and lovers

When I'm a ghost, I see no reason to run
When I'm already gone
If it wasn't taped, you could escape this song
But I'm already gone
