Traveler now reach the stream.
The astral flight adapter.
From the pain-sheath life ascends
the Non-returner sees.
Empathy release me
And the phoenix rise triumphant.
And walks onto the certitude ground
The soul's submergence ends.

From the rounds of rebirth
He arrives onto the deathless.
Light bores through the adjunct worlds
The soul-galleon prevails.
Liberates in wisdom to complete state of negation.
The five roads subsumed by grace
Emancipates from dream
