It's a cinch,
to, pass the time with you,
but hard to pass the time alone,
can you take it.
And it's true,
true, the couple next to you think you look strange.
Alone, what are your aims,
or do you have any.

Avoid confusion.
You always know,
always know how much your paying.
I concentrate on,
on, what the people say,
the couple next to me.

Pass the salt,
pour it in my wounds.
It looks like you have no friends,
can't keep up with the new trends.
Sorry, sorry, for myself I don't agree.
No, I always go out eating with my best friends.
It's less than normal.

Avoid confusion.
You always know,
always know how much your paying.
I concentrate on,
on, what the people say,
the couple next to me.

Avoid confusion.
You always know,
always know how much your paying.
I concentrate on,
on, what the people say.
I think at times.
