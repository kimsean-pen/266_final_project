Get under my skin
Drive me up the wall
I will just pretend
Nothing is ever my fault

Everyone is grey
Everyone is acting out
Caught in the chains
Sync into the synthesis

Go around
Don't make enemies
Reassure yourself
Society is what you need

Hide the pain
Just take the pill
Swallow down
Don't want to feel like this

Everyone is grey
Everyone is acting out
Caught in the chains
Sync into the synthesis

Everyone is grey
Everyone is acting out
Caught in the chains
Sync into the synthesis

It comes in waves
Walk slow through the pouring rain
Take yourself outside
And hope the colors change

It comes in waves
Walk slow through the pouring rain
Take yourself outside
But you can't escape

Everyone is grey
Everyone is acting out
Caught in the chains
Sync into the synthesis

Everyone is grey
Everyone is acting out
Caught in the chains
Sync into the synthesis
