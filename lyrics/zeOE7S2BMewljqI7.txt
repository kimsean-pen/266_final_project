Come in the sack

On the run, stay on the mat
Give it back, low to go
Soon as it's back, end of the line
It's in the bank like losing a friend
Like choosing a den, simple then

Always on, this isn't the end
Never ends, on and on
Give me something to bend
See the hidden lines

See you around
See you around
See you around
See you around
