I thought you were my best friend
I thought we'd be together to the end
Your not the girl I once knew
Tell me were she is cause she's not you
You used to be that shoulder
That shoulder I could lean on through it all
But now its getting colder
There's no love between these walls

Jealousy, Jealousy, Jealousy
Is such an evil thing
To watch someone have
Jealousy, Jealousy, Jealousy
Nobody wins when your full of envy
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

I was always happy
When I was watching you become a star
But you were only happy
When the world was openin' up my scars
And now I'm like the devil
Well if I am then what does that make you
You sold yourself for your fame
You'll still never walk a day in my shoes

Jealousy, Jealousy, Jealousy
Is such an evil thing
To watch someone have
Jealousy, Jealousy, Jealousy
Nobody wins when your full of envy

La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

[Spoken:]
I only wanted what was best for you
Everything I did, I did because I cared
So how did all the good between us turn so bad?
Maybe someday we'll get back, what we had

Jealousy, Jealousy, Jealousy
Is such an evil thing
To watch someone have
Jealousy, Jealousy, Jealousy
Is such an evil thing
To watch someone have
Jealousy, Jealousy, Jealousy
Is such an evil thing
To watch someone have
Jealousy, Jealousy, Jealousy (Jealousy)
Nobody wins when your full of envy
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
