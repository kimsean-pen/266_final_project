There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Super Dome
It's been the ruin
Of many a poor boy
And God I know I'm one

I cried to my daddy on the telephone "how long now?"
"Until the clouds unroll and you come down," The line went
But the shadows still remain since your descent, your descent

I cried to my daddy on the telephone "how long now?"
"Until the clouds unroll and you come home," The line went
But the shadows still remain since your descent, your descent

Boom Cha Hey!

The saints are coming
The saints are coming
I say no matter how I try
I realize there's no reply

The saints are coming
The saints are coming
I say no matter how I try
I realize there's no reply

A drowning sorrow floods the deepest grief, how long now
Until a weather change condemns belief, how long now
When the night watchman lets in the thief, what's wrong now

Boom Cha Hey!

The saints are coming
The saints are coming
I say no matter how I try
I realize there's no reply
The saints are coming
The saints are coming
I say no matter how I try
I realize there's no reply
I say no matter how I try
I realize there's no reply
I say no matter how I try
I realize there's no reply
