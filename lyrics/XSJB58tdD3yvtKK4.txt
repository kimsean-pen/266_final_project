Under the blaze of the midnight sun
To wreak destruction, forward we go
Expose the pain, now you reap what you sow
Plague and storms, they will return

Cut from life, face the light
Cut from life, face the light

Born to suffer, buried under
God's hammer under rapture
Cut from life

Aeons descended from the heavens
Ever defiant, open your eyes
Abomination of desolation
No one leaves until it's time

Cut from life, face the light
Cut from life, face the light

Born to suffer, buried under
God's hammer under rapture
Cut from life

Igneous ophidian, darkness inversion
Splendor of all that's inhuman
Rapture, rapture, rapture

Immortal ascension, divine intervention
Killing intentions, self-immolation
Rapture, rapture, rapture

Rapture
Rapture
Rapture
Cut from life

Holy Gospel of savage faith
Grotesque glory reclaimed
Rapture, rapture, rapture

Primitive weapons for sacrifice
Pagan fire, poison messiah
Rapture, rapture, rapture

Rapture
Rapture
I see where the demons dwell (Rapture)
Fighting for your life

Like lambs to the slaughter
