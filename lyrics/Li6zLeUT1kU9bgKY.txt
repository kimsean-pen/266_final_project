Hidden under it's wings
The darkness you wish to hide
Bearer of ugly truths

Grey...
Somber morning
Through blurry glass
The black crow

Here comes the messenger
Found bringer of dark days
Here comes the messenger
Black crow on a tombstone

Stare
That reeks of death
The posture
Makes you tremble

Here comes the messenger
Found bringer of dark days
Here comes the messenger
Black crow on a tombstone

(She'll) seek
And find you
Make you remember

Here comes the messenger
Found bringer of dark days
Here comes the messenger
Black crow on a tombstone

Hidden under it's wings
The darkness you wish to hide
Bearer of ugly truths

On a grey
Somber morning
Through blurry glass
The black crow

Here comes the messenger
Found bringer of dark days
Here comes the messenger
Black crow on a tombstone
