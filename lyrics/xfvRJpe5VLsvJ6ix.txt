I knew when I met you there was trouble in sight
Got so wrapped up in all your charm, I miss the girl in your eyes
And looking back it really shouldn't come as much a surprise
That I would catch you double dipping, you were slippin' that night

Stupid, stupid boy!
Should've stuck with toys
Don't go playing hard
Shouldn't have to tell you that part
What a mess you made
With your little games
Baby you gon' learn
If you mess with me you get hurt (ow!)

Didn't your mother teach you not to play with fire?
Caught you red-handed shoulda been a better liar!
I'll make you burn like the ashes of your cigarette
Didn't your mother teach ya'? I'll be the one to teach ya'

Went on a shopping spree with your credit cards
I met a stranger on the street, gave him the keys to your car
Took all your stuff, I packed it up and left it out in the road
I used to love you, now I'm busy pourin' bleach on your clothes

Stupid, stupid boy!
Should've stuck with toys
Don't go playing hard
Shouldn't have to tell you that part
What a mess you made
With your little games
Baby you gon' learn
If you mess with me you get hurt (ow!)

Didn't your mother teach you not to play with fire?
Caught you red-handed shoulda been a better liar!
I'll make you burn like the ashes of your cigarette
Didn't your mother teach ya'? I'll be the one to teach ya'

Oh, didn't your mother teach ya'?
Didn't your mother teach ya'?
It hurts so bad I need you here
I'll make ya' burn away, you hurt me
Didn't your mother teach ya'?
Guess I'm the one to teach ya'

Didn't your mother teach you not to play with fire?
Caught you red-handed shoulda been a better liar!
I'll make you burn like the ashes of your cigarette
Didn't your mother teach ya'? I'll be the one to teach ya'
