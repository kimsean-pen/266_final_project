I didn't mean to break your heart
I was just lonely
And everybody falls apart sometimes
I know you've found another one
But won't you just hold me tonight

I wish I never called you up
Nobody told me
And they don't know, we don't speak anymore
So take a good look at us
And won't you just hold me tonight

And I would stop trying to fall in love again
And keep it a secret
It never works out anyway
But I am not, anything like I was
Cause you were the only one for me
Yeah

Cause maybe I don't want to lose
A lover and friend in one night
If that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
Or maybe I don't want to be lonely
Darling you are my only love
Behind my truth lies everything you are

I never meant to sleep around
I was just lonely
And you did the same
Again, and again, and again
Woah, I know
So here's to the both of us
Here's to our story tonight

Oh I would stop trying to fall in love again
And keep it a secret
It never works out anyway
But I am not, anything like I was
Cause you were the only one for me
Yeah

Cause maybe I don't want to lose
A lover and friend in one night
If that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
Or maybe I don't want to be lonely
Darling you are my only love
Behind my truth lies everything you are

When I see my future
It is with you
We'll get there
And I'll want my children
To be with you
We'll get there

Cause maybe I don't want to lose
A lover and friend in one night
If that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
Or maybe I don't want to be lonely
Darling you are my only love
Behind my truth lies everything you are
Behind my truth lies everything you are
Behind my truth lies everything you are
