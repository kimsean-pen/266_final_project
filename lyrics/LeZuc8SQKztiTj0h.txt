When you're in love
You know you're in love
No matter what you try to do
You might as well resign yourself
To what you're going through
If you're a hard man or if you're a child
It still might get to you
Don't kid yourself you've seen it all before
A million mouths have said that too

I've had my hard times in the past
I've been a husband and a lover too
I've lain alone and cried at night
Over what love made me do
And the loved ones who let me down
And couldn't share my point of view
But this is Phil talking
I want to tell you
What I've found to be true

I love your love action
Lust's just a distraction
No talking, just looking
Watching your love action

I believe, I believe what the old man said
Though I know that there's no lord above
I believe in me, I believe in you
And you know I believe in love
I believe in truth though I lie a lot
I feel the pain from the push and shove
No matter what you put me through
I'll still believe in love
And I say

I love your love action
Lust's just a distraction
No talking, just looking
Watching your love action

I love your love action
Lust's just a distraction
No talking, just looking
Watching your love action

I love your love action
Lust's just a distraction
No talking - I'm just checking
To see if someone out there
Is really reading all this
