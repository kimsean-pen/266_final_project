I cannot ever find a way to throw these darkened thoughts away
I need a place to hide
It's thrown in my face everyday
Guess that's the price I have to pay
For what's inside my mind.

Alive!
Alive!
Alive!
Alive!
Alive!
Alive!
Alive!
Alive!

I am Alive
I will never run away
Places inside
My heart screams inside with pride
Once I cry
Now I wipe away the tears
Once I die
Now I'm Alive.

Alive!
Alive!
Alive!
Alive!
Alive!
Alive!
Alive!
Alive!

Little things tempt me everyday
'Cause the pain is how I like to play
Better not cross that line
Voices in my head have to be saved
It's something I can't throw away
What's inside my mind.

I am Alive
I will never run away
Places inside
My heart screams inside with pride
Once I cry
Now I wipe away the tears
Once I die
Now I'm Alive.

I find my time
I'm in a twine
I'm falling in this place I thought I left behind.

I find my time
I'm in a twine
I'm falling in this place I thought I left behind.

I find my time
I'm in a twine
I'm falling in this place I thought I left behind.

I find my time
I'm in a twine
I'm falling in this place I thought I left behind.

Alive!
Alive!
Alive!
Alive!

I am Alive
I will never run away
Places inside
My heart screams inside with pride
Once I cry
Now I wipe away the tears
Once I die
Now I'm Alive.
