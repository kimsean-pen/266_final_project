And I held the breath inAnnotateside my lungs for days
And I saw myself as one of many waves
And when I knew I'd become the ocean's slave
I just stayed

And we carried far with all the waters past
Of the waves I was not first I was not last
And if we saw a boat afloat we took the mast
So fast

There's a part of it, that I'll miss
At the heart of it, your cold kiss
From the start of it, I know this
There's a part of it

And before too long the waves grew out of hand
And they worked to keep the sea at their command
And the only thing they feared it seemed the sand
And dry land

There's a part of it, that I'll miss
At the heart of it, your cold kiss
From the start of it, I know this
Oh there's a part of it

Ohhhhh ohhhhh ohhhhh
Uhhh uhhh uhhh

From the water there was born a bright blue roar
As it rolled and formed and calmed the ocean's floor
And it finally rose and broke upon the shore
No more

There's a part of it, that I'll miss
At the heart of it, your cold kiss
From the start of it, I know this
Oh there's a part of it, I know this

There's a part of it, that I'll miss
At the heart of it, your cold kiss
From the start of it, I know this
Oh there's a part of it
Oh there's a part of it
