I have something here from me to you
If you say yeah, I can too
don't want to speak
it's a sea again
flowing, crawling in my bed
I have something here from me to you
how can I ever see through you
don't want to sleep
it's a sea again
flowers to you
flowers my friend
I'll be outside
will it snow again
walking outside
flying with my friends
