When on high the heaven, had not be named
Firm ground below was unnamed
Mummu Tiamat she who bore them
Naught primordial Apsu their begetter

(CHORUS)
And the earth has been done and the life has just begun
and the formless void and darkness outdone
And the water has been done and the sky raised up
separating the water the genesis goes on
And the greater light has been done and the lesser light spun
to rule the day and night together with the stars
And the living creatures has been done
and the sea monsters have born
and everything that moves with which the waters swarm
She made the Worm the Dragon
The Female Monster the Great Lion
The Mad Dog the Man Scorpion
The Howling Storm

(CHORUS)

And the greater light has been done
and the lesser light spun
to rule the day and night
together with the stars
