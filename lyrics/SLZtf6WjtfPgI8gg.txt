There's a game you want to play
There's a risk you'd like to take
But words can't change what you feel inside
There'll be no going back from here
I'm scared it'll lead to tears
Patience boy and I will decide
If the kiss is sweet enough
If I wanna feel your touch
You should know I can read your mind
If the deal is worth the pain
If you just won't die of shame
But I am tempted to try

If you taste this fruit that you're forbidden to eat
You drink this winefrom a love so deep
I'd dance for you, let come within
If you swear to me that it ain't no sin

There's a world you wanna know
There's a place you wanna go
Take your time and love will delight
There are wonders everywhere
There are mysteries to share
Be gentle boy and it... it will be alright

If you taste this fruit that you're forbidden to eat
You drink this wine from a love so deep
I'd dance for you, let come within
If you swear to me that it ain't no sin

If you taste this fruit that you're forbidden to eat
You drink this wine from a love so deep
I'd dance for you, let come within
If you swear to me that it ain't no sin

Oh yeah... oh
Ohf ya... oh if ya swear it to me...

If you taste this fruit that you're forbidden to eat
You drink this wine from a love so deep
I'd dance for you, let come within
If you swear to me that it ain't no sin

Taste it.so deep.i wanna dance for you.
Come on and taste it.Come on and taste it...
