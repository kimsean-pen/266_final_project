I remember a faraway laugh
A sweet caress
You'd help me zip up my dress

I remember your arms around my neck
21 shells wrapped in my nest
Endlessness
Didn't last

I won't change
Given the chance

And I remember no place for me to hide
Before you came home at night
I remember you turning out the lights
All I ever saw was the red in your eyes
No big surprise
Happened nearly every night

Your own flesh and blood
I did wonder why

I remember not knowing what to say
And how calm you had remained
Your child stillborn with no name
I remember the never-ending summer rain
Oh
Please don't let what was get in the way of what's next
Don't forget
That what's to come hasn't come yet
