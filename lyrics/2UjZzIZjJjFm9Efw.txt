Oh baby it's no big deal
However it is I feel
You were just the man on my mind
In a particular time

I know I projected onto you
My own colorful reel
I simply had man on my mind
And you delivered the lines

So fine
So fine
Ooh ooh ooh

Between the shootings and spills
Behind the scenes it's too real
After the ending
We fall into the streets
The daylight's blinding
The daylight's blinding

Where do you go
If I get to know you
I don't think I
Really want to
Lose you

Ooh ooh

But baby it's no big deal
However it is I feel
You were just the man on my mind
And you delivered the lines
It was a turbulent time
And I know things don't always
Turn out fine
Fine
