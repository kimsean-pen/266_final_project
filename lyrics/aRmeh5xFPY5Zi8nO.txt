Let the world oustide dissolve
Promise not to let me go
We don't talk emotions
We don't wanna be alone
And the planet keeps turning
The bright light is burning too fast
We're under cover
Not disappearing now
And your love is gonna fuck with my head
You're keeping me in lockdown
Yeah your love is gonna fuck with my head
You're keeping me in lockdown
Just let the world outside dissolve
Pills and kicks to numb it all
The mitsubishi poison
Unlimited emotions
And the planet keeps turning
The bright light is burning too fast
We can be trouble
I guess that we won't last
And your love is gonna fuck with my head
You're keeping me in lockdown
Yeah your love is gonna fuck with my head
You're keeping me in lockdown

And the planet keeps turning
The bright light is burning too fast
And we keep telling ourselves
That it will pass
And your love is gonna fuck with my head
You're keeping me in lockdown
Yeah your love is gonna fuck with my head
You're keeping me in lockdown
