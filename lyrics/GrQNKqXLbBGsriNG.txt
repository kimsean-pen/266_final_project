Wake up brush my teeth
Then I go and fuck your girlfriend
You're an amateur
I can make her cum in person
On the banister
I done changed up in the worst way
I don't care no more I'm a fucking different person

All of my minds on the dough
Yeah
All of them niggas are broke
Yeah
I never answer the phone
Yeah
All of my girls get it on
They be on liquor and coke
Yeah
I got a pipe for her throat
Now my mouths filled with vodka
All my dreams they knock at the door like ooouuu

She rings my phone up but I do not answer
Ooouuu
