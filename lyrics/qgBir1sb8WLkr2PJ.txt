Illusions of dominance
Egoic mankind
Habitat for parasites
Blood and flesh alive

The dead shall rise form their grave
To destroy all mankind

Death is the beginning
Bacteria kept alive
Viruses multiply
Our fall is their rise

The dead shall rise form their grave
To destroy all mankind

War-torn landscapes
Dense urban waste
Living in sewage
The black plague awaits

Illusions of dominance
Egoic mankind
Habitat for parasites
Blood and flesh alive

The dead shall rise form their grave
To destroy all mankind
