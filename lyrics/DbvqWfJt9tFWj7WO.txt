At 42, 000 feet above the sea
That's where U and I first came 2 be
From the dust of the earth and the knowledge tree
Te amo corazón {Spanish for: "I love U, sweetheart"}

At last I can tell U what I've known so long
My heart's been crying out 2 sing this song
I don't care who knows it cuz there's nothing wrong
Te amo corazón

I'm so scared of losing U
I really don't know what I'd do
Can't bear the thought of another day apart
My heart, my heart... corazón

{scatting}

At once when I first laid eyes on U
I saw heaven and Earth anew
Everyone else saw my brown eyes, no longer blue
Te amo corazón

Oh yeah, oh yes

At first I couldn't find the words 2 say
How much U've changed me in every way
I just wanna thank U, oh, each and every day
Te amo corazón
