Met you on the beach in Barcelona
Spend the whole night talking till the sun came up
Have me feelin' like I always known ya
And I knew I'd never get it enough

You were heading back in California
I was kinda hopin' you would miss your flight
Never thought that I'll be waiting for ya
Now I'm counting time 'till the days and nights

Now I can't stop
Thinking about you
I'm thinking about you
Can't stop
Thinking about you
I'm thinking about you
Every night

How we gonna make it till the summer?
How we gonna hold on that love we found?
Thinking about that beach in Barcelona
Call me crazy but I need you now

I need you now
I need you (I need you)
I need you now
I need you (I need you)
I need you now
I need you (I need you)
I need you now
I need you (I need you)
I need you now

Met you on the beach in Barcelona
Spend the whole night talking till the sun came up
Have me feelin' like I always known ya
And I knew I'd never get it enough

Now I can't stop
Thinking about you
I'm thinking about you
Can't stop
Thinking about you
I'm thinking about you
Every night

How we gonna make it till the summer?
How we gonna hold on that love we found?
Think about that beach at Barcelona
Call me crazy but I need you now

I need you now
I need you (I need you)
I need you now
I need you (I need you)
I need you now
I need you (I need you)
I need you now
I need you (I need you)
I need you now
I need you (I need you)
I need now
I need you (I need you)
I need now

Thinking about that beach in Barcelona
Call me crazy but I need you now
