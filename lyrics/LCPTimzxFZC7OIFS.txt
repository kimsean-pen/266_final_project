I Love Your Eyes, My Dear
Their Splendid, Sparkling Fire
When Suddenly You Raise Them So
To Cast A Swift Embracing Glance

Like Lightning Flashing In The Sky
But There's A Charm That Is Greater Still:
When My Love's Eyes Are Lowered
When All Is Fired By Passions Kiss

And Through The Downcast Lashes
I See The Dull Flame Of Desire
And Through The Downcast Lashes
I See The Dull Flame Of Desire

I Love Your Eyes, My Dear
Their Splendid, Sparkling Fire
When Suddenly You Raise Them So
To Cast A Swift Embracing Glance

Like Lightning Flashing In The Sky
But There's A Charm That Is Greater Still:
When My Love's Eyes Are Lowered
When All Is Fired By Passions Kiss

And Through The Downcast Lashes
I See The Dull Flame Of Desire
And Through The Downcast Lashes
I See The Dull Flame Of Desire

Dull Flame
I See The Full Flame Of Desire
I See The Dull Flame
I See The Full Flame

I Love Your Eyes, My Dear
Their Splendid, Sparkling Fire
When Suddenly You Raise Them So
To Cast A Swift Embracing Glance

Like Lightning Flashing In The Sky
But There's A Charm That Is Greater Still:
When My Love's Eyes Are Lowered
When All Is Fired By Passions Kiss

And Through The Downcast Lashes
I See The Dull Flame Of Desire
Through The Downcast Lashes
I See The Dull Flame Of Desire

Dull Flame
I See The Full Flame Of
I See The Dull Flame
I See The Full Flame

I Love Your Eyes, My Dear
Their Splendid, Sparkling Fire
When Suddenly You Raise Them So
To Cast A Swift Embracing Glance

Like Lightning Flashing In The Sky
But There's A Charm That Is Greater Still:
When My Love's Eyes Are Lowered
When All Is Fired By Passions Kiss

Through The Downcast Lashes
I See The Dull Flame Of Desire
And Through The Downcast Lashes
I See The Dull Flame Of Desire

And Through The
Downcast Lashes
I See The
Dull Flame
Of Desire.
