The star's luminosity failing
All grey ash and ruin
Bathed in the light of their guttering waning
As if a world spilled from his heart's painting

"No, please no
What have I wrought upon me?"

Overflowing, I wander here still
Blackened feet drag through dust
Bound by shackles hung
With a stone of Sisyphean weight

"No, I beg
This cannot be
Darkness claims me"

A burden of proportions Biblical
In these dizzying plains of desolation
So in death, as you were in life
May the punishment fit the crime

The soundless scream still echoes with acrid winds
This is a tomb of my own making
Their faces hang above me, a warning
They were dragged here, mourning
Toward my horizon, cold

"No, please no
What have I wrought upon me?"

"No, I beg
This cannot be
Darkness claims me"

They were dragged here, helpless
Toward my horizon, cold

I was never a person
I am a black hole
