If you could read my mind
You'd know, you'd find
That I've been searching, I've been searching
Give my loving
Give my loving
I've been searching
I've been searching
Give my loving to you
Cause I've been searching
I've been searching
Give my loving
Give my loving
I've been searching
(I started)
I've been searching
Give my loving to you
(All your baby, call another baby out)
([?])
If you could read my mind
(It's over)
You know, you'd find
(You'd find)
If you could read my mind
If you could look, you'd find
If you could read my mind
(My mind)
You'd know what you'd find
If you could read my mind
You'd know what you'd find
You'd know what you'd find
