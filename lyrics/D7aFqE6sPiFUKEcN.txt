Farewell
This blackened eye
You've learned your lessons falling down
Far behind and tracing footsteps home

Despite your lack of pride
You wore your imperfections well
Dignified
Spend your time alone
Trace your footsteps home

Your hands are always reaching out of favor
Your kind are only good for bad behavior
Your mouth was never one to trust
You're always speaking out
Falling far behind
Falling out of line

Farewell
This bitter tongue
You spoke your lessons falling down, talking out
And breaking silence

Despite the harm you've done
You swallowed your rejection well
Amplified
Sing your song alone
Trace your footsteps home

Your hands are always reaching out of favor
Your kind are only good for bad behavior
Your mouth was never one to trust
You're always speaking out
Falling far behind
Falling...

Your hands are always reaching out of favor
Your kind are only good for bad behavior
Your mouth was never one to trust
You're always speaking out
Falling far behind
Falling out of line
