I've been watching you like a hawk
I know you're hiding something
When we're together I can hardly breathe
I feel like it's gonna spill out of me what I believe

I would rather wait till it looks so bad
That you can't no longer hide it from me
I would rather wait for the chance to catch you red handed

You've got a girlfriend in this city
You got a girlfriend in this city
Oh, is your girlfriend pretty
Does she look like me

Does she blow your mind all the time
Or are you just passing time
You've got a girlfriend in this city
And it's not me

I stay at home on the other side of town
Waiting all out when you bring me flowers
You are far away and what I don't know won't hurt me, but it do
And worse, it's killing you, all the guilt inside, I can see it, it's true

You've got a girlfriend in this city
You got a girlfriend in this city
Oh, is your girlfriend pretty
Does she look like me

And I'm dying to know what she's like
Although I know it won't make this right
You've got a girlfriend in this city
And it's not me

Does she wear her hair up or her hair down
Is she quite or is she loud
Does she dress up or she dress down
Why are you keeping her around

Who is she to you
Who is she to you
Who is she to you

Who is she to you
Who is she to you
Who is she to you

You've got a girlfriend in this city
You've got a girlfriend in this city
Oh, I hear your girlfriend's pretty
I wanna see
