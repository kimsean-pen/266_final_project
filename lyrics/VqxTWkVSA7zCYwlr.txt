I crossed over, I lost myself
I saw the light, I went to hell
But the devil never looked my way
Close my eyes and try to remember
All the things that had brought us together here, here

Wake up, wake up, wake up
There's somebody calling, there's somebody calling
Wake up, wake up, wake up
There's somebody calling, there's somebody calling

From high above I heard the screams
Of emotionless machines who just see flatlines
Now I've lost my tomorrow
I paid the debt of the time I've been borrowing
Nothing can save me

Wake up, wake up, wake up
There's somebody calling, there's somebody calling
Wake up, wake up, wake up
There's somebody calling, there's somebody calling

Images are fading
There's nothing in the mirror
End is now, end is here
If you let me back in
Nothing would be different
End is here
Now all I am is a dead reflection

Wake up, wake up, wake up
There's somebody calling, there's somebody calling
All I am is a dead reflection
Wake up, wake up, wake up
There's somebody calling, there's somebody calling
All I am is a dead reflection

Images are fading
There's nothing in the mirror
End is now, end is here
If you let me back in
I know nothing would be different
The end is here
All I am is a dead reflection
