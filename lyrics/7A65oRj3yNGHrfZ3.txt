create a space, your own
a place to be alone
somewhere you can find
your heart and peace of mind

i don't wanna get caught in the middle
i can do it all on my own, not a kid oh

i don't wanna get caught in the middle
i can do it all on my own, not a kid oh

say the words you mean to say
don't get caught up in the game
hear it like you feel it play
no two hearts the same
oh, oh

go along, you've grown
somewhere you've found a home
i can see you're scared
i can see you care

i don't wanna get caught in the middle
i can do it all on my own, not a kid oh

i don't wanna get caught in the middle
i can do it all on my own, not a kid oh

say the words you mean to say
don't get caught up in the game
hear it like you feel it play
no two hearts the same
oh, oh

who needs a brain when we have these games
and i don't know what i want, but for now stay the same
sonny chiba couldn't beat this, this is where i'm supposed to be
we grow old and we turn like leaves, and i don't know what i want
but for now stay the same, sonny chiba couldn't beat this
this is where i'm supposed to be
