You have now entered from the womb
In my reconstruction from deconstruction
Where instruments of genetic distortion is me
Abandon your pious ways
You
Between sacrifice and worms
It will
Take you lifetimes of dying to live again
In my strata of war
And you think that death is finally home
Morphing in cell structures
The future is still hidden
Time bends like mirror light
I am in your mind
You are part of me
As me in you, you in me
