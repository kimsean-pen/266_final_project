I am a mindsweeper, focus on me
I am a mindsweeper, focus on me
I will read your mind
It goes on and on...
Through volatile territory
Through the plains of adversity and the ravines of neurosis
Through the veins of gods and the valley of death
But remember, but remember you are not alone
And we dance like knights
Here come the cavalry
Here come the cavalry
Oh am I glad to see your face
Sorry you're not a winner
With the air so cold
and the mind so bitter
The same blood gushes through my veins
Feel it surge
Feel it surge
Sweep through jet streams
Down axons
And across synapses
(Rous mental breakdown)
Mutato nomine, de te fabula narratur
