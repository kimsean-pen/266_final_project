Playing star again on a steel horse
I ride anywhere I roam with my
Ion, filling my palm with a titty from a city where I'm strumming a song
Poorly but surely the next girl next door needs
To prove that she really does, truly adore me
So horny, at a vacant shake warning
Some banner, hey nanner nanner's getting hammered
Saw her like a scene from a porno flick it seems

That the more hardcore my scheme, she's keen on
Banging her head like Slayer's playing in my lap
Till she looks like she's doing a "Got Milk?" ad
Sounds bad but believe me any girl this easy

Had more bands in her than CBGB's
If she needs me to meet her needs, she needs to stay away
'Cause her legs are the only thing that's open this late
But what kind of a slut would want to sleep with me?
You've gotta be fucked up to want to sleep with me
When she gets her panties lower than her self esteem
I'll show her what her mommy did that made her daddy leave
"Ask not what your cunt can do for you.

Ask what you can do for your cunt."
This all access, back stage passes
Acting as an aphrodisiac
With his floozy that laughs as she flashes her ass

And then asks for an autograph that obviously practices
In front of the mirror, knees touching her ears
On the floor so much, she gives her age in dog years
She's like a microphone 'cause she gets used by the singer
When you kiss her you're pretty much blowing Kip Winger

But what kind of a slut would want to sleep with me?
You'd gotta be fucked up to want to sleep with me
When she gets her panties lower than her self esteem
I'll show her what her mommy did to make her daddy leave
"Ask not what your cunt can do for you.
Ask what you can do for your cunt."
Stop giving them kittens away for free to creeps like me
