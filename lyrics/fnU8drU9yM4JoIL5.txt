Life is good, I can't complain
I mean I could, but no one's listening
Your image overwhelms my brain
And it feels good, good, good

Now I'm rolling my window down
I love the wind but I hate the sound
You're like a tattoo that I can't remove
And it feels good, it feels good, it feels good

Like a roller coaster ride
Holding on white knuckles like
Whoa, whoa
(Can't believe I'm like)
Whoa, whoa
(Everything I'm like)
Up and down and side to side
Every inch of me is like
Whoa, whoa
(Got me feeling like)
Whoa, whoa
(Everything I'm like)

In the morning it begins again
It feels like I'm falling, better strap me in
I think I'm running out of oxygen
And it feels good, it feels good, it feels good

Like a roller coaster ride
Holding on white knuckles like
Whoa, whoa
(Can't believe I'm like)
Whoa, whoa
(Everything I'm like)
Up and down and side to side
Every inch of me is like
Whoa, whoa
(Got me feeling like)
Whoa, whoa
(Everything I'm like)

My inhibitions are beginning to let go
This situation, I can't help but lose control
You're an affliction that I cannot seem to break
It feels good, it feels good

I'm holding on
(Holdin', holdin', holdin', holdin')
(Holdin', holdin', holdin', holdin')
I'm holdin' on
Like a roller coaster ride
Like I'm running a red light
Like a rocket ship in flight
Something else that makes me feel like
Whoa
(Please keep your hands and feet in the ride at all times, thank you)

Like a roller coaster, whoa
Holding on white knuckles, whoa
Once you let your love in, whoa
Every inch of me is like
Whoa
(Got me feeling like)
