Days go by slowly
I never know holy
I see what you want me
You never realise that everything changes, everything moves
And nothing is as it was when you lose
The thoughts you fear, ooh
The way it's real
Completly sealed, my heart revealed
My mind sealing when you're gone
See my heart

Time it just rages
Never rolls in stages
Feel like I'm average
The pressure is so savage
Walk away happy
But only if you're there
Love I can feel it
The thought of you being closer than reason
And further than seasons
Closer than seasons
Winter, spring, summer, fall

(Wait, wait, wait, wait)
(waiting for you)

Forgive me for waiting so long
For taking the time to rise and destroy
I was a boy, baby
I couldn't be
I can't feel ya
(winter)
Spring, winter, summer, fall
Forgive me
Spring, winter, summer, fall
Time it just rages
Spring, winter, summer, fall
(love rolls in stages)
Time it just rages
Spring, winter, summer, fall
Waiting for the fall
(Love rolls in stages)
Waiting for the fall
(Love rolls in stages)
