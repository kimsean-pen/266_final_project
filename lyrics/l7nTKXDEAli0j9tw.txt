Waiting in a room
All dressed up and bound and gagged
Up to a chair
It's so unfair
I don't dare move
For the pain she puts me through
It's what I need
So make it bleed!

I'm in distress
Oh, misstress I confess
So do it one more time
These handcuffs are too tight, well
You know I will obey
So please don't make me beg
For blood, sex and booze
You give me.

Say I'm disturbed
It's what I deserve
Another lesson to be learned
From a girl called 'Kill'
My head is in the gutter
Thank you, sir
Strike up another mandolin
Of dicipline
Throw me to the dogs
Let them eat my flesh
Down to the wood
It feels so good...

I'm in distress
Oh, misstress I confess
So do it one more time
These handcuffs are too tight, well
You know I will obey
So please don't make me beg
For blood, sex and booze
You give me
