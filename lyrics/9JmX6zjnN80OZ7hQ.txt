Sleeve cut just off the shoulder
You are christening the shade
They'll talk, give them every reason
For child, you walk

Just like love
Just like love
Just like love
Just like love

Slick, sheen so bright it's a bother
You are cultivating grace
They're rough
Smother them with velvet
For child, you walk

Just like love
Just like love
Just like love
Just like love

When it happens again
Baby hold on and stare them down
When it happens again
Baby hold on and
Hold on
Hold on

Just like love
Just like love
Just like love
Just like love

Just like love
Just like love
Just like love
Just like love
