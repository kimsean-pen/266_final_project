I can't find you
stay where you are
i'm in the dark
stay where you are
(i'm alright
i feel fine
you're my life
i'm alright)
She's dead if you want and that's me if you want
stuffed in the corner, "little girl lost"
and i claw and i scratch and i beg and i scream
i just need you to save me one last time
it's me if you want but it's not what i want
i want to burn up the place
set it on fire
she's bad because she wants to not be contained
i can't tell the truth, i can't speak this way
You can't find me
you're in the dark
i'm right here
stay where you are
(i'm alright
i feel fine
you're my life
i'm alright)
She's dead if you want and that's me if you want

i just need you to save me one last time
it's me if you want but it's not what i want
i want to burn up the place
set it on fire
she's bad because she wants to set things on fire
i can't tell the truth, i can't speak this way
Stay where, where, where you are
i'm where, where, where you are
(i'm alright
i feel fine
you're my life
i'm alright)
