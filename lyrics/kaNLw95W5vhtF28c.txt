In any other world you could tell the difference
And let it all unfurl into broken remnants

Smile like you mean it and let yourself let go

'Cause it's all in the hands of a bitter, bitter man
Say goodbye to the world you thought you lived in
Take a bow, play the part of a lonely, lonely heart
Say goodbye to the world you thought you lived in

To the world you thought you lived in

I try to live alone, but lonely is so lonely, alone
So human as I am, I had to give up my defences

So I smiled and tried to mean it to let myself let go

'Cause it's all in the hands of a bitter, bitter man
Say goodbye to the world you thought you lived in
Take a bow, play the part of a lonely, lonely heart
Say goodbye to the world you thought you lived in

To the world you thought you lived in

'Cause it's all in the hands of a bitter, bitter man
Say goodbye to the world you thought you lived in
Take a bow, play the part of a lonely, lonely heart
Say goodbye to the world you thought you lived in

To the world you thought you lived in

Say goodbye to the world you thought you lived in
Say goodbye to the world you thought you lived in

Say goodbye

In any other world you could tell the difference
