Deep inside the silence
staring out upon the sea
the waves are washing over
half forgotten memory

Deep within the moment
laughter floats upon the breeze
rising and falling dying down within me
and I swear I never knew how it could be
and all this time all I had inside was
what i couldn't see
I swear I never knew
how it could be
all the waves are washing over
all that hurts inside of me

Beyond this beautiful horizon
lies a dream for you and i
this tranquil scene is still unbroken
by the rumors in the sky
but there's a storm closing in
voices crying on the wind
the serenade is growing colder
breaks my soul that tries to sing
and there's so many many thoughts
when I try to go to sleep
but with you I start to feel
a sort of temporary peace
there's a drift in and out
