Kisses that linger for hours
Two hard folks erase our windows to be closed
The garden noise has penetrate the slumber
Without ...

It's like there's a payload on a ring of fire
We're not considering beyond
Everything is magical enough
It's in here with us

The sunshine being taken by a downpour
Surely words are being beat up to the sun
Game of light that sweeps across your pillow
Thickets through the leaves
