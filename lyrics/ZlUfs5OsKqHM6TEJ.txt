Last impression of the first time I heard their name
Comes a time, you draw the line, so far away

I take my time
Was our last hope
I take my time
Blown motor roll

Ocean dries, clear your eyes, it's happenin' soon
Nothin' here, in the clear that interests you

I take my time
Was our last hope
Blown motor roll
Don't panic
Don't panic
Don't panic

(Don't panic)
