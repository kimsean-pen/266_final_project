I've been trying for days to think of a way
To find the words to make sense of how we behave
This might take a while, so please just hear me out

You know how things can get crazy when we go ablaze
We just get carried away
Believe me, I know
Don't even say a word, now please just hear me out

See my side
And I'll see yours better
Love me back
And I'll love you better

Sometimes the stunts that we pull don't even make sense
But I was never the one to feel the resent
This ain't 'bout who's to blame, so please just hear me out

When the scene gets intense, it's hard to prevent
From going all crazy again
Believe me, I know
Don't even say a word, now please just hear me out

See my side
And I'll see yours better

Love me back
And I'll love you better

See my side
And I'll see yours better
Love me back
And I'll love you better

We'll get right back
On the right track
We'll get right back on
We'll get right back on
On the right track

See my side
And I'll see yours better
Love me back
And I'll love you better

See my side
And I'll see yours better
Love me back
And I'll love you better
