Enlightening charmer sent from where
A Casanova likely glare
And I was chosen
I was there
The wells get deeper
More unfolds
And at the bottom there she goes
But wells are endless
I found more

Flower, candy, Flirty, late night
On the speed dial that was you to
Dinner, movie, sweetheart, kisses
He don't dance
But tangles with two
I find you plus me divide
Me from him but I discovered
Many more and again and again

And you don't know
You fill many spaces
And she don't know
She's one of many lies

And he don't now
How he stole many places
And we all know
You can't fix him, if we tried

I would've been you one

I held the title
Wore the crown
I was the trophy
While you touched down
And she was cool
With just fooling around
Now number four was there to ride
And five was crazy his wild child
And when we're rocky
He calls number nine

Flower, candy, Flirty, late night
On the speed dial that was you to
Dinner, movie, sweetheart, kisses
He don't dance
But tangles with two
I find you plus me divide
Me from him but I discovered
Many more and more again and again

And you don't know
You fill many spaces
And she don't know
She's one of many lies

And he don't know
How he steals many places
And we all know
We can't fix him if we tried
I would've been the one

I was the one
Yes I was the one

And yes that was my name
Inked up on his arm
And if he loved me that much
And still did me wrong

You feeling sorry but you are holding on

I was the one
Yeah I was the one
Key word is was
Yes I was the one
I figured out he was empty on my own

He had to find the answer
In the something on someone

And you don't know
You fill many spaces
And she don't know
She's one of many lies

And he don't know
He stole many places
And we all know
We can't fix him if we tried
I would've been you one
