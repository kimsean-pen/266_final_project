Mind locked down in total fear
Make a hole for your life-
Dig a grave for your own mind
Live in constant paranoia-
Believe every word you hear stay blind
Another homicide rap killing kids die
Stop living lock your door stay inside
Hang yourself in fear of living
Agenda of fear
Used to lock away your rights
A mental prison
Driven by a fascist vision
Used to control your mind
Agenda of fear
Used to lock away our rights
A mental prison
Driven by a fascist vision
Used to control our minds
Live each day
It's your last if you let it be
