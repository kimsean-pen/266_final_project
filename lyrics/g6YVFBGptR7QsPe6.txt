We move forward over land
It's too hard to see
It's too far ahead so you hold my hand
And we go to a place that only lovers know
And we go to a place that we've discovered
I'm like a laser beam
Cutting through everything
I'm in my fantasy
I can do anything
Taken by dreams
Taken by dreams

Feeling you breathing
Roar like a heartbeat
Catch me I'm a roller coaster
Freedom and poetry
Taken by dreams

Taken by dreams

And if you ever knew how lost I was before
You wouldn't recognize me
Now I'm on my way
And I'm grateful I can say
I want to go
Cut me loose
Cut me loose
Let me run to the stars
There're not so far
Illuminate our way

You and I we're on our way
Come on let's go

We travel into the night
We cross galaxies
We run we leap and we fly
It's not hard
â€˜cause we're called by a music we don't understand
And we're drawn by the glow of a fire
I'm electricity
Burning bright energy
Catch me on the 1, 2, 3

I can do anything
Taken by dreams
Taken by dreams

Feeling you breathing
Roar like a heartbeat

Catch me I'm a roller coaster
Freedom and poetry
Taken by dreams
Taken by dreams

And if you ever knew how lost I was before
You wouldn't recognize me
Now I'm on my way
And I'm grateful I can say
I want to go
Cut me loose
Cut me loose

Let me run to the stars
There're not so far
Illuminate our way
You and I we're on our way

And it's the sun and moon and gold
Seeds, vibrations
Spinning out in space
Gone to another place
And in a million years from now
We're tiny stars across the Universe
Trembling, saying, "Amen"
Come on let's go
Come on let's go
Taken by dreams
Taken by dreams
