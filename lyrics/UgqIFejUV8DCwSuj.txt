It's not like you said it was
Nothing like you said it was
It's a dirty old place and I can't go back
It's not like you said it was
Nothing like you said it was
I've been misused and I can't go back

It's a dirty old place and it's full of lies
And I can't see a thing through virgin's eyes
It's a dirty old place and it's full of lies
And I'm still seeing through virgin's eyes

Tonight and I can't go back and I can't go back

I had a young boy's dream
But I can plainly see
It's a filthy world and I can't go back
Now I can't go back
Now I can't go back
I've been misused and I can't go back

Everybody here is out to get me
Or at least that's how it seems to me
Everybody here is laughing at me
But now I know my weakness is my strength

And I want to go back and I can't go back
