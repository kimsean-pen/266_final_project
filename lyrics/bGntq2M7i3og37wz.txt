Big girl, you are beautiful

Walks in to the room, feels like a big balloon
I said, "Hey girl, you are beautiful"
Diet Coke and a pizza please, diet Coke, I'm on my knees
Screaming, "Big girl, you are beautiful"

You take your skinny girl, I feel like I'm gonna die
'Cause a real woman needs a real man, here's why
You take your girl and multiply her by four
Now a whole lot of woman needs a whole lot more

Get yourself to the Butterfly Lounge, find yourself a big lady
Big boy, come on around and they'll be calling you "baby"
No need to fantasize since I was in my braces
A watering hole with the girls around and curves in all the right places

Big girl, you are beautiful
Big girl, you are beautiful
Big girl, you are beautiful
Big girl, you are beautiful

Walks in to the room, feels like a big balloon
