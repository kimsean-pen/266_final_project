Sleep, where have you gone?
It's been months now
And I'm coming undone
I keep being woken
By screams and tears
Sheer fucking terror
Ringing out in my ears

Sing you a lullaby
Every night
Just shut your eyes
We will be alright

Where have you gone?
We count the hours
While we wait for the sun
And I don't sleep
In the night-time now
And all my dreams have all gone to ground
Where have you gone?

Sing you a lullaby
Every night
Just shut your eyes
We will be alright

The stars in the sky
The moon and the tide
Your smile in the night
When I sing you a lullaby

Sleep, where have you gone?
We count the hours while we wait for the sun
And I don't sleep in the night-time now
And all my dreams have all gone to ground
Like the stars in the sky
Like the moon and the tide
Like your smile in the night
When I sing you a lullaby

Every night
Just shut your eyes
We will be alright
The stars in the sky
The moon and the tide
Your smile in the night
When I sing you a lullaby
