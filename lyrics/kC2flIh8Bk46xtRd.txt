Hey, sit down and listen and they'll tell you when you're wrong
Eradicate but vindicate as progress creeps along
Puritan work ethic maintains its subconscious edge
As old glory maintains your consciousness

There's a loser in my house and a puppet on a stool
And a crowded way of life and a black reflecting pool
And as the people bend the moral fabric dies
Then country can't pretend to ignore its peoples' cries

'Cause you are the government, you are jurisprudence
You are the volition, you are jurisdiction
And I make a difference too
