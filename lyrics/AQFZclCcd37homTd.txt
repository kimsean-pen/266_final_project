The battlefield in my car
Next to me, miles apart
I can't remember how to start
I wanna go back, yeah
I wanna go back, yeah
Enemies drawing lines
They lay the blame, we justify
I surrender, I resign
I wanna go back, yeah
I wanna go back, yeah

And all that I needed to know
Will you stay til the daylight?
I just wanna take you home
Start again with the sunrise

Sleep on a dream
On it fade into the past
I wanted you are the best thing I've ever had
And all that I needed to know
Will you stay til the daylight?

All I know is I want you
Love can heal, love can bruise
On your side, win or lose
It's all in the past, yeah
It's all in the past, yeah
Battlefield in my car
Almost home in my arms
I'll be fine if you are
It's all in the past, yeah
It's all in the past, yeah

And all that I needed to know
Will you stay til the daylight?
I just wanna take you home
Start again with the sunrise

Sleep on a dream
On it fade into the past
I wanted you are the best thing I've ever had
And all that I needed to know
Will you stay til the daylight?

Daylight, daylight
Daylight, daylight
Oh
Daylight, daylight
Daylight, daylight
Oh

And all that I needed to know
Will you stay til the daylight?

Sleep on a dream
On it fade into the past
I wanted you are the best thing I've ever had
Stars shining all quiet
Lying next to me
Eyes open arms till tonight
I can feel you breathe

And all that I needed to know
Will you stay til the daylight?
And I'll never let you go
Start again with the sunrise

I can feel you breathing
I can feel you breathing
I can feel you breathing
I can feel you still breathing

Daylight, daylight
Daylight, daylight
Oh
Daylight, daylight
Daylight, daylight
Oh
