I've got a life out there somewhere
It's waiting
Lined with palm trees and only new faces
If I could look past the present and get there
Well baby, it's worth a shot
Just enough time to plan an escape route
I put my map on the wall in the basement
Not quite a victory to run from your problems
But it's the only plan that I got
It's the only plan that I got
And if you try to find me now
Oh oh oh oh!
I'm in all the echoes that have faded out, so
I'm moving on 'cause I just want to feel for once that I belong
That's what's going on
That's what's going on
Crossed the state line and called out a warning
Not too long now, I'll breathe california
Paid my dues and I tried to be loyal
But now I'm done with all that
Where I'm going is everyone's story
We want
You left
We're left to start over
It's not a question of who are we really
It's who we want to be
And if you try to find me now
Oh oh oh oh!
I'm in all the echoes that have faded ou, so
I'm moving on 'cause I just want to feel for once that I belong
And that's what's going on
All that's in between
A brand new life and I this time
But time has not been kind
It's not been kind to me
It's winding backwards
Time has not been kind
It's crawling by
So
Slowly!
And if you try to find me now
Oh oh oh oh!
I'm in all the echoes that have faded out, so
I'm moving on 'cause I just want to feel for once that I belong
And that's what's going on
And if you try to find me now
Oh oh oh oh
I'm in all the echoes that have faded out, so
I'm moving on 'cause I just want to feel for once that I belong
And that's what's going on
