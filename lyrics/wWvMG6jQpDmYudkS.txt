Quiet in a haze
I gotta find you
cause you're living
in a maze
I know your secrets
Insecurities
I let myself into
the walls you build
from me
It's true
that you were
chosen from the start
Hard to believe you
fell into my heart
Oh I, I
gotta find you
You were hard to tell
I held your hand
you cast me
in a brand new spell
Love was on the line
we toss and turn
each night to
bring it back to life
It's true
that you were
chosen from the start
Hard to believe you
fell into my heart
Oh I, I
gotta find you
All I ever do
is dream about you,
wishing I could be
right next to you
Everyday
I feel this way
and I know
that you will stay,
tonight
Be right next to you
All I ever do
is think about you
And I know
I gotta find you
Giving all my love to you
All I ever do
is dream about you,
wishing I could be
right next to you
Everyday
I feel this way
and I know
that you will stay,
tonight
Be right next to you
All I ever do
is think about you
And I know
I gotta find you
Giving all my love to you
