Are you just someone else's dream?
Do you keep dreaming anyway?
That this town is just a back drop
Then you could get away

There's a wave I wanna ride it
Surfing blond on a Friday night
(You have to ride)
Breaking down onto the shoreline
That's you and me

Pressures might tear us away
Blow ourselves up, bombs away
I've never been so involved
We've never been so in love
Real life
Pressures might tear us away
Blow ourselves up, bombs away
I've never been so involved
We've never been so in love
Real life

Hold on, go slow
I dont wanna dig these tunnels anymore
I wanna walk in the path of the sun
I can't hide this, I wanna ride it

Theres a place I wanna find
Coming out of that fire like
Burning down the aveneues
You and me

Pressures might tear us away
Blow ourselves up, bombs away
I've never been so involved
We've never been so in love
Real life
Pressures might tear us away
Blow ourselves up, bombs away
I've never been so involved
We've never been so in love
Real life

Pressure (real life)
Pressure (tear us away)
Pressure
Pressure (I've never been so involved)
Pressure (real life)
Pressure (tear us away)
Pressure
I've never been so unsure
Real life pressure
