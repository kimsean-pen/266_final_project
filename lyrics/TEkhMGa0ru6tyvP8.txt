She's still wants to know
What I still don't know to say
When we go below
All songs I should know go away

We take the long road home but cut it short
When all the soul falls out from the cold

Into words for you
All that I can do
Songs too true
Break it into two

I'll slip on a loop
Diamond in a soup to choke
They cop a feel and fate takes the wheel
A figure eight

We take the long road home but cut it short
When all the soul falls out from the cold

Into words for you
All that I can do
Songs too true
Break it into two

Into words...
