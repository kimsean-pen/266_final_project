I shot him down down down down down down down down

I pulled the trigger on our love
Keep messing me around
Got my finger on the gun
Bang bang I shot you down

Left right
Left right
Left right
Left right

I think about it everyday
I shouldn't have hurt you that way
But it's a little late to say
That I can erase your heartache

Thinking about it
Thinking about it
Thinking about it
Oooooh baby

I pulled the trigger on our love
Keep messing me around
Got my finger on the gun
Bang bang I shot you down

I pulled the trigger on our love
Keep messing me around
Got my finger on the gun
Bang bang I shot you down

I pulled the trigger on our love
Keep messing me around
Got my finger on the gun
Bang bang I shot you down

I pulled the trigger on our love
Keep messing me around
Got my finger on the gun
Bang bang I shot you down

I pulled the trigger on our love
Keep messing me around
Got my finger on the gun
Bang bang I shot you down
