Fire is burning all around
Ashes falling to the ground
Someone save me, set me free
The smoke, it settles on my skin
Don't play with fire, you'll never win
Someone save me, help me breathe
Someone save me, help me breathe
Someone save me, help me breathe

Fire

Fire spreading everywhere
I feel we're running out of air
Someone save me, set me free
This love was cursed, long ago
It never had the chance to grow
Someone save me, help me breathe

This love was cursed, long ago
It never had the chance to grow
Someone save me, help me breathe
Fire

Someone save me, help me breathe
Someone save me, help me breathe
Someone save me, help me breathe
Someone save me, help me breathe
Fire
