Living with these shadows
Separating what I've done
And chasing the illusions
Of who I once was
Too much time, too many places
Different lives and different faces
Stripping down and bracing for a change

A better life, I'm searching for
A better life, I'm searching for

Someday I'll begin to live my life
I pray I'm okay for now
At least I'm breathing, I'm dying
I'm reaching through myself
For another way
I can win and live my life again
Someday

Looking for a sign as desperation sets within
Boredom starts to blend into another sin
All this time, all this weather
Drink my wine, I'm no better
Everything around me stays the same

A better life, I'm searching for
A better life, I'm searching for

Someday I'll begin to live my life
I pray I'm okay for now
At least I'm breathing, I'm dying
I'm reaching through myself
For another way
I can win and live my life again
Someday

Searching for a life, I need to know
I'm searching for a part of me to follow
Too many people with their hands on me
None of which I really give a shit about anyway

Shedding all my skin to start again and again
Shedding all my skin to start again and again
Shedding all my skin to start again and again
Shedding all my skin to start again and again

Someday I'll begin to live my life
I pray I'm okay for now
At least I'm breathing, I'm dying
I'm reaching through myself
For another way
I can win and live my life again
Someday
Someday
