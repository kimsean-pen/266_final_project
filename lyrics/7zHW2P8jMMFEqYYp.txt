You know that I've been infatuated
With you for so long
Thought the feeling was gone by now
But it just came back so strong
Human love is a pack of lies
And I don't know what to do
Well I guess that I'm pretty high
So I'll lie and think of you
Aftertouch
Aftertouch
Aftertouch
Aftertouch
Aftertouch
Aftertouch
And the lights of the hovercars
Through the window touch the walls
And the parallel lines of
Ultra-violet rise and fall
Like the beat of your plastick heart
In the dark when I'm touching you
And I know that I won't be fine
But I'll lie and say it's true
Aftertouch
Aftertouch
Aftertouch
Aftertouch
Aftertouch
Aftertouch
Aftertouch
Aftertouch
