Who you waiting for?
Another savior
Always looking but you never find
Never find

Waking up from
Another night gone
Always looking but you never find
Never find

Going downtown
You know where you going
Throw your top down
Like you know where you going
Tell me one thing
Do you like where you going
Ignoring all of the signs

I'm telling the truth now
Telling
Telling
I'm telling the truth now
Telling
Telling
I'm telling the truth now
We're all born naked
And the rest is drag

Who-who, who do you think you are?
Who-who telling the truth now
Who-who, who do you think you are?
We're all born naked and the rest is drag

A lonely highway
You drove the wrong way
Always chasing down the fantasy-fantasy
A sexy muscle car
Under the radar
Always looking but you never see-never see

Going downtown
You know where you going
Throw your top down
Like you know where you going
Tell me one thing
Do you like where you going
Ignoring all of the signs

I'm telling the truth now
Telling
Telling
I'm telling the truth now
Telling
Telling
I'm telling the truth now
We're all born naked and the rest is drag

Who-who, who do you think you are?
Who-who telling the truth now
Who-who, who do you think you are?
We're all born naked and the rest is drag

I'll say it again
It's never been the clothes that make the man
Nothing can
Leave your baggage behind
And I said

I'm telling the truth now
Telling
Telling
I'm telling the truth now
Telling
Telling
I'm telling the truth now
We're all born naked and the rest is drag

Who-who, who do you think you are?
Who-who telling the truth now
Who-who, who do you think you are?
We're all born naked and the rest is drag
