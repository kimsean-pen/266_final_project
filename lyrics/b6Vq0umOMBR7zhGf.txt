We've built it up just to fall apart
Try to leave them wanting more
As we scream and we fight
Carry on through the night
But the problem is never the cure

Everyday we try to be
Better than the lies and the sins
All the love, all the hate
Feel like one and the same
I only sink before I swim

I swear this time is gonna be the last one
Gonna be the last one
Oh woah oh oh
This time is gonna be the last one
Gonna be the last one
Oh woah oh oh

I'll forget all the dreams that we told our hearts
And the pain that's there to start
Try to find what is safe
From the scars that replace
Like the faithful that converts

I swear this time is gonna be the last one
Gonna be the last one
Oh woah oh oh
This time is gonna be the last one
Gonna be the last one
Oh woah oh oh

I'm standing proud
We sing it out
The legion of the underground

This time is gonna be the last one
Gonna be the last one
Oh woah oh oh

Keeps pulling me under
When the waves come down
I can't come up for air
Keeps pulling me under
When I close my eyes
It's all that I can bear
Keeps pulling me under
Let the rain come down
And wash away the fear
Keeps pulling me under
Let the rain come down
And wash away
Wash away our fear
Yeah

I swear this time is gonna be the last one
Gonna be the last one
Oh woah oh oh
This time is gonna be the last one
Gonna be the last one
Oh woah oh oh

I'm standing proud
We sing it out
The legion of the underground

This time is gonna be the last one
Gonna be the last one
Oh woah oh oh
