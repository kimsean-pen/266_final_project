These things that I've been told can rearrange
My world, my doubt in time but inside out

This is the working hour
We are paid by those who learn by our mistakes
This is the working hour
We are paid by those who learn by our mistakes

This day and age for all and not for one
All lies and secrets, put on, put on and on

This is the working hour
We are paid by those who learn by our mistakes
This is the working hour
We are paid by those who learn by our mistakes

Fear is such a vicious thing
It wraps me up in chains

Find out, find out, what this fear is about
Find out, find out, what this fear is about

Find out, find out, what this fear is about
