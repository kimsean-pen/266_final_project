As if the first cut wasn't deep enough
I dove in again 'cause I'm not into giving up
Could've gotten the same rush from any lover's touch
Why get used to something new?
'Cause no one breaks my heart like you

And you kiss me, and you wish we could see what happens next
For a moment, I can forget what happens in my head
If I doubt you, will you come through with a happy second chance?
A happy ending
But this time you don't leave me sinking

I'm underwater
With no air in my lungs
My eyes are open
I'm done giving up
You are the wave
I could never tame
If I survive
I'll dive back in

As if the first blood didn't thrill enough
I went further out to see what else was left of us
Never found the deep end of our little ocean
Drain the fantasy of you
Headfirst into shallow pools

And I wonder, is it better to get it over with?
The illusion can shatter before we begin
If you're really sorry
Happy second chance
I think I could forgive
This time you won't leave me sinking

I'm underwater
With no air in my lungs
My eyes are open
I'm done giving up
You are the wave
I could never tame
If I survive
I'll dive back in

Dive back into
Right back into
Dive right back into you
Now I know you
Now I know you
Now that I know you
Dive right back into you
Back into you
Right back into you
Dive right back into you
Now I know you
Now I know you
Now that I know you
Dive right back into you

I'm underwater
With no air in my lungs
My eyes are open
I'm done giving up
You are the wave
I could never tame
If I survive
I'll dive back in

I'm underwater
With no air in my lungs
My eyes are open
I'm done giving up
You are the wave
I could never tame
If I survive
I'll dive back in
I'll dive back in
I'll dive back
