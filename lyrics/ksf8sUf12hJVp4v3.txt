Just one more thing before I go
Before I let you take the throne
You'll go right and I'll stay left
And if you ever get too close
You'll know my name before I go

They loved me then they love you now
But don't forget there's one more round
Oh, the pain I know it well
But it hasn't kept me down
You think you've got me figured out

You thought you had me
You thought that I was done, but
I'm stronger up against the ropes
I am a-a fighter
Before this fight is over
You'll know my name before I go
Oooh, oooh, oooh
You'll know my name before I go

Just one more thing before I go
Before the final curtains close
There's no telling what comes next
But these tired hands will show
You'll know my name before I go

Just one more thing before the end
No time has never been a friend
To the dreamer, to the lover
To the one who needs to win
Watch out 'cause here it comes
I say when I am done

You thought you had me
You thought that I was done, but
I'm stronger up against the ropes
I am a-a fighter
Before this fight is over
You'll know my name before I go
Oooh, oooh, oooh
You'll know my name before I go
Oooh, oooh, oooh
You'll know my name

Just one more thing before I go

You thought you had me
You thought that I was done, but
I'm stronger up against the ropes
I am a-a fighter
Before this fight is over
You'll know my name before I go
Oooh, oooh, oooh
You'll know my name before I go
