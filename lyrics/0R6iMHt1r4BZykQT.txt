I have sinned, dear father
Father, I have sinned
Try and help me, father
Won't you let me in?

Liar!
Oh, nobody believes me
Liar!
Mmm, why don't you leave me alone?

Sire, I have stolen, stolen many times
Raised my voice in anger
When I know I never should

Liar!
Oh, everybody deceives me
Liar!
Mmm, why don't you leave me alone?

(Liar!) I have sailed the seas
(Liar!) From Mars to Mercury
(Liar!) I have drunk the wine
(Liar!) Time after time
(Liar!) You're lying to me
(Liar!) You're lying to me

Father, please, forgive me
You know you'll never leave me
Please, will you direct me in the right way?
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, that's what they keep calling me
Liar, liar, liar

Listen! Are you gonna listen?
Mama, I'm gonna be your slave
All-day long
Mama, I'm gonna try behave
All-day long
Mama, I'm gonna be your slave
All-day long
I'm gonna serve you 'til your dying day
All-day long
I'm gonna keep you 'til your dying day
All-day long
I'm gonna kneel down by your side and pray
All-day long (And pray)
All-day long (And pray)
All-day long (And pray)
All-day long, all-day long, all-day long
All-day long, all-day long, all-day long
All-day long, all-day long

All-day long, all-day long, all-day long

Liar, liar, they never, ever, let you win
Liar, liar, everything you do is sin
Liar, nobody believes you
Liar, they bring you down before you begin
Now, let me tell you this
Now, you know you could be dead before they let you
