When a bee lies sleepin'
In the palm of your hand
You're bewitched, and deep in
Love's long looked-after land
Where you'll see a sun-up sky
With a mornin' moon
And where the days go laughin'
By, as love comes a callin' on you

Sleep on bee, don't waken
Can't believe what just passed
He's mine for the takin'
I am happy at last
Maybe I dreams
But he seems
Sweet golden as a crown
A sleepin' bee
Done told me
I will walk with my feet off the ground
When my one true love, I has found

Sleep on bee, don't waken!
Cannot believe what just passed!
He's mine for the takin'
I am happy at last
Maybe I dreams
But he seems
Golden as a crown
A sleepin' bee
Done told me
I will walk with my feet off the ground
When my one true love, I has found!
