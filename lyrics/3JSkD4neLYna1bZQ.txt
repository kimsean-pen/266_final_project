You believe in me
I believe in you
How come that you don't believe in us?

You believe in me
I believe in you
How come that you don't believe in us?

It started out quite badly
It only got worse
She said that it depended on what's mine
But I know it depended on what's hers

It could have been perfect
I guess you thought it was
You didn't understood what was wrong
'Til I told you it wasn't worth the cost

Oh darling, please
You believe in me
I believe in you
How come that you don't believe in us?

You believe in me
I believe in you
How come that you don't believe in us?

I thought it would be easy
To break up with you
But now when we've reached this certain point
I'm no longer sure how to do

Of course you won't be sorry
You've always said you're bored
It's better if it ends right here and now
Or maybe it'll end up in the morgue

Oh darling, please
You believe in me
I believe in you
How come that you don't believe in us?

You believe in me
I believe in you
How come that you don't believe in us?

Oh darling, please
You believe in me
I believe in you
How come that you don't believe in us?

You believe in me
I believe in you
How come that you don't believe in us?

You believe in me
I believe in you
How come that you don't believe in us?

You believe in me
I believe in you
How come that you don't believe in us?
