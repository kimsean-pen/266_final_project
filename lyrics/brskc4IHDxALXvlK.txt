Woke up today in casts of blue
Unheld but stay pretending we'll get better over time
The bars and chains are old but new
I got away, still under you

Ah ah ahh
Ah ah ahh
Ah uh uh ahh
Ah uuh

Fell on my way to get it through
Collect the days to bend things, so it's better over time
Hung up on all the shades and hues
Always the same, still under you

So please don't make more promises to me
And please don't take everything from me
And I will breathe in every word you mean
If you could please promise them to me

Ah ah ahh
Ah ah ahh
Ah uh uh ahh
Ah uuh

Ah ah ah
Ah ah

So please don't make more promises to me
And please don't take everything from me
And I will breathe in every word you mean
If you could please promise them to me

Ah ah ahh
Ah ah ahh
Ah uh uh ahh
Ah uuh

Eeeyaaah!!

So please don't make more promises to me
And please don't take everything from me
And I will breathe in every word you mean
If you could please promise them to me
