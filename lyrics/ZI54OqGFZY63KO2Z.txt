One two three four give me more
'Cause I think we're going down
What you need it for?
Pass the wealth around
We're going right back to the borderline
Now you should save yourself
I'm on my own
No use to no one else

'Cause I--every time I think I'm fine
You keep on dreaming up
A hundred different ways to cause hysteria
Am I insane, am I blind?
I just can't seem to trust
Too many regulations coming back at you

We're running out
Of money
Of love
Of luck
We're running out
Of language
Of fame
Of bread
We're running out

Something tells me that I'm fine
But when I get enough
Another one--wouldn't be too much
And still I chew it up and spit it out
It's too big to swallow
Got enough for everyone
So here we go

Ooh, let's see how far that we have run
before this gig is over
I hear the warning sign
On everybody's stereo
Do you love, what you like
What would you do for more?
You kept on dancing underneath the burning floor

We're running out
Of money
Of each other
Of confidence
We're running out
Of drugs
Of patience
Of air
We're running out

We're running out
Of money
Of love
Of luck
We're running out
Of fame
Of language
Of bread
We're running out
Of money
Of each other
Of confidence
We're running out
Of dugs
Of patience
Of air
We're running out
