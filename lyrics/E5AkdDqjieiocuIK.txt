The grass wasn't green enough here
After watering it with my tears
I'm not sure where you went
Now we are, just past tense
The snakes, they are slithering in
Chasing me to my end
I can't say where that is
I'm running again

Oh, when I get there
It won't be far enough
I'm a renegade
It's in my blood
If ever I get there
It won't be fast enough
I'm a renegade
I always was

Well, your spark never lit up the fire
Though we tried and tried and tried
The wind came through your lungs
A hurricane from your tongue
I'll keep your secrets with me
Right behind my teeth
The anger, the anchor
I'll sail much further on
Ah, ah, on

Oh, when I get there
it won't be far enough
I'm a renegade
It's in my blood
If ever I get there
It won't be fast enough
I'm a renegade
I always was

I'll keep running
I'll keep running again
keep running
I'll keep running
running, running
Keep running, running
running

Oh, when I get there
it won't be far enough
I'm a renegade
It's in my blood
If ever I get there
It won't be fast enough
I'm a renegade
It's in my blood

I'm a renegade
I always was
