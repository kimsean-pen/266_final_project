Hey dear
I fear
I'll watch you disappear
I know
You'll go
Until you're skin and bones
Your reflection's all you're worth

This time it's almost over
I'll watch you turn to dust
I know it's not much longer
Until you faint
'Cause you'll never love yourself at all
'Cause everything you touch will fall to pieces
This time it's almost over now

Wake up skin and bones (Wake up)
Wake up skin and bones (Wake up)

You're so alone
Your sickness feels like home
Find some control
Starve 'til you're beautiful

Your reflection's all your worth

This time it's almost over
I watch you turn to dust
I know it's not much longer
Until you faint
'Cause you'll never love yourself at all
'Cause everything you touch will fall to pieces
This time it's almost over

Until you're skin and bones

Your sickness feels like home
(Your sickness feels like)
Your sickness feels like
Home...

This time it's almost over
I'll watch you turn to dust
I know it's not much longer
Until you faint
'Cause you'll never love yourself at all
'Cause everything you touch will fall to pieces
This time it's almost over
