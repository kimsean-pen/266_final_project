It's been a while since we crossed paths
I thought I saw you in an hourglass
I'm not sure where the time is gone
But I know it's been too long
We used to say we'd never change
Now we're trying not to show our age
I know, you said you needed space
So, you moved all the furniture around this place

Ooooh, I hate this feeling
You don't feel like home
Ooooh, I hate this feeling
You don't feel like home

It's getting dark in sunset park
I see the marks on your broken heart
I'm trying not to let it get to me
But it's hard with all our history
Leaving town while the city sleeps
You know, I always had bigger dreams
I keep looking in the rear-view mirror
You know, I wasn't happy here

Oh, I hate this feeling
You don't feel like home
Oh, I hate this feeling
You don't feel like home

And now I'm running to you, trying to find myself
But I don't even know where to start
I can't sit tight as I wait, I've keeping nothing the same
'Cause I don't even know who you are

Oh, I hate this feeling
You don't feel like home
Oh, I hate this feeling
You don't feel like home
Oh, I hate this feeling
You don't feel like home
Oh, I hate this feeling
You don't feel like home
Feel like home
