There they're clean as a whistle
Smellin' like a rose
She's got some dirty little fingers
Bloodshot eyes are gone
Tell me I'm wrong
Twice as hard fought
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
Twice as hard fought
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
And no one will ever wanna know
Love ain't funny
A crime in the wink of an eye

Oh yeah
Your sister always sayin'
She plays a step child
A broken little memory
Her heart was never kind
Tell me I'm blind
Twice as hard fought
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
Twice as hard fought
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
And no one'll ever wanna know
Love ain't funny
Crime in the wink of an eye

Yeah, bloodshot eyes are gone
Tell me I'm wrong
Twice as hard fought
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
Twice as hard fought
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
Twice as hard fought
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
Twice as hard fought
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
