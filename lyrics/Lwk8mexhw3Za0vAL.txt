Speak of the devil and she appears
Heat up the kettle
Dishevel her freckles
Wrestle up another beer
Pick up my medals
Her meadows got me head over heels
Rip up this treble
I bet he'll send over seven deals
Never let money limit me
Honey got stunning symmetry
Hop in and out of limousines
Pop in an "M" and pity me
In the city we
Sitting pretty kitty B
I ain't even kidding, G
Living like a legacy

Body like a weapon
Smoking Smith and Wesson in my hand
All night
I might pull her trigger one more time
Just to feel her come alive

Caught in the valley
Singing to Alice
She's got a long way to go
She got a long way to go
So call up the valet
She lives in a palace
We got a long way to go
We got a long way, long way, long way
I know you say you're
I know you say you're all alone
But I don't want to know

She got a body like a weapon
Smoking Smith and Wesson in my hand
All night
I might pull her trigger one more time
Just to feel her come alive
