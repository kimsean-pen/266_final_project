We would not be so scared of losing hair and slowing down
If we knew that our hearts are not aging
Our little hearts are born already ancient

We would not be so scared to say I do and settle down
If we knew that our hearts never go dating
They stay at home for us patiently waiting

We would not be so scared of meeting love and lying down
If we knew that mountains would be unveiling

We would not be so scared of being swallowed by the ground
If we knew that greater bodies still were waiting
Dotted lines in the air tomorrow morning
