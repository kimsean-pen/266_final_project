Ain't no price, feed yourself twice
It'll keep you all on your own
It's the first time I've been higher than you
It'll lead you to that familiar place, oh

It's been a long time coming, it'll be alright
A young boy died turning on the light
Did you hear and did you ever see him go
He's going home but he's still on his own
It's been a long time coming, will it be alright
A young boy died turning on the light
Did you hear and did you ever see him go
He's going home but he's still on his own

It's been a long time coming,
it'll be alright (Ain't no price, feed yourself twice)
