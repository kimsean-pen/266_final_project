You cannot protect
That which you cannot control
I lit a candle for you
But somebody blew it out
He comes to me in my dreams
And tells me that he's all right
That he's just been hiding out
Somewhere there is no light
Aw, yeah
That'd be nice
And if you took it back
I wouldn't feel so uncertain
I wouldn't feel so uncertain
That when your body hit the earth
It opened up and swallowed you
She kept you safe in her heart's center
And always tucked you in at night
When you woke up nervous
She said, "Baby, you're inside of me
You're safe inside my orange womb
There's no reason to worry."
They bought him magnets
To form into different shapes
Small spheres of metal
Always carefully composed
He's making hexagons
He's making perfect squares
He's making triangles
He's making cylinders
And in the junk yard
Above the robot screams
They gave him orders
I'd rather drown in dreams
No, I ain't letting down
And how'd you keep a spouse
And he dies slowly
His blood is thinnin' out
Things slip sometimes
Things slip sometimes
Things slip sometimes
