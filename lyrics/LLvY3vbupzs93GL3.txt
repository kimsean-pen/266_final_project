Yeah, c'mon Bad Boy Baby
This is the remix
Haha, you know how we do
Dream: no no no no no non onmh
Lets go baby c'mon
Oh boy I'm not the one
Who broke your heart before
(Yeah)
And I don't wanna
Make you hurt anymore
She had you pulling out
Your hair against the wall
But baby that's not me at all
Whoa whoa whoa whoa

You gotta see
Were different as can be
She and I are not alike
(Not alike)
So don't compare her to me
(Oh yeah)
It doesn't matter
What happened then
(Happened then)
In me you have
A friend for life
(For life)
You should know that
That was her and baby this is me

You get so nervous everytime
I touch your hand
(This is the remix)
I'm not the others
Who just took
Your heart and ran
(Let's go)
But everytime you say
Those things
You make me feel so bad
Why can't you just
Give me a chance
(Yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You gotta see
Were different as can be
(We're two different people)
She and I are not alike
So don't compare her to me
(This is me, this is me)
It doesn't matter
What happened then
(Doesn't matter that was then)
In me you have a friend for life
(Friends for life)
You should know that
(Baby)
That was her and
Baby this is me

(Kain:)
Now understand
When I met you
It was love at first site
Deep thoughts and
Talks the first night
Tell her all how my past hurt life
Comparing you to her
Waiting for our first fight
Because she said the
Same things that you say
And how love is only
A game that fools play
All night with her
Friends every Tuesday
That's why I bought you
A cell and a two-way
I know it's wrong and
It makes you nauseous
But I'm not suspicious
I'm cautious
And you know I want
To love and trust you
But it's really a lot
To try and adjust to
And I'm glad that
You're on my team
Defending when you're man
When I fall on a scheme
Baby you can have all my cream
It was a nightmare
Now it's all a dream

Boy you had your share
You had your share
Of people taking you
For granted
I know that you
Can't stand it no more
I will be there
(La, la, la, la, la, la)
When things aren't going
The way you planned it
(La, la, la, la, la, la)
Don't be afraid to let go
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

You gotta see
Were different as can be
(No, no, no, no)
She and I are not alike
So don't compare her to me
(Don't compare her to me)
It doesn't matter
What happened then
(It won't repeat again)
In me you have a friend for life
(I'll always be
Your friend, forever)
You should know that
That was her and
Baby this is me
