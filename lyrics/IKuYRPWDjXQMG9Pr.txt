When the angels take the angel voice away
Some lower their eyes, some of us shout cheats

Cheating on the deal, pulling off the sting
Tuning up the harps, dishing out the wings

If they can dance on, on the head of a pin
Don't that tell you something about their skin
Hard faced, little bastards

When the angels take the angel voice away
Jealously they see, the sometimes man you'd be

Must get so blaze, knowing you'll never die
Lounging on a cloud, polishing the sky
The memories are blue, but borrowed for the day
They sit around ignored, till someone goes away

If they can dance on, on the head of a pin
Don't that tell you something about their skin
Hard faced little bastards

When the angels take the angel voice away
Jealously they see, the sometimes man you'd be

The memories are blue but borrowed for the day
They sit around ignored, till someone goes away
For cheating on the deal, pulling off the sting
Tuning up the harps, dishing out the wings

If they can dance on, on the head of a pin
Don't that tell you something about their skin
Hard faced little bastards

When the angels take the angel voice away
Jealously they see, the sometimes man you'd be
When the angels take the angel voice away
Jealously they see, the sometimes man you'd be
When the angels take the angel voice away
Jealously they see, the sometimes man you'd be
When the angels take the angel voice away
Jealously they see, the sometimes man you'd be
When the angels take the angel voice away
Jealously they see, the sometimes man you'd be
