There's no symmetry left between you and me
It's hard to remember where your eyes used to be
In the dark and in between

Tell me I need some more water
From here it feels so much farther
I just want to grow smaller
Tell me I need some more water

There's a curve in your widow's peak I've never even seen before
And it's okay to walk as fast as you can when you're alone

This weakness it rots me
Wild
And it's something I thought I had heard you say
A while ago
But this weakness it does rot me
Wild
And it's something that takes
A while

Tell me I need some more water
From here it feels so much smaller
I just want to grow farther
I just need some more water
