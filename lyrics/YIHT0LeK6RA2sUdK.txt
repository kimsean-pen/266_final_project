Systematic, you're insane
You're just like a problem that never ends
Take all the sunshine and give it away
Did you get what you paid for?

I'm in love 'cause I wanna be lonely
I'm in love 'cause I wanna be lonely
I'm in love 'cause I wanna be lonely
I'm in love 'cause I wanna be lonely
So what's my problem?

I cut you loose and let it go
I'm keeping it simple
A broken switch is turning me on
It's all very simple
Systematic, you're insane
You're just like a problem that never ends
Take all the sunshine, take all the rain
It's never my problem

I'm in love 'cause I wanna be lonely
I'm in love 'cause I wanna be lonely
I'm in love 'cause I wanna be lonely
I'm in love 'cause I wanna be lonely
So what's my problem?
So what's my problem?
So what's my problem?
So what's my problem?
Yeah, what's my problem?
