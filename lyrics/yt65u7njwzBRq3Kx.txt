I was living day to day
As the meetings they would suggest
Sitting pretty having one foot out that door
No, I didn't know how to act
Started running and I didn't look back
Still feel the same way
Still don't know where I'm going
Oh, then you let me in
I don't know how you did it other than you did
Cut your wrist and come get you some
It only works if you don't look down
Bought the ticket, now you're on the track
You can keep it but you can't look back
You can keep it but you can't look back
You can keep it but you can't look back
You can keep it but you can't look back

I didn't know what I was looking for
And come to think I wasn't looking at all
I'm not the same man, not since you came in
I'm going to get you if it takes me all night long
I'm going to get you if it takes me all night long
I'm going to get you if it takes me all night long
I'm going to get you if it takes me all night long
I'm not the same man, not since you came in
I'm going to get you if it take me all night
I'm going to get you if it takes me all night long

I was nearly four states away
Mamma calling from the other end
Someday a woman's gonna need you most the time
Lord, I didn't know how to act
I started running and I didn't look back
Still feel the same way
Still don't know where I'm going
But now I'm in it until the bitter end
You're gonna do me then you do me like that
Cut your wrist and said come get you some
It only works if you don't look down
Bought the ticket, now you're on the track
You can keep it but you can't look back
You can keep it but you can't look back
You can keep it but you can't look back
You can keep it but you can't look back

I didn't know what I was looking for (can't look back)
And come to think I wasn't looking at all (can't look back)
I'm not the same man, not since you came in
I'm going to get you if it takes me all night long
I'm going to get you if it takes me all night long

I'm going to get you if it takes me all night
I'm going to get you if it takes me all night long
I'm going to get you if it takes me all night long

Started runnin' in
You cut your wrist
You let me in

Don't know how you did it other than you did
I was there beside myself in my own skin
Unfamiliar, I tried it on and liked the fit
I don't know how you did it other than you did
I'm going to get you if it takes me all night long
I don't know how you did it other than you did
I was there beside myself in my own skin
Unfamiliar, I tried it on and liked the fit
I don't know how you did it other than you did
Don't know how you did it other than you did
I was there beside myself in my own skin
Unfamiliar, I tried it on and liked the fit
I don't know how you did it other than you did
Don't know how you did it other than you did
