I feel nothing.

Look into my eyes
So vicious
Heels on high
So infectious
Social sickness
Glitter and kisses

I will make you mine
Malicious
Take you from behind
So vivid
The lower you fall, the higher you'll climb
Prepare the flash and let me die

Microphones and ice cream cones
Drippin' down my collar bones
Taste a piece of my bubble gum
Everybody wants some (yum yum)

I like this.

Read between the lines
You'll see it
Cutting like a knife
You'll feel it
The lower you fall, the higher you'll climb
Intoxicate and let me fly

Microphones and ice cream cones
Drippin' down my collar bones
Taste a piece of my bubble gum
Everybody wants some (yum yum)

Poster child party girl
Miss boombox make me swirl

Microphones and ice cream cones
Drippin' down my collar bones
Taste a piece of my bubble gum
Everybody wants some (yum yum)
