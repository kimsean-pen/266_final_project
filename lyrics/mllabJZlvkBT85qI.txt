Three rings to elven kings
Under the sky, seven for the dwarf lords
in halls of stone
Nine for mortal men
doomed to die
One for the Dark Lord
on his dark throne

In the land
Of Mordor where the shadows lie
One Ring to rule them all
One Ring to find them
One Ring to bring them all
And in darkness bind them
In the land of Mordor
where shadows lie

One Ring to bring them all
And in darkness bind them
In the land
of Mordor
where the shadows lie
