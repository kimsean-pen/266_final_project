You know this boogie is for real
I used to put my faith in worship
But then my chance to get to heaven slipped
I used to worry about the future
But then I threw my caution to the wind
I had no reason to be care free, no, no, no
Until I took a trip to the other side of town, yeah, yeah, yeah
You know I heard that boogie rhythm, hey
I had no choice but to get down, down, down, down
Dance, nothing left for me to do but dance
Off these bad times I'm going through just dance
Got canned heat in my heels tonight, baby
I feel the thunder, see the lightning
I know this anger's heaven sent
So I've got to hang out all my hang-ups
Because of the boogie I feel so hell bent, hey, hey
It's just an instant gut reaction, that I got
I know I never ever felt like this before
I don't know what to do but then that's nothing new
Stuck between hell and high water I need a cure to make it through
Hey Dance (yeah) nothing left for me to do but dance
Off these bad times I'm going through just dance
Hey, got canned heat in my heels tonight, baby
You know I've got canned heat up my heels
You know this boogie is for real
Only the wind can blow the answer
And she cries to me when I'm asleep
She says you know that you can go much faster
I know that peoples talk can be so cheap, hey
I got this voodoo child in veined on me
I'm gonna use my power to ascend
You know I got these running heels to use
Sometimes there's no way I lose, I was born to run and built to last
You've never seen my feet 'cause they move so fast
Dance yeah, hey nothing left for me to do but dance
Off these bad times I'm going through just dance, hey
Got canned heat in my heels tonight, baby
Dance
