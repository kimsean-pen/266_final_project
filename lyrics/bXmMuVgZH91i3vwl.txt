I walk around these empty streets
They say there's nothing left to meet
I say there's no one here for you

Down in the land, the land of the blind
The one eyed king, he stole my mind
And I let him

Everything I like's illegal, seductive
Addictive in my world, corrosive, destructive
But I've got kind words in my heart. It's a passion
It's fashion, only fashion

Tonight I'm hunting for you
Tonight I'm hunting for you
Tonight I'm hunting for...

The stone is set, the dye is cast
I am the record, you're my past
And I am not afraid to ask

I sail away my sanity just to find some company
Now darling
Everything I like's illegal, seductive
Addictive in my world, corrosive, destructive
Your addiction to danger makes me no stranger
It's fashion, only fashion

Tonight I'm hunting for you
Tonight I'm hunting for you
Tonight I'm hunting for you
Tonight I'm hunting for...

I'll be gone but I won't be cheap
There is no limit here for me
And I'll take everything I need
I'll need everything, everything

You can waste away in fashion
When you chase the daylight whole
You can waste away in fashion
When you chase the daylight whole

Tonight I'm hunting for you
Tonight I'm hunting for you
Tonight I'm hunting for you
Tonight I'm hunting for you
Tonight I'm hunting for...

You can waste away in fashion
(Tonight I'm hunting for you)
Tonight I'm hunting for you
When you chase the daylight whole
(Tonight I'm hunting for you)
Tonight I'm hunting for you
