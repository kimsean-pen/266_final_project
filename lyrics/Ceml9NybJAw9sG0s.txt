I am dissenting, I'm looking differently
I do whatever I please, exactly what I want to be
I don't fit into general rules
Ignore them all the time

Breakin' the rules, gonna take my share
Live my own life, I don't care
I don't fit into general rules
Ignore them all the time

United we stand – Eternal ban
Together we are strong – Eternal ban

Long-haired crowd is going their own way
They are invincible if together they stand
I don't fit into general rules
Ignore them all the time

United we stand – Eternal ban
Together we are strong – Eternal ban

United we stand – Eternal ban
Together we are strong – Eternal ban

United we stand – Eternal ban
Together we are strong – Eternal ban
United we stand – Eternal ban
Together we are strong – Eternal ban
