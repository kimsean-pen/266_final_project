In this life, in this life, in this life
In this oh sweet life
We're coming in from the cold
We're coming in, coming in, coming in
Coming in from the cold

It's you, it's you, it's you I'm talking to
Well you, it's you, it's you
It's you I'm talking to now
Why do you look so sad and foresaken
When one door is closed
Don't you know another is open

Would you let the system
Make you kill your brotherman
No dread no
Would you make the system
Make you kill your brotherman
No dread no
Would you make the system
Get on top of your head again
No dread no
Well the biggest man you ever
Did see was just a baby

In this life, in this life
In this oh sweet life
We're coming in from the cold
We're coming in, coming in, coming in
We're coming in from the cold
It's life, it's life, it's life
Coming in from the cold
We're coming in, coming in, coming in
Coming in from the cold

It's you, it's you, it's you I'm talking to
Well you, it's you, it's you
It's you I'm talking to now
Why do you look so sad and foresaken
Don't you know
When one door is closed
Don't you know many more is open

Would you let the system
No dread no
Would you let the system
Get on top of your head
No dread no
Would you let the system
Make you kill your brotherman
No dread no
The biggest man you ever
Did see was once a baby

In this life, in this life, in this life
In this oh sweet life
We're coming in from the cold
We're coming in, coming in, coming in
Coming in from the cold
We're coming in, coming in, coming in
