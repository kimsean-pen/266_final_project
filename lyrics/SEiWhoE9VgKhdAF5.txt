I can love a man dead
I can love a man dead
She can love a man dead
She can love a man dead

There is a dark horse living in my hood
I'm sure you've walked past him changing your mood
He is a slow worker, down in every detail
He is a chameleon always blending in

That's what his girls are - fuel on his engine
A carnivore, hate him like you never loved someone before
Makes his shadow soak up your sunshine
He will get you in his car and then he locks the door

No need, no need to run
Throw in the towels, drop your gun
My heart is my only weapon
I can love a man dead
No need, no need to hide
Throw in the towels, stop the fight
My heart is my only weapon
I can love a man dead

I can love a man dead
I can love a man dead
She can love a man dead
She can love a man dead

Now he is scouting walking round the block
What kinda sad people, people do that
He had a baby sister
Didn't know much about her
But the way you look at him
Makes him feel she is living

Now he's a stray dog
I'm the bone who can make him feel at home
A loner, doesn't know what it means when you say no
Tears taught him everything you love, you will lose
He is making up his truth in a web of disillusions

We were taught and raised to believe that man is kind
But love has many faces and some of them are blind

We're born, we're raised to believe
Human is kind
We're young, we're free to believe
Strong in our minds
