So, here I stare
At an empty bottle full of confidence
Fuzzy faded with the poison in my head
It's an empty glass philosophy
I can't help it, I can't stop

Dead, I'm a zombie with no notion of regret
Grab a bucket and a mop cause I'm a mess
Full of sexual ferocity
I can't help it, I can't stop it

I'm living fast until I'm dead
It's in my head and singing

Because I'm on a permanent vacation
We're young, we're young
We're dumb and we don't care
And I don't owe an explanation
We're young, we're young
We're dumb and we don't care, no

Forever stuck in our youth
Forever stuck in our youth

My liver hates my guts
Because I'm stuck on living in a daze

Bottom shelf tequila coursing through my veins
Giddy, greedy, grin upon my face
I can't help it, I can't stop
And so I drank
My cells away until I'm in one, and I think

About how no one would believe it, so I sing
A song about my rowdy rebel ways
I can't help it, I can't stop
We're young, we're dumb, and having fun

We're young, we're dumb, just turn it up
We're young, we're dumb, and having fun
Don't make me tell you twice
Baby, that's why I'm on a permanent vacation
We're young, we're young
We're dumb and we don't care, no

And I don't owe an explanation
We're young, we're young
We're dumb and we don't care, no
Forever stuck in our youth
Forever stuck in our youth
We're young, we're dumb
And havin' fun, we're young
We're dumb just turn it up
We're young, we're dumb and havin' fun
And we'll be forever stuck in our youth.
Forever stuck in our youth.
I'm on a permanent vacation
We're young, we're young
We're dumb and we don't care, no
And I don't owe an explanation
We're young, we're young
We're dumb and we don't care, no
Forever stuck in our youth.
Forever stuck in our youth
