Strolling along minding my own buisness
Well there goes a girl and a half
She's got me going up and down
She's got me going up and down
Walking on the beaches looking at the peaches
Well I got the notion girl that you got some suntan lotion in that bottle of yours
Spread it all over my peelin' skin baby
That feels real good
All this skirt lappin' up the sun
Lap me up
Why don't you come on and
Lap me up
Walking on the beaches looking at the peaches
Well there goes another one just lying down on the sand dunes
I'd better go take a swim and see if I can cool down a little bit
Coz you and me woman
We got a lotta things on our minds (you know what I mean)
Walking on the beaches looking at the peaches
Will you just take a look over there (where?) there
Is she tryin' to get outta that clitares?
Liberation for women
That's what I preach
Preacher man
Walking on the beaches looking at the peaches
Oh shit
There goes the charabang
Looks like im gonna be stuck here the whole summer
Well what a bummer
I can think of a lot worse places to be
Like down in the streets
Or down in the sewer
Or even on the end of a skewer
Down on the beaches, just look at all the peaches
Down on the beaches, just look at all the brown bodies
Down on the beaches, just look at all the sunglasses
Down on the beaches, just look at all the peaches
Down on the beaches, just look at all the peaches
Down on the beaches, just look at all the peaches
Down on the beaches
A load of "mms"
