You know that I love you
and I know that you can love me to
but you can't be unfaithful
and you sure can't be untrue
There's no need to begging please
you never belonged to me
and it hurts me so much
it hurts me so much
hurts me so much
it hurts me so much
I try to be stronger (I want to)
wish my heart right out of the way
can't take it much longer
This game is getting hard to play
there's no need to begging please
you never belonged to me
and it hurts me so much
it hurts me so much
hurts me so much
it hurts me so much
Said I want you
and I need you, I want you,
but I can't have you
Said I want you
there's no need to begging please
you never belonged to me
and it hurts me so much
it hurts me so much
hurts me so much
it hurts me so much
