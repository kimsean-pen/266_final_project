I remember you and me
Before we knew our destiny
Never walked the road before
Though you long to search for more
We put everything aside
With our futures on the line
I could say it's 'cause of you
You showed the dream we walked into
I saw the danger on the way
But with you it seemed okay
'Cause when the evening comes
We're like fire in the rain
When the nights begun
My desire heals the pain
And the dreams we share
They are never gonna fade
It's because of love we're standing here today
We're like fire in the rain
Like fire in the rain
I remember every night
I gave my hope you gave your life
We could mend our every scar
Just by looking at the stars
In my mirror I saw you
Everything I need to see
The reflection set me free
'Cause when the evening comes
We're like fire in the rain
When the nights begun
My desire heals the pain
And the dreams we share
They are never gonna fade
It's because of love we're standing here today
We're like fire in the rain
Like fire in the rain
Like fire in the rain
Like fire in the rain
When the evening comes
We're like fire in the rain
When the nights begun
My desire heals the pain
And the dreams we share
They are never gonna fade
It's because of love we're standing here today
'Cause when the evening comes
We're like fire in the rain
When the nights begun
My desire heals the pain
And the dreams we share
They are never gonna fade
It's because of love we're standing here today
We're like fire in the rain
Like fire in the rain
Like fire in the rain
Like fire in the rain
