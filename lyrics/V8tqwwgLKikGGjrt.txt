I'm sick and sick and sick of every step that I take, well you can't fool forever anyway.
Our rainy days slither, slither, slither away, like a slug in the salt breeze, so please.
Mr. postman deliver me, to the beach.

Bermuda! Bahamas! Key Largo! Montego!

Simple clouds, simple clouds, any day. Decompose and swept away.
I wanna see the first sunset on color TV, myself walk into the center screen.

Bermuda! Bahamas! Key Largo! Montego!
