I'm tired
I can't believe that you will die
So tired
My eyes are closed you said goodbye

Why couldn't you leave me be
Why couldn't you leave it be
Why couldn't we leave it be
I watched you slowly slip away

Why did you leave in the night
Played God so long
Played God so long
Played God for so long
I never wanted to fight
Played God so long
Been gone for so long
Why did you leave in the night

You were tired
Closed the door turned out the light
So tired
My eyes were closed you said goodnight

Why couldn't you leave me be
Why couldn't you leave it be
Why couldn't we leave it be
I watched you slowly slip away

Why did you leave in the night
Played God for so long
Played God so long
Played God for so long
I never wanted to fight
Played God so long
Been gone for so long
Why did you leave in the night

Why did you leave in the night
Played God for so long
Played God so long
Played God for so long
I never wanted to fight
Played God so long
Been gone for so long
Why did you leave in the night
