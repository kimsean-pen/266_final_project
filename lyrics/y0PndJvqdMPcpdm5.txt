What happened to me?
Felt like I had everything
Such a big catastrophe, but I had to deal with the struggle
It all began passing life so easily
Ready for almost anything, but it took a different direction

Then, one night, sharp turns
A light came from nowhere

Blown away
Never felt my injuries
Bleeding deep inside of me
Just knew I had to help all those people

Lost
My mind
It's gone
That life
Lost
I've been looking for myself
It haunts me everyday
I'm searching for a truth no longer there

Transformed I'm someone else
Must face my phantom self
Transformed I'm someone else
Must face my phantom self

It's a mystery
Changed my body's chemistry
Always creeping up on me
Wiped out my whole soul of existence

The crash
Flashbacks
Carnage
The blood keeps on flowing

Killing me
Trapped inside this tragedy
Can't see the road in front of me
Replay this nightmare over and over

Lost
I've been looking for myself
It haunts me everyday
I'm searching for a truth no longer there

Transformed I'm someone else
Must face my phantom self
Transformed I'm someone else
I'll face my phantom self

Lost
I've been looking for myself
It haunts me everyday
I'm searching for a truth no longer there

Transformed I'm someone else
Must face my phantom self
Transformed I'm someone else
I'll face my phantom self
