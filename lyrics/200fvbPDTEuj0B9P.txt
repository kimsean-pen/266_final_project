I gave my hand for you to hold,
I gave my love that you went and sold,
Exchanged our song for another
Can't blame, this dead flame that once glowed like no other.

How do you soften the thought of carrying coffins?
We were so alive, only to see us wither and die.

You said you'd stand even if this Would all fall
You're yearning, yeilded, when you hit the wall
I shook your ears tried to make you hear my call
But your were long gone no hope in this sunless dawn.

How do you soften the thought of carrying coffins?
We were so alive, only to see us wither and die
Woah-aoh-ohhhh
Why must soil run dry?

And I never ever thought I'd hear these words be said,
Now I lay here in an unmade bed
Empty stomach unable to be fed,
Your ego swallowed and from there you fled.
So far away could not find your way back
Walked down the path, wet feed slip through the cracks
Wet feet slip through the cracks,
Could not find your way back,
Wet feet slip through the cracks,
Could not find your way back.

How do you soften the thought of carrying coffins?
We were so alive only to see us wither and die.
Woah-aoh-ohhhh
Why must soil run dry
