You waited for me
When I was strong
You never called
You waited long
Now I come back
To sleep with you
You love me still
I love you, too

You kept the house
I could not keep
You kissed good night
And went to sleep
Now I come back
To sleep with you
You love me still
I love you, too

Come with me
To that room by the sea
With the view of the moon of Los Angeles
You're beautiful back then
God, you're beautiful now
Come with me

Yeah, I was strong
I had no choice
The kids grew up
And left the house
Bur I come back
To sleep with you
You love me still
I love you, too
