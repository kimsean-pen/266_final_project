To bear it down, to be in flight, to bear it down, to be in flight
It wasn't about me, it was only a stone, in my shoe
Then worries came to perch on us, impatience and our painted bus
I kept you close to me, close to my ear

We set out once with folded shirts with hairy chests and well-rehearsed
I want it all, I want it all for myself
I'll set it right between your eyes, your shoulder blade, your running life
I want it all, I want it all for myself

Improving all, the time I am, improving as I kissed the hem
I promise I won't be a trouble at all
For I'm okay, I'm in the red, impressions of the unmade bed
You cradle close to me, close to my ear

We set out once, forget our shirts with hairy chests and all new words
I want it all, I want it all for myself
For in the earth, I smell of you, a bathing boy, amazing view
I want it all, I want it all for myself
