Hey, Get up, Get loud
Start Pumpin' up the party now

It's the same old, same grind
but we don't feel a we're wasting time
Not so bored that we can't find
A better way
My friends, my kind
No one's getting left behind
If they did it'd be a crime
That's why we say
Let the music start a revolution
No time to play it safe

Hey, Get up, Get loud
Start Pumpin' up the party now
Hey, Get up, Get loud
Start Pumpin' up the party now

They can't, we can
Parents might not understand
Havin' fun without a plan
but that's what we do
We're all here, Let's go!
Gotta make this party grow.
Together we can make it blow
Right trough the roof
The music's gonna start a revolution
Too late to play it safe

Hey, Get up, Get loud
Start Pumpin' up the party now
Hey, Get up, Get loud
Start Pumpin' up the party now

We don't have to paint by numbers
Let our voice come out from under
Hear it rise, feel the thunder
It's time to lose control!

Hey, Get up, Get loud
Start Pumpin' up the party now
Hey, Get up, Get loud
Start Pumpin' up the party now
