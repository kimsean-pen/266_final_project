You have tried
You are ripped up
But nothing has changed
They have told you
You will be lucky
But nothing has changed

I can't wait to set it off
And it will be the end finally
I'm gonna lie back down
And ask for nothing, nothing
I'm gonna throw it back
And let it, let it go

Though I'm not concerned
For this is how it goes
I am ill
But it doesn't hurt

I get up get up
But my day is ruined again
I get up get up
But the day is ruined again

You can run
But what's the point
They won't catch you
You can love
But to what end
They won't leave you

I'm gonna lie back down
And ask for nothing, nothing
I'm gonna throw it back
And let it, let it go

I get up get up
But my day is ruined again
I get up get up
But the day is ruined again

Yesterday was awful
Today's discolored
