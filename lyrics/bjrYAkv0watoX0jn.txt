I have been looking for a breath to feel
I have been searching for a way out of here
Every day I fight for myself
I have lost so much long the way
Every morning I wake up alone
Missing the feeling of home
Missing the feeling of home
Been wandering through the evergreen
Been following my dream
Been wandering through the evergreen
Still following my dream
Following myyyyy
(Drop)
Been wandering through the evergreen
Been following my dream
Been wandering through the evergreen
Still following my dream
Following myyyyy
(Build Up) Through the ever
