I saw you there, so beautiful
You stopped and stared, so magical
Then you asked me for my name
And we took an uptown train
Before you leave, get up to go
I wanna know

Do you like Shakespeare, Jeff Buckley
Watching movies on Sunday?
Do you like kissing when it's raining
Making faces in the station?
Do you like, I need to know
What do you like, before you go?

You walk me home, so wonderful
It starts to snow, it's incredible
Now we're walking up my street
And you slowly turn to me
You're three inches from my lips
But before we do this

Do you like Shakespeare, Jeff Buckley
Watching movies on Sunday?
Do you like kissing when it's raining
Making faces in the station?
Do you like, I need to know
What do you like, before you go?
Oh, oh

Show me the place where you come from
And the places you dream of
I wanna know everything you are
But before we get that far

What do you like?
I need to know
What do you like before you go?

Do you like Shakespeare, Jeff Buckley
Watching movies on Sunday?
Do you like kissing when it's raining
Making faces in the station?
'Cause I like Shakespeare, Jeff Buckley
Watching movies on Sunday
Kissing when it's raining
Making faces in the station
What do you like?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
