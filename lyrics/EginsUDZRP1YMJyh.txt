We said our Good-byes
(Oh, The Night Before)
Love was in your eyes
(Oh, The Night Before)
Now today I find
You have changed your mind
Treat me like you did The Night Before

Were you telling lies?
(Oh, The Night Before)
Was I so unwise?
(Oh, The Night Before)
When I held you near
You were so sincere
Treat me like you did The Night Before

Last night is the night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did
It makes me wanna cry
