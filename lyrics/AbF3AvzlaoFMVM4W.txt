I've been changing faces
Watching my time cave in slow
I stay in town, never come around
But suddenly there's pain and joy from laughter
Holding off from what is cruel
I lay around, never come around
But suddenly there's you
But suddenly there's you

Hiding myself under shades of constant swirls of blue
I stayed in town, never came around
And suddenly there's pain and joy from laughter
Holding off from what is cruel
Thought i hurt myself, thought of no one else
But suddenly there's you
But suddenly there's you
