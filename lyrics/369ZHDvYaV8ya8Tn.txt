I'm joining a cult, joining a cult, joining a cult
Cut off my hair, clean out my head, fill me with song
Scrap obstructed eyes
Leave my friends behind

Say I'm free, say I'm free, say I'm free and I am
Say I'm free, say I'm free, say I'm free and I am

Reverse the poles on the magnet
Pierce the armor of habit

I'm joining a cult, joining a cult, joining a cult
Cut off my hair, clean out my head, fill me with song
Willing to surrender to persist
Empty stare and dumb shit eating grin

Teach me to breathe, don't let me think
Break me in half, teach me to breed, don't let me think
Teach me to breathe, don't let me think
Wipe out my past, break me in half

We're gonna get carried away
We're gonna get carried away
We're gonna get carried away

New clothes! New home!
New job! New God!
From faith to doubt
I'm hardwired to short-out
From parts unknown
To streets paved in gold

Left on the rooftop
Token in hand
I'm stuck here in neutral
I don't understand

Drink up
Drink up
Drink up
Drink up
Drink up

Teach me to breathe, don't let me think
Wipe out my past, break me in half

I'm joining a cult, joining a cult, joining a cult
