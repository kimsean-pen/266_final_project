I had a thought running through my head
Now you're gone, I don't remember it
I had the life and then I see you
Now our love is all see-through
So, no worries, no worries, no worries now
'Cause love just comes and goes
No worries, no worries
I swear like a sailor, sailor from my bad behavior

And if you come and go it won't matter anymore
It won't matter anymore, no
And if you can't stay slow, I'll be waiting at the door
I'll be waiting at the door, oh
And if you come and go it won't matter anymore
It won't matter anymore, no
And if you can't stay slow, I'll swear like a sailor
Sailor from my bad behavior

And if you come an go it won't matter anymore
It won't matter anymore, no
And if you can't stay slow, I'll be waiting at the door
I'll be waiting at the door, oh

I have a lover back in England
She's a star, she's like Taylor Swift
I come home, don't remember it
'Cause she's gone, she don't exist.
So, no worries, no worries, no worries now

'Cause love just comes and goes
No worries, no worries
I swear like a sailor, and say screw you Taylor Swift!
Screw you Taylor Swift!
And if you come and go it won't matter anymore
It won't matter anymore, no
And if you can't stay slow, I'll be waiting at the door
I'll be waiting at the door, oh
And if you come and go it won't matter anymore
It won't matter anymore, no
And if you can't stay slow, I'll swear like a sailor
Sailor from my bad behavior
