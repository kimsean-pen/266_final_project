Sleep, I sleep, I sleep
Under the world I keep, I keep, I keep
Inside my head
Meek, I'm meek, I'm meek, I'm meek
Under the skin I creep, I creep, I creep
Until it sheds

This is the love that you gave me
And it's the one that I'm fightin' for
This is the love that you gave me
And it's the one that I'm fightin' for
This is the love that you gave me

Leave and go quietly
Leave and go quietly
Leave and go quietly

Breathe, I breathe, I breathe
Under the water seeps, it seeps, it seeps
Into my face
Grieve, I grieve, I grieve
All of the love I see, I see, I see
Is run with red

This is the love that you gave me
And it's the one that I'm fightin' for
This is the love that you gave me
(This is the love that you gave me, baby)
But it's the one that I'm fightin' for
Oh, this is the love that you gave me
(This is the love that you gave me, baby)
And it's the one that I'm fightin' for
This is the love that you gave me

So leave and go quietly
Leave and go quietly
Leave and go quietly
Leave and go quietly

Leave and go quietly, leave and go quietly
Leave and go quietly, leave and go quietly

Leave and go quietly
(Leave and go quietly)
Leave and go quietly
(Leave and go quietly)
Leave and go quietly
(Leave and go quietly)
Leave and go quietly
(Leave and go quietly)
