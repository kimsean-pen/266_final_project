Now as you know it's your time on this earth
While we're rocking the cradle, we're riding the hearse
We keep moving upward toward everything free
And kindly look downward and oh, you'll see me
I've had six years of luck, I've had six on the line
And I've poured myself out like an old bitter wine
I've seen much of nothin', and nothin's the game
I've been thrown on my back and I don't know my name!

There's too many tears
Too many tears
Too many people in too many years
Some tears of laughter and some tears of pain
That break like a fever and fall like rain!

Points on the map, tears line the way
I've seen all your pretty things and oh, it's a shame
There's been much confusion with too many hurt
I feel my words dyin' down in the dirt!

I've had lies in my head, there's been lies in my heart
I've been tortured by this riddle and I don't know how to start
With a lightning flash and thunder, boys
And my mind it starts to click
So do what you must do and you best do it quick!

There's too many tears
Too many tears
Too many people in too many years
Some tears of laughter and some tears of pain
That break like a fever and fall like rain!

Oooohhh

There's too many tears
Too many tears!

Doctor, oh doctor
My world's in your hands
I feel like I'm dyin' and oh, I need a plan
Sister, sweet sister
There's blood on my lips
Why does it feel like this wound's doing flips
The dream's come on time, it's clear I can tell
I've seen your work everywhere and there's mercy in hell
With a lightning flash and thunder, boys
And again it all comes down
And I see my life merging with these poor souls underground!

There's too many tears
Too many tears
Too many people in too many years
Some tears of laughter and some tears of pain
That break like a fever

Oooohhh

There's too many tears
Too many tears
Too many people in too many years
Some tears of laughter and some tears of pain
That break like a fever and fall like rain!

Oooohhh

There's too many tears
Too many tears!

There's too many tears
Too many tears!

Fall like rain!

There's too many tears
Too many tears!

Oooohhh
Oooohhh

Break like a fever and fall like rain!

Oooohhh

Too many tears

Fall like rain!
