The haunting voice of a siren
In the appearance of a man
Human shape, childish laughter
He will return to the throne

A serpent lingers, ground is shaking
Also human in his form
Head put rest between his shoulders
His heads are shaking in the air

It's only memories untold
The dreams you are all making up
In all the centuries there is a demon waiting
It's where death confronts the sea

There is a curse that lies waiting
A shadow figure taking form
Where you can't reach your destination
Something is rotten to the bone

It's only memories untold
The dreams you are all making up
In all the centuries there is a demon waiting
It's where death confronts the sea
