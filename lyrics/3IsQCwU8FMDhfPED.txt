Here's a man who's done it all
He takes a bath and he takes a fall
But you know
he wants to take you home
And here's a man with a lust for life
He lives for now on the edge of a knife
And you know
he doesn't like to be cut
Yeah, you know
he will never keep his eyes shut

Here's a man who walks alone
He takes a bow then he takes you home
But you should know
that you will never in him out
John the Baptist in his youth
He's gonna wanna know the dirty truth
Oh yeah, what's revealed in the end
The best day along with your best friend
