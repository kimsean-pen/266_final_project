I know it's not like me to,
Hold back but this time I knew,
You must be silent to increase the volume.
In your head blood run red.

I'm a spectator, the motivator!
Shut up, shut up and do it to yourself!
I'm just an innocent bystander!
I'm a spectator, the motivator!
Shut up, shut up and do it to yourself!
I'm just an innocent bystander!

You ripped your own self in two,
Swear I had nothing to do,
With what's been done,
You know you can't but you can.
In your head blood run red.

I'm a spectator, the motivator!
Shut up, shut up and do it to yourself!
I'm just an innocent bystander!
I'm a spectator, the motivator!
Shut up, shut up and do it to yourself!
I'm just an innocent bystander!

Standing at the edge here.
Enough for me to hover by the bit here.
Enough you see I miss you with my head - fear.
So wrong that they will never reap our deaths clear.

Enough is enough!
Enough is enough!
Enough is enough!
Enough is enough!
Enough is enough!
Enough is enough!
Enough is enough!

I'm a spectator, the motivator!
Shut up, shut up and do it to yourself!
I'm just an innocent bystander!
I'm a spectator, the motivator!
Shut up, shut up and do it to yourself!
I'm just an innocent bystander!
I'm just an innocent bystander!
I'm just an innocent bystander!
I'm just an innocent bystander!
