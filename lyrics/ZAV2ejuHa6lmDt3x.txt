I was made the wrong way
Won't you do me the right way?
Where you gonna be tonight
'Cause I won't stay too long?

Maybe you're the light for me
When you talk to me it strikes me
Won't somebody help me
'Cause I don't feel too strong?

Was it something that I said, was it something that I did
Or the combination of both that did me end?

You know I'm hoping you'll sing along
Though it's not your favorite song
Don't wanna be the wind
There's nothing left to say
You know that some of us spin again
And when you do you need a friend
Don't wanna be the wind
There's nothing left for me
And I hate the thought of finally being erased
Baby that's the best of me

Everything's behind you
But the hopeless stands besides you
Living in the moment
Have I wasted all your time?

Was it something that I said, was it something that I did
Or the combination of both that did me end?

You know I'm hoping you'll sing along
Though it's not your favorite song
Don't wanna be the wind
There's nothing left to say
You know that some of us spin again
And when you do you need a friend
Don't wanna be the wind
There's nothing left for me
And I hate the thought finally being erased
But baby that's the best of me, yeah
Baby that's the best of me

You know I'm hoping you'll sing along
Though it's not your favorite song
Don't wanna be the wind
There's nothing left to say
You know that some of us spin again
And when you do, you need a friend
Don't wanna be the wind
There's nothing left for me
And I hate the thought finally being erased
Baby that's the best of me
