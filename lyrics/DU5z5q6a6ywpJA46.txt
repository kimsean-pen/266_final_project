Been staring for a hundred hours
Run down a spiral drain
Keep mouth clamped tight
And it isn't right

Three words keep running round my mind
But my tongue is hard to find
I need to let it go
Because I know

Dark secrets burn their vessel
Tearing out to grab a mouthful
Chunk of heart destroyed by quiet
Yell it out before it kills you now

Let it all out

Used to let rumors do my work
They got around real well
Now they only hurt
It's a liar's quirk

This time I gotta say it straight
I mean to do some good
I'm calling out your name
While the chance remains

Dark secrets burn their vessel
Tearing out to grab a mouthful
Chunk of heart destroyed by quiet
Yell it out before it kills you now

Let it all out

I want you
I want you
I want you
I want you

So now you know where I come from
My secret's come undone
My heart revealed my cause

I'm lying naked at your feet
Don't crush the heart that beat
Take me at my word
It may sound absurd

I want you
I want you
I want you
I want you

I want you, I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you, I want you
I want you
I want you
