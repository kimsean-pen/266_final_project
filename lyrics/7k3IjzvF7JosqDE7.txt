They told me the point
Was to get it
But nobody told me
What does it do if I got it
Chasing the high,
Now my card has imported
The greatest narcotics
One day I know I'll regret it
Been numb to the pain, they sip it,
They hit it, they pop it
Every day I'm trying to top it
Told me to stop it, changing the topic
Checking the like and the follow
It's feeling the same
As down in the Vicodin bottle
Living it like they're tomorrow
Living this life, but it's hollow, fuck

Grin like I'm wild, unstable
Life on the road has
All of my demons enabled
Breaking it down on the table
Be careful, though, it can be fatal

I'm fallin', ai, ai, ai
Fallin', ai, ai, ai
Fallin', ai, ai, ai
I said it was the last time, last time
Wake me up, I'm fallin', ai, ai, ai
Fallin', ai, ai, ai
Fallin', ai, ai, ai
I said it was the last time, last time

Pushed her away, then I lost her
In the DM a stranger
But the dangerous scared
Her off
All this self loathing I foster
Mirror reflects an imposter
Swipe up and go through the motion
Obsessively posting,
Can't seem to live in the moment
I'm just a drop in the ocean
Everything's fine, no emotions

The bank doesn't
Mind all the tattoos
'Cause the cash rules
But it isn't fulfilling as fast food
And your worth
Dripping past you
I'm coming with you,
I'm gonna outlast you
Temptation telling
Me don't let it in
Told it I'm leaving,
I'm chasing the sin
The only thing I learnt
From letting it win
Is never again
(Never again)

I'm fallin', ai, ai, ai
Fallin', ai, ai, ai
Fallin', ai, ai, ai
I said it was the last time, last time
Wake me up, I'm fallin', ai, ai, ai
Fallin', ai, ai, ai
Fallin', ai, ai, ai
I said it was the last time, last time

I said it was the last time, last time
But I'm fallin', ai, ai, ai
I'm fallin', ai, ai, ai
I'm fallin'
I, I said it was the last time, last time
Fuck it, now I'm fallin'
I'm fallin'
I am fallin'
Ai, ai, ai
I am fallin'
Fallin'
I said it was the last time, last time
