Back and forth - the face to face
Space between the emptiness
We don't always radiate, a sense of faith
But it's the place I long to be

I believe it's my destiny
A crater laid empty, screams to increase
Stable safety rears its pretty face
Afraid of the failure - afraid of the pain

Inside the back and forth
Between the emptiness
Is the place I long to be
Another shot at destiny

Inside the back and forth
Between the emptiness
Is the place I long to be
Another shot at destiny

Careful brain I creep right past you
My actions test your security
I'm not afraid of your healing approval
Snapped in half - broken in two

Inside the back and forth
Between the emptiness
Is the place I long to be
Another shot at destiny

Inside the back and forth
Between the emptiness
Is the place I long to be
Another shot at destiny

Back and forth - the face to face
Space between the emptiness
We don't always radiate, a sense of faith
But it's the place I long to be

My eyes at times at times see the perfect picture
Yet I sacrifice, solid ground and a balanced life
Cycles of tragedy
Cycles of tragedy
