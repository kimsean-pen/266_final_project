Hush now, don't explain
Just say you'll remain
I'm glad you're back
Don't explain
Quiet, don't explain
There's nothing to gain
Skip that, lipstick
Don't explain

You know that I love you
And what love endures
Nothing rates above you
For I'm so completely yours
Cry a tear, folks chatter
And I know you cheat
Right or wrong don't matter
When you're with me, my sweet

Hush now, don't explain
You're mine, young and pained
My life, yours love
Don't explain

You know that I love you
And what love endures
Nothing rates above you
For I'm so completely yours
Cry a tear, folks chatter
And I know you cheat
Right or wrong don't matter
When you're with me, my sweet

Hush now, don't explain
You're mine, young and pained
My life, yours love
Don't explain
