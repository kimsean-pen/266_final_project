The whole world sittin' on a ticking bomb
The whole world sittin' on a ticking bomb
So keep your calm, carry on
The whole world sittin' on a ticking bomb

The sun may never rise again
The question ain't "if" but "when"
The sea will boil and the sky will fall
The sun may never rise again
The silent war has begun
You're staring down a loaded gun
No refuge found, no solid ground
Assuming race can't be won

Don't wait to say goodbye, you're running out of time
Whatever you believe it's easy to see

The whole world sittin' on a ticking bomb
The whole world sittin' on a ticking bomb
So keep your calm and carry on
The whole world sittin' on a ticking bomb
And it's about to explode

(The whole world, the whole world)
(The whole world, the whole world)

The future is a dying art
Laying in a ditch in the dark
I need you here, but all I hear
Is the beating of a broken heart

Don't wait to say goodbye, you're running out of time
Whatever you believe it's easy to see

The whole world sittin' on a ticking bomb,
The whole world sittin' on a ticking bomb,
So keep your calm, and carry on
The whole world's sittin' on a ticking bomb
And it's about to explode

(The whole world, the whole world)
(The whole world, the whole world)

And it's about to explode

(The whole world, the whole world)
(The whole world, the whole world)

The whole world sittin' on a ticking bomb
The whole world sittin' on a ticking bomb
And it don't care what side you're on
The whole world sittin' on a ticking bomb
(The whole world, the whole world)
(The whole world, the whole world)
So keep your calm and carry on
The whole world sitting on a ticking bomb
