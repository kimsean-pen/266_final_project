Do, Do you got a first aid kit handy?
Do, Do you know how to patch up a wound?
Tell me,
are you patient,
understanding?
Cause I might need some time to clear the hold in my heart and I
I've tried every remedy
And nothing seems to work for me
Baby, (baby)
this situation is driving me crazy
And I really wanna be your lady
But the one before you left me so
Damaged, damaged
Damaged, damaged
I thought that I should let you know

That my heart is
Damaged, damaged
So Damaged
And you can blame the one before
So how you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it
(Baby I gotta know what you are gonna do?)
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it
(Baby I gotta know what you are gonna do?)
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it
(Baby I gotta know what you are gonna do?)
