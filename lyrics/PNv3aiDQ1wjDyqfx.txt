I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
You better stop
The thing that you doin'
I said "Watch out!"
I ain't lyin'
Yeaaah!

I ain't gonna take none of your
Foolin' around
I ain't gonna take none of your
Puttin' me down
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
Oh, all right!

I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
You better stop
The thing that you doin'
I said "Watch out!"
I ain't lyin'
Yeaaah!

I ain't gonna take none of your
Foolin' around
Ain't gonna take none of your
Puttin' me down
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
Ohh, ahhh
