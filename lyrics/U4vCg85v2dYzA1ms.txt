I caught some feelings, now I sense a change
Something beautiful has slipped away
I let you in and, then you disappear
Like the dying of another day

I was never planning on, any of this chaos
I wasn't being difficult, but you still betrayed us

Now I'm stuck, in a rut
Kicking stones, looking at my phone all night
Baby I've lost my mind
When I couldn't breathe, couldn't sleep
And you say it served me right
Maybe I've lost my mind

You're on the ceiling, I'm down here on the floor
Keeps me coming back
Keeps me begging for more

I knew there'd be other girls
And I like the danger
Once or twice I've seen your soul
You weren't always a stranger

Stuck in a rut
Kicking stones, looking at my phone all night
Baby I've lost my mind
When I couldn't breathe, couldn't sleep
And you say it served me right
Maybe I've lost my mind

You wouldn't give me closure
Let me get off the ride
And now I'm getting closer, to the other side

Now I'm stuck, in a rut
Kicking stones, looking at my phone all night
Baby I've lost my mind
When I couldn't breathe, couldn't sleep
And you say it, served me right
Maybe I've lost my mind

Stuck in a rut
Kicking stones, looking at my phone all night
Baby I've lost my mind
Stuck in a rut
Kicking stones, looking at my phone all night
Maybe I've lost my mind
