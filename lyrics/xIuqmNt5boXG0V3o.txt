They crucify you when you get it wrong
When things are fine they put you ahead
They laugh at you with your trousers down
They pick the stones and aim them at you're head

When you're alive, they won't care what you said
What you deserve and all the blood you bled

Doesn't matter what you try to hide
The sun comes out and then the truth is read
Your fans will love you while you're alive
But the wreaths are laid by the rest instead

When you're alive they won't care what you said
What you deserve and all the blood you bled

'Cause everybody loves you when you're dead
Kneel and pray by the side of your bed
And then everybody loves you when you're dead
Kneel and pray just like your momma said
