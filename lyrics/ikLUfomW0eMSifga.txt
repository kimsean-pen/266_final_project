I don't wanna waste it this time
And see fate as the end of me
I don't wanna waste it, my life
And know it was in front of me

Together we rock, together we roll
Finding ourselves is taking its toll
Hear it on the cold wind of this town
I'm never going back, that's a lonely road

I made it, it started, I can't stop it oh no
I will wait for you to call me out, me out
It's not a need nor a want, living with his hands out
Would have stayed there alone, I can't go back no more
I believe I don't know what you want
I believe I don't know

I don't wanna waste it this time
Do you see the fate that's the end of me?
I don't wanna waste it, my life
To think it was in front of me

Together we laugh, the memory low
Finding ourselves, the phases were slow
Cause I don't wanna waste any of this time
The body's still wasted

I made it, it started, I can't stop it oh no
I will wait for you to call me out, me out
It's not a need nor a want, living with his hands out
Would have stayed there alone, I can't go back no more
I believe I don't know what you want
I believe I don't know

I don't want to waste it this time
I don't want to waste it, my life
