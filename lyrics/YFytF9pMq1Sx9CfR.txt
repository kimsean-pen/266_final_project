Top down on da nawf
I'm home
I can never get loss
No no
I play the field and the coach (I play the field)
And they know, that's why I'm huncho

For the reason I can't cry cry
For some reason I am not tired
For the gang I gotta bring it home
For my grandma watching in the sky (Grandma)

You probably wanna see me run
You probably wanna see me run on them
