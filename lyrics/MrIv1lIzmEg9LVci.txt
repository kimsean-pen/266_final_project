You don't wanna fall back
I don't want to fall back tonight
I just want my old baby
You just want to know it's alright
For you to take it all off
For me to take care of you
'Cause you been taking it all in stride

Now I'm gonna make a time to make love
I'm gonna make a point to just focus on us
Now I'm gonna make sure you get enough
When I make it all about you, take care of us

Look what you made me do, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, hm, hm
Look what you made me do, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, hm, hm

Don't let it go to waste
Had it dropping on my chest
I need your energy
I don't want to feel like you're saving it for some other time
Or some other things that's been on your mind (oh, no)
Believe me, I know, I know but

Now I'm gonna make a time to make love
I'm gonna make a point to just focus on us
Now I'm gonna make sure you get enough
When I make it all about you, take care of us

Look what you made me do, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, hm, hm
Look what you made me do, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, hm, hm

Look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you
