Cut close,
But never too near
'Cause who knows
What's behind her veneer
Golden bronze and decadence
Top it off with her fragrance
Broken heel,
So well concealed in her dance
Ask for help, but she's indisposed
Pull the silk and she'll be exposed
Now it seems that the emperor has no clothes
KIMONO

The door's closed,
and she's disappeared
And now I propose
We take a souvenir
Golden bronze and decadence
Top it off with her fragrance
Broken heel,
So well concealed in her dance
Ask for help, but she's indisposed
Pull the silk and she'll be exposed
Now it seems that the emperor has no clothes

Never look back, don't turn around
Tangled threads they come undone
So, never look back, don't turn around
'Cause here we come, here we come, here we come

KIMONO
KIMONO
KIMONO
KIMONO

KIMONO
