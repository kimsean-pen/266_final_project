We're all in this together
Or so I was told
All for one, one for none
When its time
You know this could never be justified
But still
You take the hatred home

Is this what you were searching for
The wounded and the filtered truth
Don't ignore a life that's real

How come you feel so alone?
Is it the rage inside that wipes it all away?
The rage inside

Your back turned against the world
You knew
A place to hide from everything
And it had to made you fall?

How come you feel so alone?
Is it the rage inside that wipes it all away?
The rage inside

How come you feel so alone?
Is it the rage inside that wipes it all away?
The rage inside
How come you feel so alone?
Is it the rage inside that wipes it all away?
The rage inside
