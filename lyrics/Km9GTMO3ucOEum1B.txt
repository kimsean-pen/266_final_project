Depth over distance every time, my dear
And this tree of ours may grow tall in the woods
But it's the roots that will bind us here
To the ground

Depth over distance was all I asked of you
And I may be foolish to fall as I do
Still there's strength in the blindness you fear
If you're coming too
If you're coming too

Oh hold on, wait until that lone sun
Breaks from the arms of the Lord
Yeah hold on, though we may be too young
To know this ride we're on

Depth over distance was all I asked of you
And everybody round here's acting like a stone
Still there's things I'd do, darling, I'd go blind for you
If you let it go sometimes, let it go sometimes, let it go
Just let it go sometimes

So hold on, wait until that lone sun
Breaks from the arms of the Lord
Now hold on, though we may be too young
To know this ride we're on
Oh hold on, though we may be too young
To know this ride we're on

Depth over distance every time, my dear
And I may be foolish to fall as I do
Still there's strength in the blindness you fear
If you're coming too
Oh If you're coming too

Oh hold on, wait until that lone sun
Breaks from the arms of the Lord
Yeah
Yeah hold on, though we may be too young
To know this ride we're on
To know this ride
To know this ride we're on
