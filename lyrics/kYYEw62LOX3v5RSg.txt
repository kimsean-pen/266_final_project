To my surprise
And my delight
I saw a sunrise
I saw a sunlight

I am nothing
In the dark
And the clouds burst
To show the daylight

Oh, and the sun will shine
Yeah, on this heart of mine
Oh, and I realize
Who cannot live without
Who come apart without it

On a hilltop
On the sky rise
Like a first born
Child

On a full day
On a full flight
Defeat darkness
Breaking the daylight

Oh, and the sun will shine
Yeah, on this heart of mine
Oh, and I realize
Who cannot live without
Who come apart without
Daylight

Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight

Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
