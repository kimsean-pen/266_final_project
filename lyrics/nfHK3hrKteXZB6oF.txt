We weave in and out of consciousness alone
Til our bodies collide and keep us from getting cold

Skin pores open up and swallow each other whole
And the scars we collect connect and reverse the flow

And so it goes
And so it goes

Emotions in motions motion us to wars
And our last experience has served as swords

Each life that we take burns holes into the walls
Til the roof caves and we wash up on the shore

And so it goes
And so it goes
And so it goes
And so it goes

But there's a light
If you dare to believe it
It floods in and washes all away
Blood, sweat and tears won't retrieve it
You just have to wait to receive...

The light
If you dare to believe it
It floods in and washes all away
Blood, sweat and tears won't retrieve it
You just have to wait to receive it

Blood, sweat and tears won't retrieve it
You just have to wait to receive it

Blood, sweat and tears won't retrieve it
You just have to wait to receive it
