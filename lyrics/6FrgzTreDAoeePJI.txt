Sometimes you say you will sometimes you say you won't
you always keep me waiting waiting hesitating hey yeah
At times I think you do at times I think you don't
my mind is rollerskating, skipping, jumping rope, and fading

Mental Hopscotch
why must you treat me this way
Mental Hopscotch
ready or not I'm going away

Why can't you be like this why can't you be like that
I don't know where I am, or where or where I'm at
So now you got me up and now you got me down
You won't be walking you'll be talking
watch me now it's crazy

Mental Hopscotch
why must you treat me this way
Mental Hopscotch
ready or not I'm going away
Mental Hopscotch
cover your eyes and count to 10
Mental Hopscotch
don't do a em up till I say when

So now you get me up and now you get me down

You won't be walking you'll be doin what you love baby
You don't think twice about what I might say
I follow you around and play an play an play an play

Mental Hopscotch
why must you treat me this way
Mental Hopscotch
ready or not I'm going away
Mental Hopscotch
cover your eyes and count to 10
Mental Hopscotch
don't do em up till I say when

Mental Hopsctch
Do me dump me rill me rock me
Mental Hopscotch
rollarskating skipping fading
Mental Hopscotch
Mental Hopscotch
Mental Hopscotch
