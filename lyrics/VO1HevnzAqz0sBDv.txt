There will be no love that's dying here
The bird that flew in through my window
Simply lost his way.
He broke his wing i helped him heal and then he flew away
Well the death of love is everywhere
But i wont let it be,
There will be no love dying here for me.
There will be no love that's dying here
The mirror that fell from the wall was ragedy that's all,
It rests upon a rusty nail
Before it made it's fall
Well the bones of love are every where but i wont let it be,
There will be no love dying here for me.

There will be no that's dying here
Four flowers is my aging faces, not a sign within
I payed for three a sweet old lady gave me four instead
Theres some doubt thats out about this love but i wont let it be,
There will be no love thats dying here for me.
There will be no love that's dying here
The bird that flew in through my window
Simply lost his way

He broke his wing i helped him heal and then he flew away
Well the death of love is everywhere
But i wont let it be,
There will be no love dying here for me
no-o-o-o oh
There will be no love that's dying for me
There will be no love thats dying for you and me
Oh there will be no love dying here
No-o not for me
There will be no love that's dying here
No-o-o
There will be no love thats dying here
No no no no no no no no no no no
There will be no lo-o-o-ve dying for me.
