I am still broken in two parts
There is my mind there is my heart
Nowhere for me to run and hide

You only live to serve yourself
Come crawling back when you need help
After you burn there's no one else

You know the way back
You just crash right into me
But it's not so easy now
Oh way back when

Now that I've seen the other you
How do I know which one is true?
How many faces do you have?

Think that you've got me figured out
All of this time without a doubt
Don't even think that you know me

You know the way back
You just crash right into me
But it's not so easy now
Oh way back
When you only had one face
Saving grace now
You know the way back
(You know the way back)

I am still broken in two parts
There is my mind there is my heart
Nowhere for me to run and hide

You know the way back
You just crash right into me
But it's not so easy now
Oh way back
When you only had one face
Saving grace now
You know the way back
(You know the way back)
(Way back)
(Way back)
(You know the way back)
