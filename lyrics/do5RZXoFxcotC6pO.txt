Oh
swallow something,
canned, frozen.
ungodly festering source,
dragging and kicking and screaming for more,
that burns, burns, burns, burns

hands on the table right where I can see them run
(who's the sow for)
small vacant things that wind up so willing
(who's the sow for)
burns on my knees, scrapes that I scrape
(who's the sow for)
five minutes grag down pillow's wet ache
(who's the sow for)

I can see
The waiting up,
I'm willing
burns are fine
they're serious,
the things I see your mouth saying
the words come out.

run, run for your life,
run for the take,
harder the beating
the sooner the ache

run for your life,
run for the take,
harder the beating,
the sooner the
sow, sow, sow, sow

hands on the table right where I can see them run
(who's the sow for)
small vacant things that wind up so willing
(who's the sow for)
burns on my knees, scrapes that I scrape
(who's the sow for)
five minutes grag down pillow's wet ache
(who's the sow for)

i can see you all
stop living
oh, we could sing out
and talk abouth things
stop wondering
why, how

run, run for your life,
run for the take,
harder the beating,
the sooner the
sow, sow, sow, sow

run, run for your life,
run for the beating, the heart,
the feeding, the taking
the sow, sow, sow, sow

run, run for your life,
run for the beating, the heart,
the feeding, the eating,
the bigger the plate

the pig on the take,
there's more for the bank,
the mongrels are banking too
sow, sow, sow, sow

sow, sow, sow, sow

run, run for your life,
run for the beating, the feeding,
the eating, defeating,
the scream, scream for your life,
scream for eating the beating the feeding
deaf eating the sow
