Must have died a thousand times
I must have died a thousand times
I must have died a thousand times
Feeling less than human
I surmise I'm less than human
In Gods' eyes
Time he's on my side, she said
Time he's on my side, she said
He may be on your side I said
But it makes no difference in the end
He's coming after you my friend
Must have cried a thousand times
Must have cried a thousand times
I must have cried a thousand times
Feeling less than human
I surmise I'm less than human
In Gods' eyes
I must have died a thousand times
I must have died a thousand times
And I must have cried a thousand times
I must have cried a thousand times
Wao-oo-oo Wao-oo-oo Wao-oo-oo Wao-oo-oo
