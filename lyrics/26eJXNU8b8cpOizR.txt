There's not a soul in here–

Pull to your house and dump like a trash man
All up in your grill, but I'm not a fan
Merlyn, I do no hat trick, just show me where the cash at
Then show me where the hash at
Fuck that, show me where the cash at
(There's not a soul in here–)
I would rather be on acid, rather make investments
They'll come out of that debt, we'll come out of those bed sheets
I'm like the IRS, pull up to your address
I was tryin' my best to seizure, but pull it like Keisha
(There's not a soul in here–)
Johnny Dang gon' ice my diamonds, up out that freezer
I used to be broke, I don't got amnesia
I used to deal with both, now it's black victims
She know not to call collect if she go to prison
(There's not a soul in here–)

Move to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat (Ba-dam!)
G-P to S and figure where you niggas at (Show out)
Where the cash at? Used to ask that
Where the cash at? Used to ask that
(There's not a soul in here–)
Move to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat (Ba-dam!)
G-P to S and figure where you niggas at (Show out)
Where the cash at? Used to ask that
Where the cash at? Used to ask that

At the night I bring them out, I was sleepin' upside-down
Keep you up, I come around, they stay right up on my tip
Send me a pic whenever you slip, hopin' this outflow my scales
Full throttle whenever I blaze, fifty mil, put it under my wheel
(There's not a soul in here–)
Human, I see through your eyes until my CCC wide open to my skin
They can see they run, they feel like they been kickin' DDR
Bustin' out the bar, human out the tour
They grip three types of the gas, miss the days I can't get back
(There's not a soul in here–)

Move to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat (Ba-dam!)
G-P to S and figure where you niggas at (Show out)
Where the cash at? Used to ask that
Where the cash at? Used to ask that
(There's not a soul in here–)
Move to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat (Ba-dam!)
G-P to S and figure where you niggas at (Show out)
Where the cash at? Used to ask that
Where the cash at? Used to ask that
