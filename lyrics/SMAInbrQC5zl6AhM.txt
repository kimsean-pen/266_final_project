If you don't know...
What you want...
Don't leave me lone tonight...
If you don't go...
I let you...
What there is...
In my heart...
If you don't know...
Ah-aaaah...
Ah-aaaah, tonight...
I need your sunshine, tonight...
If you don't know,
What you're for me,
Don't leave me alone tonight,
If you don't go,
I let you see,
What there is in my heart,
If you say 'no'
I'll feel alone,
I need your sunshine, tonight...
If you stay home,
I'll give my whole,
I'll be your star...
If you love me, if you love me now,
I'll be your star
If you love me, if you love me now,
I'll be your star
If you love me, if you love me now,
I'll be your star
If you love me, if you love me now,
I'll be your star
Ah-aaaah...
Ah-aaaah, tonight...
I need your sunshine, tonight...
If you want love,
Then come with me
Stay by my side tonight
If you want love,
I'll make you rise,
like the moon in the night
If you say 'no'
I'll feel alone,
I need your sunshine, tonight...
If you stay home,
I'll give my whole,
I'll be your star...
If you love me, if you love me now,
I'll be your star
If you love me, if you love me now,
I'll be your star
If you love me, if you love me now,
I'll be your star
If you love me, if you love me now,
I'll be your star
