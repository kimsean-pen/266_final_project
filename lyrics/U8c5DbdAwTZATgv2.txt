Protect me from ravagement
I'm ten years old
I don't know what to do
Protect me myself
I'm fourteen
There's nothing to do
Protect me yourself
I'm sixteen
Protect me from starving
I'm eighteen
Protect me you
I don't know what to do
Protect me demons
That come at night
I don't know what they say
Their whispering
Sends the night air away
And makes me forget
I hope they come
Again and again

Here they come
Again and again
I hope they come again
Again
Again
