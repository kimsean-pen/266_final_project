Are you ugly?
A liar like me?
A loser, a lost soul?
Someone you don't know
Money it's no cure
A sickness so pure
Are you like me?
Are you ugly?

We are dirt, we are alone
You know we're far from sober
We are fake, we are afraid
You know it's far from over
We are dirt we are alone
You know we're far from sober
Look closer, are you like me?
Are you ugly?

Turn a blind eye
Why do I deny?
Medicate me
So I die happy
A strain of cancer
Chokes the answers
Are you like me?
A liar like me?

We are dirt, we are alone
You know we're far from sober
We are fake, we are afraid
You know it's far from over
We are dirt we are alone
You know we're far from sober
Look closer, are you like me?
Are you ugly?

I don't care, you don't care
I'm bitter, you're angry
You don't care, I don't care
You love you, just like me
I blame you, you blame me
I'm bitter, you're angry
You don't care, I don't care
You love you, like me

We are dirt, we are alone
You know we're far from sober
We are fake, we are afraid
You know it's far from over
We are dirt we are alone
You know we're far from sober
Look closer, are you like me?
Are you ugly?
Are you ugly?
Are you ugly?
