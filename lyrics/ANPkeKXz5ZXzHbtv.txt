Air your secrets out
Let's dive in
But not just yet
Lusting soul seeking affection
Caught your eye in the reflection
I don't know how much longer
Tell me, am i getting closer?
Shy vein
The pain & time
It takes to find is
Better than
Leaving you behind
Finding the new wave
Focusing all the rage
So far, so good
Hesitation left at bay
Often misunderstood
We both see it another way
Lay down next to me
We're hollowed out
I know you won't deceive me
Exactly what we need
