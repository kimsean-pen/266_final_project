I got a plane in the middle of the night, don't you mind?
I nearly killed somebody, don't you mind? Don't you mind?
I gave you something you can never give back, don't you mind?
You've seen your face like a heart attack, Don't you mind? Don't you mind?

I was late but I arrived
I'm sorry, but I'd rather be getting high than watching my family die
Exaggerate and you and I
I think I did something terrible to your body, don't you mind?

I put your mother through hell, don't you mind?
I hurt your brother as well, don't you mind? Don't you mind?
I was thinking 'bout killing myself, don't you mind?
I love you, don't you mind? Don't you mind?

I put your mother through hell, don't you mind?
I hurt your brother as well, don't you mind? Don't you mind?
I was thinking 'bout killing myself, don't you mind?
I love you, don't you mind? Don't you mind?
