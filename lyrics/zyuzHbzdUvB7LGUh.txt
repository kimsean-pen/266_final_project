Poets, priests, and visionaries rallied to the call,
The will of humankind defined them all

Coveting the gold and silver idols of success,
only to perpetuate the rest

Every king's assassinated silently at bay,
Counting down until it's Holy Day

Artifacts of ancient wisdom buried in the Sand,
Hastily upturned to clear the land

Now I ain't going to claim to be the Second Son,
I love my follow man,
But I hate what you've become,
It goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on,

To calculate the Universe is further from divine,
But can we comprehend all that we find?

Artifacts of ancient wisdom buried in the Sand,
Affective d and denied by us again,

Now I ain't going to calculate stones to sea,
I love my follow man,
And I love what you could be,

It goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on,
