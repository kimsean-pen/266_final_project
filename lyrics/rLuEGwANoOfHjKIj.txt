The castle is lit with candles and torches
The carriages of the nobles arrive in front
The smell of splendor and decadence
And nobody can foresee
The masters and the mistresses are walking into the hall
They are smiling and laughing and showing that they are tall
They don't recognize that we're waiting there
And just nobody can foresee
This is the last night of the kings
We are the folk
And we have the right
To stand up and to fight
For an independent life
We are the force
We are the might
And we will stand up
For an independent life
The ball has begun and we're closing our trap
Inwardly we're gathering ourselves
While the dance comes to higher pace
Still nobody can foresee
Joining the circles, in black robes unknown
Unsheathing our swords and get ready to dance
Our hearts are filled with the will to survive
In this last night of their life
It's a murderous, murderous ball night
We are the folk
And we have the right
To stand up and to fight
For an independent life
We are the force
We are the might
And we will stand up
For an independent life
We are heroes
Heroes of the night
We are ready to live forevermore
Our gods lead us through this fight
On and on
We are one and on our way
We are the folk
And we have the right
To stand up and to fight
For an independent life
We are the force
We are the might
And we will stand up
For an independent life
