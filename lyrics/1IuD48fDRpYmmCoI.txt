Had a bad day
As bad as they come
Time to get a real job
You gotta stop having fun
So I
So I got a real job
I'm workin' nine to nine
I'm makin' five bucks an hour
'Til the day i die

Got a strong side of me
And it's feeling just fine
Got a strong side of me
With the strongest wine

Am I one third passion
Am I two thirds pride
I said I used to have a life once
He said I used to like your smile once
Singing, silence to the world
But the stars kept marching
You said, silence to everyone
I said, I'm still talking

Have you got some more deep inside of you
Deep inside of you
Deep inside of you

I'll always have more for me, yeah, yeah
I'll always have more for me, yeah, yeah
I take a little more for me
More for me
More for me, baby

Got a picture of the way
The world has summed me up
If I could have one wish
I sure wish that I had never grown up
Got a picture of the way I looked when I was 3
I came out laughing, screaming, dancing
I came out laughing, screaming, dancing

I used to be free spirited
Now I'm just free of sleep
I got a burning passion in my throat
I got a burning passion inside me
I got a job that wasts my time and gift
I got a life that needs a serious lift
And all the things I wanted
Yes, all the things I want go
All the things I wanted
All the things I wanted
All of the things I want
All of the things I want go

On and on and on and on and ah ah
Yes we go on, on, on

You said, have you got some more
Deep inside of you

I will always have more for me, yeah, yeah
I'll always have more for me, yeah, yeah
I take a little more for me
More for me
More for me, baby

This is all the things I want, they go
All the things I want, they go
All the things I want, they go
All the things I want, they go

So I take a little more for me, yeah yeah
I take a little more for me, yeah yeah
I take a little more for me,
More for me
More for me
