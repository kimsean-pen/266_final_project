I always felt, that it was wrong
To lay my world in foreign hands
So why'd it take so long
To find the strength to steal it back?
All that I once had and so much more
An open door so I can finally breathe again

All this weight should lift from every inch
That suffocates the way that I think
If somehow all becomes far from misfortuned destiny
Oh, that I've come to believe as the only way
To pass each day, confined to feeling so empty
Until now

I see a way out, and I can see the
Sun on the horizon
But it's getting more and more distant, oh
Every time you turn and face away

I see a way out, and I can hear a
Echo that begs to be followed
Lord only knows where it is taking me
Lord only knows where it is taking me
Ohh, ohh
Oh, oh

And not so long ago, I seemed to think
That I had the whole thing figured out
Only to find my self, trapped at the heart of someone else
Oh, but now I finally see, the other side
And just in time, before I let it pull me in, again

I see a way out and I can see the
Sun on the horizon
But it's getting more and more distant, oh
Every time you turn and face away

I see a way out and I can hear a
Echo that begs to be followed
Lord only knows where it is taking me
Lord only knows where it is taking me
Ohh, ohh, ohh

And all new life
Must be born from the ashes
But I'm more than willing to start again
To start again

And all new life
Must be born from the ashes
But I'm more than willing to start again
To start again
To start again

And I see a way out and I can see the
Sun on the horizon
But it's getting more and more distant, oh
Every time you turn and face away

I see a way out and I can hear a
Echo that begs to be followed
Lord only knows where it is taking me
Lord only knows where it is taking me
Ohh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh
