I'm not alone because the TV's on, yeah
I'm not crazy 'cause I take the right pills every day and rest
Clean your conscience
Clear your thoughts with speyside with your grain
Clean your conscience
Clear your thoughts with speyside

Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt
Our hearts littering the topsoil
Tune in
And we can get the last call
Our lives
Our coal
Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt
Our hearts littering the topsoil
Sign up
The picket line or the parade
I'm not alone 'cause the TV's on, yeah

I'm not crazy 'cause I take the right pills every day and rest
Clean your conscience
Clear your thoughts with speyside and with your brain
Clean your conscience
Clear your thoughts with speyside
Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt

Our hearts littering the topsoil
Tune in
And we can get the last call
Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt
Our our hearts littering the topsoil
Sign up
It's the picket line or the parade
Bleed from my arm
Won't they give it a rest now?
(Give it a rest now)
Now, now, now

Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt
Our hearts littering the topsoil
Tune in
And we can get the last call
Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt

Our hearts littering the topsoil
Sign up
The picket line or the parade
Our lives
Our coal
