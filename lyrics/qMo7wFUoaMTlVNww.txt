Everything I see is sacred
Five point zero holds a spoil
Mother Mary, rearrange me
Help to go through soouthern soil

Twist your fingers
Called you a star
Twist your fingers
Holy one
Calling
Twist your fingers
Called you a star
Twist your fingers
Holy one
Calling

Now you yourself go through the needle's eye
With all you eating we're creatures
I make my bed across the lion's teeth tonight
Come all you quivers and their preachers

Twist your fingers
Called you a star
Twist your fingers
Holy one
Calling
Twist your fingers
Called you a star
Twist your fingers
Holy one
Calling

Come all of you to my arms
Asking for nothing, asking for anything
Come all of you to my arms
Asking for something, asking for anything

Come all you hungry children to my arms
Searching fo something, searching for anything
Come all you hungry children to my arms
Asking for nothing, asking for anything
