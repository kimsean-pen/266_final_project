I'm walking away
You're hurt and I am to blame
Who's right or wrong?
What does it matter now anyway?
Oh I'm sorry I fucked up
For this hurtful breakup
I cannot change, who I am
Uh oh the skies are red
Better run, better run
Gonna end up dead
Dead and gone
Dead and gone
Dead and gone
Uh oh the skies are red
Gotta make, gotta make this right
If it's not too late
Too little, too late

(Woah)
I wanna say that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
I wanna tell you I'm sorry for the mistakes I've made
And I hope it's not too little, not too late
Cos' I can't breathe, woah, I can't breathe
I can't breathe, oh, I can't breathe
I can't breathe, oh, I can't breathe

Who's right or wrong?
What does it matter now anyway?
Sorry I fucked up
But this hurtful breakup
I cannot change
Uh oh the skies are red
Gotta make this right
Gonna end up dead
Dead and gone

I wanna say that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
I wanna tell you I'm sorry for the mistakes I've made
And I hope it's not too little, not too late
Cos' I can't breathe, woah, I can't breathe
I can't breathe, oh, I can't breathe
I can't breathe, oh, I can't breathe

Woah, oh oh, woah oh, woah oh
Woah oh, woah oh, woah oh

Woah, oh oh, Woah oh, woah oh
Woah oh, woah oh, woah oh

I wanna say that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
I wanna tell you I'm sorry for the mistakes I've made
And I hope it's not too little, not too late
Cos' I can't breathe, woah, I can't breathe
I can't breathe, oh, I can't breathe
I can't breathe, oh, I can't breathe

Woah, oh oh, woah oh, woah oh
Woah oh, woah oh, woah oh

Woah, oh oh, woah oh, woah oh
Woah oh, woah oh, woah oh
