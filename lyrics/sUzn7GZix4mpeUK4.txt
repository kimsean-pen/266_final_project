It's getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school (No I can't complain)
The teachers who taught me weren't cool (No I can't complain)
They're holding me down (ah-ahh)
Turnin' me 'round (Oh-ohh)
Filling me up with your rules (ooh-hoo)

I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better, since you've been mine

I used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word, I finally heard
And doing the best that I can

I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better, since you've been mine

Getting so much better all the time
It's getting better all the time (Better, better, better)
It's getting better all the time (Better, better, better)

I used to be cruel to my woman, I beat her
And kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean, but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can (Ooh-hoo)

I admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
Yes, I admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine

Getting so much better all the time
It's getting better all the time (Better, better, better)
It's getting better all the time (Better, better, better)
Getting so much better all the time
