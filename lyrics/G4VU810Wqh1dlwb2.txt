Where it began, I can't begin to know when
But then I know it's growing strong
Wasn't the spring
And spring became the summer
Who'd have believe you'd come along

Hands, touching hands, reaching out
Touching me, touching you

Sweet Caroline
Good times never seem so good
I've been inclined
To believe it never would but now I

Look at the night
And it don't seem so lonely
We fill it up with only two

And when I hurt
Hurting runs off my shoulder
How can I hurt when holding you

One, touching one, reaching out
Touching me, touching you

Sweet Caroline
Good times never seem so good
I've been inclined
To believe they never would, oh no no

Sweet Caroline
Good times never seem so good
Sweet Caroline
I believe they never could
Sweet Caroline
