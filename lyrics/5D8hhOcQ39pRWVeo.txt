I will be your dragon indoors,
Take you outside these four walls
You could be my heaven and sky
I pull off the corner of my eye
You're not as I, and you told me to fly
I don't know how we are close to the sky
Wondering why I'm blind in the dark
Like you said
I'll be your dragon tonight
You'll never see me on the street
Tears are records on repeat
You'll never see me on the street
Tears are records on repeat
I'll be your dragon tonight
You'll never see me on the street
Tears are records on repeat
You'll never see me on the street
Tears are records on repeat

Take a look at what we could have here,
All the things we dream and fear
Could you be my shoulder a while?!
I pull off the corner of my eye
You're not as I, and you told me to fly
I don't know how we are close to the sky
Wondering why I'm blind in the dark
Like you said
I'll be your dragon tonight
You'll never see me on the street
Tears are records on repeat
You'll never see me on the street
Tears are records on repeat
I'll be your dragon tonight
You'll never see me on the street
Tears are records on repeat
You'll never see me on the street
Tears are records on repeat

I'll be your dragon tonight
You'll never see me on the street
Tears are records on repeat
You'll never see me on the street
Tears are records on repeat
I'll be your dragon tonight
You'll never see me on the street
Tears are records on repeat
You'll never see me on the street
Tears are records on repeat
