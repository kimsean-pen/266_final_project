Watch the sunrise from a place, I had it all
Left you lonely for the life that I had sold
Led a lie 'cause it was easier than going home, oh-oh
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)

And tell me, where do we go when this shit gets so real?
We can't find the words to say, (oh-oh)
I'm standing here in limbo
If this is what we're in for then maybe I don't want it anyway

Innocent or guilty, will you save me if I stay?
See the world in color, tell me everything's okay, ooh
Can I lay back into the dark? (In your arms, baby, in your arms, baby)
Do you wanna be a hero?
Can I lay in your arms?
Can you tell me it's alright, even though I know it's not?
Ooh
Can I lay back into the dark? (In your arms, baby, in your arms, baby)

Oh, I lied to you and made you feel small
Watch you fade away until you had no more
By the time I realized that you were walking out my door

And tell me, where do we go when this shit gets so real?
We can't find the words to say, (oh-oh)
I'm standing here in limbo
If this is what we're in for then maybe I don't want it anyway

Innocent or guilty, will you save me if I stay?
See the world in color, tell me everything's okay, ooh
Can I lay back into the dark? (In your arms, baby, in your arms, baby)
Do you wanna be a hero?
Can I lay in your arms?
Can you tell me it's alright, even though I know it's not?
Ooh
Can I lay back into the dark? (In your arms, baby, in your arms, baby)

And tell me, where do we go when this shit gets so real?
We can't find the words to say
I'm standing here in limbo
If this is what we're in for then maybe I don't want it anyway

Innocent or guilty, will you save me if I stay?
See the world in color, tell me everything's okay, ooh
Can I lay back into the dark? (In your arms, baby, in your arms, baby)
Do you wanna be a hero?
Can I lay in your arms?
Can you tell me it's alright
Even though I know it's not? Ooh
Can I lay back into the dark? (In your arms, baby, in your arms, baby)

In your arms, baby, in your arms, baby
In your arms, baby, in your arms, baby
In your arms, baby, in your arms, baby
Can I lay back into the dark?
In your arms, baby, in your arms, baby
