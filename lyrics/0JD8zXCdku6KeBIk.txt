The city feels clean this time of night
Just empty streets and me walking home
To clear my head, I know it came as no surprise
I'm affected more than I had guessed on what was said

If this loves not meant to be
If a heart's not ready to open
If the naked eye won't see it's broken

If this loves not meant to be
If a heart's not ready to open
If the naked eye won't see it's broken

It's the quiet time before the dawn
And I'm half past making sense of it
Was I wrong?

Should I claim to give it all
In a world where not much
Ever seems to last long?

If this loves not meant to be
If a heart's not ready to open
If the naked eye won't see it's broken

If this loves not meant to be
If a heart's not ready to open
If the naked eye won't see how it's broken

How it's broken

If this loves not meant to be
If a heart's not ready to open
If the naked eye won't see it's broken

If this loves not meant to be
If a heart's not ready to open
If the naked eye won't see it's broken
If this loves not meant to be
If a heart's not ready to open
If the naked eye won't see how it's broken
How it's broken
How it's broken
How it's broken
