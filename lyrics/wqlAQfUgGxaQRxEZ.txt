We are snowflakes
Drifting to the end
We are snowflakes
Drifting to the end

Like leaves falling
Off the trees of winter
The sun goes down
And you never come around
The moon fades away
And the stars are blowing up
Like the leaves on the trees
In the winter we die

We are snowflakes
Drifting to the end
We are snowflakes
Drifting to the end

Like leaves falling
Off the trees of winter
The sun goes down
And you never come around
The moon fades away
And the stars are blowing up
Like the leaves on the trees
In the winter we die
