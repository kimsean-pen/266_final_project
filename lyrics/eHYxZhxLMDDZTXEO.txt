I've got syphilitic hetro friends in every part of town
I don't hate them but I know them I don't want them hanging around
I won't roll my bones for every little girl who gets on down
I got space and space got me I should be selling it by the pound
Ever since I heard the voice I thought I had no choice but then I kissed her
I don't mind if I get broken I don't mind if I get fixed
I don't mind if I'm not spoken I don't mind if I get kicks
If I wake up dead I'll wake up just like any other day
And the photographs of God I bought have almost fade away
Everything just passes by I thought it always would but then I kissed her
