So what are you doing back?
Well, I sat back and thought about the things we used to do
It really meant a lot to me, you mean a lot to me
I really mean that much to you?
Girl, you know it's true

I'm in love with you, girl, that's on my mind
You're the one I think about 'lmost every time
The way you pack a smile in everything you do
Don't you understand, girl, this love is true?
You're soft, succulent, so sweet and thin
That's kind of like a vision upon your skin
It lightens up my day, and that's oh so true
Together we're one, separated we're two
To make you all mine, all mine is my desire
'Cause you contain a quality, you that I admire
To put it plain and simple,
you rule my world
so try to understand

I'm in love, girl
I'm so in love, girl
I'm just in love, girl,
and this is true

Girl, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you
Yes, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you

Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you

This is some sort of thing, girl, I can't explain
My emotions start up when I hear your name
Maybe your sweet, sweet voice would ring in my ears
Stimulates my system when you are near
With your positive emotions, laughs make you jump
You don't need to fuss, girl or boy
These feelings I get, I often wonder why
So I thought I might discuss this, girl, just you and I
Now what you wear, I don't care, and if you fussed before
The reason that I like you, girl, for what you are
If I said I'd think about it, you rule my world
So try to understand

I'm in love, girl
I'm so in love, girl
I'm just in love girl,
and this is true

Girl, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you
Yes, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you

Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you

I'm in love with you, girl
I'm in love with you, girl
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you

Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you
Girl, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you
Yes, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you
