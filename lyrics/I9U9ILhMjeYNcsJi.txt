Locked up behind these walls
Ages of trying to cope
Behind December's walls

Years and years of finding myself
This was the longest journey I've ever made
Days of wasting tears and no one cares
Countless nights, drowning in worthless nightmares
Ages of trying to cope
Ages of not giving up hope

Keeping alive the hope for a deeper sense
For a better understanding of my world
My destiny, my goals and myself
Climbing out of that endless misery
No security, no confirmation of an end
Alone in the masses, Alone in the masses...
Alone in the masses
Yeah!

Is there anybody on my side?
Please appear now
I feel, I feel myself slowly crumbling
Yeah!

And when the rain is coming I can feel myself melting into the ground
Becoming the puppet I never meant to be

I don't know how, I don't know why
So sure I don't deserve this
But there came an eastern wind that brought me forward
Pushed me out of the sludge
Formed my actual self
Buried my inner demons
Locked up December's walls
(Locked up) Behind December's walls

The rain can't force me down, can't force me down anymore
I'm strong enough to hold back the storms now
Seeing my visions clear like never before
From that day I met you
For what you are, for what you saw in me
Now I can see clearly all the wrong paths I took
The prospect is perfect

From the roof I see down the walls
From the roof I am bulletproof
I am bulletproof
(From the roof I see down the walls, from the roof)
I am bulletproof, I am bulletproof...

And if the vultures are ever circling above me again
You can be sure I won't let you go
Because I know you can still feel my passion
Strengthened by the scars I've collected in the past
I will move heaven and earth to save this
Because...
I am bulletproof!
I... AM... BULLETPROOF!
