This world is empty without you now
This world is empty without you

Tonight, tonight, tonight, you're gonna see me cry
Tonight, tonight, tonight, you're gonna see me cry

Why do you love somebody else?
Why do you love somebody else?
I've never loved somebody else
Why do you love somebody else?

This world is empty without you now
This world is empty without you

Tonight, tonight, tonight, you're gonna see me cry
Tonight, tonight, tonight, you're gonna see me cry

Why do you love somebody else?
Why do you love somebody else?
I've never loved somebody else
Why do you love somebody else?

Why do you love somebody else?
Why do you love somebody else?
I've never loved somebody else
Why do you love somebody else?
