This time we are certain
A cloud draws color running red
I'll bury my hands in black water
Undercover where they've bled
Oh reconcile these actions
In tune and unaware
Where is my matchmaker
Tell me how you live your life
Cold cool flesh killing night
Without warm light becoming nothing
I watch the falling embers beckon
Come inside, come to me
Unaware of this growing tension
The stillness quips at your retreat
Where is my matchmaker
Tell me how you live your life
Cold cool flesh killing night
Without warm light becoming nothing
Oh reconcile these actions
Covet it's murk and bleak relief
Casting fuel into the fire
In it we find the truth we seek
