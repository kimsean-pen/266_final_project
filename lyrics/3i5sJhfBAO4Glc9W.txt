All we are
Is broken glass
Thrown to the floor
We were never meant to last

And all we are
Are empty shells
Try to pick us up
You're gonna cut yourself

We march the streets at night
Looking for a thrill
Looking for a fight
It was the first day of
The rest of our lives

We were fast
Never gonna die
Riding up the highway 45

We didn't know
We couldn't go on forever

All we are
Is broken glass
Thrown to the floor
We were never meant to last

And all we are
Are empty shells
Try to pick us up
You're gonna cut yourself

We fought to rule the world
I know it just how fragile we really were
Like it was the first day of
The rest of our lives

Then the bricks began to fall
And we can see the cracks along the wall
We didn't know
It couldn't go on forever

All we are
Is broken glass
Thrown to the floor
We were never meant to last

And all we are
Are empty shells
Try to pick us up
You're gonna cut yourself

We believed
That we
Could go on forever

We believed
That we
Could go on forever
Forever

All we are
Is broken glass
Thrown to the floor
We were never meant to last

And all we are
Are empty shells
Try to pick us up
You're gonna cut yourself

Cut yourself
You're gonna
Cut yourself
You're gonna
Cut yourself
