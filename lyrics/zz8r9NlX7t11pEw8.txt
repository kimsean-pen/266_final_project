I come home, in the morning light
My mother says: "When you gonna live your life right?"
Oh momma dear, we're not the fortunate ones
And girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have fun

The phone rings, in the middle of the night
My father yells: "What you gonna do with your life?"
Oh daddy dear, you know you're still number one
But girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have

That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have (girls) fun (they want)
(Wanna have fun)
(Girls)
(Wanna have)

Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world
I wanna be the one to walk in the sun
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have

That's all they really want
Is some fun
When the working day is done
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have (girls) fun (they want)
(Wanna have fun)
(Girls)
(Wanna have)

They just wanna, they just wanna (girls)
They just wanna, they just wanna
(Girls just wanna have fun)
Oh, girls
Girls just wanna have fun
They just wanna, they just wanna
They just wanna, they just wanna (Girls)
They just wanna, they just wanna
(Girls just wanna have fun)
Girls, girls just wanna have fun

When the workin'
When the working day is done
Oh, when the working day is done
Oh, girls
Girls just wanna have fun
They just wanna, they just wanna (girls)
They just wanna, they just wanna
(Girls just wanna have fun)
Oh, girls
Girls just wanna have fun
(They just wanna, they just wanna)
When the workin'
When the working day is done
(They just wanna, they just wanna)
Oh, when the working day is done
(Oh, girls)
(Girls just wanna have fun)
