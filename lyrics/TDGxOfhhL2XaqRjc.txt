Walking after dark
In the New York City park
Your thoughts are so unholy
In the holiest of holes
Onward Christian soldier
Filled with jive and mind control

The blood left on the dance floor
Runnin', runnin' red
The bullet that you asked for killing you to your death
Unless you

Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Voices in my head are saying, "Shoot that fucker down"

We are the vultures
The dirtiest kind
They culture war's
In your heart and your mind

Walking after dark
In the New York City park
I'll pick up what's left in the club
A pocket full of pills
Sodom and Gomorrah
In the century of thrills

The blood left on the dance floor
Runnin', runnin' red
The bullet that you asked for killing you to your death
Unless you

Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Hold him under water 'til that motherfucker drowns

We are the vultures
The dirtiest kind
The culture war's
In your heart and your mind

Someone's gonna get you boy...
Shoot that fucker down!

Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ (Walking after dark...)
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ (Walking after dark...)
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ (Walking after dark...)
Someone kill the DJ, shoot that fucker down! (Wow!)

Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Voices in my head are saying, "Shoot that fucker down"
