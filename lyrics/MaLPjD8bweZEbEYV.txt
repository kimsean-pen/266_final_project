Meet up to keep things ticking over,
Meet up and have a lovely time,
And trust me I really do, I just don't get that funny feeling,
When you're around, I get what I'm supposed to do.

I'm thinking maybe I could live with it,
Just give me a minute tonight, you can make me feel alright,
Get with it, just give me a minute tonight.

We're gonna burn like,
Fire, fire, fire
Like fire, fire, fire
Watch me burn it down, watch me burn it down
Na na na na na na na
Like fire, fire, fire
Like a fire, fire, fire
Burn it to the ground, burn it to the ground
Na na na na na na na

I'll confuse affection for passion,
And I'll learn to miss you when you're gone,
And trust me I really will, I just won't get that funny feeling,
When you're around, I get how I'm supposed to feel.

I'm thinking I'll get used to living with it,
You can make me feel alright.

We're gonna burn like,
Fire, fire, fire
Like fire, fire, fire
Watch me burn it down, watch me burn it down
Na na na na na na na
Like fire, fire, fire
Like a fire, fire, fire
Burn it to the ground, burn it to the ground
Na na na na na na na

Light that spark, try to look the other way,
But your eyes how they flutter, ooh you turn the fool to stone
Find that spark, a needle in the hay,
Cos I don't have the stones, we're gonna light, we're gonna light it up.

Fire, fire, fire
Like fire, fire, fire
Watch me burn it down, watch me burn it down
Na na na na na na na
Like fire, fire, fire
Like a fire, fire, fire
Burn it to the ground, burn it to the ground
Na na na na na na na

Hey, I just don't get that feeling.
Just gimme a minute, just gimme a minute.
Hey, I just don't get that feeling.
You can make me feel, you can make me feel alright.
