Beautiful God

Laying your majesty aside
You reached out in love to show me life
Lifted from darkness into life, oh
King for a slave

Trading your righteousness for shame
Despite all my pride and foolish ways
Caught in your infinite embrace, oh
And I find myself here on my knees again

Caught up in grace like an avalanche
Nothing compares to this love, love, love
Burning in my heart
Saviour and friend

Breathing your life into my heart
Your word it the lamp unto my path
Forever I'm humbled by your love, oh
And I find myself here on my knees again

Caught up in grace like an avalanche
Nothing compares to this love, love, love
Burning in my heart
Take my life, take all that I am

With all that I am
I will love you
Take my heart, take all that I have
Jesus, how I adore you
Take my life, take all that I am

With all that I am
I will love you
Take my heart, take all that I have
Jesus, how I adore you
And I find myself here on my knees again
Caught up in grace like an avalanche
Nothing compares to this love, love, love
Burning in my heart
