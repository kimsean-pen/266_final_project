Should you take me from this darkness left inside

Left inside

Left inside

Hiding right in plain sight
With that pathetic eyes
Run into addiction
The darkness kept inside
So empty
Pretending
Under the fallen sky
Keep staying rearranging
To hold the mirror of mind
You lose nothing with no life

Would it kill you
Does it thrill you
Could you make this living satisfy
To become you to replace you
Should you take me from this darkness left inside

Left inside

Left inside

Day dreamer high fever
The nightmares come to life
That takes you
Animates you
Satisfy every fight
Go away far away
Create some guiding light
Deny these bitter feelings
Coping process final flight
You lose nothing with no life

Would it kill you
Does it thrill you
Could you make this living satisfy
To become you to replace you
Should you take me from this darkness left inside

Would it kill you
Does it thrill you
Could you make this living satisfy
To become you to replace you
Should you take me from this darkness left inside

Throw it all away
Throw it all away
Throw it all away
Throw it all away

Would it kill you
Does it thrill you
Could you make this living satisfy
To become you to replace you
Should you take me from this darkness left inside

Left inside

To become you to replace you
Should you take me from this darkness left inside

Darkness left inside
Darkness left inside
Darkness left inside
