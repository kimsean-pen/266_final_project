Here I am, playing with those memories again
And just when I thought time had set me free
Those thoughts of you keep taunting me
Holding you, a feeling I never out grew

Though each and every part of me has tried
Only you can fill that space inside
So there's no sense pretending
My heart is not mending

Just when I thought I was over you
And just when I thought I could stand on my own
Oh baby, those memories come crashing through
And I just can't go on without you

On my own, I've tried to make the best of it alone
I've done everything I can to ease the pain
But only you can stop the rain
I just can't live without you, I miss everything about you

Just when I thought I was over you
And just when I thought I could stand on my own
Oh baby, those memories come crashing through
And I just can't go on without, go on without
It's just no good without

Just when I thought I was over you
(Without you)
Just when I thought I could stand on my own
(Without you)

Just when I thought I was over you
(Without you)
Just when I thought I could stand on my own
(Without you)
Just when I thought I was over you
(Without you)
Just when I thought I could stand on my own
(Without you)
