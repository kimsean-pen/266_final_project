What was it that brought you west
I assume i can only guess
It's the question to what i've asked
That appear when time has passed
It felt like many years
Taking apart our home
I dug through forty years all alone

on my own
on my own
on my own
on my own

Was it all the palm dreams
Placed where they shouldn't it be
That made you feel complete
In this land of make believe

like going 65 on the 5 in 5
like going 65 on the 5 in 5

on my own
on my own
on my own
on my own

I am still bereaved
Come every ocean breeze
Was it all the palm trees
Placed where they shouldn't be
That made you feel complete
In this land of make believe

What was it that brought you west
What was it that brought you west
What was it that brought you west
Where i lay my head to rest
It felt like many years
Taking apart our home
I dug through forty years, all alone.
