Where do we go from here?
How do we carry on?
I can't get beyond the questions

Clambering for the scraps
In the shatter of us collapsed
That cuts me with every could-have-been

Pain on pain on play repeating
With the backup, makeshift life in waiting

Everybody says
Time heals everything
But what of the wretched hollow?
The endless in-between?
Are we just going to wait it out?

There's nothing to see here now
Turning the sign around
We're closed to the earth 'til further notice

A stumbling cliched case
Crumpled and puffy faced
Dead in the stare of a thousand miles

All I want, only one, street-level miracle
I'll be an out-in-out, born-again, from none more cynical

Everybody says
That time heals everything
All in the end
What of the wretched hollow?
The endless in-between?
Are we just going to wait it out?

And sit here cold, we will be long gone by then
In lackluster, in dust we layer on old magazines,
Fluorescent lighting sets the scene
For all we could and should be being
In the one life that we've got

In the one life that we've got

Everybody says
That time heals everything
What of the wretched hollow?
The endless in-between?
Are we just going to wait it out?

And sit here
Just going to wait it out
And sit here cold
Just going to sweat it out
Wait it out
