I was frozen there
Paralyzed and floating in the air
Or I thought
Cuz no one really knows
Who could've saw

So I wanted her
To feel the breeze
Just blowing through the trees
A ghost
Of something in our love we don't yet know

It's such an arbitrary line and we dance
We waited centuries to throw up our hands
It's such an arbitrary line and we dance
We dance we dance
Oh everything is debatable
everything is debatable

So I waited there
Burdened by some things I shouldn't have
Cared about
I brushed them off
And dug my heart right out

It's such an arbitrary line and we dance
We waited centuries to throw up our hands
It's such an arbitrary line and we dance
We dance we dance
Oh everything is debatable
everything is debatable

I seem kinda strange
I saw the other side
Floating around in the room
I realized
You thought I'd look the same
Despite some touch (?) and I was
Darting around after you

It's such an arbitrary line and we dance
We waited centuries to throw up our hands
It's such an arbitrary line and we dance
We dance we dance
Oh everything is debatable
I saw the other side
The other side and beyond, oh
Everything is debatable
Everything is debatable

Everything is debatable
Debatable
Everything is
