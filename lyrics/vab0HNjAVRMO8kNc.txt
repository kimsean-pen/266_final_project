Oh it's you I know, you're the one I dream of
Look into my eyes, take me to the clouds above
Oh I lose control, can't seem to get enough
When I wake from dream, tell me, is it really love?

How will I know if you really love me
I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things

How will I know if you're thinking of me
I try to phone but I'm too shy, can't speak
Falling in love is so bitter sweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak

Oh wake me, I'm shaking
Wish I had you near me now
Said there's no mistaking
What I feel is really love

How will I know
How will I know
How will I know
How will I know

How will I know if you really love me
I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things

How will I know if you're thinking of me
I try to phone but I'm too shy, can't speak
Falling in love is all bitter sweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak

If you love me
If you love me now
If you love me
If you love me now
