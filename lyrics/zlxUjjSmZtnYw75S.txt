Free, you better love me
And hide or run away
From all your yesterdays

Speak the truth or make your peace some other way
Oh yeah, yeah
I never knew but I believed that you'll trust in me
Oh, well speak to me!

And way beyond your controlling mind
And no more believing in all your precious lies, yeah

Speak the truth or make your peace some other way
Oh yeah, yeah
Well I never knew but I believed that you'll trust in me
Oh, well speak to me!

Speak the truth or make your peace some other way
Oh yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I never knew but I believed that you'll trust in me
Oh, well speak to me!
