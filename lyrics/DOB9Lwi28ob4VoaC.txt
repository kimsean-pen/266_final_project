wear their marks
deep-rooted abuse bread apathy
colossal stone, reborn
vile inhumanity
primitive retribution
malevolent solutions
new spirit infiltrating
divine hatred

violence
is forever
your silence
forced this war

final death march
corpses left in the dark depths
peace uncoils
push the pain threshold
grotesque beings
souless heathens
unleashing hostility
harvesting hatred

violence
is forever
your silence
forced this war

manipulation
intimidation
retaliation
no hesitation
annihilation
violence
