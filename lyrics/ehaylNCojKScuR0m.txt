You know it is twelve o'clock
In Soho, baby
It's gin o'clock where I wake up
I don't know
And I think about you, lo
Everywhere I go
And I've done everythin' and
I've been everywhere, you know

I've been fed gold by sweet
Fools in Abu Dhabi
And I've danced real slow with
Rockettes on Dodge and Molly

But I've had no love like
Your love, ooh, I'm nobody
I'd be appalled if I saw you
Ever try to be a saint
I wouldn't fall for someone
I thought couldn't misbehave
But I want you to know that
I've had no love like your love

Honey, when you warm
The bed on Wednesday
It's suicide Tuesday back in LA
If I had the choice between
Here and Illinois
Excitement of a thousand
Dollars turnin' up your voice

At first chance, I'd take the
Bed warmed by the body, woo
I once warmed my hands
Over a burnin' Maserati, woo

Still I've had no love like
Your love from nobody
I'd be appalled if I saw you
Ever try to be a saint
I wouldn't fall for someone
I thought couldn't misbehave
But I want you to know that
I've had no love like your love

And on the other side, why
Should we deny the truth?
We could have less to worry about
Honey, I won't lie to you
But everything I do
I've had no love like your love
