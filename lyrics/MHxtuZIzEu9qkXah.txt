Welcome boy
Welcome girl
Step into a world
Where the city never sleeps
The music rocks
And the beat never stops
Let the bassline kick your feet
When the beatbox grooves
Get down and move
Never felt this feeling before
You know that you want it
So show that you got it
For sure, for sure

No sleep for the wicked
No fun for the good
Take it or leave it
You know that you should
No sleep for the wicked
No fun for the good
You're living a lie to where we should

Stop
'Cos now we're back on top
And everywhere that we go
We're gonna let the beat drop
I said
Stop
'Cos now we're back on top
And everywhere that we go
We're gonna let the beat drop

We're gonna let the beat drop

When the city chills
We get our thrills
It's the good times rolled into one
Hit the floor
'Cos the music is pure
Give it up and join the fun

No sleep for the wicked
No fun for the good
Take it or leave it
You know that you should
No sleep for the wicked
No fun for the good
You're living a lie to where we should

Stop
'Cos now we're back on top
And everywhere that we go
We're gonna let the beat drop
I said
Stop
'Cos now we're back on top
And everywhere that we go
We're gonna let the beat drop

Move to the groove
Of the soothing beat
Show what we know
Cos that's all you need

Stop
'Cos now we're back on top
And everywhere that we go
We're gonna let the beat drop
I said
Stop
'Cos now we're back on top
And everywhere that we go
We're gonna let the beat drop
