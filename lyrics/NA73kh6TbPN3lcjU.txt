There's a song that I'm looking for
Ooo-oo-oo
Nobody plays it nowadays
Ooo-oo-oo
But it made me so happy
Ooo-oo-oo
Now it's all that I'm looking for
Ooo-oo-oo
There's a song that I'm looking for
Nobody plays it anymore
They don't know what they're missing
They never heard the song long ago
Oh no
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
It was such a long, long time ago
Ooo-oo-oo
Back in another life
Ooo-oo-oo
People looked so different then
Ooo-oo-oo
Because they were smiling
Ooo-oo-oo
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it in my radio
Oooooooo...
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
oh, play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
