I, I am the one
The one
Who lost control
Control
But in the end I'd be the
Last Man Standing

I, I am the one
The one
Who sold his soul
His soul
Forever gone to be the
Last Man Standing tall

Glorious, noble in my mind
Everything a fight to win
Taking all and giving
Whatever my pride would let me
Not backing down, not giving in
I wouldn't lose, I couldn't die

I, I am the one
The one
Who lost control
Control
But in the end I'd be the
Last Man Standing

I, I am the one
The one
Who sold his soul
His soul
Forever gone to be the
Last Man Standing tall

I walk alone with my head held high
Never felt that I belonged
Stand my ground at all costs
Running through life with blindfolds
Just for the right, right to be wrong
Nothing would rule my world but i

I, I am the one
The one
Who lost control
Control
But in the end I'd be the
Last Man Standing

I, I am the one
The one
Who sold his soul
His soul
Forever gone to be the
Last Man Standing tall

Nothing would rule my world but i

I, I am the one
The one
Who lost control
Control
But in the end I'd be the
Last Man Standing

I, I am the one
The one
Who sold his soul
His soul
Forever gone to be the
Last Man Standing

I, I am the one
The one
Who lost control
Control
But in the end I'd be the
Last Man Standing

I, I am the one
The one
Who sold his soul
His soul
Forever gone to be the
Last Man Standing tall

Seeing clearer what I've done
I'd refuse to let things go
I could never once admit I'm wrong
And what do I have to show?

Seeing clearer what's at stake
And the things I have to change
I just hope I can, it's not too late
To get a chance to end this pain
