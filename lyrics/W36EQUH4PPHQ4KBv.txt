Quietly, almost elusively
Almost invisibly, I found that I
For a moment had slipped away

Ripped in two, then pasted back again
Then crumpled up inside, then tossed aside
You know that it feels so bad

Oh, Mercury
Oh, Mercury

Happened once and then it happened twice
And then it happened thrice and now a fourth
You know that? Did you know that?

Ripped in two, then pasted back again
Then crumpled up inside, then tossed aside
You know that it feels so bad

Oh, Mercury
Oh, Mercury

Quietly, almost elusively
Almost invisibly, I found that I
For a moment had slipped away

Ripped in two, then pasted back again
Then crumpled up inside, then tossed aside
You know that it feels so bad

Oh, Mercury
Oh, Mercury

Oh, Mercury
Oh, Mercury
