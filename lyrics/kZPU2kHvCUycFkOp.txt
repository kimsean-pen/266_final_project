Don't listen to my heart, don't listen to my friends
Keep hoping things get better
Don't listen when we fight, don't care when you cry
Keep hoping things better

Don't blame me, I'm not the same me
Lost sight of what I want
Don't blame me, I'm not the same me (I'm not the same me)

If we're not miserable then show me misery
Cause our hearts don't agree and this is killing me

We used to make love, it was all ok
Now we just fuck to hide the pain
What was innocence has turned to shame

Don't blame me, I'm not the shame me
Lost sight of what I want
Don't blame me, I'm not the shame me (I'm not the shame me)

If we're miserable then show my misery
Cause our hearts don't agree and this is killing me
I don't believe in anything
You want what's worst for me

(Please show my misery)

I'm not the shame me, I'm not the shame me
I'm not the shame me, I'm not the shame me
You'll never save me, You'll never save me
You'll never save me, You'll never save me

If we're miserable then show my misery
Cause our hearts don't agree and this is killing me
I don't believe in anything
You want what's worst for me
