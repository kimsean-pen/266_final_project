Awake to the sound of emptiness
Alone and in a room that's filled with the darkest of light
I was told there was nothing beyond here
How do I know what side I'm on
How do I know what side I'm on
How do I know what side I'm on
How do I know what side I'm on
Breathe
A captive with nothing but the thoughts engraved in my skin.
I don't belong here
But I can't find my exit
This is where they all come to hunt me down hunt me down
Where they come to hunt me down
They hunt me down
Weigh up the options
Breath the new world
I know what you're thinking
Come on man I swear you can do this
Come on man I swear you can do this
I break free from this room they built for me
I break free from this room they built for me
This is where they all come to hunt me down hunt me down
Where they come to hunt me down
They hunt me down
I tore out my naive eyes
So they locked me up
Preying on the innocent
Preying on the innocent
