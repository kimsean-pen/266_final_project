Can we separate a body from mind and the soul
Come together trying to find where to go
Can we separate a body from mind and the soul
And celebrate a life as lot of 'em gone
This place is alive in more ways than you know
And my love for you stronger is than rocking and roll
And this place is alive in the place you don't know
As we celebrate a life as lot of 'em gone

Can we separate a body from mind and the soul
Come together trying to find where to go
And this place is alive in the place you don't know
As we celebrate a life as lot of 'em gone
Yeah, there's a lot of them gone.
But you know that's how a change is gonna come
So look the future in the eye and be strong
And feel love inside your heart forever more
Forever more, forever more
And feel love inside your heart forever more
Forever more, forever more
And feel love inside your heart forever more
Forever love, forever love, forever love, forever love
Been so long but I feel it in my heart
Forever love, feel it in my heart,
Forever love, feel it in my heart,
Forever love, feel it in my heart
Been so long but I feel you in my heart forever

Can we separate the truth from the things we know
Then bring 'em all together to free the soul,
Let's separate the truth from the things that we know
And celebrate the mind and the body and soul
This place is alive in more ways than you know
And a fire is burning inside of my soul
This place is alive and we're ready to go
And celebrate a life cause a lot of 'em gone
Can we separate the truth from the things we know
Then bring 'em all together to free the soul,
This place is alive and we're ready to go

Oh, the city may have changed
And the year may be completely different
But my love remains
Oh, my love is still the same
Oh the melody may be changed
And the beat may be completely different
But my love remains
Oh, my love is still the same
Oh, my love, oh, my love is still the same

Forever love, feel it my heart
Forever love, feel it in my heart,
Forever love, got your love, feel it in my heart
Forever love, been so long, but I feel it in my heart forever.
