Hot change
Got it right in the groove
And a rang-a-tang Joe
Is a ring-a-ding mood
A little racka tacka tacka tacka run done thing
A racka tacka tacka tacka run done thing
A racka tacka tacka tacka run done thing
Everybody wanna get rich right away
Right away, right away, right away
Everybody wanna get rich right away
Everybody wanna be king for a day
Everybody wanna get rich right away
If you wanna be rich and you wanna be wealthy
I believe I'd rather be poor and healthy
If you wanna be rich and you wanna be wealthy
I believe I'd rather be poor and healthy
A racka tacka tacka tacka rum-dum thing
It's a racka tacka tacka tacka rum-dum game
A racka tacka tacka tacka rum-dum thing
It's a racka tacka tacka tacka rum-dum game.
