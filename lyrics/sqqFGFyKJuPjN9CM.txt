You know i do my best thinking when i'm flying down the bridge.
Humming to myself and kicking up my kicks
.have to... for my life
I hope i won't crush like another summer,
I'm back on the bridge was just a wooden half,
Like he said it was back in 56.

I thought i'd learnt from my mistakes,
I thought he'd learnt from my mistakes,
I thought you'd give me the right advice,
I thought he let me in for one last time.

...like an old time movie,
She's got kind of a native vibe before that was so cool
She's got kind of a native vibe before i knew who was who
And he's ignoring me like it's 2001.
Why keep time travelling if it doesn't get better on me?
A second time move on,
Why keep time travelling if it doesn't get better on me?
A second time move on,

I thought i'd learnt from my mistakes,
I thought he'd learnt from my mistakes,
I thought you'd give me the right advice,
I thought he let me in for one last time.

.on another sunday morning,
Carrying umbrella, and talking on the phone!
Cut my hand and my knees.
. from california and i swear, i swear they're here!
I swear they saved my life!

I thought i'd learnt from my mistakes,
I thought he'd learnt from my mistakes,
I thought you'd give me the right advice,
I thought he let me in for one last time.

I thought i'd learnt from my mistakes,
I thought he'd learnt from my mistakes,
I thought you'd give me the right advice,
I thought he let me in for one last time.
