Dark is getting darker
Feel it all together
Could we come closer?
It's all right

'Cause there's not much time left to spend
Together
In our world
It's cool
To believe it

I need a real lover
Red red rover
Call me over

Don't keep me wondering
How you've been
'Cause it's the time to know

How it feels
In our world
It's cool
My love

I need a real lover
