So while I'm turning in my sheets
And once again, I cannot sleep
Walk out the door and up the street
Look at the stars beneath my feet
Remember rights that I did wrong
So here I go

Hello, hello
There is no place I cannot go
My mind is muddy but
My heart is heavy, does it show?
I lose the track that loses me
So here I go

Ahuuuuu Ahuuuuu Ahuuuuu

And so I sent some men to fight
And one came back at dead of night
Said he'd seen my enemy
Said he looked just like me
So I set out to cut myself
And here I go

Ahuuuuu Ahuuuuu Ahuuuuu

I'm not calling for a second chance
I'm screaming at the top of my voice
Give me reason, but don't give me choice
'Cause I'll just make the same mistake again

Ahuuuuu

And maybe someday we will meet
And maybe talk and not just speak
Don't buy the promises 'cause
There are no promises I keep
And my reflection troubles me
So here I go

Ahuuuuu Ahuuuuu Ahuuuuu

I'm not calling for a second chance
I'm screaming at the top of my voice
Give me reason, but don't give me choice
'Cause I'll just make the same mistake

I'm not calling for a second chance
I'm screaming at the top of my voice
Give me reason, but don't give me choice
'Cause I'll just make the same mistake again

Ahuuuuu Ahuuuuu Ahuuuuu

(Ahuuuuu) Saw the world turning in my sheets
(Ahuuuuu) And once again, I cannot sleep
(Ahuuuuu) Walk out the door and up the street
(Ahuuuuu) Look at the stars
(Ahuuuuu) Look at the stars fall down
(Ahuuuuu) And I wonder where
(Ahuuuuu) Did I go wrong
