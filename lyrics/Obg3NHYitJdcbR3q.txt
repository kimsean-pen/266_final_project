Fair Roseanna,
your vagrancy's a familiar tale
fraught with danger,
the lives you led were judged for fame
hatred enfolds us,
inculpates the minds with it's heresy
laymen enfold us,
clemency arrives to set you free!

Fate...
Although Xavier has prayed
that life-giving waters may rain
down on the souls of men
to cure them of their pain.

These were the sins of Xavier's past
hung like jewels in the forest of veils.

Deep in the heart where the mysteries emerge
Eve bears the stigma of original sin
freedom so high when we all are bound by laws
etched in the scheme of nature's own hand
unseen by those who fail in their pursuit of fate.

Although Xavier has prayed
that life-giving waters may rain
down on the souls of men
to cure them of their ways

And as the night turns into day
oh the sun, the moon, wish away
although your nightmares come home to stay
Xavier's love lies in chains

These were the sins of Xavier's past
hung like jewels in the forest of veils
