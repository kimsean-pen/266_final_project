on the floor of your room
i pressed myself flat against the rug
you told me "you're possessed"
there's something inside
and i hadn't felt the love not in a while
it used to make me sick; not anymore
almost every night, i see it glow
i know you will go, you've made that clear
but i've never felt a love like this before
