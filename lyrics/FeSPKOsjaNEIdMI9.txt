Purple haze all in my brain
Lately things just don't seem the same
Actin' funny, but I don't know why
'Scuse me while I kiss the sky

Purple Haze all around
Don't know if I'm comin' up or down
Am I happy or in misery?
What ever it is, that girl put a spell on me

Help me
Help me
(Oh, no, no)

(Hammerin')
(Talkin' 'bout heart 'n'...s-soul)
(I'm talkin' about hard stuff)
(If everbodys still around, fluff and ease, if)
(So far out my mind)
(Somethings happening, somethings happening)

(Ooo, ahhh)
(Ooo, {click} ahhh)
(Ooo, ahhh)
(Ooo, ahhh)
YEAH!
Purple haze all in my eyes
Don't know if its day or night
You got me blowin', blowin' my mind

Is it tomorrow, or just the end of time?

Help me
Ahh, yea-yeah, purple haze, yeah
(Oh, no, oh)
(Oh, help me)
(Purple haze, Tell me, baby, tell me)
(I can't go on like this)
(Purple haze)
(You're makin' me blow my mind... mama)
(Purple haze, n-no, nooo)
(Purple haze, no, its painful, baby)
