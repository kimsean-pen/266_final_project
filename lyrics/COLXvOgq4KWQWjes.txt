The sea said goodbye to the shore so the sun wouldn't notice
The seaweed it wrapped its arms around you

The calm on my cheek feels like the fall grass
And I run through the tall trees with your hands chasing me

The books that I keep by my bed are full of the stories
That I drew up from a little dream of mine, a little nightmare of yours.

And beat us to take this bludge to forgive and forget
To be the better man, be a better man, be a better man.

So love me mother, and love me father, and love my sister as well
So love me mother, and love me father, and love my brother as well

They cast the silhouette as big as a monster in this concrete jungle,
The streetlights hang in their house

So make all your last demands, for I will forsake you
And I'll meet your eyes for the very first time, for the very last.

So love me mother, and love me father, and love my sister as well
So love me mother, and love me father, and love my brother as well
So love me mother, and love me father, and love my sister as well
So love me mother, and love me father, and love my brother as well

I met a man today and he smiled back at me
Oh there are thoughts like these that keep me on my feet, that keep me on my feet.
