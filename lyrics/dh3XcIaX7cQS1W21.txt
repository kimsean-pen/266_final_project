Crowds push and shove down the street
in a bus fume haze
building for a new day
what'll become of you and me, our love?
i wanna shout from the roof
no these things they just don't do
will they wait for me and you
or just leave us both behind?
i dont know

she said, "man, i don't wanna play around with words
i just wanna lay with you"
i can't solve the problems in this world
its breaking my brain in two

hey baby, don't you know our dreams they are the same?
we're waiting on you
don't want you for your time
and promise you a lie
say it isn't true!
lately i can tell that you're scared
well we're growing up
said maybe if you changed your hair
you'd be good enough
for kids i used to know that died
now they're not around
i wonder what they think of life
when they're looking down

wanna walk to your door
so i heard from the store
and i ring on your bell
cause i see that you are home
and awake for a while
and i look up to the sky
but nobody comes back
on my feet i was straight to the place
where we were where you said all the words
that you meant for me then
do you still mean em now?
i cant see how you do
but i hope thats true

she said, "well right now you and i were getting high
but we don't have to be this way."
maybe i don't wanna say goodbye
but thats all i aim to say

hey baby, don't you know our dreams they are the same?
we're waiting on you
don't want you for your time
and promise you a lie
say it isn't true!
lately i can tell that you're scared
well we're growing up
said maybe if you changed your hair
you'd be good enough
for kids i used to know that died
now they're not around
i wonder what they think of life
when they're looking down...
