Hey, haven't seen you around in a while
Hey, haven't seen you around in a while
Hey, haven't seen you around in a while
Hey

I didn't go to work for a month
I didn't leave my bed for eight days straight
I haven't hung out with anyone
If I did, I'd have nothing to say

I didn't feel angry or depressed
I didn't feel anything at all
I didn't want to go to bed
And I didn't want to stay up late

When you're livin' your life, well
That's the price you pay

Whenever I breath out, you're breathin' it in
Whenever I speak out, you're speakin' it in
Whenever I breath out, you're breathin' it in
Whenever I speak out, you're speakin' it in

I'm feeling this positive, negative, positive, negative
I'm feeling this positive, negative, positive, negative
I'm feeling this positive, negative, positive, negative

Whenever I breath out, you're breathin' it in
Whenever I speak out, you're speakin' it in
Whenever I breath out, you're breathin' it in
Whenever I speak out, you're speakin' it in

I didn't go to work for a month
I didn't leave my bed for eight days straight
I haven't hung out with anyone
If I did, I'd have nothing to say
