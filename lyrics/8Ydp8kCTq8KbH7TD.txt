Hey now, hey now
What's the matter with you?
Girls just wanna have fun now

I come home in the morning light
My mother says when you gonna live your life right
Oh mother dear we're not the fortunate ones
And girls they want to have fun
Oh girls just want to have fun

Hey now, hey now
What's the matter with you?
Girls just wanna have fun now
Come on

The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells what you gonna do with your life
Oh daddy dear you know you're still number one
But girls they want to have fun
Oh girls just want to have

That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
You know girls, they want to have fun

Hey now, hey now
What's the matter with you?
Girls just wanna have fun now
Come on

Hey now, hey now
What's the matter with you?
Girls just wanna have fun now

And the boys they wanna have fun
And the girls they wanna have fun
And the boys they wanna have fun
And the girls they wanna have

Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world
I want to be the one to walk in the sun

Hey now, hey now
What's the matter with you?
Girls just wanna have fun now
Come on

Hey now, hey now
What's the matter with you?
Girls just wanna have fun now

And the boys they wanna have fun
And the girls they wanna have fun
And the boys they wanna have fun
And the girls they wanna have

Hey now, hey now
What's the matter with you?
Girls just wanna have fun now

And the boys they wanna have fun
And the girls they wanna have fun
And the boys they wanna have fun
And the girls they wanna have

Girls just wanna have fun now
Come on

Hey now, hey now
What's the matter with you?
Girls just wanna have fun now
