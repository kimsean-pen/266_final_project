Take my hand, stay, Joanne
Heaven's not ready for you
Every part of my aching heart
Needs you more than the angels do

Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?
Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?

If you could, I know that you'd stay
We both know things don't work that way
I promised I wouldn't say goodbye
So I grin, and my voice gets thin

Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?
Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?

Honestly, I know where you're goin'
And, baby, you're just moving on
And I'll still love you even if I can't see you anymore
Can't wait to see you soar

Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?
Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?
