Never mind the stars in the sky
Never mind the when and the why
Got a feelin' higher than high
This is the real thing
This is the real thing

No more livin' in shame
And I'm not gonna run or gonna hide away
No more tellin' all those lies
It's been too long

No more livin' in chains
No, I don't give a damn what the people say
There's no use holdin' back desire
We've burnt our fingers now lets jump into the flames

Never mind the stars in the sky
Never mind the when and the why
Got a feelin' higher than high
This is the real thing

Never mind the rain and the storm
We'll keep each other warm
We got somethin' stronger than strong
This is the real thing

Gonna walk out hand in hand
So let them criticize 'cos they don't understand
We've got nothin' to hide
It's just love

I've had enough of shy
So let's go out and show them what we have inside
There's no use holdin' back desire
We've burnt our fingers now let's jump into the fire

Never mind the stars in the sky
Never mind the when and the why
Got a feelin' higher than high
This is the real thing

Never mind the rain and the storm
We'll keep each other warm
We got somethin' stronger than strong
This is the real thing

Never mind the stars in the sky baby
Never mind the when and the why baby
Never mind the stars in the sky baby
'Cos I've got a feelin' that's higher than high

Oh, ooh what you do to me, baby?

Never mind the stars in the sky
Never mind the when and the why
Got a feelin' higher than high
This is the real thing

Never mind the rain and the storm
We'll keep each other warm
We got somethin' stronger than strong
This is the real thing

Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
This is the real thing

Never mind the stars in the sky, baby
Never mind the when and the why, baby
Never mind the stars in the sky, baby
Never mind the when and the why, baby

Never mind the stars in the sky
Never mind the when and the why
Got a feelin' higher than high
Ooh baby, what you do?

Never mind the rain and the storm
We'll keep each other warm
We got somethin' stronger than strong
This is the real thing

Never mind the stars in the sky
Never mind the when and the why
Got a feelin' higher than high

Never mind the rain and the storm
We'll keep each other warm
We got somethin' stronger than strong
