Were we're goin we won't need air
No lookin back from here on in
It's moving on to better things
Cause you deserve all, anything
Forget everything you told
It's greener grass and then some gold
And maybe I should bite my tongue
No, but I can't seem to fight it
...
And gone are the days you used to
Gone are the days
Say you'll go back to the man who used you
...
And if you've ever felt
This way before
I'll show you, girl
What you've been waiting for
I can free your mind
Help you lose control
Cause now is the time
To show you, girl
...
You come out the other side
And you hold your head up high
If he could only see you now
And see how far you've passed him
...
And gone are the days you used to
Gone are the days
Say you'll go back to the man who used you
...
And if you've ever felt
This way before
I'll show you, girl
What you've been waiting for
I can free your mind
Help you lose control
Cause now is the time
To show you, girl
...
And gone are the days you used to
Say you'll go back to the man who used you
I'll treat you the best, and soothe you
No, no anything less just won't do
...
And if you've ever felt
This way before
I'll show you, girl
What you've been waiting for
I can free your mind
Help you lose control
Cause now is the time
To show you, girl
...
Gone are the days
Gone are the days
Gone are the days
Gone are the days
