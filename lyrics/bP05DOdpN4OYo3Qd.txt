Keep on walkin' that road and I'll follow
Keep on callin' my name, I'll be there
And if a mirror should break, it's easy to take
Deep down I know that you care
Well, I'm not superstitious, no, ooh

I'm not superstitious, I have no doubt
That there's a reason, how things turn out
While things are changin' from day to day
Well, I'll keep this feelin' with me all the way

And I want you to know
That you're on my mind
Every day, all of the time

So, keep on walkin' that road and I'll follow
Keep on callin' my name, I'll be there, yeah
And if a mirror should break, it's easy to take
Deep down I know that you care
Well, I'm not superstitious, no, ooh

There might be times of wonder when I'm on my own
Tryin' to find out if love has gone
It might make a difference, it might bring me down
But no superstition is gonna turn things around

And I want you to know
That you're on my mind
Every day, all of the time

So, keep on walkin' that road and I'll follow
Keep on callin' my name, I'll be there, yeah
And if a mirror should break, it's easy to take
Deep down I know that you care
Well, I'm not superstitious, no, no

So keep on walkin' and we'll make things right
Yeah, keep on dreamin', each and every night
We're gonna make it, and that's what we'll do
Right to the end, girl, we're gonna walk on, walk on through
So, keep on walkin' that road and I'll follow
Keep on callin' my name, I'll be there, yeah
And if a mirror should break, it's easy to take
Deep down I know, I know that you care
Well, I'm not superstitious, no, not superstitious
