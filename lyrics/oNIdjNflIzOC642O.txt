Give me a hit
One little bit
Of that thing that moves me
Beyond the skin
Outside and in
Don't they call it love?

And the moon shines differently out here
And the moon shines differently out here

Luna, Lunisa
Cool breeze touch skin and we shiver
We go deeper (deeper)
Soul sister, mellow mister (moonshine)
New moon, new chapter
Centered, we enter the ever after, ay ow

Sight into sense
Coincidence
Everything that could be
Iris to eye
Earth into sky
Don't they call it love?

And the moon shines differently out here
And the moon shines differently out here

We melt down by the river
Kindling, tingling silhouettes circling round the fire
Soft souls sing acapella
Moonlight on the water
Bright lights, thunder
Look above and we wonder
The wanderer feels it
Stronger
The sun slumbers, we're under (under moonshine)

Luna, Lunisa
Cool breeze touch skin and we shiver
We go deeper (deeper)
Soul sister, mellow mister
New moon new chapter
Centered, we enter the ever after, ay ow

And the moon shines
And the moon shines
