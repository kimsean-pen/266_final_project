I'll write it down
Where you can see
I have gone to sleep

Try to relate
Can't give in to your temptations (temptations)

All your hopes and dreams, I'll take away
Its time that I forget everything
You've taught me (you've taught me)
When I looked up to you

Fall to your knees
And Give up your aspirations (aspirations)
Fall in to your knees

So how can you expect
Me to just close my eyes
And forget everything
Defending you is getting
Harder everyday, day

I'm breaking down
Behind this fear
If I don't go to my addiction
Make it through yourself

All your hopes and dreams, I'll take away
Its time that I forget everything
You've taught me (you've taught me)
When I looked up to you

So how can you expect
Me to just close my eyes
And forget everything
Defending you is getting
Hard everyday, day

I look inside myself for strength
Like a million times before
You'll never let it in because
I know you said
I know you said
I know, I know, I know, I know

Fall, I'll show you where this goes (where this goes)
How can you live this way
I'll never forget (Never forget)
Where I come from, Where I've been
I'll never forget you

So how can you expect
Me to just close my eyes
And forget everything
Defending you is getting
Harder everyday, day

So how can you expect
Me to just close my eyes
And forget everything
Defending you is getting
Harder everyday, day

You've lost it all
