Crawling in the street made me believe you
The little town you left wanted to keep you
The dreamer never dies, don't stop believing
Cut a heart in half, can't stop the beating

Never got what you want
Never got what you want
Never got it

Never got what you want
Never got what you want
Never got it

Caught up in the twist of fate decisions
The reasons and the thoughts fill up your dreams when
The pictures on the screen tell lives are higher
But that voice inside your head is such a liar

Never got what you want
Never got what you want
Never got it

Never got what you want
Never got what you want
Never got it

Never got what you want
Never got what you want
Never got it

Never got what you want
Never got what you want
Never got what you want
She forgot what she wants

Pulling down the blinds on suns tomorrow
A fist to the wall for what you can't swallow
Babies in their beds take in the breathing
Count up all your luck, can't stop the feeling

Never got what you want
Never got what you want
Never got it

Never got what you want
Never got what you want
Never got it

Never got what you want
Never got what you want
Never got it

Never got what you want
Never got what you want
Never got what you want
She forgot what she wants
