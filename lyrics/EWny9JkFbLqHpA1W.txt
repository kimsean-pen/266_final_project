Got myself angering over you
Got myself angering over you
Sitting in silence wondering what to do
Got myself angering over you

Don't believe in karma or hell
But in the memories and stories we build
Don't believe in karma or hell
But in the memories and stories we tell

Oh they'll get to you
Hope they'll get to you
Wondering what's on your mind
Wondering what's driving you

Oh they'll get to you
Hope they'll get to you
Wondering what's on your mind
Wondering what's driving you

Oh they'll get to you
Hope they'll get to you
Wondering what's on your mind
Wondering what's driving you

Oh they'll get to you
Hope they'll get to you
Wondering what's on your mind
Wondering what's driving you
