You're kidding yourself
Live like that, no you can't live like that
You're kidding yourself
Sink some beers, watch the match
Get a grip on yourself
Live like that, no you can't live like that
Don't hate yourself
Gone out, won't come back

We're living out our dreams
Stay ignorant with me
You're kidding yourself
Live like that, no you can't live like that

Oh, if we're gonna fake it, fake it right
Shoot me down off the satellite
Oh, oh, we won't, we won't know
Oh, if we're gonna make it through the night
Turn the volume up, turn off the lights, oh
Oh, oh, we won't, we won't know
We won't, we won't

You're kidding yourself
Live like that, no you can't live like that
You're kidding yourself
Sink some beers, watch the match
Get a grip on yourself
Live like that, no you can't live like that
Don't hate yourself
Big night out, don't come back

Lying awake
Talking about the things we liked about our day
Goodnight my love, wouh wouh wouh wouh
Wouh wouh wouh wouh wouh
Wide awake
Thinking about the things I saw go down today
Goodnight my love, wouh wouh wouh wouh
Wouh wouh wouh wouh wouh

Oh, if we're gonna fake it, fake it right
Shoot me down off the satellite, oh
Oh, oh, we won't, we won't know
Oh, if we're gonna make it through the night
Turn the volume up, turn off the lights, oh
Oh, oh, e won't, we won't know
We won't, we won't

Wide awake
Thinking about the things I saw go down the drain
Goodnight love, wouh wouh wouh wouh
Wouh wouh wouh wouh wouh
