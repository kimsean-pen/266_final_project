Thou who wouldst make us Devils
Thou shalt not poison me
The world hath been persuaded
To believe thy heresy

I spit in the eye of Satan
And I will spit in thine
The Devils that surround thee
Liveth only in thine eye

Bad religion, bad religion
I need no gods or devils, I need no pagan rights
Bad religion, bad religion
I need no burning crosses to illuminate my nights

Hey! Hey!
You hear me now, you hear me now
Hey! Hey!
For thou art Judas, the mark of Cain be on thy brow

Evangelistic Nazis, you cannot frighten me
The name you take in vain shall judge you for eternity

I spit in the eye of Satan
Spit right in your eye too
You are the spooks you're chasing
You know not what you do

Bad religion, bad religion
I know you lie, I know you lie
Bad religion, bad religion
Thieves and liars cross my heart, I hope you die

Hey! Hey!
Remember me, remember me
Hey! Hey!
If there be justice burning Hell awaits for thee

If there be such a being
Then thou art Anti-Christ
Turn men against their children
Turn beauty into vice

I say thy God shall smite thee
He will perceive thy lust
His wrath shall fall upon thee
Thou that betray His trust

Bad religion, bad religion
I say that thou art liars, thy souls shall not be saved
Bad religion, bad religion
Here are the days of thunder, the days that thou hast made

Hey! Hey!
Base seducers, I see thy greed
Hey! Hey!
I am more fit for glory than any ten of thee

Bad religion
