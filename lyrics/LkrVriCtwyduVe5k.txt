Wake up all alone
Sending postcards back to home
On the road

If the medication works
Could I be the way I was?
In control

You painted a picture
I'm the worst type of sinner
You know

You painted a picture
Happier than I can afford

Nobody can save me
Nobody can save me
Nobody can say what I'll do if I'm alone
