Keep the lights off in the middle of the afternoon
Blue string lights are plugged in in my room
Blinds are shut, rain crashes against the house

It's a light so soft
It's life sneaking into the cold
It's the concave of a shiver
And I'm so fed up

If I open all the windows
It would be fine if it spilled in
I'll plug everything in

It's the pique that stabs the hardwood
It's the gravity gripping the shadow
It's the plaque of the artery walls
And I'm so fed up

Laying on the floor
Body, become cement
Gravity, don't let me down

Cause I'm so fed up
And I'm so fed up with hope
