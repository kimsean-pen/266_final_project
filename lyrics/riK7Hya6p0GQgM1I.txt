Did you ever wonder why the wind blows cold?
Did you ever realize your face is painted on my soul?

In between your whispers so sincere
I'll catch you when you fall
Through the eyes of broken innocence
I'd sell my heart for stones
Leave it all behind and fade away
To feel your purest blue
I can feel your purest blue, for you I must be strong
For I don't know right from wrong

Did you ever wonder why they all have gone away?
Did you ever realize that nothing changes, everything stays the same?

In between your whispers so sincere
I'll catch you when you fall
Through the eyes of broken innocence
I'd sell my heart for stones
Leave it all behind and fade away
To feel your purest blue
I can feel your purest blue, for you I must be strong
For I don't know right from wrong

I will lay in the gentle hands of your controlling gaze
I will be your servant through your darkest days
I will make the sacrifice and change just for you
I will dive into the essence of your purest blue

In between your whispers so sincere
I'll catch you when you fall
Through the eyes of broken innocence
I'd sell my heart for stones
Leave it all behind and fade away
To feel your purest blue
I can feel your purest blue, for you I must be strong
For I don't know right from wrong
