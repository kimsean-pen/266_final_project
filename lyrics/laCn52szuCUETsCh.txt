Welcome you fool of blunder, insert rite of nether dreams
Sheep or leader, your worth equals filth
I grant illusions of purging flesh no dog shall be spared

Pollution I carry unsuspected
Erupted sanity I hereby sell you reign
Fallen figures on their knees cry sacrilegious
Enticed by fruits of life as death was sent to collect

Silent praying spreads through the air without response
Storm of sick and wealth
Lights go out, stunning chill, waves of sin brought to kill
Screams eroding panic explodes to their delight
Storm of sick and wrath

Fair angels demons follow, where there is grace they shall nest
To smear their loathing and put them to rest
Wings of gold ripped off cold left dead without a soul
Upon dethroning their glory, a bleeding fist

Bereft of life indeed
Ripe and sweet, birth out of grain
Rotting meat all that remains, sin may bring relief

Witness in awe the sight of celebration
Plow through it all, find nothing but deception

Leap into the furnace flames attack in numbers, let them stroke
Sanctimony breeds here undisturbed for reasons, no one knows and no one will
Darkness leads, eminent in gifts levitate and shifts
Watched from below transformed and flawed
No one's left behind pain is here to stay these last of days

Silent praying spreads through the air without response
Storm of sick and wrath
Lights go out, stunning chill, waves of sin brought to kill
Screams eroding panic explodes to their delight
Storm of sick and wrath

Thief of them all portrayed as distant somber
Hence they shall fall, provoked and in time to reap the call
Fair angels demon follow, where there is grace they shall nest
To smear their loathing and put them to rest
Wings of gold ripped off cold left dead without a soul
Upon dethroning their glory, a bleeding fest
All that's left dies here with sorrow, where angels go demons follow
Declining not shining deep is the pit where they all now sleep.
