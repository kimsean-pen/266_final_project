Broken boys look good sitting on their shoes
Silent waves responds expose to fear
Library cards, rented faces, lying on the naked train
Hard parades with nothing skin
Things that breathe way too thin

They lost their lives in backyards
They lost their lives in backyards

They lost their lives in backyards
They lost their lives in backyards

Elevator, red blue stain, best of things
Half way between things and times, a kill
Library cards, rented faces, lying on the naked train
Highways and major club smell stale, almost eyes, a thousand things

They lost their lives in backyards
They lost their lives in backyards

They lost their lives in backyards
They lost their lives in backyards

It's a hard parade, just be courageous
It's a hard parade, just be courageous
It's a hard parade, just be courageous
It's a hard parade, just be courageous
It's a hard parade, just
It's a hard parade
It's a hard parade, just be courageous
It's a hard parade, just be courageous
It's a hard parade, just be courageous
It's a hard parade, just be courageous
It's a hard parade, just be courageous
It's a hard parade, just be courageous
Be courageous
Be courageous
Be courageous
Be courageous
Hard parade just, be courageous
Hard parade just, be courageous
It's a hard parade just, be courageous
It's a hard parade just, be courageous
It's a hard parade just, be courageous
It's a hard parade just, be courageous
