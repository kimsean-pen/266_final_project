Can you hear me calling
Out your name?
You know that I'm falling
And I don't know what to say
I'll speak a little louder
I'll even shout
You know that I'm proud
And I can't get the words out
Oh I...
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I...
I wanna be with you everywhere
be with you everywhere
Can you hear me calling
Out your name?
You know that I'm falling
And I don't know what to say
Come along baby
We better make a start
You better make it soon
Before you break my heart
Oh I...
I wanna be with you everywhere
Everywhere
Oh I...
I wanna be with you everywhere
be with you everywhere
I wanna be with you, be with you everywhere
With you everywhere
Everywhere
I wanna be with you, be with you everywere
with you everywhere
Everywhere
I wanna be with you, with you everywhere
Everywhere
Everywhere
