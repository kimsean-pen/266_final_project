Here I am
And I been thinking about you lately
Hold my hand
'Cause I been missing you like crazy

Don't wanna go through life
Every single night
Wishing we could do it, oh (Do it right)
Do it right
Come and hold me tight, we don't need to fight
Rather spend my life with you, every night
Cause baby...

This bed
Is too lonely without you (Baby)
Don't wanna hold my pillow, I wanna hold you
Please be beside me
These king size sheets
Need more than just a queen
In between 'em
This bed
Is too lonely without you

So why don't we
Go inside where we can be together?
You mean more than anything
Stay with me
Wanna be with you forever

Don't wanna go through life,
Every single night
Wishing we could do it, oh (Do it Right)
Do it Right
Come and hold me tight, we don't need to fight
Rather spend my life with you, every night
Ooh baby...

This bed
Is too lonely without you (Baby, baby baby)
Don't wanna hold my pillow, I wanna hold you (I wanna hold you, hold you)
Please be beside me
These king size sheets
Need more than just a queen
In between 'em (Yeah)
This bed
Is too lonely without you (Too lonely)

You know when it starts to get late
And it's time to go to sleep, I
I don't know what to do
Cause I don't wanna hold my pillow
I wanna hold you

Don't wanna go through life
Every single night
Wishing we could do it, oh (Do it right)
Do me right
Come and hold me tight, we don't need to fight
Rather spend my life with you, every night
Oh baby...

This bed
Is too lonely without you (Baby, baby)
Don't wanna hold my pillow, I wanna hold you (I wanna hold ya, hold ya)
Please be beside me
These king size sheets
Need more than just a queen
In between 'em (Yeah)
This bed
Is too lonely without you (Too lonely)
