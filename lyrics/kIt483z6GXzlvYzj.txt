You were breaking like the ground beneath me, burn up like a dream
I keep off lightning strikes on summer nights on television
Now I needed you to be there to carry me to sleep
That night I tripped and broke my rib cage on a bar seat drunk for weeks
Chasing ambulances, stumbled to my bedsheets
Softly drift off after peaceful things
I had once a release down in the streets
Now hear it beyond, our footsteps ending at the pond

Don't get why you believed in me so much to follow and retrieve it all
That sanctity I scattered so indifferently
Still you called on me breathe you out, you begged the breeze:
"Relieve me from what settles deep and burns down underneath if you believe"

My love's like a battered dog, wanders under street signs
Subside into nothingness
Burns up like a bad dream gone
I guess I needed you to freeze me out
Those corners of your dreams
I think you needed me to bleed out loud
I guess I needed you to freeze me up
Those corners of your dreams
I guess you needed me to leave

Still you carried me to sleep, living in dream retreats
Grasping for an older me, some faded image
And it carries you to sleep, breathes out in the fog before me
And cat tails hit your knees to sense some soul promise
To scatter all their seeds, to grow before they leave
For life and all its consequential, complicated scenes
They shake you out of sleep
Scrape our knees beneath your feet
I think we bleed because we need to bleed
We bleed because we need

I just wanted you to carry on and carry me
I guess I wanted you to need the things I needed you to be
I just wanted you to carry on and carry for me
I guess I wanted you to leave
I guess you needed me to bleed

Out loud
I guess I needed you to freeze me out
Those corners of your dreams
I guess you needed me bleed out loud
I guess I needed you to freeze me up
Those corners of your dreams
I guess I needed me to leave

Come and shake me from my sleep
Burn up in a bad dream like a belief
Come and shake me from my sleep
Come and hold me for weeks
