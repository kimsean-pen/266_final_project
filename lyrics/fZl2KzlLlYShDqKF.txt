Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

Weekend has arrived
Everybody's tryin to find
Something to get into
My friends wanna go out
But I can't cancel my plans
Got a date with my baby
He's taking me out
So I'm gonna catch up with you
Some other day
Gotta go
Can't make him wait
Tonight

Have to make sure I'm looking hot
'Cos we're going to our favourite spot
Till the morning we're gonna rock
Boy you rock me up (yeah)

My baby
Doesn't matter what's going on
Or who's around us
All I see is you
Right now they're playing our song
Dancefloor is ours
All I see is you
The DJ's got me feelin' like I did
When I first met you
And there's nothing that can't break us apart
In two
'Cos all I see is you

I get lost in time
When I'm lookin' in your eyes
And we're body to body
I don't want you to rush
'Cos you're feeling like heaven to me
Follow the rhythm
And keep it real close
In the dark everything goes
Love it better when you touch
(Don't stop)
Baby 'cos we've just begun

Have to make sure I'm looking hot
'Cos we're going to our favourite spot
Till the morning we're gonna rock
Boy you rock me up (yeah)

My baby
Doesn't matter what's going on
Or who's around us
All I see is you
Right now they're playing our song
Dancefloor is ours
All I see is you
The DJ's got me feelin' like I did
When I first met you
And there's nothing that can't break us apart
In two
'Cos all I see is you

Oh oh oh
Please don't let me go oh oh
My love for you's growing
More and more and more
As we move across the floor
'Cos all I see is you
'Cos all I see is you
DJ spin my record again

My baby
Doesn't matter what's going on
Or who's around us
All I see is you
Right now they're playing our song
Dancefloor is ours
All I see is you
The DJ's got me feelin' like I did
When I first met you
And there's nothing that can't break us apart
In two
'Cos all I see is you

My baby
Doesn't matter what's going on
Or who's around us
All I see is you
Right now they're playing our song
Dancefloor is ours
All I see is you
The DJ's got me feelin' like I did
When I first met you
And there's nothing that can't break us apart
In two
'Cos all I see is you
