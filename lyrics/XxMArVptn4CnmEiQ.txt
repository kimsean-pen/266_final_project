I - I gone to play God
With you
I - I want to rule it all
Dead starlight bleeds down on the Devil's nitrate
All the nerves of the patients bathe in shock and shame
Cause I'm the trigger that'll start this game
And the strike of the night will trash the skyline
And darken the marks I've put in your skin
Cause I want to play God
I want to play God
With you
I - I want to rule it all
Rule you
The human cattle lick on the ethical nightsticks
All the tears of the victims run on cold cheeks' meat
Cause here's a future that'll feed on sheep
And the strike of the night will trash the skyline
And darken the marks I've put in your skin
Cause I want to play God
I want to play God
With you
I - I want to rule it all
Rule you
Cause I want to play God
I want to play God
With you
I - I want to rule it all
Rule you
Let's play a game of two
I'll play God and you'll play you
Let's play a game tonight
I'll play Dark and you'll play...
I - I want to play God
With you

I - I want to play God
With you
I - I want to rule it all
Rule you
Cause I want to play
Cause I want to play
Cause I want to play God, God, God, God
Cause I want to play
Cause I want to play
Cause I want to play God, God, God, God
Let's play a game tonight
I'll play Dark and you'll play...
