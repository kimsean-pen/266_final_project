Mama told me, when I was young
Come sit beside me, my only son
And listen closely, to what I say
And if you do this, it'll help you
Some sunny day, oh, yeah

Oh, take your time, don't live too fast
Troubles will come, and they will pass
Go find a woman, and you'll find love
And don't forget, son, there is someone up above

And be a simple kind of man
Oh, be somethin' you love and understand
Baby, be a simple kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me son, if you can

Forget your lust
For the rich man's gold
All that you need, is in your soul
And you can do this, if you try
All that I want for you my son
Is to be satisfied

And be a simple kind of man
Oh, be somethin' you love and understand
Baby, be a simple kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me son, if you can
(Oh, yes I will)

Oh, don't you worry, you'll find yourself
Follow your heart, and nothing else
And you can do this, oh babe, if you try
All that I want for you my son, is to be satisfied

And be a simple kind of man
Oh, be somethin' you love and understand
Baby, be a simple kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me son, if you can

Baby, be a simple, be a simple man
Oh, be somethin' you love and understand
Baby, be a simple kind of man
