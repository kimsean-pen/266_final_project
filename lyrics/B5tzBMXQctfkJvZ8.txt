You saw the cactus bloom
Its scent filled your room
You cried a thousand times and now
You're fine

You'd think I'd feel, by now
Like someone else somehow
I'm on my hero's journey, don't laugh
It's not funny

Aloha!
Do you even know how
Wild I can get?

I see the breakers crash
The sand will never last
And I know it's not supposed to stay
But still, I want my way

Aloha!
Do you even know how
Wild I can get?

Aloha!
Do you even know how?
'Cause even I forget
