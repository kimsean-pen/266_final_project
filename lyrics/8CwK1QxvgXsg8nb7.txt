Tangled in my garments
Run out of space
Will I ever get to wear all of this?
Do I even like any of it?
Cheap shit

I never looked the way I pictured
The way I want

End up wearing the same old
Top and bottoms
There are some men I don't
Want looking at my parts
The same, same old top and bottoms
Day in, day out

Wish I could wear what I want to wear
Wishing to find what I want to wear
Then wishing to afford what I want to wear
What fits my body?
What fits a stick with a belly?

End up wearing the same old
Top and bottoms
There are some men I don't
Want lookin' at my bottom
The same, same old top and bottoms
Day in, Day out

I just don't know what I'm doing
Some people really know a thing
I just can't feel what I'm doing
Some people really know a thing
Do I even like any of it?
Do I even like any of it?
Cheap shit

I never looked the way I pictured
The way I want, it's always strange
I try it on, it never works for me and
Will I ever stop looking for the right thing?

End up wearing the same old
Top and bottoms
Tangled up in the same old top and bottoms
Day out
