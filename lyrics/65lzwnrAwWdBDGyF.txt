Revelation artistry
So fed up with hypocrisy
There isn't a label large enough to fit your bill

Act like you deserve to win
Trade up for a thicker skin
For scraps of acceptance from coked-up quasi-urbane kids

I'm really, really, really,
Really proud of what you did

Post-paint boy, with your art
You're penny rich and dollar dumb
In a style that they call
So non-European

You're the maker of modern
Minor masterpieces for the untrained eye
You're the maker of modern
Minor masterpieces for the untrained eye--yep!

Belarus Biennial
You surely surely made them wow
Minds were blown and bombs were thrown--oh no!

Seventeen anteaters
Sequestered in a room
With the sisters of mothers of famous gluttons I don't know

You really, really, really,
Really, really, really showed

Who can blame you for becoming
Penny smart and dollar dumb
In a world that has become
So American

You're the maker of modern
Minor masterpieces for the untrained eye
You're the maker of modern
Minor masterpieces for the untrained eye

You're the maker of modern
Minor masterpieces for the untrained eye
You're the maker of modern
Minor masterpieces for the untrained eye--yep!
