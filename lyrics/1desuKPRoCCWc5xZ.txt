I'll stay
I'll stay for she'll be coming back
You know her head went out to play
but she'll get over that
I know that my reward
When she returns
Woo woo
Keeps me hanging on
I'll stay

I'll stay
though friends they ridicule
You know for her there is no substitute
Talk I can endure (I must endure)
But that's alright
mother says "Son"
Know my reward
When she returns (whoo whoo)
(when she thinks she wants to come home)
She'll still come home whoa
Keeps me hanging on
I'll stay

Ba ba-ba-ba
ba-ba-ba
ba ba ooo ooo ooo ooo
Ba ba-ba-ba
ba-ba-ba
ba ba ooo ooo ooo ooo
Ba ba-ba-ba
ba-ba-ba
ba ba dooo ooo ooo ooo
(continues)

You know her head went out to play
That's all right
The girl will get over that
Lord, my reward is gonna be much greater
Every night, lord, is gonna replace her
And if another girl decides she wants to come home
Wait right there
Wait right here
Wait right here
I ain't goin' nowhere
Wait right here
Wait right here
I'm gonna stand right here
On this ground and wait
Hey hey hey hey

say knowing knowing my reward
(grunting and sputtering)
