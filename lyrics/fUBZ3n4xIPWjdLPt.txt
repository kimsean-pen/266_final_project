He's good, but I'm better
You ain't gotta worry 'bout me
'Cause I know that I should be fed up
Fearing that he's over me
Baby I'm good, don't regret it
Standing on my own two feet
Single never tasted so sweet
But you ain't gotta worry 'bout me, nah

He's good (He's good)
He's good (He's good)
He's good, he's good, he's good
But baby I'm better, better, better, better, better
He's good (He's good)
He's good (He's good)
He's good, he's good, he's good
But baby I'm better, better, better, better, better

Heard he got a new girl
No pressure
'Cause baby she got nothing on me
Should've taken your time
Reconsidered
'Cause you weren't fully over me

Does she know it's a lie
When you tell her
There's nowhere that you'd rather be?
'Cause you be always calling me
When you know I don't wanna speak

You're tryna make me jealous (jealous)
With pictures of your next ex (next ex)
I know you just pretending
Really I couldn't care less
And now you're tryna see me
You think it's so damn easy (easy)
'Cause boy I'm done, ain't going back there again, no

He's good (He's good)
He's good (He's good)
He's good, he's good, he's good
But baby I'm better, better, better, better, better
He's good (He's good)
He's good (He's good)
He's good, he's good, he's good
But baby I'm better, better, better, better, better

And you know those days are over
Ain't nothing left for us to say anymore, no, no
And you, you know I am better
I'm doing better than before, before

He's good (He's good)
He's good (He's good)
He's good, he's good, he's good
But baby I'm better, better, better, better, better
He's good (He's good)
He's good (He's good)
He's good, he's good, he's good
But baby I'm better, better, better, better, better
