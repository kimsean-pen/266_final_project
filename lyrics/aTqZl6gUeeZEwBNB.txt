Shadows settle on the place
That you left
Our minds are troubled by the emptiness
Destroy the middle
It's a waste of time
From the perfect start
To the finish line

And if you're still breathing
You're the lucky ones
'Cause most of us are heaving through corrupted lungs
Setting fire to our insides for fun
Collecting names of the lovers that went wrong
The lovers that went wrong

We are the reckless
We are the wild youth
Chasing visions of our futures
One day we'll reveal the truth
That one will die before he gets there

And if you're still bleeding
You're the lucky ones
'Cause most of our feelings
They are dead and they are gone
We're setting fire to our insides for fun
Collecting pictures from a flood that wrecked our home
It was a flood that wrecked our home

And youth caused it
And youth caused it
And youth caused it
Youth caused it
