I save my metaphors for rainy days
When I'm too phased, but that's not here
Or there so I'll give you the phrase that pays
'Cause we're not seventeen, but you're my teenage dream
If there's a chance we'll sink then I don't even wanna try
To sleep or dream
To sleep or dream

I just hope it's nicer where you are
'Cause I only want to lift you up
I guess I never really said enough
For you to hear me where you are
'Cause I only want to lift you up
I guess I never really said enough
So let me tell you now

My tired thoughts don't take vacations, oh no
You float up in conversations, oh no
You're my final destination, I know
You're probably fine there
Just know I think you're rare
Just know I think you're rare
Just know I think you're

Let's make some plans for time to waste
Your Cali gaze has stuck me spinning, dripping sweetness
Hidden in my face
'Cause we're not seventeen, but you're my teenage dream
If there's a chance we'll sink then I don't even wanna try
To sleep or dream
To sleep or dream

I just hope it's nicer where you are
'Cause I only want to lift you up
I guess I never really said enough
For you to hear me where you are
'Cause I only want to lift you up
I guess I never really said enough
So let me tell you now

My tired thoughts don't take vacations, oh no
You float up in conversations, oh no
You're my final destination, I know
You're probably fine there
Just know I think you're rare

You know I think you're rare
I wasn't prepared
I've got to say
I think it's weird I need your love
I've clocked 300 ways
You know I think you're rare
I wasn't prepared
And now my stomach's cold

And I hope it's nicer where you are
'Cause I only want to lift you up
I guess I never really said enough
For you to hear me where you are
'Cause I only want to lift you up
I guess I never really said enough
So let me tell you now

My tired thoughts don't take vacations, oh no
You float up in conversations, oh no
You're my final destination, I know
You're probably fine there
Just know I think you're rare
(Just know I think you're rare)
