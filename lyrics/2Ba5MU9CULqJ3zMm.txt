I picture you now
Right in front of me
Your beautiful eyes
Looking right at me
Remember the warmth

You used to give me
I wish I could bring it back
Wish I could take it back

Never thought it'd exist

I never thought it could be
The second I saw you
Something changed in me

My feelings flowered up and came naturally
Something changed in me

Can you hear me calling
Calling for you?

Can you hear me screaming
Screaming for you?
It is like I'm naked out in the rain

Alone and dealing with the pain
Can you hear me calling
Calling
Calling

Remember the days we spent together
Heey
Give anything to have them forever
And all the things we used to laugh at
I Wish I could bring it back

Wish I could take it back
Yeah...
Now I know things that I never knew
I'm standing out here and I'm calling you
You mean the world to me
And believe that it's true
I love you!
Can you hear me calling
Calling for you?
Can you hear me screaming
Screaming for you?
It is like I'm naked out in the rain
Alone and dealing with the pain
Can you hear me calling
Calling
Calling...
Yeaheahea...
Screaming...
Yeaheahea...
Calling!
You mean the world to me
You mean the world to me
Screaming!
You mean the world to me
You mean the world to me
Can you hear me calling
Calling for you?
Can you hear me screaming
Screaming for you?
It is like I'm naked out in the rain
Alone and dealing with the pain
Can you hear me calling
Calling
Calling?...
