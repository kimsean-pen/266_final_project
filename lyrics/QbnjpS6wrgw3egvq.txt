Come on Balthazar
I refuse to let you die
Come on fallen star
I refuse to let you die

Cause it's wrong
And I've been waiting far too long
And it's wrong
I've been waiting far too long
For you to be
Be
Be
Be

Be mine
For you to be mine
Be mine
For you to be mine

And it's wrong
I've been waiting far too long
It's wrong
I've been waiting far too long
For you to be
Be
Be
Be

All the centrefolds
That you can't afford
They've long since waved their last goodbyes
All the centrefolds
That you can't afford
You've long since faded from their eyes

So be
Be mine
So be
Be mine
