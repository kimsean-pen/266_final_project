Can you see bats chase stars next to a starship lost?
And then the mermaids dead next to one legged piece?
It's all right? Maybe not?

Head messed up! I see, my eyes are flying
Head messed up! I feel, my brain is melting
Head messed up! We are all surely spinning around

Now I see a trap inside next to a flag in blood
And then facts no truth next to smile in fear
It's all lie? Maybe yes?

Head messed up! I see, my hands are weeping
Head messed up! I bet my mind is fading
Head messed up! We are all surely spinning around

I've forgotten how to stop

Head messed up! I keep my eyes open wide
Head messed up! I keep my ears clear and nice
Head messed up! We are all painfully spinning around
Head mixed up! Confused as things go by

Even the moon splits out
Even the stars fall down
Even the sun melts down - We laugh out!

Keep spinning around to see what is right
Keep spinning around to see what is there
Keep spinning around as if your head is burst
Keep spinning around, let's keep spinning with the time
At the end, we'll all be dead, someday!
