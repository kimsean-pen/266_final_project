Parallels exist within*
Reflection of time and space
Inside of dimension
Dualities evolving from a
Single-cell universe within the molecule
Within this dimension
Of my creation
In the blinding light of darkness
I remain one/we become one
Constant fluctuation
Two suns born
Born of the atom
Symbiotic opposition
Recreation of life changing
Individual... sovereignty
Absorb the other... fusion
Conception of time's vibration collapses within
Ancient forces of opposition
Eternal balances of existence
Aeons... futures... past... evolution
Internal axis of resistance
Pre-embryonic magnetic core
Creation of all worlds inside
Existence of thought
Reaches beyond... forever
Harmony achieved through unity
Within the spectral fields of light... called time
