Hold still...

All of my life, all of my time
I don't wanna come back around tonight
And all that I need, is serenity
I don't wanna be your new disease

The natural life
You're born, you die
The natural life
You're wrong, you're right
The natural life
You're born, you die
The natural life's a lie

All of my lies, swallow your pride
I don't wanna come back around tonight
And all that I need, is serenity
I don't wanna be your new disease

The natural life
You're born, you die
The natural life
You're wrong, you're right
The natural life
You're born, you die
The natural life's a lie

RIGHT!

You're right, I can never lie
Let me go, try to find a home
I can't wait, try to stay awake
Dead inside, bothered by the lie
You're right

The natural life
You're born, you die
The natural life
You're wrong, you're right
The natural life
You're born, you die
The natural life's a lie
A lie...
