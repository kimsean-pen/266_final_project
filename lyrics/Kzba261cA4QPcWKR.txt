When I step into the light
My arms are open wide
When I step into the light
My eyes searching wildly
Would you not like to be
Sitting on top of the world with
your legs hanging free
Would you not like to be ok, ok, ok?

When I'm walking by the water
Splish splash me and you takin a bath
When I'm walking by the water
Come up through my toes
To my ankles
To my head
To my soul
I'm blown away

When I'm walking by the water
Splish splash me and you takin a bath
When I'm walking by the water
Come up through my toes
To my ankles
To my head
To my soul
I'm blown away

(various talking and laughter)

I can't believe that we would
lie in our graves
Wondering if we had
spent our living days well
I can't believe that we would
lie in our graves
Dreaming of things that we
might have been

I can't believe that we would
lie in our graves
Wondering if we had
spent our living days well
I can't believe that we would
lie in our graves
Dreaming of things that we
might have been

Would you not like to be
I can't believe that you
would not like to be
Would you not like to be
ok, ok, ok
