You're not my dream girl
You're not my reality girl
You're my dreams-come-true-girl

All the troubles in my past
That's just what they are
And all the delusions that took host then passed
Have only made my immunity strong

You're not my dream girl
You're not my reality girl
You're my dreams-come-true-girl

I've been blessed, your eyes are two moons
I hope this voyage will not be ending very soon

To scry in orbit with these mirrors of perfection
To die in he arms of your affection

What land is this?
May I never wake
What land is this?
May I never wake

You're not my dream girl
You're not my reality girl
You're my dreams-come-true-girl

All the troubles in my past
That's just what they are
And all the delusions that took host then passed
Have only made my immunity strong

I'm not your dream girl
