Who could've known
Things could have gone so wrong?
One moment everything is here
The next it is all gone

A child's love
Turns into a bloody mom
Who could've known
Things could have gone so wrong

Walking through the house
The photographs line the walls
Memories they hurt
The bludgening will send them all

Please close your eyes
As the blows makes impact
And say goodbye
'Cause they are never coming back

My family
They never knew
My family
They never knew
My family
The never knew
My family
