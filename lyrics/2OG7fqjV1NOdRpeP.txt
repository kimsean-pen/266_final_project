Spent the best of my life running scared in the city
left my shoes and my clothes and my lovers behind, yeah
oh but I felt incomplete, living out there on the street

I was always alone and afraid, such a pity
little girls just don't know what comes out after dark
but the devil waits in heat, down on that dead end street

And I say
running for cover
running for cover
running for cover

It's keeping me running
I'm just ascared that he's out tonight
it's keeping me running
I don't know why, but it's getting dark
say the devil's in the park
and it's already after dark
running for cover
running for cover
running for cover, now
...now...

Life is really so hard when you live in the city
no one know what a young girl has on her mind, yeah
but you're headed for defeat, down on that dead end street

Never learned of the lesson you should, such a pity
Still and all you will stay with the others behind
and the promise in the dark is that the devil's in the park

And I say
running for cover
running for cover
running for cover

It's keeping me running
I'm just ascared that he's out tonight
it's keeping me running
I don't know why, but it's getting dark
say the devil's in the park
and it's already after dark

running for cover
running for cover
running for cover

Spent the best of my life running scared in the city
left my shoes and my clothes and my lovers behind, yeah
oh but I felt incomplete, living out there on the street

running for cover
running for cover
running for cover

It's keeping me running
I'm just ascared that he's out tonight
it's keeping me running
I don't know why, but it's getting dark
say the devil's in the park
and its already after dark
