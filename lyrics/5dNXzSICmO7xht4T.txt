I'd only come here seeking peace
I'd only come here seeking me
It seems I came to leave

In your dream you see me clear
I have no restraint, no fear
Powerless I watched from faces I'd assumed
My purpose set, my will defined
Caress the air, embrace the skies
Escape the sorrow and restraint of mortal cities

Give me time I will be clear, given time you'll understand
What posseses me to right what you have suffered
I'm in this mood because of scorn, I'm in a mood for total war
To the darkened skies once more and ever onward

So many years I stood among
The thoughts and tears of those I served
Among my own I was alone through my own doing
All the years I walked unknown behind the faces I assumed
Powerless to clear your minds of what you'd suffered
They fall again
They fall again

Give me time I will be clear, given time you'll understand
What posseses me to right what you have suffered
I'm in this mood because of scorn, I'm in a mood for total war
To the darkened skies once more and ever onward
There is no faith in which to hide, even truth is filled with lies
Doubting angels fall to walk among the living
I'm in this mood because of scorn, I'm in a mood for total war
To the darkened skies once more and ever onward

I'd only come here seeking peace
I'd only come here seeking me
It seems I came to leave
