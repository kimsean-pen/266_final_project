Late last night I was looking through pictures
Flooded with memories I lied on the floor
And spread them around me like friends at a party
There faces remind me of all that I've known

Still I can't forget all the hush who and why's
All the fiction and lies and the tears and the laughs
Take a walk through the past you and I hand in hand
As we looked at this thing called us

Late last night I was pacing the hallway
Reading the letters you'd signed x and o
I turned out the lights in the and imagined you with me
I tried my hardest to cry but it just wouldn't come

Still I can't forget all the hush who and why's
All the fiction and lies all the tears and the laughs
Take a walk through the past you and I hand in hand
As we look at this thing called us

All the hush who and why's
All the fiction and lies all the tears and the laughs
Take a walk through the past, you and I hand in hand
As we look at this thing called trust

Still I can't forget all the hush who and why's
All the fiction and lies all the tears and the laughs
Take a walk through the past you and I hand in hand
As we look at this thing called us

All the hush who and why's
All the fiction and lies all the tears and the laughs
Take a walk through the past, you and I hand in hand
As we look at this thing called trust
