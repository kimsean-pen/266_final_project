Lately I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out
Be a little inappropriate
Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
When the light's out

Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

I-I-I wanna go-o-o all the wa-a-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow all the di-i-irt
I got running through my mind
Wo-oh-oh

I-I-I wanna go-o-o all the wa-a-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow all the di-i-irt
I got running through my mind
Wo-oh-oh

Lately people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out
I've been told just what to do with it
To keep both my hands above the bla-blanket
When the light's out

Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

I-I-I wanna go-o-o all the wa-a-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow all the di-i-irt
I got running through my mind
Wo-oh-oh

I-I-I wanna go-o-o all the wa-a-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow all the di-i-irt
I got running through my mind
Wo-oh-oh

Shame on me (shame on me)
To need release (to need release)
Uncontrollably (uncontrollably, -lably, -lably, -lably)

I-I-I wanna go-o-o all the wa-a-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow all the di-i-irt
I got running through my mind
Wo-oh-oh

I-I-I wanna go-o-o all the wa-a-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow all the di-i-irt
I got running through my mind
Wo-oh-oh
