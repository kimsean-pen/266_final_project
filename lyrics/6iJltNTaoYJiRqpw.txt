I stand map in hand
Direction misaligned
(direction misaligned, direction misaligned)
I play my role
With the cast of a die
(cast of a die, cast of a die)
It spins through the air
Bound by gravity
(bound by gravity, bound by gravity)
So why can't I
Feel momentum pulling me?
(momentum pulling me)

Their design
Shifting frame by frame
(shifting frame by frame)
Blur the lines
The cycle starts again

My
First
Step was undertaken aimlessly
(undertaken aimlessly, undertaken aimlessly)
Yet I arrived
As if I meant to be
(as if I meant to be, as if I meant to be)
Conceived by desire
Or compelled by certainty
(or compelled by certainty, or compelled by certainty)
Did I decide
Or did the road choose me?
(did the road choose me?)

Their design
Shifting frame by frame
(shifting frame by frame)
Blur the lines
The cycle starts again

All I am
Blood, flesh and bone
Hand in hand
Love trust and hope
Step by step
All roads lead home
Birth to death
Thy will be done

All I am
Blood, flesh and bone
Hand in hand
Love trust and hope
Step by step
All roads lead home
Birth to death
Thy will be done

Break the code
Find your soul
Cast the die
Lose control

Break the code
Find the formula
Lose control
In euphoria
Break the code
Find the formula
Lose control
In euphoria
