While away the hour
Into something new
Throw away the flower
They make you feel blue

Throwing stones at stranger
Waiting for the fight
Throwing stones at birds who
Struggle to take flight

I am a dark cloud
Swelling with hate
I am a dark cloud
Swelling with hate

Get it out your system
Get it out of you
Send them home with blisters
Send them home with truth

Send away the doubter
Blind them with your hoof
Try to save the doubters
Try to sell the new

I am a dark cloud
Swelling with hate
I am a dark cloud
Swelling with hate

I am a dark cloud
Swelling with hate
I am a dark cloud
Swelling with hate

I am a dark cloud
Swelling with hate
I am a dark cloud
Swelling with hate
