I know life is different to you
First love can be frightening that's true
But take me as your brother and your friend

And take me as your lover and your man

Pretty young girl of my mind
How I wish you to be mine
Girl, you're no child anymore

Pretty young girl of my mind
Don't you know? Know I can't hide
Can't hide my feelings
You're my girl and you're sixteen

Don't know, is it wrong, is it right?
Sweet girl, I wanna love you tonight
So take me as your brother and your friend
But first of all, I wanna be your man

Pretty young girl of my mind
How I wish you to be mine
Girl you're no child anymore

Pretty young girl of my mind
Don't you know, know I can't hide
Can't hide my feelings
You're my girl and you're sixteen

Pretty young girl of my mind
How I wish you to be mine
Girl you're no child anymore

Pretty young girl of my mind
Don't you know, know I can't hide
Can't hide my feelings
You're my girl and you're sixteen
