have you ever wandered lonely through the wood?
and everything it feels just as it should
you're part of the life there, part of something good
if you've ever wandered lonely through the woods
ooooh
if you've ever wandered lonely through the woods.

lyin on your back you're askin' why?
what's the purpose, I wonder who am I
if you've ever stared into a starry sky
ooooh, aaaah, aaooaaooh
have you ever stared into a starry sky

have you ever been out walking in the snow
tried to get back where you were before
you always end up not knowing where to go
if you've ever been out walking in the snow
ooooh, aaaah, aaooaaooh, ooooh, aaooaaooh
if you'd ever been out walking, you would know
