Church bells are ringing today
God is on the right side for once
We will go down swinging you say
Oh to die at the hands of a fascist dunce

These church bells
I love what they say
Nazis should be dealt with like in Normandie
Only inbreds join an alt right parade
Someone please tell that to Morrissey

Going down swinging now
Going down swinging now
Going down swinging now

Church bells are ringing today
God is on the right side for once
We will go down swinging you say
But I never fought anyone
I just got beat up you see
Can't give that pleasure to a nazi devotee

Going down swinging now
Going down swinging now
Going down swinging now

Do the right thing now
When you're in that moment
Do the right thing now
In your heart you know it
You're not fooling anyone
You know this is for real
