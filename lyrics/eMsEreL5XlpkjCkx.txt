Someone is waiting
To swallow all the halos out of you
As your face blows
Through my windows
Sending pieces flying all around the room

And I love you
And I want to
Shoot all the superheroes from your skies
Watch them bleeding
From your ceiling
As their empty anger falls out from their eyes
All alone...
