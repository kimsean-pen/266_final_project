I want to spend the night
With you forever
Every time we wind up spending the night together
Do you ever feel it?

I want to share my life
With you forever
Every time we wind up sharing a night together
Do you ever feel it?

Ah, and when I stay away from you I never get to sleep
I try to hug my pillow and pretend that you're with me
But I can't feel it
Then when we're together, it's right there for me to see
I can't keep looking at loneliness and trying to call it freedom
Do you ever feel it?

I want to spend the night with you forever
Every time we wind up spending the night together
Do you ever feel it?

Do you ever want to spend the night?
Do you ever want to spend the night?
Do you ever want to spend the night?
Do you ever want to spend the night?
