The desert grows three miles a year
It just grows, it just grows
I put my pain in a jar
It will be full tomorrow

The desert grows three miles a year
It just grows, it just grows
I put my pain in a jar
It will be full, it will be full

That just happens, and...
Let's cull that garden...

It's so high, you can't get over it
It's so low, you can't get under it
It's so wide, you can't get around it
