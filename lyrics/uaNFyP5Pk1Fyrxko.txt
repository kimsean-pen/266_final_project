Hey, what became of my head
The beats in my heart, the jokes that I said?
I guess all these false starts
Of a puzzle you can't finish cause' you're missing the best parts

And, don't you fear, I'm bringing you home
Out of this pit where I left you alone in
This horrible mess that I made
But I guess that's what you get when you're not paying attention

So baby, welcome back to the man you've been missing
Baby, welcome back to confusion, perplexion

We all go up in flames, going out in style
And Heaven help us if they'd ever let
us live for just a little while, yeah
We all go up in flames, going out in style
Am I out of my head to think the world
will start believing me when I am dead?

I was a miserable man
With washed up excuses, I know, I know
Part of the confusion is me
We both agree that I wasn't the man you needed me to be
But, oh, how I changed and oh, how I've grown
But could she believe me when I've got nothing to show?
My everything, she needs to see
The choice is hers to believe in me

So baby, I'm back and I'm not gonna stop
Baby, I'm back and I'm not gonna stop

We all go up in flames, going out in style
And Heaven help us if they'd ever let
us live for just a little while, yeah
We all go up in flames, going out in style
Am I out of my head to think the
world will start believing me when I am
I am dead?

You and me, we're not enemies, I'm begging
If anything, all we are, we are
In harmony, sing with me, I plea
Oh, if I can make things right then this will be our night
The world against you and I

We all go up in flames, go out in style
We all go up in flames, going out in style
And Heaven help us if they'd ever let
us live for just a little while, yeah
We all go up in flames, going out in style
Am I out of my head to think the world
will start believing me when I am dead?

I said na, na na na na na na,
na na na na na na, na na na na nanana nanana nanana na nanana
Na, na na na na na na, na na na na na na,
na na na na nanana nanana nanana na nanana

"Are you ready?"
"As the day we met."
"You're adorable"
