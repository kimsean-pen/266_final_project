let's break through the madness of the night
everything is gonna be alright
soon this life will be over

run through the darkness and the streets
so no one else can see
death move a little closer

you say you really really love me
but that's because you hate me now
i say i really really hate you
but that's because i love you

ask yourself, do you really really want this life?
do you really really want this?
i need to know, i need you now

ask yourself, could you ever make the sacrifice?
could you ever ever stop it?
i need to know. i want you dead

ohhhh
ohhhh
ohhhh
ohhhh

every day i dream of you
because i'm stuck inside this place
dream of all the things you do
because i'm stuck inside this place
hateful, scary, smelly flesh
sick and sad and worth place
to turn it off to mourn for death

to die for you
to eat myself
piece by piece until i'm gone

to break though the madness of the night
everything is gonna be alright
soon this life will be over
run through the darkness and the streets
so no one else can see
death move a little closer
