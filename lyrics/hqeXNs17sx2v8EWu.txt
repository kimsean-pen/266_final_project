I've discovered that all monsters are human,
and they'll devour anything that smells weak.
Shamelessly shredding innocence to pieces.
Shamelessly shredding innocence to pieces.

And it's amazing what we can destroy without a single touch.
How does it feel to find out that it's all been lies?
It's all been lies Ana, how does it feel Ana?
What a relief to be told that you're just fine.
You're just fine Ana, what a relief Ana.
You're just fine. Ana, how does it feel?

We're victims of a culture that taught us to deny anything different.
And it's selective poison ruining our youth.
It's selective poison ruining our youth, Oh.

And it's amazing what we can destroy without a single touch.
How does it feel to find out that it's all been lies?
It's all been lies Ana, how does it feel Ana?
What a relief to be told that you're just fine.
You're just fine Ana, what a relief Ana.
You're just fine. Ana, how does it feel?

You can't have me, Ana.
You can't have me.
You can't have me, Ana.
You can't have me.

How does it feel to find out that it's all been lies?
It's all been lies Ana, how does it feel Ana?
What a relief to be told that you're just fine.
You're just fine Ana, what a relief Ana.
You're just fine. Ana, how does it feel?
