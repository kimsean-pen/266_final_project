Woke up this morning
Set off down the road
Left behind me all those years
Searching for a common soul
I've been looking for a thousand
And one distractions
To empty my mind
Of thoughts of loneliness
I've been looking for someone
To take away my frustrations
But all I find is a sea of emptiness

Death will be my bride
Death will be my bride

Three hours from sundown
I'm still on the road
With those voices in my head
Ringing down the years
For the wind whispers my name
And the leaves they lend a helping hand
If I don't reach you by this time tomorrow
I'll be stone cold dead in the ground

Death will be my bride
Death will be my bride
