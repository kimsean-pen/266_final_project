Transport
Motorways and tram-lines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing

The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people, yeah
Clinging on to bottles
But when it comes it's so, so, so disappointing

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
I said let down and hanging around

Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental, no
It always ends up drivel

One day, one day
I'm gonna, I'm gonna grow wings
It's a chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and

Let down and hanging around, yeah
Crushed like a bug in the ground
I said let down and hanging around, hey

Let down again
Let down again
Let down again

You know, you know where you are with
You know where you are with
Floor collapsing, floating
Bouncing back

One day, one day
I'm gonna grow wings
It's a chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless

I said let down and hanging around
Crushed, crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around, hey, hey, yeah

Let down again
Let down again
Let down again
