I've got you right where I want you
Leave you where I got you
No one to help you
Me that you turn to
Trip over your lies
You've got time to get tired
Caught up in the mess you try to leave behind
I'm over, I'm done
This really isn't fun
When you beg and you plead
And I kinda gotta leave
You're a mess, I'm stressed
This heat got you pressed
Talkin about real when I couldn't give you less

I've got you right where I want you
Leave you where I got you
No one to help you
Me that you turn to
Trip over your lies
You've got time to get tired
Caught up in the mess you try to leave behind
I'm over, I'm done
This really isn't fun
When you beg and you plead
And I kinda gotta leave
You're a mess, I'm stressed
This heat got you pressed
Talkin about real when I couldn't give you less

I've got you

I've got you

If I hear talk on my name
You'll soon regret that you came
It's not smart, it's not wise, and you'll never be the same
I give you one second luck
Now you're playing games to fuck with me
No trust and I'll be quick to dark you out before I duck
You see I'm done giving lessons to you boys
Who keep on messing with my mind
Do you think I'm blind?
I always see just what I'm getting
Is it cruel to keep up practice?
I've got time to go hard at this
Don't look down, give me your eyes
They'll be the last to see you back this

I've got you right where I want you
Leave you where I got you
No one to help you
Me that you turn to
Trip over your lies
You've got time to get tired
Caught up in the mess you try to leave behind
I'm over, I'm done
This really isn't fun
When you beg and you plead
And I kinda gotta leave
You're a mess, I'm stressed
This heat got you pressed
Talkin about real when I couldn't give you less

I've got you

I've got you
