Oil remove shred and tear
Radiation vapor air
It's the fear so unclear
Man in motion going nowhere
In our homes stuck in the face
Spread the word to the populace
Yellow journal, yellow journal
Set the pace feel the rage
Manifestations of a sort
So insidious off the point
Simple solution never confusion
Sport a gun kill a cop
Crazy world of weary thought
So receive me had enough
Lock me up
Lock me up

Rot and Assimilate
Too hot to annihilate

Rot and Assimilate
Too hot to annihilate

Deviation tonic mess
Prolonged existence innocence
Is he who speaks isn't weak
Wheelchair virtue so to speak
Bubonic plague the truth of aids
Immunity avoid decay
In the trench of pestilence
The bible screams announce your faith
Mutterings of death to bring
Suffocate a newborn thing
Degradation of an age
Venereal it's all sensation
Protect design the moral plan
Infallible as propaganda
Completely black
With no steps back

Rot and Assimilate
Too hot to annihilate

Rot and Assimilate
Too hot to annihilate

Agony
Inner thinking of the brain
Clanking chains
Groans of pain
