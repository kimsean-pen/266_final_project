A fortress in the sky
What's left of life it holds
We live on borrowed time

Along a glowing moonlit pier
Their armies still advance
From the murky depths they rise

From their rotting bones
Their souls they scream
For the flesh they need

Tonight... Zombies walk
Upon the earth
Land of the Dead

Massive flames arise
They burn out of control
In the slums it's genocide

Evolved they find a way inside
Those who could escape
Had no chance to survive
