I'm so tired of the cold
It's running straight right through my bones, yeah
And I could sleep next to the heater
It's not enough to keep me warm, no no
Now maybe some sleep can cure my aforementioned
Fear of death and lack of home
My mind is shaking in somebody's spare room
Someone I barely even know

I hear your voice, it's a symphony

Well my friend, it's been quite a year
And I feel right now, that I need you here
A romance, so cavalier
I hear your voice but you're never near
The lights set in, as I come out
And I'm reminded what it's all about
I'll still think of you every time
I'll be just fine

Spent another evening drinking, out of focus, me and you
Watched the fireworks at parliament, from someone else's roof
Spend the weekend out of town
Rainy days we just lay around
Seems I've found that I just can't live without you

Forget what you told
Focus, breathe in slow
Life is much shorter than we know
(Spending hours in the afterglow)
God I feel alive, alive enough to die
We can go anywhere we'd like
But staying in tonight, alright

Well my friend, it's been quite a year
And I feel right now, that I need you here
A romance, so cavalier
I hear your voice but you're never near
The lights set in, as I come out
And I'm reminded what it's all about
I'll still think of you every time
I'll be just fine

Well my friend, it's been quite a year
And I feel right now, that I need you here
A romance, so cavalier
I hear your voice but you're never near
The lights set in, as I come out
And I'm reminded what it's all about
I'll still think of you every time
I'll be just fine
