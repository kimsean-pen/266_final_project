Reasons, why you ran
Don't make you a good man
Yes, I understand

You were on time at the wrong time
I was debating, but tried and I don't know why
You can act cold on a dime and so outta line

For you
I'd do anything for you
Nail my heart to the ceiling
Put my fist through a wall

How come (how come)
I stick around when I break down (break down, break down)
I take the blows like a champion (champion, champion)
But I get nothing at all

Reasons for my hope
All make me a big joke
I already know

You were just fine, I was just fine
Why did we turn a good time to a dark one?
I'd give you a chance, but the better man never called, oh, oh

For you (for you)
I'd do anything for you (for you, for you)
Nail my heart to the ceiling (ceiling, ceiling)
I'd put my fist through a wall

How come (how come)
I stick around when I break down (break down, break down)
I take the blows like a champion (champion, champion)
But I get nothing at all

But I get nothing at all
But I get nothing at all

For you, I'd do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you (put my fist through a wall)
I would do anything

For you (for you)
I'd do anything for you (for you, for you)
Nail my heart to the ceiling (ceiling, ceiling) o-oh
I'd put my fist through a wall (put my fist through a wal)

How come (how come)
I stick around when I break down (I stick around when I break down)
I take the blows like a champion (champion, champion)
But I get nothing at all (but I get nothing, but I get nothing at all)
I get nothing at all

(For you, I'd do anything for you)
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything
