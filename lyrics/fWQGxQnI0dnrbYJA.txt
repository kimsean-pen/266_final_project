Clad in pretence we face the face of future
And undercover frightened like a child
My order was revenge, now i'm worn out and torn
But you are my tower of power

Would you be my pale empress
My haven in the gale
Would you be my shelter strong
So, would you be my empress
So strong and yet so pale
Would you sing our, sing our
Sing our empire song

I sought some refuge, sought it in your shadow
But shadows are much taller than you are
And our country is a land of tumbling walls
I thought you were, i never saw you are

Would you be my pale empress
My haven in the gale
Would you be my shelter strong
So, would you be my empress
So strong and yet so pale
Would you sing our, sing our
Sing our empire song
