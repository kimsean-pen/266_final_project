Tuck it in or take it out for what
You cannot see with them eyes
A tired hand, her naked hand, putting me to sleep

It won't be long, your glow
Has left me dry and my abstinence has been
Postponed by my comfort in denial

And the worst lie it may be (that hope said)
She'd be the last one to leave

Always close now sense it clear
For years to come I can't go back
To the things I held so, I held so dear

We were crushed by her halo—oh what a way to go

Endlessly she said forevermore in debt

Colourful, so beautiful, with fever eyes closed and so free
Those were my heroines

Freedom roar from senseless mind
Apocalypse all dressed in white
Saw it coming watched them leaving with all I ever was

Broken tissue, broken dreams far-fetched as those fantasies
Since peace of mind was not meant for me
(I'll praise them silently)

We were crushed by her halo—oh what a way to go

Endlessly she said forevermore in debt

Colourful, so beautiful, with fever eyes closed and so free
Those were my heroines
