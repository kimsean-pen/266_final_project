Mmm Yeah
My love's a weapon and I'm knockin' em dead
I got a heart that's tough as leather
Get what I want and just forget em
Well this game you're playing is a Russian Roulette
Just cause I'm sweet when we're together
Doesn't mean I'm yours forever

I never should have looked into your eyes
Now everybody's gonna see how I feel

Don't go ruining, ruining my my bad reputation
Don't go telling them, telling them all the plans we've been makin
Cause everyone knows that I don't cry
You never see stars shining in my eyes yeah
Don't go ruining, ruining my my bad reputation
Oh no, oh oh no no
Oh no, oh oh no no

Well I tell em tell em yeah you're nothing to me
I tell him that you, you're just another
You're just like any other
Well I try to sell em but they ain't buying it
Baby they see me start to stutter
When they ask if you're my lover

I'm losing sleep, what's gotten into me
I'm usually never this week baby

Don't go ruining, ruining my my bad reputation
Don't go telling them, telling them all the plans we've been makin
Cause everyone knows that I don't cry
You never see stars shining in my eyes
Don't go ruining, ruining my my bad reputation
Oh no, oh oh no no
Oh no, oh oh no no

I have got to pull myself together but I can't control it
My lips they know what they want everybody knows it
Once a girl controlled the world with words that pierced the bone
Now I'm smiling like a lovesick puppy everybody knows it yeah yeah yeah oh yeah oh yeah

Don't go ruining, ruining my my bad reputation
Don't go telling them, telling them all the plans we've been makin
Cause everyone knows that I don't cry
You never see stars shining in my eyes yeah
Don't go ruining, ruining my my bad reputation
Oh no, oh oh no no
Oh no, oh oh no no

Don't go ruining, ruining my my bad reputation
Don't go telling them, telling them all the plans we've been makin
Cause everyone knows that I don't cry
You never see stars shining in my eyes yeah
Don't go ruining, ruining my my bad reputation
Oh no
