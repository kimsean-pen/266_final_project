If only we could fly
Limp Bizkit style
John Otto
Take 'em to the Mathews Bridge
Can you feel it?
My g-g-generation
Get up, my g-g-generation
Are you ready?

Do you know where you are?
Welcome to the jungle punk
Take a look around
It's Limp Bizkit fuckin' up your town
We downloaded the Shockwave
For all the ladies in the cave to get your groove on
And maybe I'm the one who flew over the cuckoo's nest
Well guess who's next? (who?)
Generation x, generation strange
Sun don't even shine through our window pane

So go ahead and talk shit
Talk shit about me
Go ahead and talk shit
About my g-g-generation

'Cause we don't, don't give a fuck and
We won't ever give a fuck until you
You give a fuck about me
And my generation

Hey kid, take my advice
You don't want to step into a big pile of shit
The captain's drunk
Your world is Titanic
Floating on the funk, so get your groove on
And maybe I am just a little fucked up
Life's just a little fucked up
Generation x, generation strange
Sun don't even shine through our window pane

So go ahead and talk shit
Talk shit about me
Go ahead and talk shit
About my g-g-generation

'Cause we don't, don't give a fuck and
We won't ever give a fuck until you
You give a fuck about me
And my generation
We don't, don't give a fuck and
We won't ever give a fuck until you
You give a fuck about me
And my generation

Who gets the blame?
You get the blame
And I get the blame
Who gets the blame?
You get the blame
And I get the blame
But do you think we can fly? (away, away)
Do you think we can fly? (away)
Do you think we can fly?
Well I do (I do)
I do (I do), fly!

DJ Lethal, bring it on!

Oh yeah, come on!
So go ahead and talk shit
Talk shit about me
And go ahead and talk shit
About my g-g-generation

'Cause we don't, don't give a fuck and
We won't ever give a fuck until you
You give a fuck about me
And my generation
We don't, don't give a fuck and
We won't ever give a fuck until you
You give a fuck about me
And my generation
Oh yeah!
