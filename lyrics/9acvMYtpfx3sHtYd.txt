i went to class, you didn't show up
i thought we said that we'd keep in touch
walk through town, disassembled on a crutch
just like you did when you were in love

i left the house and i didn't miss much
you opened your mouth and i lost my trust
yeah i left the house for the first time in months
for the first time in months

now here i am, disassembled as a whole
when i got home i lost control
