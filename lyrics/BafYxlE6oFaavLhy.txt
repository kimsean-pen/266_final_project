When you're near me I have no fear
When I'm untrue you see right through me
You know me as deep as the sea goes
Calm my head whenever a storm blows

When the stars, and the moon,
and the sky fall through

I'd throw them all away when I'm hollow
Deep as the sea goes
All I know is I would
Throw them all away, away

So in my restless hour I'm holding
Words you say that lay my soul to sleep
I dream of buildings that burn
The sky turns black, I toss and turn

When the stars, and the moon,
and the sky fall through

I'd throw them all away when I'm hollow
Deep as the sea goes
All I know is I would
Throw them all away, away

This love branches out like an oak tree
Reach for the sky and roots to the sea
So when you're shaken down and broken
Find your peace of mind in knowing

I'd throw them all away when I'm hollow
Deep as the sea goes
All I know is I would
Throw them all away when I'm hollow
Deep as the sea goes
All I know is I would
Throw them all away, away
