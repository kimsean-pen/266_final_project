keep me alive
only you can do it
if not you'll die too
and i'll see to it

it's hard to survive
don't know if i can do it

keep me alive
i can't accept my fate
i need help
before it's too late

it's hard to survive, don't know if i can do it
i need to belong, i need to hang on
i need, need

keep me alive feelings i must obey
can't turn my eyes from the past
this crisis is the last

keep me alive
i rely on your judgement
i've got none left of my own
don't know what i'm doing

it's hard to survive, don't know if i can do it
i need to belong, i need to hang on
i need, need

keep me alive
only you can do it
keep me alive
only you can do it

it's hard to survive, don't know if i can do it

keep me alive
keep me alive
keep me alive
keep me alive

it's hard to survive, don't know if i can do it
i need to belong, i need to hang on
i need, need
