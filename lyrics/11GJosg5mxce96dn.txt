Ay, ay, ow
You say you wanna walk away
You ain't got nothing to say
I salute you

Go on out the door
Now, you take care
No more tears to shed
What, you expecting me to beg

Well I'm not, I'm done
So when you leave just close the door behind you
Cause, I'm feeling kind of taller than you, lately
I'm feeling kind of stronger than you, lately

I'm feeling kind of better than you
And I know just what to do, yeah
I feel like doing my hair

I feel like calling some of my friends (some of my girlfriends)
I feel like going to a club and partying
Cause I'm a soldier girl, in this world
I stand alone, I can be strong

I walked the miles, I made home
It's good to know without you I made it
Soldier girl, in my world
I took the fall now I stand tall
Fought the pain and all, I made it through

And now all I gotta say to you is
Salute, ay, ay
Salute, ay, ay
You think you know everything

And you think that your shit don't stink
Well it do, yeah
And when it comes to me
You don't have a clue

It took me all of these years
To realize that you were gone long but not here
I can do better
You say I'll never do better

Yeah right, whatever
Cause, I'm feeling kind of taller than you, lately
I'm feeling kind of stronger than you, baby lately

I'm feeling kind of better than you
And I know just what to do
I feel like doing my hair
I feel like calling some of my friends (my girlfriends)

I feel like going to a club and do some partying
Cause I'm a soldier girl, in this world
I stand alone, I can be strong
I walked the miles, (walk a mile)
I made it home, (I made it home)

It's good to know without you I made it
Soldier girl, (Solider girl)
In my world (in this world)
I took the fall now I stand tall

Fought the pain and all, I made it through
And now all I gotta say to you
I Salute, ay, ay
I Salute, ay, ay

So don't call or come back
I did it for years, yeah
Through all of the drama and the pain
And all of the tears
It's time to stop this rollercoaster
See I wanna get off
Let's start moving mountains, swimming seas
And climbing over walls
Cause I'm a soldier girl, in this world
I Stand alone, I can be strong
I walked the miles, and made home
It's good to know without you I made it
Soldier, girl, in my world
I took the fall now I stand tall
Fought the pain and all, I made it through
And now all I gotta say to you
I Salute you, ay, ay
I Salute you, ay, ay
