I'll take it inward so no one sees
While you find slumber on tops of trees
And after all of this I still find it hard to breathe
I taught myself things you never did
You need a spine like I need new skin
But neither will ever happen

How dare you guilt me for not sticking around as if you ever did for me?
I'll leave you in the dark with a broken flashlight
You left me with a choice and a pretense

I will not follow in your footsteps
I'll find a face to call my own
Because the mask you wear is all I've ever known

Consider this a repercussion of the actions which you were never properly punished for due to an overbearing demeanor brought on by your own self-awareness
Your credibility is a half-empty glass of salt water that I watched you spill over and over and over again
Go ahead, make me the bad guy

How dare you guilt me for not sticking around as if you ever did for me?
I'll leave you in the dark with a broken flashlight
You left me with a choice and a pretense

So I'll take what strength I have left
If you could call it that
And I'll give you time to reflect
Then you can call me back

How dare you guilt me for not sticking around as if you ever did for me?
I'll leave you in the dark with a broken flashlight
You left me with a choice and a pretense
You left me with a choice and a pretense
You left me with a choice and a pretense
