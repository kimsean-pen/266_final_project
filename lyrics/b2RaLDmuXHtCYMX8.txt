I'm gonna fall off of this Earth, cause I'm living low
And I fear that I've wasted all the wisdom that I know
And I dream of a place, somewhere I could disappear
With colors, they rain, a shower that kills your fear
I want to feel the bliss, that I, I deserve

We're on the midnight island in the heart of the sea
Let me take you down to the tree of dreams, of dreams
Oh, let your body escape, take a breath from your mind
If you would rather rest in the place of paradise, paradise
Oh, we're on the midnight island in the heart of the sea
Let me take you down to the tree of dreams, of dreams
Oh, let your body escape, take a breath from your mind
If you would rather rest in the place of paradise, paradise

I'm gonna fall into the world of the unknown
Where the colors, they chase the tales of children who've been alone
And there's waterfalls all around me
The sky and the stars fill my surroundings
And in the night, I wake you, to be a bad man

We're on the midnight island in the heart of the sea
Let me take you down to the tree of dreams, of dreams
Oh, let your body escape, take a breath from your mind
If you would rather rest in the place of paradise, paradise
Oh, we're on the midnight island in the heart of the sea
Let me take you down to the tree of dreams, of dreams
Oh, let your body escape, take a breath from your mind
If you would rather rest in the place of paradise, paradise

Let your body escape, take a breath from your mind
Let your body escape, take a breath from your mind
Let your body escape, take a breath from your mind
Let your body escape, take a breath from your mind
