I been balling a shiny black steel jack-hammer,
been chippin' up rocks for the great highway,
live five years if I take my time,
ballin' that jack and a drinkin' my wine.

I been chippin' them rocks from dawn till doom,
while my rider hide my bottle in the other room.
Doctor say better stop ballin' that jack,
if I live five years I gonna bust my back, yes I will.

Easy wind cross the Bayou today
cause there's a whole lotta women, mama,
out in red on the streets today.
And the river keeps a talkin',
but you never heard a word it said.

Gotta find a woman be good to me,
won't hide my liquor try to serve me tea,
cause I'm a stone jack baller and my heart is true
and I'll give everything that I got to you, yes I will.

Easy wind going cross the Bayou today
there's a whole lotta women
out on the streets in a red today.
And the river keep a talkin',
but you never heard a word it said.
