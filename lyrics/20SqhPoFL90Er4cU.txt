Raise your voice
Start a feud
Spoiled for Joyce
I hesitate
To intrude

Bolshy bolshy bolshy oh
Bolshy bolshy bolshy oh
Bolshy bolshy bolshy oh
Where you lead, my heart will go

Get me excited or give me a smile
I'll wait if you say and I'll be worth my while
There you are, pretending you're lonely
I don't believe you, don't know you could own me
Don't know you could own me
You don't know you could own me

Bolshy bolshy bolshy oh
Bolshy bolshy bolshy oh
Bolshy bolshy bolshy oh
Where you lead, my heart will go

Bolshy bolshy bolshy oh
Bolshy bolshy bolshy oh
Bolshy bolshy bolshy oh
Where you lead, my heart will go

Oh
Where you lead, my heart will go

There you are
Pretending you're lonely
I don't believe
You don't know you could own me

There you are
Pretending you're lonely
I don't believe
You don't know you could own me

You don't know you could own me

Bolshy bolshy bolshy oh
Bolshy bolshy bolshy oh
Bolshy bolshy bolshy oh
Where you lead, my heart will go

Bolshy bolshy bolshy oh
Bolshy bolshy bolshy oh
Bolshy bolshy bolshy oh
Where you lead, my heart will go

Bolshy bolshy bolshy oh
Bolshy bolshy bolshy oh
Bolshy bolshy bolshy oh
Where you lead, my heart will go
