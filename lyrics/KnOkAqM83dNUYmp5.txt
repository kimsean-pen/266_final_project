3 am
I think's it's saturday night
We're recovering from another fight
And i
Cant believe i keep on wasting my time
Somtimes i think we wont escape here alive
And i'm tired

But i cant stop
Cos need your love

If i was messiah if ruled the world
Even if i had it all
I will need your love

If i was the center of the uni
Even if i never fall
I will need your love

You and I are like a fiery storm
Scorching water is the fuel to our love
And I never knew that I could belong
To somebody who feels so right and so wrong
I'm exhausted

But I need your love
