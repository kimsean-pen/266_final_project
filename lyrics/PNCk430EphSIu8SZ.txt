Complicate this world you wrapped for me
I'm acquainted with your suffering

And all your weight
It falls on me, it brings me down
And all your weight
It falls on me, it falls on me

Hold me up to all whom you've deceived
Promises you break you still believe

And all your weight
It falls on me, it brings me down
And all your weight
It brings me down, it brings down
And all your weight
It falls on me, it brings me down
And all your weight
It falls on me, it falls on me

And all your weight
It falls on me, it brings me down
And all your weight
It falls on me, it falls on me
