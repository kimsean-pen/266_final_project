Experience your race!
You are the son of the hostile nest.
Dormant, damned skills, and mercy-proof eyes.
Black gates to its core. Welcome to the swarm!
Grind your string, pull out the tongue, forget speech, impale claws.
Ready to attack, always bites back twice.
Banish the Decalogue, the strongest shape the law.
Never lower the eyes, the weak ones lose at once.
Born in pain, bring the pain. Burnish bloody, priceless craft!

Inner crusade, man against the beast,
or beast against the anthropic man?
Eternal search for thyself.
The delusion of triumph. The burden of plague.
Human ever-equal death!
Humanize yourself - die!
Or incarnate the beast - strike!
Seal the cursed fate.
The wrath is the way. Discover its taste.
The virgin hit - a furious release.
Don't move a step back!
This is the lethal symphony of nature.
