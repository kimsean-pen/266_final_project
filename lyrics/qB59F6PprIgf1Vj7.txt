Now, I may be
An old-fashioned country girl
But when it comes
To loving you
Honey I know what to do
Now I put
All my pride aside
I won't be denied
I'm satisfied
I'm all you'll ever need
Now that you've had the fun
You'll wanna run
But look here daddy
That's not where
I'm coming from

You can hit and run
I've got to be
Number one
Gotta make up your mind
'Cause you'll never
Find a love so divine

You can hit and run
I've got to be
Number one
Gotta make up your mind
'Cause you'll never
Find a love so divine

You may have been
Known as a lady's man
But you have to understand
I want a
One-woman man
No second best
Will ever do
Between me and you
Because there's only room
In my world
Just for two
So you can throw away
Your little black book
If you're gonna stay
Then you gotta stay
I was brought up
That way

You can hit and run
Gotta be number one
Gotta make up your mind
'Cause you'll never
Find a love so divine

You can hit and run
I've gotta get number one
Gotta make up your mind
'Cause you'll never
Find a love so divine

Now that you've had the fun
You'll wanna run
But look here daddy
That's not where
I'm coming from

You can hit and run
I've got to be
Number one
Gotta make up your mind
'Cause you'll never
Find a love so divine

You can hit and run
Gotta be number one
If you're gonna stay
Then you've gotta stay
I was brought up
That way

You can hit and run
I've gotta be number one
Gotta make up your mind
'Cause you'll never
Find a love
So divine

You can hit and run
I've got to be number one
If you're gonna stay
Then you've gotta stay
I was brought up
That way

You can hit and run
Hit and run
Satisfied
I get satisfied
And I long desire
A long desire
If you're gonna stay
Yeah, honey you gotta stay
A long desire
Hit and run
No 'nother lady's man
No 'nother lady's man
Well, between me and you
That's the matter
Between me an dyou
I want a one-woman man
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
And you've gotta stay
'Cause see I was
Brought up that way
I may be
I may be old fashioned
And a country girl
but when it comes to
Loving you
When it comes to
Love
I know what to do
I know what to do
I put all my pride aside
I won't deny
You see I can satisfy... fade...
