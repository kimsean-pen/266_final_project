Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Woaah, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Waaoh, Oh, Oh

Life's just a pace car on death
Only less diligent
And when the two collide
It's no coincidence
The lights are on and everybody's home

The only thing suicidal here is the door
We had a good run
Even I have to admit
Life's just a pace car on death
Only less diligent

Hell or Glory
I don't want anything in between
Then came a baby boy with long eyelashes
And Daddy said you gotta show the world

The thunder (Woah)
The Thunder (Woah)
The Thunder (Woah)
The Thunder (Woah)

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Woaah, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Woahh, Oh, Oh

We didn't come to compete
This is a demonstration
Even the young ones become irrelevant
They always bring up how you've changed

Never the same person when I go to sleep
As when I wake up
As when I wake up
Bop bop ba dop
Ba dop op ba dop
Ba dop op ba dop
Ba dop op ba dop

Hell or Glory
I don't want anything in between
Then came a baby boy with long eyelashes
And Daddy said you gotta show the world

The Thunder (Woah)
The Thunder (Woah)
The Thunder (Woah)
The Thunder (Woah)

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Woaah, Oh, Oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Woaah, Oh, Oh

Hell or Glory
I don't want anything in between
Then came a baby boy with long eyelashes
And Daddy said you gotta show the world
The Thunder (Woah)
The Thunder (Woah)
The Thunder (Woah)
The Thunder (Woah)

He Said Bring The Thunder (Woah)
The Thunder
Woah
The Thunder
Woah, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh
Ohh
