Let's go

Baby, I just want you to be mine
Won't you give me a bit of your time? Oh, woah
Chasin' you, no, I won't stop tryin'
Just meet me at the borderline
(Exclusive)

You play hard-to-get
But I know you want me, too
Ain't out here looking for other dudes
So I'ma keep it tight for you

You know I'm the wifey type, bae
You know I be one of a kind, oh, woah
Once you tastin' my ice cream
I bet you won't ever leave
I know it's hard to believe
But you got me all on my knees

(Light it up, tho)
(Light it up, tho)
You're playin' too hard for me
(Light it up, tho)
(Light it up, tho)
Stop playin' too hard for me

Seems like I'm comin' on strong
But I don't want this time to pass
I know you gotta lotta chicks hollerin' at you
But I bet they cannot last

You know I'm the wifey type, bae
You know I be one of a kind, oh, woah

Uh, I'm like, you got me so on a chase
Got me feelin' so out of place
Think 'bout you all of my days
Wish you'd chew on me like fresh grapes
Not tryna cuff you or crowd your place
I'm tryna find cute words just to say
"Dang, you fine, and look at that face"
At the borderline beside me you lay

Baby, I just want you to be mine
Won't you give me a bit of your time? Oh, woah
Chasin' you, no, I won't stop tryin'
Just meet me at the borderline
