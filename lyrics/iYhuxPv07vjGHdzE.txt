Killing my past

歩き出す欠けたまま脈を打ち
自分という存在を
どこかでいつも否定していた

I seem to lose all dazzling light
Can't understand this broken sight

Redo the pain pain start all over
I want to kill the past
I feel the shame shame it's never over
These days
I'm better dead

I want to be reborn
Leave me alone
歪む自分の影に声を殺し泣いた
Shite fuck
What's happened to me
Why is it always just like this
Go to hell
God damn it fuck
What's happened to me
Why is it always just like this
Go to hell

Redo the pain pain start all over
I want to kill the past
I feel the shame shame it's never over
Why do these days last
Redo the pain pain start all over
I want to kill the past
I feel the shame shame it's never over
These days
I'm better dead

In darker dreams
(help me)
A goddess speaks to me
And it seems
(there's no way)
I cannot see the light
(help me)
Out of sight
And reborn somewhere else
Don't just abandon me
Please

Please
Please
Please
Fuck you
