Be around when you call me
I'll be around, be around for the ball

Hot love is for sale
And the time is just right

And when i see a little temp'rature rise
You know i wasn't surprised
See you were smiling, oh
Hot love will burn
Hot love will burn your heart

Got the time if you need it

You know i wasn't surprised
See, that you were smiling
Hot love will burn
Hot love will burn you

Hot love will burn your heart
Hot love will burn
