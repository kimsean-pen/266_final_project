Nothing goes to plan
It's all a game of chance they say in Wonderland
There's magic in the air
A tragic love affair that I don't understand

These summer girls are really
Something else
Our lifes are short

But the nights are long
Mrs Halloween
Is drinking at the bar again in New Orleans
She throws another dart
It narrowly avoids my lonely broken heart

Torn apart
These summer girls are really
Something else
Our lifes are short
But the nights are long
The nights go on and on

The nights go on and on
The nights go on and on
So pinch me I must be dreaming

My life has lost all its meaning
But I like the way I'm feeling now
Kissing her lips at midnight

Under the stars and moonlight
But I never thought we'd be this wrong
The nights go on and on

The nights go on and on
The nights go on and on
She's looking good tonight
I love the way she glows in ultraviolet light
Intoxicate my mind
I know that love is blind and I'm not seeing right

I'm not alright
These summer girls are really
Something else
Our lifes are short
But the nights are long
These summer girls are really
Something else
Our lifes are short
But the nights are long
The nights go on and on
The nights go on and on
The nights go on and on
