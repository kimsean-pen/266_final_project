Sharpen the pick
To pierce the skull through the ear
Stab at an angle
Cranial transfixion, hearing and vision terminated by the penetration

Skewered from ear to eye
Lancing the boil of your mind
Deafened by the piercing thrust
Exit wound has left you blind

Skewered from ear to eye
Bisection of the brain by steel
Final thoughts will dissipate
Unable to perceive what is real

Struggle with death
In shock you grasp at the air
Senses deprived
Cerebral cessation, mental division created by this perforation

Skewered from ear to eye
Lancing the boil of your mind
Deafened by the piercing thrust
Exit wound has left you blind

Skewered from ear to eye
Bisection of the brain by steel
Final thoughts will dissipate
Unable to perceive what is real

Boring through the brain, eye impaled upon the point
Steel spears crisscross your grey matter
Puncturing the eardrum and the blood begins to ooze
Red blooms grace the dying head

Auditory nerve is severed
Labyrinth destroyed
You are rendered deaf and blind
Seconds before death

On a spit
Your head will burn
Charring flesh
Brain tissue congeals

Crack the skull
Open wide
Scoop it out
I consume your mind

[Solo - O'Brien]

Eating the brain
To gain the knowledge of death
You are inside
Psychic absorption, hearing and vision
Are now mine through this appropriation

Skewered from ear to eye
Lancing the boil of your mind
Deafened by the piercing thrust
Exit wound has left you blind

Skewered from ear to eye
Bisection of the brain by steel
Final thoughts will dissipate
Unable to perceive what is real
