Ooooh, whoa

Something about the way
You looked at me
Made me think for a moment
That maybe we were meant to be
Living our lives separately
And it's strange that things change
But not me wanting you
So desperately

Ohhh
Why can't I ignore it (Yeah)
I keep giving in
But I should know better
Cause there was something about the way
You looked at me
And it's strange that things change
But not me wanting you
So desperately

You looked my way
And said "You frustrate me"
Like you're thinking of lines and times
When you and I were you and me
We took our chance out on the street
Then I missed my chance and chances are
It won't be coming back to me

Why can't I ignore it (Yeah)
I keep giving in
But I should know better.
Cause there's something about the way
You looked at me
And it's strange that things change
But not me wanting you
So desperately
So desperately

Ohhh
Why can't I ignore it (Yeah)
I keep giving in
But I should know better
Cause there was something about the way
You looked at me
And it's strange that things change
But not me wanting you
So desperately
So desperately
I want you so desperately

I keep giving in but I should know better
I keep giving in but I should know better
So desperately
I want you so desperately
