Looking through the keyhole
As you hear the thunder roar
You see the lightening flashing
But you know not what it's for
There looks to be a stallion
With a rider on it's back
You have seen him pass
And know that he'll be back
He looks to be a wizard
Or perhaps a magic man
With eyes of liquid fire
Golden staff within his hand
And he rides above the mountains
With the secret that he holds
The time has come, the people must be told

So shall it be written
So shall it be done
Came the warning from the prophet
And it came to pass before the rising sun

He looked upon the thousands
That had come to hear him speak
He warned them of the darkness
Of their evil and their greed
But somehow they ignored him
Though their faces filled with fear
So he turned away and shed a single tear

So shall it be written
So shall it be done
Came the warning from the prophet
And it came to pass before the rising sun

Well his words had gone unheeded
Nothing more that could be done
He returned into the mountains
From where he had begun
Now he watches from the heavens
As the void is drawing near
And the prophet's words are ringin'
All too clear, all too clear, all too clear

So shall it be written
So shall it be done
Came the warning from the prophet
And it came to pass before the rising sun
So shall it be written
So shall it be done
Came the warning from the prophet
And it came to pass before the rising sun
