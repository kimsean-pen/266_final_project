Oh, she never had a chance
Oh, she was only five years old
Pity the poor little darling now
Oh, she never had a chance
Death came quick
For a girl
Victim of a homicide
Cut and beaten
Brutally raped
The five year old
She Didn't escape
Her mom and friends
Did her in
Cigarette burns
On her arms
From her mom and her friend
He had a whip
To hit her again
Do you wanna party?
It's partytime
We gotta party!

It's partytime
DahahaHA
Oh, she never had a chance
Oh, she was only five years old
Oh, she never was aware
Oh, she never had a chance
Her grand mother
Was sent to jail
Except Veronica
Her older sister
She wasn't loved
For a dime
Where ever it is it's party time
Do you wanna party
It's partytime
We gotta party
It's partytime
Do you wanna party?
It's partytime
We gotta party!
It's partytime
It's partytime
It's partytime
It's partytime
It's partytime
It's partytime
