Trying to pick up the pace

Trying to make it so I never see your face again
Time to throw this away
Wanna make sure that you never waste my time again
How does it feel?

How does it feel to be you right now, dear?
You broke this apart
So pick your piece
And go away from here

Please just let me go now
Please just let me go
Would you please just let me go now?
Please just let me go

I'm gonna get you
I gotta get you
I'm gonna get you out of my head

GET OUT!
I'm gonna get you
I gotta get you

I'm gonna get you out of my head
GET OUT!
Never said we'd be friends
Trying to keep myself away from you
Cause you're bad, bad news
With you gone

I'm alive
Makes me feel like I took happy pills
And time stands still
How does it feel?
How does it feel to be the one shut out?
You broke all the rules
I won't be a fool for you, no more, my dear
Please just let me go now, Please just let me go
Would you please just let me go now?
Please just let me go
I'm gonna get you
I gotta get you
I'm gonna get you out of my head
GET OUT!
I'm gonna get you
I gotta get you
I'm gonna get you out of my head
GET OUT!
