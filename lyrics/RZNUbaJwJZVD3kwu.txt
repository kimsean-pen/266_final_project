So sit back and relax
Enjoy your cocaine Kate
Takes some time to get used to
But I know you'll be
Alright

Send some sensitivity
Gettin' you are you're feelin' me
Jump out the window
If it's the last thing
I do

You can have my piggy bank when I die
For you

Put a match to a tree
Watch the leaves burn high
They're all sensitive like you, babe
But I know you'll be alright
You'll be alright
You'll be alright
You'll be alright
