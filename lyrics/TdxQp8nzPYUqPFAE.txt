And I know I've been closing myself off, unsure
I know I've been real hard to reach, and harder to love
And I know it's tiring, this shit is getting old
But please, just hold on to me

I've slayed these demons, they're old to me
Recurring dreams, this is happening
Tearing my seams; lucid reality

And I just want you to feel love (love)
Before it disappears (not)
'Cause we are more than we're not (wrong)
So never fear to feel (brave)
Good when everything's wrong (love)
And find some beauty there (not)
'Cause all we ever are is brave (brave)
And your world's not ending, ooh

So I won't go
I'm still living in the middle of a one-way war
I can't fight it but I'm trying to be what you want, yeah
You can't sing but you're singing this anyway
And anyway

So please just hold on to me
This is no end, we're not finished here
Finding our way, we're just changing
Becoming more than I think of me, yeah

These fears in my head, dreams in my bed
They won't get the best of me
'Cause I chase dreams 'til the end
These nightmares all bend
Silver linings are all I need

So, please, just hold on to me
I've slayed these demons, they're old to me
Recurring dreams, this is happening
Tearing my seams from reality

And I just want you to feel love
Before it disappears
'Cause we are more than we're not
So never fear to feel

Good when everything's wrong (wrong)
And find some beauty there (not)
'Cause all we ever are is brave
