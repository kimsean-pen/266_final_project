Maybe I act on confused behavior
Maybe waves crash like semi-trailer
Maybe I'll spend my off-time without you
It seems like we need our own space

And all this time I've wasted away
To not feel good unless you stay, stay, stay
And all this time I've chased you away
Simply to catch back up with

Your solitude is welcome, welcome
Your attitude is welcome, welcome
Your solitude is welcome, welcome
Your attitude is welcome

All you see is red lights behind me
Maybe this isn't what you wanted, baby
And I don't blame you falling backwards
No one's ever quite confused you this way

And all this time we wasted away
Don't feel good unless we're gray
And all the times I chased you away
I simply don't feel good

Your solitude is welcome, welcome
Your attitude is welcome, welcome
Your solitude is welcome, welcome
Your attitude is welcome

You are welcome
You are welcome
You are welcome
You are welcome

All this time, we heard alarms
Come to find, we fell apart
This whole thing has crashed down, crashed down
All this time, we heard alarms

Your solitude is welcome, welcome
Your attitude is welcome, welcome
Your solitude is welcome, welcome
Your attitude is welcome
You are welcome
You are welcome
You are welcome
You are welcome
Welcome, welcome
Welcome, welcome
Welcome, welcome
