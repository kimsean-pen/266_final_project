The snow covered plains...
Early dawn...

As the village greets a new day, the old Crow cries atop the pine.
Spiritually bounded with nature and all creatures, great and small, the
hunting families sense danger as the cry of the old Crow continues. A
rumble, at first loud enough to a human ear, grows into a deafening storm
of hooves thundering across the frozen tundra. Then bursts into the
village, four times five riders clad in in armour black. Swords drawn
glimmering int the awakening sun's light. Cries echoes. Throats are slit.
Beautiful bodies fall to the frozen ground and limbs of able men are stewn
across the snowcovered plains. The blood colours the white snow red. Women
and children are brought far north. Hidden under the foliage of a majestic
tree, a ten year-old boy. When the shadows ahorse can no longer be heard,
he crawls out from his hideout to seek his loved ones. Not a sound. Not a
movement. No sign of life...
And thus begins the saga of Blood On Ice...
