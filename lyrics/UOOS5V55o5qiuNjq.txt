I can tell you, what they say in space
That our earth is too grey
But when the spirit is so digital
The body acts this way
That world was killing me
World was killin' me
Disassociative
The nervous systems down
The nervous systems down
I know
The nervous systems down
The nervous systems down
I know
I can never get out of here
I don't wanna explode in fear
A dead astronaut in space
I can never get out of here
I don't wanna explode in fear
A dead astronaut in space
Sometimes we walk like, we were shot
Through our heads, my love
We write our song in space
Like we are already, dead and gone
Your world was killin' me
World was killin' me
Disassociative
Your world was killin' me
Your world was killin' me
Disassociative
I can never get out of here
I don't wanna explode in fear
A dead astronaut in space
I can never get out of here
I don't wanna explode in fear
A dead astronaut in space
The nervous systems down
The nervous systems down
The nervous systems down
The nervous systems down
I can never get out of here
I don't wanna explode in fear
A dead astronaut in space
I can never get out of here
I don't wanna explode in fear
A dead astronaut in space
