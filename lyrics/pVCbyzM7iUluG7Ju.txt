Wait.
Oh, yes, wait a minute, Mr. Postman.

Wait.
Wa-a-a-a-a-ait, Mr. Postman.
Please Mr. Postman, look and see (Oh, yeah.)
Is there a letter in your bag for me.

Please, please Mr. Postman.
Yes, it's been a mighty long time (Oh, yeah.)
Since I heard from this boyfriend of mine.
There must be some word today

From my boyfriend who's so far away.
Please Mr. Postman, look and see
Is there a letter, a letter for me.
I was standing here waiting, Mr. Postman

So, so patiently
For just a card or just a letter
Saying he's returning home to me.
Please Mr. Postman. (Please Mr. Postman, look and see)

Oh, yeah. (Is there a letter in your bag for me.)
Please, please, Mr. Postman.
(Yes, it's been a mighty long time) Oh, yeah.
Since I heard from this boyfriend of mine.

So many days you passed me by.
You saw the tears standing in my eye.
You wouldn't stop to make me feel better
By leaving me a card or a letter.
(Postman, postman.) Please Mr. Postman, look and see

Is there a letter, oh yeah, in your bag for me.
You know it's been so long, (Postman, postman.)
Yeah, since I heard from this boyfriend of mine.
You better wait a minute, wait a minute.

(Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman.)
Oh, you better wait a minute. (Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman.)
Please, please, Mr. Postman. (Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman.)
Please check and see just one more time for me.
You better wait, wait a minute. (Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman.)
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
(Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman.)
Please, Mr. Postman. (Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman.)
Deliver the letter. The sooner, the better.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. (Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman.)
Wait a minute please, please, Mr. Postman.
(Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman.)
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
