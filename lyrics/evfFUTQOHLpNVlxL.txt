I've been a fool when you promised me
I stood around waiting for the end
You wanted to believe it'd go away

It's been a while since I've found my way
I never tried to understand
The war within our motherland
The war beneath my skin

I don't believe
I don't believe in you
Please don't let me down

It seems like time always finds its way
Tomorrow turns into yesterdays
You wanted to believe it'd go away

I was afraid you would put me down
I had no choice but to run away
The war within our motherland
The war beneath my skin

I don't believe
I don't believe in you
Please don't let me down

So why don't you talk to me?
Why don't you talk to me?
Why don't you talk to me?
