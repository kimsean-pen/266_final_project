Bela kisses you and reaches out for your heart
But his kisses causes your life to fall apart
Darkness evolves you and he takes control
Bela drowns his pain together with his wifes in alcohol

Bela Bela Kiss Kiss - Come please stop telling lies
Bela Bela Kiss Kiss - did you really kill your wife
Put her in an iron tank pickled in formaldehyde
Bela Bela Kiss Kiss - Kiss of Death and homicide

What kind of monster have you let yourself become
How many women are still out there on your farm
Your bare hands - their neck - you choke them
Your dark collection grows
but Bela your cold heart
stays for ever broken

Bela Bela Kiss Kiss - Come please stop telling lies
Bela Bela Kiss Kiss - did you really kill your wife
Put her in an iron tank pickled in formaldehyde
Bela Bela Kiss Kiss - Kiss of Death and homicide

You adored your wife until she found her self alone
but you made sure there was no happy ever after
and still somewhere in your home with the others
Carefully preserved float in blood strange bodies
Bodies

Bela Bela Kiss Kiss - Come please stoptelling lies
Bela Bela Kiss Kiss - did you really kill your wife
Put her in an iron tank pickled in formaldehyde
Bela Bela Kiss Kiss - Kiss of Death and homicide

Of death and homicide

Kiss of death and homicide
