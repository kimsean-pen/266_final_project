Inside you're pretending
Crimes have been swept aside
Somewhere

Where they can forget
Divine upper reaches
Still holding on
This ocean will not be grasped

All for nothing
Did you really want?
Did you really want?
Did you really want?

Did you really want?
Refuse to surrender
Strung out until ripped apart
Who dares, dares to condemn

All for nothing
Did you really want?
Did you really want?
Did you really want?
Did you really want?
