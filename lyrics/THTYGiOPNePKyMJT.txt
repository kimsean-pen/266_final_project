Can you even stand it being alone? why won't you demand it? don't you wanna watch it grow? thought you had a handle on both hands on the past need no explanation for something that will last

I don't need to be set free
I already know

all the dreams you wake from without a reason why
wake in levitation, a different way to die
all the weight's been shifted back
it's how it has to be
wait for you to want me back come back and laugh with me

I don't need to be set free
i already know
you keep telling me
neither of us need
everything seems wrong
I want to be wrong
I want to be wrong
I want to be wrong
