i
wanna be alone
(wanna be alone)
driveway red like cherry coke

someone knocking at the door
it's just something to ignore

i never feel alone
never feel alone
wake up
window makes me cold

comfort on the shower floor
head resting for hours more

you are cobweb sifting through
god i'm sorry
death wish in a mirrored room
god i'm sorry

someone knocking at the door
it's just something to ignore see less
