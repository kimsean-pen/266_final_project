I'd like to come and see you
But what's it worth to know?
Promise you'll make it easy
You won't get me to go

I've been a wreck so long
It's hard to pull it back
But I'm on it and I want it and just flaunt it
And it wakes me and it takes me and it rapes me

Gone away, on the way

I want to let you go
I got a little red
Just can't pull it together
Before it goes to your head

Gone away, on the way
On the way, on the way

I'd like to come and see you
But I think I'm on my way

Gone away, gone away, on the way
On the way, on the way, gone away

I've been a wreck so long
It's hard to pull out
Look to me, I feel the fool again
