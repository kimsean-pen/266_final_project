The room's green
It's got writing
On the wall
It's got one chair
It's kinda small

Dirty shoes
Running past the door
And then you go round
Beat yourself up,

Ten minutes to go,
And I wanna go home
Ten minutes to go,
Yeah
I've got to go home
Ten minutes to go,
And the air
It don't feel clear
Everybody disappear
You're in it
On your own

Fourteen
Intimidated
And she's just fourteen
She's getting pulled
From the opposite side,
Until it breaks down
Blame it on
The wrong crowd
Stay, more make up
Hair dye

Ten minutes to go,
You know
She should have gone home
Ten minutes to go,
Yeah
You should have gone home
Ten minutes to go,
And the air
It don't feel clear,
Everybody disappear
You're in it on your own

You can't sleep,
You know it's over
But you just can't sleep
You've gotta face it,
Gotta go outside
And do the day-walk
Living
With the lights off
Ain't nobody home

Ten minutes to go,
You know
You wanna stay home
Ten minutes to go,
Yeah you wanna stay home
Ten minutes to go,
And the air
It don't feel clear,
Everybody disappear
You're
In it on your own

Keep your head
Keep your head
Just keep your head
Keep your
Head

You wanna keep
Ah
Keep it on
The right side
If you know
Your gonna be
Coming off
It's gonna make you
Open your eyes
I said, now
Open your eyes
You know it
You wanna keep
Ah
Keep it on the low side
Yes you gonna see
Ten minutes to go (?)
And your keeping it
Heads up
Keep it low, be right
Push it kinda low

So, open your eyes
