Dogs that howl from outer space
Come to Earth to lay to waste
With fang and claw to shred your face
They will erase the human race
Time to kiss your ass goodbye
Prehistoric dogs of war
Pack of wolves is at your door
Their will to kill will fill the pits of hell
Blood is spilled and none too soon
Looking down from cratered moon
They see us flee we need to break the spell

Dogs that howl from outer space
Come to Earth to lay to waste
With fang and claw to shred your face
They will erase the human race
Time to kiss your ass goodbye
Our lives are long
But our flesh is gone
It may be wrong
God bless godlessness
We're walking tall
If we walk at all
We're living like a
Prehistoric dog
