It's two AM, in your car
Windows down, passed my street the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You thinking that I hate you now
Cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that, I will never forget you as long as I live
I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

It's two AM, in my room
Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you
We were crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you want to run and hide
It'd makes you turn straight back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did I
wish you knew that, I will never forget you as long as I live I
wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

I wish we could go back and remember what we were fighting for I wish you knew that, I miss you too much to be mad anymore I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would
I-I-I-I-I-I Wish ya, wish ya
I-I-I-I-I-I Wish ya, wish ya.
I-I-I-I-I-I Wish ya, wish ya.

You always knew how to push my buttons
You gave me everything and nothing
This mad, mad, love makes you come running
Stand back wasted
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would

Two AM, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you want to run and hide
But it made us right turn back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did I
wish you knew that, I will never forget you as long as I live I
wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did I
wish you knew that, I will never forget you as long as I live I
wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

I wish we could go back and remember what we were fighting for I wish you knew that, I miss you too much to be mad anymore I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

You always knew how to push my buttons
You gave me everything and nothing
This mad, mad, love makes you come running
Stand back wasted

I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would

I-I-I-I-I-I Wish ya, wish ya
I-I-I-I-I-I Wish ya, wish ya.

I wish you would
