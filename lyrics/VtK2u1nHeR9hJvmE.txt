Long live the innocent
Oh, you'll get this now
I'mma get this now, and I'mma take mine just to get mine

You think I know, wide eyes got a narrow scope
You think that they'd know not to shoot a man while he on the floor
That's why these youngins, they run before talking to police 'cause they know the deal
See young Trayvon Martin had just left the market with candy and got his ass killed

No more excuses, we must refuse this, silence is useless
Long live the innocent
They tell us stories of star-spangled glory, this is your warning
Long live the innocent
Long live the innocent

Eyes of the law do not, yeah, look anything like my own
See, I can see clearly now that the arraignment is gone
Yes, I did go head up with that cop trying to do me like Radio Raheem
I looked at the judge, said: "I feared for my life, and I pray that you'll do the right thing"

No more excuses, we must refuse this, silence is useless
Long live the innocent
They tell us stories of star-spangled glory, this is your warning
Long live the innocent

It ain't what you are, it's what you can be
It ain't what you are, it's what you can be
It ain't what you are, it's what you can be
And I see you, my brother
All they know is what you show them

No more excuses, we must refuse this, silence is useless
Long live the innocent
They tell us stories of star-spangled glory, this is your warning
Long live the innocent
Long live the innocent
Long live the innocent
