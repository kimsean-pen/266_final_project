Shields that gleam before the cannon fodder rushes in the dust
Horns blow the pain in massive bursts
Sun and Moon defy the destiny that calls for feeble peace
The ones obliterated forever sing their wretched cry

The dawn waits for our enemies to rise
Defile their prophet to spread terror in their eyes
Breaches in their lines
All that we long for in this life shall come

Cast the first stone to conquer this world for Rome
Cast the first stone - Gods said to spare no man

Solo - Giulio Moschini

Raise your swords
Infidel's words are deceitful lies
Shielded by the sun
The truth that we preach in the eternal skies

Seven kings will break the twenty seals of the tree of life
Plagues and swarms cast on them
Sun and Moon realize the destiny that calls for holy war
Half Moon obliterated forever sings her wretched cry

Sunrise
Cast the first stone to conquer this world for Rome
Cast the first stone - Gods said to spare no man

Blissful desire
Destroy the golden domes so that I see the fall of Him
Bring forward the icon that retains our will of fire
Let me go, let my soul transcend in

Flames of gold
Infidel's words are deceitful lies
Shielded by the Sun
The truth that we preach in the eternal skies
