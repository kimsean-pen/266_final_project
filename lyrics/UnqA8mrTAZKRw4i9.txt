Oh yeah!
I went down to the crossroads
Make a deal with the devil
Strapped my soul for a guitar
Became a rock'n'roll rebel
He put fire in my fingers
And whiskey in my blood
He said take this six strings
And burn heaven above

Are you ready? Are you ready?
You better get ready
Once we start we never stop
Get ready to rock
Ready to rock
Get ready to rock
Ready to rock

Got thunder and
Lighting crashing all around
The power is frightening
One hell of a sound
And heaven's on fire
The needle's in the red
The flames are getting higher
We're goin' over the edge

Are you ready? Are you ready?
You better get ready
Once we start we never stop
Get ready to rock
Ready to rock
Get ready to rock
Ready to rock
Are you ready to rock?
Are you ready to rock to rock'n'roll?

Whaou! Oh yeah, c'mon! Oh yeah!
Let's go. Encore, can you feel it?
Just a little bit louder c'mon
Just a one more time c'mon
Once we start we never stop

Get ready to rock
Ready to rock
Get ready to rock
Ready to rock
Get ready
Get ready to rock
Ready to rock
Get ready to rock
Ready to rock
Are you ready?
Are you ready to rock?
I said are you ready to rock?
I said are you ready to rock?
Are you ready to rock?
To rock to rock to rock
To rock'n rock'n roll!
Oh get ready to rock c'mon!
Let me hear you!
Get ready to rock
Ready to rock baby
Get ready to rock
Ready to rock
Ready to rock
Get ready to rock rock rock
Ready to rock
