Did you ever know what it is to be hurt?
Did you ever feel like dirt?
Did you ever give up all your pride
Just to have him by your side?

Well if you don't know what I'm talking about
You don't know nothing
You don't know nothing
You don't know
You don't know nothing
About love

When the nighttime comes do your tears fall like rain?
And in the morning do they fall all over again?
Tell me do you get down on your knees and pray
That he'll never never go away

Well if you don't know what I'm talking about
You don't know nothing
You don't know nothing
You don't know nothing
Nothing about love

Don't try to tell me that I'm out of my mind
'Cause anywhere the man goes
I'll be right behind

You don't know nothing
You don't know nothing
You don't know nothing
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know nothing
You don't know nothing
No you don't
You know nothing
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know nothing
About love

You don't know nothing
About love
About love, about love
You don't know
You don't know nothing
About love
