Oh, I hoped that you were somebody
Someone I could count
To pull me to my feet again
When I was in doubt

Oh now Mama, do you hear me?
Calling out your name
Oh now Mama, do you hear me?
Calling out your name, calling out your name

Now I'm the last cowboy in this town
Empty veins and my plastic broken crown
They said I swam the sea that ran around
They said I once was lost but now I'm truly found

And I know the place but not the way
I feel, I feel no shame
Oh now Mama, do you hear my fear?
It's coming after me

I'm calling out your name
I'm calling out your name

Stay with me
Stay with me

But you threw your heart away
Oh, I know just what I say
That the Concorde it can wait
'Cause we still got time to say

And I know you ran away
Oh, I know my feeling, okay?
But now I found love, the feeling won't go
Now I found love, the feeling won't go
I see you walk away, feeling okay now
Happy now?

Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
