They don't care about the truth
Gotta a mouth full of lies
That is not the way we want it
There is nothing good about it
Now you know what to do
When your heart's full of knives
When your heart's dark
Won't last the nigth
In the end
Inthe end
We will not forget
Like it's door die
In the end
In the end
They will reach the end
When we find
So I stay
I fight
And I give
I fight
