Oh, how is it that I could come out to here
And be still floatin'
And never hit bottom and keep falling through
Just relaxed and paying attention?
All my two-dimensional boundaries were gone
I had lost to them badly
I saw that world crumble and thought I was dead
But I found my senses still working
And as I continued to drop through the hole
I found all surrounding
To show me that joy innocently is
Just be quiet and feel it around you
And I opened my heart to the whole universe
And I found it was lovin'
And I saw the great blunder my teachers had made
Scientific delerium madness
I will keep falling as long as I live
Ah, without ending
And I will remember the place that is now
That has ended before the beginning
Oh, how is it that I could come out to here
And be still floatin'
And never hit bottom and keep falling through
Just relaxed and paying attention?
