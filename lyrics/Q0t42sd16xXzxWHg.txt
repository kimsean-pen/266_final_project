Preach for me, daddy
Preach for me, preach for me
Preach for me, daddy, daddy

Sleep on the moon, breaking my skin
Deep in the shadows, that's where I live
Blowin' red lights, ask where I've been
Deep in the shadows, that's where I live

Fallin' all in to your tsunami
Edamame, be my saké, my kamikaze
Push the Audi pedal into my body
I'm a wreck, babe, write off the check, bank

Turn the engine off, we could just stay here
Long way from God, but we can still pray here
We can still pray here, we can still pray here
We can still pray here

Preach for me daddy, pray for the pussy
I can be your deity, hook me like a caddy
Hook me, hook me like, hook me like a
Preach for me daddy, pray for the pussy
I can be your deity, hook me like a caddy
Hook me, hook me like a caddy

Seen you at the church in the nymph life
Last truck left on the highway
Crossin' 6 lanes in the getaway
We up late just to fade away

Fallin' all in to your tsunami
Edamame, be my saké, my kamikaze
Push the Audi pedal into my body
I'm a wreck, babe, write off the check, bank

Turn the engine off, we could just stay here
Long way from God, but we can still pray here
We can still pray here, we can still pray here
We can still pray...

Preach for me daddy, pray for the pussy
I can be your deity, hook me like a caddy
Preach for me daddy, pray for the pussy
I can be your deity, hook me like a caddy

Preach for me daddy, pray for the pussy
I can be your deity, hook me like a caddy
Hook me, hook me like, hook me like a
Preach for me daddy, pray for the pussy
I can be your deity, hook me like a caddy
Hook me, hook me like a caddy
