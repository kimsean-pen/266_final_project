On a scale from one to ten
I am perfect like I am
I don't need your number
I don't need your number
And the stupid magazines
Want me to change my everything
It don't even matter
They're not taking my power

I'm so over all of these voices around
They've said enough
It's my turn, let's get loud

I'll show you what a girl is
'Cause all of me is perfect
Who cares about a dress size?
It's all about what's inside
I'll stand up now, and won't back down
We're breaking through the surface
To show you what a girl is

We are flawless in our skin
Your words don't mean anything
I'm done wasting my time
I can make up my own mind (make up my own mind)

I'm so over all of these voices around
They've said enough
It's my turn, let's get loud

I'll show you what a girl is
'Cause all of me is perfect
Who cares about a dress size?
It's all about what's inside
I'll stand up now, and won't back down
We're breaking through the surface
To show you what a girl is

You are exactly what you're made to be, I swear
Don't be afraid just to put yourself out there

On a scale from one to ten, I am perfect like I am
I don't need your number
We don't need your number

I'll show you what a girl is
'Cause all of me is perfect
Who cares about a dress size?
It's all about what's inside
I'll stand up now, and won't back down
We're breaking through the surface
To show you what a girl is
We're breaking through the surface
To show you what a girl is
