Whisper my name
I will find you, I will fly
In my mind I feel you inside
As I slide over the sky
I will find you, oh and I

And I know I'd only let you down
And I know you won't stick around
But I'll make sure
I'll keep you coming to my door

Dust from your hair
Small splinter from your back
Will keep my raging mind in check
My sweet heart, each curse, every crime
Your thoughts, your thoughts
Are mine mine mine mine mine

And I know I'd only let you down
And I know you won't stick around
But I'll make sure, I'll keep you coming back
And the taste of wine is oh so sweet
And I'm going to sweep you off your feet
Just take my hand, just take my small, sweet hand

Say the words now you realize, you are my soul
Speak the spell, the one with starry eyes, to paralyze
Now sing, this song
Now sing sing along

And I know I'd only let you down
And I know you won't stick around
But I'll make sure, I'll keep you coming back
And the taste of wine is oh so sweet
And I'm going to sweep you off your feet
Just take my hand
Just take my small, sweet hand
