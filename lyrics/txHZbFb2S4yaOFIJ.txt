As a chance to expand
Rode the colour-coded tram to the Westworld
Should I wander should I wait
If the stagecoach is late in the Westworld

Is there really no one except for me
And the powers that be
Are holding out on you and me
My enemy may be the last I see

Blurring out of focus
Central system psychosis
In the Westworld
All the walls hear you sigh
See the portraits move their eyes in the Westworld

Is there really no one except for me
And the powers that be
Are holding out on you and me
My enemy may be the last I see
