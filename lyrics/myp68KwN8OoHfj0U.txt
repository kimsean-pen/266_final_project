Precious fingers, she knows how to hold the poison
Lick it, dip it and for no particular reason
She crawls on the floor, slides against the door
Press your fingers over blossom and it's season

Doesn't matter, she'll be doing it her way
Doesn't care if it's a 10 or a 2-way
Doesn't matter, she'll be doing it her way
Every night, every day
Never meant to show of fear anyway
Only fucking you till the season change

Treasure deep between the places that you hold dear
Can't it hurt to act as if we are in love here?
Lies across this chair, fingers everywhere
To define all the angels up above here

Doesn't matter, she'll be doing it her way
Doesn't care if it's a 10 or a 2-way
Doesn't matter, she'll be doing it her way
Every night, every day
Never meant to show of fear anyway
Only fucking you till the season change

When you cum, be a good girl
Hold your breath, make it last long
And it's called death
A little death, girl

Never make a show of fear anyway
Only fucking you till the season change
Never make a show of fear anyway
Only fucking you till the season change
