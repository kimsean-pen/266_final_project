Things are so different here
all truths seem to disappear
and who you were doesn't matter
my point is a better view
make me look beautiful
and every face same old story

In Hollywood, Hollywood
every sunrise you get so close
every sunset an overdose
no one cares but everybody knows

bask in someone elses fame
live off of the family name
and who you are is all that matter
its so hard being young today
dior adds and pink cocaine
you'll go far for doing nothing

In Hollywood, Hollywood
every sunrise you get so close
every sunset an overdose
no one cares but everybody knows

everybody wants to be someone
everybody wants to be someone else
and if your down they'll hand you a shot gun
just get me out, get me out
of hollywood, hollywood
every sunrise you get so close
every sunset an overdose
no one cares but everybody knows

get me out
get me out
get me out
get me out
get me out
