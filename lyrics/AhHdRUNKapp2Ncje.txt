I couldn't stop movin' when I first took hold
It was a warm spring night at the old town hall
There was a band called "Jokers", they were layin' it down
Doncha know I'm never gonna lose that funky sound

Rock and roll, hoochie koo
Lawdy mama, light my fuse
Rock and roll, hoochie koo
Truck on out and spread the news, alright

I hope y'all know what I'm talkin' about
The way she wiggled that thing, it really knocks me out
Gettin' high all the time but if you're not there too
Come on a little closer, gonna do it to you

Rock and roll, hoochie koo
Lawdy mama, light my fuse
Rock and roll, hoochie koo
Truck on out and spread the news

'Squitas start buzzin' 'bout that time of year
She's goin' 'round backstage, she'd meet me there
We were ballin' in the grass too behind the barn
Now my ears started ringin' like a fire alarm

Rock and roll, hoochie koo
Lawdy mama, light my fuse
Rock and roll, hoochie koo
Truck on out and spread the news

Rock and roll, hoochie koo
Lawdy mama, light my fuse
Rock and roll, hoochie koo
Truck on out and spread the news

Done got tired of payin' dues
Said goodbye to all my blues
Lawdy mama, light my fuse
