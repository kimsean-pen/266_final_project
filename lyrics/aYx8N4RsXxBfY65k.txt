I can't eat, I'm so hungry for loving you
I'll talk online all night, if that's what you're into
I can't sleep, I'm so hungry for loving you
So come online

Make me weak, I'm so hungry for kissing you
You little cyber freak, I know what you're into
Make me sick, 'cause I'm hopelessly missing you
So come online

I can't take it, it's sweeter than ice cream
Your little secret plays all up in my daydreams
I can't fake it, it's sweeter when you scream
So come online

Think you're giving me chronic insomnia
I dream in 20-second clips, like it's mania
Think I'm addicted to endlessly missing ya
So come online

Take me deeper and deeper in your internet
Take me deeper and deeper in your internet
Take me deeper and deeper in your internet
Take me deeper and deeper in your internet
Take me deeper and deeper in your internet
Take me deeper and deeper in your internet
Take me deeper and deeper in your internet
Take me deeper and deeper in your internet
