Cried out, to you alone
What's in you? Throw me a bone
Oh life, what did you know?
How do we ever decide?

Careful love, blow it away
Let's go there, what do you say?
Oh life, why did you wait
How do we get to the sky?

Called out, to you alone
What made you? Maybe you know
Oh life, let it all go
How do we get to the sky?
