I like the things you do,
I like the way you move
You got them baby blues
Just got me like, just got me like

You and your magic touch,
I just can't get enough
You're all I'm thinking of
Every night, every night

Oh you know, you know
Can't get you out my head
You can have it all
In this heart of mine

As long as you love me, love me
In every way
I will be calling, calling your name
So say that you love, love me
And I'll do the same
We will be falling, falling always
Always, hey, always
Always, hey, always, always

You like to hold my hand
You like it when I'm mad
Say I'm the best you had
Tell it right, tell it right

Them other boys they quit
They don't know what of this
But sure you never miss
Get it right, get it right

Oh you know, you know
Can't get you out my head
You can have it all
In this heart of mine

As long as you love me, love me
In every way
I will be calling, calling your name
So say that you love, love me
And I'll do the same
We will be falling, falling always

Always, hey, always
Always, hey, always, always.
Always, hey, always
Always, hey, always

Oh you know, you know
Can't get you out my head
You can have it all
In this heart of mine

As long as you love me, love me
In every way
I will be calling, calling your name
So say that you love, love me
And I'll do the same
We will be falling, falling always

Always, hey, always
Always, hey, always
Always, hey, always
Always, hey, always, always
