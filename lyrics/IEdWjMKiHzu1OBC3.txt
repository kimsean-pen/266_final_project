One day she'll take the world from you

Women, baby, that I meet, yeah
They all tell me I don't need ya now
Runnin', baby, hold on
I'll be here for you

Just hold me
I'm a lonely heart
You've been miles away
Just hold me
And we'll never get hurt
You've been miles away

Heavy, California
I will love you, can't afford you
It's a heaven waitin' for you
So I'm headin' for California
Our love
California

Miss the sunlight
I was sayin'
Your love was so crazy
So hold on to it for me
Come on, baby
Hold on
I'll be here for you

Heavy, California
I will love you, can't afford you
It's a heaven waitin' for you
So I'm headin' for California
Our love
California

Just hold me
I'm a lonely heart
You've been miles away
Held up at the border
Just hold me
And we'll never get hurt
You've been miles away

Heavy, California
I will love you, can't afford you
It's a heaven waitin' for you
So I'm headin' for California
Our love
California
Our love
California
California
