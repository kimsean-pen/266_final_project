cracking under the pressure
rising up and getting underneath your skin
feel it turn into leather
watch it peeling off the broken bones of a discount soul forever
i'll always be the one to watch you fall apart then try to keep it together
at the bottom in the endless dark of an empty heart
i take it to the edge
i do it till it bleeds
i push it to the limit
i ain't never gonna sleep
i'm dying for a fight
i'm living on the run
cause it's hard to see the light down the barrel of a gun
i take it like a drug to try to kill the pain
addicted to the damage i ain't never gonna change
cause what I want is haunting me
like a nightmare
giving into the pleasure
like a silver digging underneath my skin
i'm feeling better than ever
drag myself across a concrete floor through an open door forever
you'll always be the one to make me fall apart
gotta keep it together
at the bottom of the endless dark feel the fire start
i take it to the edge
i do it till it bleeds
i push it to the limit
i ain't never gonna sleep
i'm dying for a fight
i'm living on the run
cause it's hard to see the light down the barrel of a gun
i take it like a drug to try to kill the pain
addicted to the damage i ain't never gonna change
cause what i want is haunting me
like a nightmare
like a nightmare
i take it to the edge
i do it till it bleeds
i push it to the limit
i ain't never gonna sleep
i'm dying for a fight
i'm living on the run
cause it's hard to see a light down the barrel of a gun
i take it like a drug to try to kill the pain
addicted to the damage i ain't never gonna change
cause what i want is haunting me
like a nightmare
like a nightmare
like a nightmare
