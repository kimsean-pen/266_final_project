Overconfident, too proud
Self-centered, too loud
We'll never hear through the noise
Compelling arguments
In a reality we don't live in
We'll never hear through the noise

Don't wanna swallow our pride
Just wanna follow the tides
Until the wheels fall off
And we're driving blind
Swerving over the line

We're living like free radicals,
Destroying every rational chemical
If we're too far to see the other side
Short sighted views become our guide
We're living like free radicals
Destroying every rational chemical

Short tempered, too cold
Confined to a mold
We'll never hear through the noise
A never ending push and pull
Of opinions, but no truth
We'll never hear through the noise

We're living like free radicals
Destroying every rational chemical
If we're too far to see the other side
Short sighted views become our guide
We're living like free radicals
Destroying every rational chemical

Feeding off the enemy
Most threatening to our beliefs
In a never ending battle for control

We're fighting fire with fire
Finger on the trigger, always ready to pull it
We fear the truth like a liar

We're living like free radicals
Destroying every rational chemical
If we're too far to see the other side
Short sighted views become our guide
We're living like free radicals
Destroying every rational
Destroying every rational chemical
