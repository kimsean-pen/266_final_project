Change
The river is blocked
The road is hot
The sky is blazing
Black smoke on the rise
The weather rolls until it's on you and suddenly breaks

I come right back into the sound
I take one breath and spiral down
And you, more watching the road
Or watching the flood stage rise
We are yearlings
Now watching the tide run out
To what the daylight hides
Is among

Yearlings
Now watching the tide run out
We are yearlings
(I come right back into the sound)
Feeling the flood break down

Yearlings (I take one breath and spiral down)
(Change, the river is blocked)
Now watching the tide run out
(the road is hot, the sky is blazing)
(The weather rolls until it's on you)
We are yearlings (I come right back into the sound)
(Black smoke on the rise)
Feeling the flood break down (and suddenly breaks,
and suddenly breaks)

Yearlings (I take one breath and spiral down)
(Change, the river is blocked)
Now watching the tide run out (the road is hot,
the sky is blazing) (The weather rolls until it's on you)
We are yearlings (I come right back into the sound)
(Black smoke on the rise)
Feeling the flood break down
(and suddenly breaks, and suddenly breaks)
