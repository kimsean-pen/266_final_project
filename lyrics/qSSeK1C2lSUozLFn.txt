To who do you compare me
Recreate to mold me?
And frozen in that ambition,
You scramp me up
Where is the soft in our league
They strip me up to fail me
I used to feel protection from your touch

And if I am your beloved
Then why don't I feel it!
Oh, if I'm your beloved
Why don't I feel it!
We ride together, but I feel so alone
When I give everything I have to you
Why isn't ever enough?

For me there was nobody
You were the one & only
But now, I'm uninvited inside your love

And if I am your beloved
Then why don't I feel it!
Oh, if I'm your beloved
Why don't I feel it!
We ride together, but I feel so alone
When I give everything I have to you
Why isn't ever enough?

Take take, twist shape
Tell me what you want from me
Call shots from your embrace
Love is all for self or hate
Don't speak, skin creep
If only it's what see in me,
Don't sweet the lies you say
Tell me why I am your beloved?

Then why don't I feel it!
Oh, if I'm your beloved
Why don't I feel it!
We ride together, but I feel so alone
When I give everything I have to you
Why isn't ever enough?

Take take, twist shape
Tell me what you want from me
Call shots from your embrace
Love is all for self or hate
Don't speak, skin creep
If only it's what see in me,
Don't sweet the lies you say
Tell me why I am your beloved?

Then why don't I feel it!
Oh, if I'm your beloved
Why don't I feel it!
We ride together, but I feel so alone
When I give everything I have to you
Why isn't ever enough?
