Does your heart ache
When you get around me?
Does your heart break
When you think about me?

Now you wanna say
I was a liar
Led you astray
I won't deny it
I did what they
Thought would be good for me

Now you wanna cry
Call me a cheater
Left you to die
Though I did neither
Thought that it would
That it would be best for me

Do you crumble?
Do your worst (oh, oh, oh, oh-OH-oh-oh)
Do you tumble?
Do your worst (oh, oh, oh, oh-OH-oh-oh)

I couldn't be your friend
Even if I tried again
I couldn't be your friend (couldn't be your friend)

Try to conceal it
I won't believe it
Even if I tried again (oh, oh, oh, oh-OH-oh-oh)

I couldn't be your friend (couldn't be your friend)

Does your body shake
When you get around me?
Does your body wake
When you think about me?

Now you wanna say
I was a criminal
Stole you away
That sounds so fictional
I did what they
Thought would be good for me

Do you crumble?
Do your worst (oh, oh, oh, oh-OH-oh-oh)
Do you tumble?
Do your worst (oh, oh, oh, oh-OH-oh-oh)

I couldn't be your friend
Even if I tried again
I couldn't be your friend (couldn't be your friend)

Try to conceal it
I won't believe it
Even if I tried again (oh, oh, oh, oh-OH-oh-oh)

I couldn't be your friend (couldn't be your friend)

Now you wanna say
You had it all wrong
Now you wanna say
You had me all wrong

Now you wanna say
You had it all wrong
Now you wanna say
You had me all wrong (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!)

I couldn't be your friend (oh, oh, oh, oh-OH-oh-oh)
Even if I tried again
I couldn't be your friend (couldn't be your friend)

Try to conceal it
I won't believe it
Even if I tried again (oh, oh, oh, oh-OH-oh-oh)

I couldn't be your friend (couldn't be your friend)

Try to conceal it
I won't believe it
Even if I tried again (oh, oh, oh, oh-OH-oh-oh)

I couldn't be your friend (couldn't be your friend)

Oh, oh, oh, oh-OH-oh-oh
oh, oh, oh, oh-OH-oh-oh
oh, oh, oh, oh-OH-oh-oh

Couldn't be your friend
