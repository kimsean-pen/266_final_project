You move like tusk in trade
You rule like sun in shade
I've had no pleasure
Let's get together
You move like Jack and jive
You move like sin inside
I've had no pleasure
Let's get together, yeah

Then my budding bloom
Bet that you could see through the plastic
Spend my honor, too
Girl, you look so good in the passing

You move like wisk and roll
You make like lip
And look, I've had no pleasure
Let's get together

You run like count and country
You make without your love
I've had no pleasure
Let's get together, yeah

Then my budding bloom
Bet that you could see through the plastic
Spend my honor, too
Girl, you look so good in the passing

I see color
Shades of gray, oh
Who we holdin'?
Free to make up
I see color
Shades of gray, oh
Who we holdin'?
Free to make up, oh
