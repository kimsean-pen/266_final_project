I was looking at you
You were looking at me
It was easy to see
That it was one of your lies
Is it working for you?
Cause it's working for me
Let's count to three
No it's not hard to disguise
Was it part of the plan?
Taking me by the hand
Being one of the damned
On this merry-go-round
It's not hard to explain
Don't hide your shame
Just play the game
You're one of many we've found
Crystal
You take me out this way
You take me out
I was looking at you
You were looking at me
It was easy to see
That it was one of your lies
Is it working for you?
Cause it's working for me
Let's count to three
No it's not hard to disguise
We're all divisive
We're all
You take me out this way
You take me out
I'll take you deep down now
I can take you deep down now
All hands down
Don't make a sound
Your heart pounds
Can you take anymore?
I think you'll know that it's true
When it comes into view
No matter what you do
You're just the same as before
We're all divisive
We're all
You take me out this way
You take me out
