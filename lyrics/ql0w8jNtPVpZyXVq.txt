All night long I sit at home.
I dream about a time we can be alone.
Come on baby call me on the telephone,
But you never do.

And when were together I can feel the space.
I want you so bad but the look on your face.
Tell me one thing that I already know.
You're not ready to go.

Were make you groove.
I'm gonna make move.
I'm gonna make you run.
I'm gonna make you sweat.

All night long I've been waiting for you.
I can't help but imagine all the things we'll do.
To an electric groove.
