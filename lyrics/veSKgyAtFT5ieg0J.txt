I was driving in from Tampa when the radiator burst
I was three sheets to the wind, a civilian saw me first
And then there was the cop and then the children standing on the corner
Your love is like a cyclone in a swamp and the weather's getting warmer

I was getting out of jail, headed to the Greyhound
You said you'd hop on one yourself and meet me on the way down
I was shaking way too hard to think, dead on my feet, about to drop
Went and got the case of vodka from the car and walked the two miles to the bus stop

Got on the bus half-drunk again, the driver glared at me
Met up with you in Ingles, thumbed a ride to Cedar Key
If we never make it back to California, I want you to know I love you
But my love is like a dark cloud full of rain, always right there up above you
