Waking up in someone else's bed
Was what I was waiting for
Oh my days, what have I done
She saw me sneaking out the door

What have I been waiting for
Been wasting all my time
Watching my youth slip away
Surely is a crime

And no, she don't know
What we do in our spare time
No, she don't know
That we've been up all night
All night, all night, all night

We go on and on and on and on and on
Never knowing where, never knowing where
We gonna, we gonna
We gonna end up in the morning

We go on and on and on and on and on
Never knowing where, never knowing where
We gonna, we gonna
We gonna end up in the morning

Sun is up while I'm walking home
But my head's up in the clouds
Trying to get myself to bed
But I really don't know how

And no, she don't know what I do in our spare time
No she don't know that we've been up all night
All night, all night, all night

We go on and on and on and on and on
Never knowing where, never knowing where
We gonna, we gonna
We gonna end up in the morning

We go on and on and on and on and on
Never knowing where, never knowing where
We gonna, we gonna
We gonna end up in the morning

When I get myself home to my bedroom
I'm gonna sleep all day till the sun sets
When I get myself home to my bedroom
I'm gonna sleep all day till the sun sets

When I get myself home to my bedroom
I'm gonna sleep all day till the sun sets
When I get myself home to my bedroom
I'm gonna sleep all day till the sun sets

We go on and on and on and on and on
Never knowing where, never knowing where
We gonna, we gonna
We gonna end up in the morning

We go on and on and on and on and on
Never knowing where, never knowing where
We gonna, we gonna
We gonna end up in the morning
