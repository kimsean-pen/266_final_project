Pick up the pieces
Fix my diseases
Pick up the pieces
Fix my diseases

I'm tied down to my bed
Wanna get out but I can't commit
Dead spirit, dead spirit
Lethargic, lethargic

(Wake me)
Wake me up get me out
(Shake me)
Shake me till my neck breaks
(Hit me)
Put your fist in my chest
(Give me)
CPR before I'm dead

Pick up the pieces
Fix my diseases
Pick up the pieces
Fix my disease

Staring at the ground while I'm walking lately
Haven't seen the sun in a week and it's killing me
Depression has its grip trying to keep me sick
Medicated but still not thinking freely
I haven't eaten in a week and it's killing me
There's a darkness in my soul but I will never be controlled
I'll never be controlled

Ignorance is (Ignorance is)
Ignorance is bliss isn't it
Ignorance is (Ignorance is)
Ignorance is bliss isn't it

When your house is empty
They moved out, they moved on
But you don't even notice
Cause you're busy being dead in your room

(Wake me)
Wake me up get me out
(Shake me)
Shake me till my neck breaks
(Hit me)
Put your fist in my chest
(Give me)
CPR before I'm dead

Pick up the pieces
Fix my diseases
Pick up the pieces
Fix my disease

Staring at the ground while I'm walking lately
Haven't seen the sun in a week and it's killing me
Depression has its grip trying to keep me sick
Medicated but still not thinking freely
I haven't eaten in a week and it's killing me
There's a darkness in my soul but I will never be controlled

I'm not, I'm not one of your demons
I'm not, I'm not one of your demons
I'm not, I'm not one of your demons
I'm not, I'm not one of your demons

No, I'm not one of your demons

Ignorance is (Ignorance is)
Ignorance is bliss isn't it
Ignorance is (Ignorance is)
Ignorance is bliss isn't it
