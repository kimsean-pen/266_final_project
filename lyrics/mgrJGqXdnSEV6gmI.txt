You cheated on me wo-oh

Can we skip the part where
You look in my eyes and
Tell me you apologize?
Even looking at me
Saying that you're sorry
Isn't gonna change my mind

After all we had
I just can't go back
To the life I wanted
I'm just being honest
This is where it ends, goodbye

Cause I know
You cheated on me
You cheated on me wo-oh
And I know
You'll never love me
You'll never love me, no-o
You fooled me once and I let you come home
Fooled me twice, now I'm letting you go
Cause I know
You cheated on me
You cheated on me wo-oh

Wo-oh o-o-oh
You cheated on me wo-oh

I know I don't deserve this
You don't get a last kiss
Gotta leave you now or never
This is gonna haunt you
Every guy that wants you
Is gonna see a scarlet letter

After all we had
I just can't go back
To the picked fences
Coming to my senses
This could never last forever

Cause I know
You cheated on me
You cheated on me wo-oh
And I know
You'll never love me
You'll never love me, no-o
You fooled me once and I let you come home
Fooled me twice, now I'm letting you go
Cause I know
You cheated on me
You cheated on me wo-oh

Wo-oh o-o-oh
You cheated on me wo-oh
Wo-oh o-o-oh
You cheated on me wo-oh

Late at night
In your bed full of roses
You reached for me
And get a hand full of thorns
But before you leave
I just thought you should know this

Wo-oh o-o-oh
I know wo-oh o-o-oh
I know
You cheated on me
You cheated on me wo-oh
And I know
You'll never love me
You'll never love me, no-o

Cause I know
You cheated on me
You cheated on me wo-oh
And I know
You'll never love me
You'll never love me, no-o
You fooled me once and I let you come home
Fooled me twice, now I'm letting you go
Cause I know
You cheated on me
You cheated on me wo-oh
Wo-oh o-o-oh
You cheated on me wo-oh
Wo-oh o-o-oh
You cheated on me wo-oh
Can we skip the part where
You look in my eyes and
Tell me you apologize?
