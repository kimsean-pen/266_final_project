Jezebel Woman - Malfunkshun

My guitar takes me whole-loyalty without control
Blood and stains-another boy
(transcriber's note: unknown word!) past and the no
way out

Jezebel Woman-lift up your skirt

My girlfriend and I'm here-to share forever the future
holds
Yet possession drags along
Offering no sence o' love

Jezebel Woman-lift up your skirt
and she smelled of jasmine

My guitar sticks it in-doctor please Im sick again
Blood and stains-another boy
Far the better man I've heard

Jezebel Woman-lift up your skirt
and she smelled of jasmine
