Hey, Mr. Preacher Man
I've been playing with a heart like a violin
I've been stumbling through the door after 6 A.M.
Fix my soul so I don't lose a love again
Hey, Mr. Preacher Man
Can you help me get away from this life of sin?
I'm ashamed of the dark places I have been
Fix my soul so I don't lose a love again

I was driving through the city
Just looking at myself
My conscience telling me
That I should just turn this car around
But man, I've got these demons
And they're telling me to go
Further into the night
So the further I go

I'm down on my knees
Yeah, I'm paranoid
Don't wanna repeat
What I did before
I wanna believe
That there's something more
I wanna believe

Hey, Mr. Preacher Man

I'm ashamed of the dark places I have been
Fix my soul so I don't lose a love again

Going a hundred miles an hour
And the wind is in my hair
But my mouth is just too damn dry
To utter out a prayer
And the radio is blasting
Yeah, is keeping me awake
'Cause I just gotta get back to her
Before it's just too late

I'm down on my knees
Yeah, I'm paranoid
Don't wanna repeat
What I did before
I wanna believe
That there's something more
I wanna believe
