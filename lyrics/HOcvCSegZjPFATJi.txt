Deadweight on velveteen
It's retained emptiness
It's not what it seems
Uncover the mystery
Tell everyone what you see
It's not what it seems
Vulgar when brought to light
Betray the image
There's nothing between the sheets
It's not what it seems
But deadweight on velveteen
Vulgar when brought to light
Vulgar the lie
