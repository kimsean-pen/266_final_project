Awake, awake, a tummy ache
With all the space in space, how I feel so misplaced
It's over, I'm overcome, I'm just not one
Sometimes it's hard to switch it off
Get up and go, go get along
And we get along

A fake, a fake, a looming fake
I close my eyes to dream about all of my teeth falling out
For goodness sake, if life's a cake
I want to eat it all right now, it's a risk I'm willing to take

But, oh, look up, I never see it coming
Oh, what now
And when it hits me like a drum
Oh no, I never see it coming
Taking me over and I do it all again

Awake, awake again, a tummy ache again
With all the space in space, how I feel so misplaced
It's over, I'm overcome, am I someone?
Sometimes it's hard to switch it off
Get up and go, go move along
And we move along

But, oh, look up, I never see it coming
Oh, what now
And when it hits me like a drum
Oh no, I never see it coming
Taking me over and I do it all again
And oh my God, I never see it coming
It's getting old now
And when it hits me like a drum
Oh no, I never see it coming
Taking me over and I do it all again
(And I do it all again)

So shake me, shake me
Do you wanna break me?
I'm playing solitaire at night just to pass the time
I cry and cry, I, I sigh a sigh
Don't want to worry anybody
It goes away after a while
