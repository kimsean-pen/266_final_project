Some of my friends sell drugs
But I just sell sad songs
To the ones who feel alone
You can count on me when it all goes wrong

Everyone wants to know
Where it all fell apart
Pick up my pieces
And put them back together like art
I found something I love
And I let it break my heart
No, the pain don't go away
When the music stops

Thanks to everyone that bought tickets to my shows
I put all the money that you spent right up my nose

Some of my friends sell drugs
But I just sell sad songs
To the ones who feel alone
You can count on me when it all goes wrong

What do you think I owe you?
Haven't I given you enough?
Well I can fill a room full of faces I don't know
But I can't see the ones that I love
I've always been so hard on myself
A piece of me in every song
I gave them all to you; five years of my life
And you still think that I've done you wrong

Some of my friends sell drugs
But I just sell sad songs
To the ones who feel alone
You can count on me when it all goes wrong

Love me or hate me
No one's gonna say you're wrong
But there's nothing you can do or say to me
That's gonna break me any more than I've already done
I've got a soft spot
For being fucked up
I've spent years alone and unloved
But I made it out
And I'm happy now
I'm your friend, I'm your brother, I'm your lover, I'm your son

Some of my friends sell drugs
But I just sell sad songs
To the ones who feel alone
You can count on me when it all goes wrong

Some of my friends sell drugs
But I just sell sad songs
To the ones who feel alone
You can count on me when it all goes wrong
