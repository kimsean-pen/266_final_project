Well, the telephone is ringing
Is that my mother on the phone
The telephone is ringing
Is that my mother on the phone
The telephone is screaming
Won't she leave me alone
The telephone is ringing
Is that my mother on the phone

Well, every girl I got out with
Becomes my mother in the end
Every girl I go out with
Becomes my mother in the end
Well, I hear my mother calling
But I don't need her as a friend

Every girl I go out with

Becomes my mother in the end
Oh Oh mother

Mother

Oh mother dear please listen
And don't devour me
Oh mother dear please listen
And don't devour me
Oh women please have mercy
Let this poor boy be
Oh mother dear please listen
And don't devour me
Oh mother
Well, the telephone is ringing
Is that my mother on the phone
The telephone is ringing
Is that my mother on the phone
The telephone is screaming
Won't she leave me alone
The telephone is ringing
Is that my mother on the phone
Oh Mother...
