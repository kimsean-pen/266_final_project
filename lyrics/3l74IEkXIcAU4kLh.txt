You said you'd wait forever
But I blinked and the world was gone
You wade through the water
Slowly your hands grow numb
I wish you felt me falling
I wish you'd watched over me
You said you'd wait forever but I blink
And the world was gone
And the world was gone
And the world was gone

I run through your head
Loud with a nightmare
Brushing your skin with my breathing
Turn out the light
And every nightlight
Run you can run you can run
I blink and the world was gone
I blink and the world was gone
I blink and the world was gone
You said you'd wait forever but I blinked
And the world was gone
You wade through the water
Slowly your hands grow numb
I wish you felt me falling
I wish you'd watch over me
You said you'd wait forever
But I blink and the world was gone
And the world was gone
And the world was gone
