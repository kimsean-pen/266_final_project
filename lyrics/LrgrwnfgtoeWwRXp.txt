Funny how secrets travel
I'd start to believe if I were to bleed
Thin skies, the man chains his hands held high
Cruise me blond, cruise me babe
A blond belief beyond, beyond, beyond
No return, no return

I'm deranged
Deranged down, down, down
I'm deranged down, down, down
So cruise me babe, cruise me baby

And the rain sets in
It's the angel man
I'm deranged
Cruise me, cruise me, cruise me baby

The clutch of life
And the fist of love
Over your head

Big deal Salaam
Be real deranged Salaam
Before we reel
I'm deranged

And the rain sets in
It's the angel man
I'm deranged

And the rain sets in
It's the angel man
I'm deranged

And the rain sets in
It's the angel man
I'm deranged
Cruise me, cruise me, cruise me baby

I'm deranged
And the rain sets in
It's the angel man
