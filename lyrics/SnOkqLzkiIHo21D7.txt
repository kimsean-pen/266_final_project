Hard to see when your eyes are closed
Hard to love when your heart is broken
Live my life out in the cold
Days are gone and now I'm frozen

The wind it blows
Where it stops? Nobody's gonna know (I said)
Away we go, where do we stop?
Nobody's gonna know, nobody's gonna know

I'm in too deep, I sold my soul
I'm out of reach and I can't let go
I'm in trouble, I'm in trouble
I made my way, a dead end road
I can't turn back so I walk alone
I'm in trouble, I'm in trouble
I'm in, I'm in trouble, trouble

Hard to breathe when you lose control
Hard to live with the words unspoken
I walk away cause I got no home
Empty hole and my body's shaking

The wind will blow
Where it stops? Nobody's gonna know (I said)
Away we go, where do we stop?
Nobody's gonna know, nobody's gonna know

I'm in too deep, I sold my soul
I'm out of reach and I can't let go
I'm in trouble, I'm in trouble
I made my way, a dead end road
I can't turn back so I walk alone
I'm in trouble, I'm in trouble
I'm in, I'm in trouble (Take me heaven, yeah, yeah, yeah I'm in)
Trouble (Save me, yeah)

You're so respectable, And I'm so impossible
We just can't have it all
No, no, we just can't have it all
We were invincible, It's almost criminal
No light at the end of the tunnel when you get yourself in trouble

I'm in too deep, I sold my soul
I'm out of reach and I can't let go
I'm in trouble, I'm in trouble
I made my way, a dead end road
I can't turn back so I walk alone
I'm in trouble, I'm in trouble
I'm in, I'm in trouble (How did I get myself in?)
Trouble (How did I get myself in?)
Trouble (Take me heaven, yeah, yeah, yeah I'm in)
Trouble (Save me, yeah)
