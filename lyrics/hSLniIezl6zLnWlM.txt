The girl\'s a fool
She broke the rule
She hurt him hard
This time you will break down
She\'s lost his trust

And so she must
Now all is lost
The system has broke down
Romance has broke down

This boi is crackin\' up
This boi has broken down
This boi is crackin\' up
This boi has broke down
She plays it hard

She plays it tough
But thats enough
The love is over
She\'s broke his heart and that is rough

But in the end you\'ll soon recover

The romance is over
This boi is crackin\' up
This boi has broken down
(Hey, yeah yeah)

This boi is crackin\' up
This boi has broke down
(solo)
Ola!
This boi is crackin\' up

This boi has broken down

Yeh, yeah-hah!
This boi is crackin\' up
This boi has broke down
I\'ve been spending my money

In the old town
It\'s not the same honey
With you not around
I\'ve been spending my time

In the old town
I sure miss you honey
Now you\'re not around
You\'re not around
This old town
Ola!
This boi is crackin\' up
This boi has broken down
Yeah, yeah
This boi is crackin\' up
This boi has broke down
This boi is crackin\' up, crackin\' up!
This boi has broken down
Yeah-ah!
This boi is crackin\' up
This boi has broke down
This boi has broken down
This boi has broke down
Oh!
This boi has broken down
Yeah-ah-ah!
