We deny all
Keep our free fall
Or dig the truth out right now

Turn on your lights
I'll meet you on the inside
Last call
Last time
Getting on
Getting on the last ride

Lay your head down
Another star became a sun in someone else's sky

Turn on your light
I'll meet you in the inside.
Last call
Last time
Getting on
Getting on the last ride

Far away from home
So far away from home

Turn on your light
I'll meet you in the inside
Last call
Last time
Getting on
Getting on the last ride
