Will you look at me?
Take a good look at me,
and tell me who it is that I am.
This old mirror, it is broken,
there's too much drift in the dam.

It's not the world that's spinning, that's me
I go from nowhere to nowhere searching for the key.
There's nothing new under the sun,
all that will happen has already begun.

Will you savor this in your mind,
this old feeling when you're left behind?
Will you hold to this as true,
or will you dance to another tune?

I was watching for a long time
as people crossed the street.
Some heavy sadness weighed upon me
as I sat silent in the car seat.

Shadows with that same look upon their faces,
a child will die that nobody embraces,
everything gets tiresome, every thing grows old,
with each secret revealed, there's another to be told.

Will you savor this in your mind,
this old feeling your left behind?
Will you hold to this as true,
or will you dance to another tune?

Will you look at me?
Take a good look at me,
and tell me who it is that I am.
