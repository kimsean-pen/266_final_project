I'm in love with your brother
What's his name?
I thought I'd come by to see him again
And when you two danced
oh what a dance
And when you two laughed
oh what a laugh
Has he mentioned my age, love?

Or is he more into young girls with dyed black hair
I'm in love with your brother
I'd thought I'd come by

I'm in love with your brother
Yes, I am but maybe I
shouldn't ask for his name
and you danced
oh what a dance
and you laughed
oh what a laugh
Does he know what I do and

You pass this on, won't you and
If I asked him once what would he say
Is he willing, can he play?
I wasn't really looking for some more than
some company on the dancefloor and
does he know what I do and
you pass this on, won't you and?
