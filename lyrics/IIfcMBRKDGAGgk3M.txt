I'm not the kind of person
You think I am
I'm not the antichrist or
The iron man
I have a vision that I
Just can't control
I feel I've lost my spirit
And sold my soul

Got no control

I try to entertain you
The best I can
I wished I started walking
Before I ran
But I still love the feeling
I get from you
I hope you'll never stop cause
It gets me through yeah

The feelings that I hide behind
Sometime reality's unkind
The nightmares start for me at night.
I dread the long and lonely nights

I'm not the kind of person
You think I am
I'm not the antichrist or
The iron man
But I still love the feeling
I get from you
I hope you'll never stop cause
It gets me through yeah
I'm just trying to live yeah
I'm just trying to live yeah
I'm just trying to live yeah.
