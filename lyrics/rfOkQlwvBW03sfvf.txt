I've had a thorn in my heart, it was there from the start
I had a life it was sad, it was all I had
I died a bit every day
I had a girl she was fine, we could walk the line
A fat house and a car, thought I was a star
I died a bit every day

And when the lights go out, you can see me go
All filled up with doubts, yeah it's all I know

Then you tell me,
Get up, come on, don't worry now my old friend
Get up, come on, together now there's no end
Get up, come on, we'll show them now the way we roam
I'm gonna bring you home

I had a change for the good, hope you understood
I had to go underground and you were not around
I improve a bit every day
I've got no girl, no big house, still I'm living large
Got the peace in my mind it was hard to find
I fight and now it's looking bright

And when the lights go out, you can see me go
With a smile on my face, yeah it's all I know

And I tell you
Get up, come on, don't worry now my old friend
Get up, come on, together now there's no end
Get up, come on, we'll show them now the way we roam

You know I'm gonna tell you
Get up, come on, don't worry now my old friend
Get up, come on, together now there's no end
Get up, come on, we'll show them now the way we roam

I'm gonna bring you home
Yeah, I'm gonna bring you home
Oh, I'm gonna bring you home
Yeah, I'm gonna bring you home
Yeah, get up, come on
Don't you worry now my old friend
Get up come on

Yeah, I'm gonna bring you home
Get up, come on, don't worry now my old friend
Get up, come on, together now there's no end
Get up, come on, we'll show them now the way we roam

You know I'm gonna tell you
Get up, come on, don't worry now my old friend
Get up, come on, together now there's no end
Get up, come on, we'll show them now the way we roam

I'm gonna bring you home
