And the sun won't shine for me
And it seems like nothing's goin' right
There's a place I want to be

Just layin' there beside you
In the shelter of your room
I leave the world outside your door
Lose myself in you

When you're in my arms
I find all that I need
I could never live without
The Heaven that you showed me

I've been waitin' all my life
Just to look into your eyes
I live for the time alone with you

And when I climb the stairs to find you
And we reach for the light
I thank God I've got
This time alone with you, oh yeah

Your kiss can captivate me
And your touch can set me free
I count the hours baby
'Til you are next to me

And it's taken such a long time
To find someone that understands
When I reach out for love now
I reach out for your hand

When I feel your heart beat
It makes me come alive
I don't wanna live without
Somethin' that is so right

I've been waitin' all my life
Just to look into your eyes
I live for the time alone with you

'Cause every time I see your face
All my troubles fade away
I live for the time alone with you

And when I climb the stairs to find you
And we reach for the light
I thank God I've got
This time alone with you

I've been waitin' all my life
Just to look into your eyes
I live for the time alone with you

'Cause every time I see your face
All my troubles fade away
I live for the time alone with you

And when I climb the stairs to find you
And we reach for the light
I thank God I've got this time alone with you
Oh yeah, oh this time alone with you

And the sun won't shine for me
And it seems like nothing's goin' right
