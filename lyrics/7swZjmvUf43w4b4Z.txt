I am no one, but I'm well known
For I am the Man with the Dogs
I stare at you shopping, watch while you're walking
Two dogs run around your toes

You turn around, two eyes break you down
"Now, who does that guy think he's starin' at?"
Stop in your tracks, you're being laughed at
You armored ego is nude

And I do and I do
Crack up 'cause I'm getting to you
I see you, I see you
And you're pretty self-conscious too
Ah ah, yeah, yeah

Down to your church, I'm looking for victims
Spell of the Man with the Dogs
I'll haunt you and follow you to work
That ghost is back again

Creep into you, I won't go away
You're taking yourself too seriously
I smile as you frown and turn to walk away
Your habits for all to see

I see a shrew, I see you
And the rodent things you do
You see you, you see you
And you're pretty self-conscious too

And I'm gonna crack your mask
Yeah, and I'm gonna laugh
Open wide
Oh yeah

Saw you again, you'll see me tomorrow
Curse of the Man with the Dogs
You may not like me, you won't forget me
Not safe even in Walgreen's

They've seen me, ask your friends, "oh, I know him"
Seen but I'm never heard by your lot
A stare is worth a thousand biting phrases
See how stupid you are?

I dare you, I dare you
To erase my laser tattoo
You see you, you see you
And you're pretty self-conscious too

And I'm gonna crack your mask
Yeah, and I'm gonna laugh
What's inside?
Is it pubic hair
Is it cobweb air
I bet you just don't care
