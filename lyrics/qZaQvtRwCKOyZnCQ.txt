Bow not before his creation, these mortals: man
This act of insult breeds our discontent
He turned his back on our loyalty
I will bring my insurrection, and a war upon heaven

I will bring my insurrection
And a war upon heaven
Hell-fire be my destruction
For this war upon heaven

Forged from fire I declare this war
A war against heaven
I bring upon my scourge filled with hubris
A declaration of war

It is I who spawns this fury, torches, ignite
Blaze is set to engulf all of which we hate
Storm in, eviscerate every motherfucker in our way
I will bring my insurrection, and a war upon heaven

I will bring my insurrection
And a war upon heaven
Hell-fire be my destruction
For this war upon heaven

Forged from fire I declare this war
A war against heaven
I bring upon my scourge filled with hubris
A declaration of war

Ascend to the heavens to destroy them all
Ascend to the heavens to destroy them all
Ascend to the heavens to destroy them all
Ascend to the heavens to destroy them all

Forged from fire I declare this war
A war against heaven
I bring upon my scourge filled with hubris
A declaration of war
Forged from fire I declare this war
A war against heaven
I bring upon my scourge filled with hubris
A declaration of war
