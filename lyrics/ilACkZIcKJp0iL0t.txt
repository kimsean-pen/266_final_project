I wanna wake up
In dream, dream, dream
Where the air is soft
To breathe, breathe, breathe

Hold on and don't let go
If we fall down, then you should know
That we could just be

Blowing florets
I want to dance in the air
Blowing florets
And just not care about anyone or anything
But you and me

So don't let go of me
Don't let go of me

I wanna rise up, with the trees, trees, trees
And let go of all responsibilities
And we could just be

Blowing florets
I want to dance in the air
Blowing florets
And just not care about anyone or anything
But you and me

So don't let go of me
Don't let go of me

Wherever the wind blows
Ever the wind blows
Don't let go
Wherever the wind blows
Ever the wind blows
Don't let go

Blowing florets
I wanna dance in the air
Blowing florets
And just not care about anyone or anything
But you and me

Don't let go of me, oh oh, oh oh
Don't let go of me
Don't let go of me

Wherever the wind blows
Ever the wind blows
Don't let go
Wherever the wind blows
Ever the wind blows
Don't let go
