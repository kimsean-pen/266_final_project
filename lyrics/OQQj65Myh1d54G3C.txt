I really thought you were the one
It was over before it begun
It's so hard for me to walk away
But I know I can't stay

You're beautiful and crazy too
Maybe that's why I fell into you
Even though you would pretend to be
You were never with me

So it's over yeah we're through
So I'mma unfriend you
You're the best liar ever knew
So I'mma unfriend you
'Cause I should have known, right from the start
I'm deleting you right from my heart
Yeah it's over, my last move is to unfriend you

I thought in time that you could change
And my time and love would heal the pain
And I didn't want this day to come
But now all I feel is numb

So it's over yeah we're through
So I'mma unfriend you
You're the best liar ever knew
So I'mma unfriend you
'Cause I should have known, right from the start
I'm deleting you right from my heart
Yeah it's over, my last move is to unfriend you

You come on to everybody
Everybody all the time
You give up to anybody
What I thought was only mine
Mine

Woah, ohh
Woah, woah, woah

So it's over yeah we're through
So I'mma unfriend you
You're the best liar ever knew
So I'mma unfriend you
'Cause I should have known, right from the start
That you didn't have a human heart
Yeah it's over, my last move is to unfriend you
Unfriend you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
