Where you are, thats where I wanna be
Through your eyes are all the things I wanna see
In the night you are my dream, you're everything to me

You're the love of my life and the breath in my prayers
Take my hand and lead me there
What I need is you here

I cant forget the taste of your mouth
From your lips all the heavens pour out
I can't forget when we are one
With you alone I am free

Everyday, every night, you alone are the love of my life

We go dancing in the moonlight
With the starlight in your eyes
We go dancing till the sunrise
You and me, we're gonna dance, dance, dance
