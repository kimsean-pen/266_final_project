I know this emptiness will go on
It's heartbreaking to have you away

Looks like an angel when she sleeps
Looks like a goddess wehn she lives

I'd like to escape by myself
Find a way and restart with her

But tonight we're on a star
Every time, the whole time
She'll take you and she'll make you dream

My dreams will never end
But you must be good, sir

Lie down under a tree
And think about how important she is

But tonight we're on a star
Every time, the whole time
She'll take you and she'll make you dream

You could show her all you want
Kneel in front of her and find the wonder

But tonight we're on a star
Every time, the whole time
She'll take you and she'll make you dream
