Guilty pleasures at best
Gouge the floors in our chests
And this the only vestige left
Next time will be better I guess

And I'd be alone
Happy alone
I'd be alone
Happy alone
Call what you want
and I'll be alone

To presuppose this precipice
Could be climbed by any one of us
That was my misjudgement
I guess I best just shut up and face that

I'll be alone
Happy alone
I'll be alone
Happy alone
Call what you want
And I'll be alone

I am not one to
Be three fourths sore
When I crave a split lip
I'll get it quick

And I'll be alone
Happy alone
I'll be alone
Happy alone
Call what you want
And I'd be alone
