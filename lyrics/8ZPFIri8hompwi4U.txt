Reasons for leaving you
I can't think of
Never had to
We both understand that we
Are the reason for one another
Seasons will be new
And we'll both find ourselves so far apart
Stay my love
I will always learn to find a way
So I gotta just straighten out
Your heart
Feel this
Don't lie
Then I felt this from the start
Cause I can't see us
Often
Places
Where I
Only that I can take you
I could never dream the dream without you
We both understand that we

Don't lie

Feel this
