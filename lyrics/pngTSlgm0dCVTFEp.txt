Endless Days
We search for what we hold inside
So hard to find
Luck turns
will the fallen ever reach within
and rise again

For the rest of my life
I will find the answers
that were always here
I will find the meaning this time
I will fight the end

Till the end is here
Wasted time
With words that seem to break our will
They bind us still
Without a care
they tarnish what we hold so dear

what was once so clear
For the rest of my life
I will find the answers
That were always here
I will find the meaning this time
I will fight the end
Till the end is here
The end is here
For the rest of my life

I will find the answers
That were always here
I will find the meaning this time
I will fight the end
Till the end is here
