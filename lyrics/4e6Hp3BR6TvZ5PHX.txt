Change the color of your eyes
Make your body move like mine
Then I showed you what to do
I made it easier for you
You've got another boy to lose
But does he want you like I do?
I bet you've seen it all before
I bet you're always wanting more

You and me, we'll make it serious now
And I'll be good if you can tell me how
Cause I been wondering lately
Are you the one that's gonna hold me down?

Can you tell me, oh, would you lead me on?
Would you start me over? I'm ready to be torn apart
And oh, would you break my heart?
And I'll break it for you, I'm ready to be torn apart

Oh, I'm ready for you, I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you, oh now, I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you, I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you, oh now, I'm ready for you

And as you see me start to play
It's the way that I was made
I refuse to tread the line
Cause I'm happier tonight
If you want my love to kill
I can give you love to fill
Never asking, never lie
And you never have to hide

You and me, we'll make it serious now
And I'll be good if you can tell me how
Cause I been wondering lately
Are you the one that's gonna hold me down?

Can you tell me, oh, would you lead me on?
Would you start me over? I'm ready to be torn apart
Oh, would you break my heart?
And I'll break it for you, I'm ready to be torn apart

Oh, I'm ready for you, I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you, oh now, I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you, I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you, oh now, I'm ready for you

Oh, would you lead me on?
Would you start me over? I'm ready to be torn apart
And oh, would you break my heart?
And I can break it for you, I'm ready to be torn apart

Oh, I'm ready for you, I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you, oh now, I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you, I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you, oh now, I'm ready for you
