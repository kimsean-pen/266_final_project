I wouldnt back now living with you
Just to hear you speak your mind
One at a time

As hard as a sac
went to react
you were unactive by the start
and I took way too long

To do whats only right
when I'm out of the brightness
well I haven't challenged how to survive
how to survive
Well I called my Eliza
but you wouldnt like that
I cannot try that when I'm alone

See gold is cold, all over

Listen for me in a very beautiful car accident
Now were mangled up together
righteous like teenagers who couldnt take it
Well take it, and take it, and know to keep it all inside

We could sleep for hours
Drive all night

To do whats only right
when I'm out of the brightness
well I havent challenged how to survive
All night (all night)
Well I called my Eliza
but you wouldn't like that
I cannot try that and I'm alone

But it wasn't right
everytime there was war
you want to sing
people running out of reach in a matter of days
but it wasn't there

And I'm tearing at my skin again
I'm tearing at my skin
I'm tearing at my skin
I'm tearing at my skin
and with the melting flesh
compiled your (indistinct)

Do what's only right
when I'm out of the brightness
well I haven't challenged how to survive
All night (all night)
Well I called my Eliza
but you wouldnt like that
I cannot try that and I'm alone
