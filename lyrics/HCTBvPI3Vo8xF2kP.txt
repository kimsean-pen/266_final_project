Devastation at last finally we meet
After all of these years out here on the street
I had a feeling you would make yourself known
You came along just to claim your place on the throne
And I have been overthrown
Overthrown

And I thought if I towed the right lines
But these mockingbirds won't let me shine

Devastation my door was left open wide
You brought me into your heart then you swallowed my pride
I had a feeling you were hiding your thoughts
I made a note to myself I nearly forgot
Now I am overwrought
I'm overwrought

And I thought if I towed the right lines
But these mockingbirds won't let me shine

And I thought if I towed the right lines
But these mockingbirds won't let me shine

One day this ground will break
And open up for me I hope it will I hope it will

Salutations at last down on my knees
I heard the bugle this morn blast reveille
Woke from a dream where I was in a terrible realm
All my sails were ablaze I was chained to the helm
And now I am overwhelmed
I'm overwhelmed

And I thought if I towed the right lines
But these mockingbirds won't let me shine

And I thought if I towed the right lines
But these mockingbirds won't let me shine

And I thought if I towed the right lines (devastation at last)
But these mockingbirds won't let me shine

And I thought if I towed the right lines (devastation at last)
But these mockingbirds won't let me shine

And I thought if I towed the right lines (devastation at last)
But these mockingbirds won't let me shine

And I thought if I towed the right lines (devastation at last)
But these mockingbirds won't let me shine
