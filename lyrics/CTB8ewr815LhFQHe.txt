We wouldn't be seen dead here in the day
I guess you're lucky that it's dark now
And if I like it, then we stay
Impress the empress, take your shot now

(We got the glow in our mouths)
White teeth teens are out
(Out)
White teeth teens are up for it

I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning
But we got our methods, and there's nothing here to stop
To stop this

If you want, we'll help tonight to split its seams
Give the bruises out like gifts
You'll get the picture of your dreams
I won't be smilin' but the notes from my admirers
Fill my dashboard just the same, ah, ah-ah

(We got the glow in our mouths)
White teeth teens are out
(Out)
White teeth teens are up for it

I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning
But we got our methods, and there's nothing here to stop
To stop this, when we're up for it
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning
But we got our methods, and there's nothing here to stop
To stop this

(And everything works out so good)
(I wear the robe like no one could)

I'll let you in on something big
I am not a white teeth teen
I tried to join, but never did
The way they are, the way they seem
Is something else, it's in the blood
Their molars blinkin' like the lights
In the underpass, where we all sit
And do nothing, and love it

(Everything works out so good)
(I wear the robe like no one could)
(Everything works out so good)
(I wear the robe like no one could)

(We got the glow in our mouths)
White teeth teens are out
(Out)
White teeth teens are out
