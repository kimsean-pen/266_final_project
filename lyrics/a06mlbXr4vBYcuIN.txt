You're waiting on miracles
We're bleeding out
Thoughts and prayers

Adorable (crisis)
Like cake in a crisis
We're bleeding out

While you deliberate
Bodies accumulate
Sit and talk like Jesus
Try walking like Jesus

Sit and talk like Jesus
Talk like Jesus
Talk, talk, talk, talk
Get the fuck out of my way

Don't be the problem, be the solution
Don't be the problem, be the solution
Don't be the problem, be the solution
Problem, problem, problem, problem

Faith without works is
Talk without works is
Faith without works is
Dead, dead, dead, dead

Sit and talk like Jesus
Try walking like Jesus
Sit and talk like Jesus

Try walking like Jesus
Try braving the rain
Try lifting the stone

Try extending a hand
Try walking your talk
Or get the fuck out of my way.
