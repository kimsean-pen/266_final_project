And when the sun is setting
You know that I need you on my team
And I can feel you sweating
Your love's so rough, it's like the sea

Let's go to the back of your car
How I hope you understand
My dreams dry up and fall apart
Now we're lying in the sand

Now we're lying in the sand
Now we're lying in the sand

Take the sun, take the sun
Take the sun in your eyes
Feel the cold, feel the cold, cold water on your skin
Let the salt on your tongue make you feel alright
I can tell by your face that your smile is wearing thin

And when the sun is setting
You know that I need you on my team
And I can feel you sweating
Your love's so rough, it's like the sea

Let's go to the back of your car
How I hope you understand
My dreams dry up and fall apart
Now we're lying in the sand

Ride the waves, ride the waves
Ride the waves to the shore
Grab my arm, hold me down
Leave me feeling, wanting more
You buy me lots, and lots of sweet lemonade
When your rays come down they leave me feeling burnt

I don't know what lies ahead
Let's pull over, let's pretend
If you're with me, let me know

And when the sun is setting
You know that I need you on my team
And I can feel you sweating
Your love's so rough, it's like the sea

Let's go to the back of your car
How I hope you understand
My dreams dry up and fall apart
Now we're lying in the sand

Now we're lying in the sand
Now we're lying in the sand
