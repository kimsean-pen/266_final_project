We were born to live, in a desperate time
Where it seems the death of dreams, is the end of life

But we have only one life to live, just one opportunity
And failure is not the end of the world, that's just society!

Career suicide is not real suicide, Career suicide is alright
Career suicide is not real suicide, Career suicide is fine

We are all expendable, and we can be replaced.
They have supplies of infinite lives, and no time to waste.

But we have only one life to live, one time to exist
And though there is no afterlife (after all), there is still more to life than this!

Career suicide is not real suicide, Career suicide is alright
Career suicide is not real suicide, Career suicide is fine
Career suicide is not real suicide its not real suicide at all...
Career suicide is not real suicide, its not the end of the world...

Death is the failure of our parts,
Failure is just the death of dreams
There's more to life than suc-cess
but only death is real...

ONLY DEATH IS REAL!

Death is the failure of our parts,
Failure is just the death of dreams
There's more to life than suc-cess
but only death is real...

Career suicide is not real suicide, Career suicide is alright
Career suicide is not real suicide, Career suicide is fine
Career suicide is not real suicide its not real suicide at all...
Career suicide is not real suicide, its not the end of the world... its not the end of the world.
