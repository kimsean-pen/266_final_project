Impossible Germany
Unlikely Japan
Wherever you go
Wherever you land
I'll say what this means to me
I'll do what I can
Impossible Germany
Unlikely Japan

The fundamental problem
I need to face "This is important"
But I know you're not listening
I know you're not listening

This is still new to me
I wouldn't understand
Impossible Germany
Unlikely Japan
This is what love is for
To be at a place
Gorgeous and alone
And face to face

With no larger problems
That need to be erased
And nothing more important
Than to know someone's listening
Oh I know you'll be listening
