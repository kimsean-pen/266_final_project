I was living in a devil town
Lived my life in a devil town
Oh my lord it really brings me down
About the devil town
And all my friends were vampires
I didn't know they were vampires
Until that I was a vampire too
In a devil town
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
I was living in a devil town
Lived my life in a devil town
Oh lord it really brings me down
About the devil town
Devil town
