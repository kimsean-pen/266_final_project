Infinity and beyond buzz
How you've got me grow high on love, boy
How you lead me on trust
Thought it would be like here for us
But let it go, let it show
That it's no one Just let me know, 'cause truth be told
It's getting old now
How we've been going 'round with this
It's getting quite ridiculous
You're sayin' that you need your head
You need a little doze of it
But, but it's been all wrong to be your confident
I said I'm tryina right this out
But you've been moving way too proud
I'm Keeping safe and sound I ain't seen no??
Bring your loving downtown
Let me do my workand release your hurt
Give what you deserve
Bring your loving downtown
Let me show you outta Earth
Take you out of this
But baby first things first
Bring your loving downtown
Bring your loving downtown
