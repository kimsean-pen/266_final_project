They Used to tell me:
You got to choose a side
Now it's four years later,
And they beg for advice.
Don't trust the critic he's a cynic
Make the call for yourself
This is my 10-step course to not be like everyone else

I know
It's not the easiest route,
And I know
It leaves you overflowing with doubt
But if you want it you can have it
Hope it's all that you dreamt
Cause once you got it your gonna get it
I wont be leaving this

You can't trust everyone you meet
They won't amount to anything
Go tell them
Go tell them
It's not as simple as you think
You can't trust everyone you meet
They never meant that much to me
Go tell them
Go tell them
It's not as simple as you think

Clenched fists held above me
You will never bring me to my knees
I said
Clenched fists held above me
You will never bring me to my knees
You'll get what you deserve
