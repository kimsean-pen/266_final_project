Once I walked through the halls of a station
And someone called your name
In the street I heard children laughing
They all sound the same

Wonder, could you ever know me
Know the reason why I live
Is there nothing you can show me
Life seems so little to give

Once I climbed to the top of a mountain
And ate the wild fruit there
Fell asleep until the moonlight woke me
Dreaming I could touch your hair

Isn't everybody dreaming!
Then the voice I hear is real
Out of all the idle scheming
Can't we have something to feel

Once upon a time leaves me empty
Tomorrow never came
I could hear the sound of your laughter
Still I don't know your name

Must be some way to repay you
After all the good you gave
If a rumour should delay you
Love seems so little to save
Oh save me...
