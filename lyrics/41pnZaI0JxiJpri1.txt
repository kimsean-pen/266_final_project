You can make it alone if you try
Til' the beat come home
I know you'll sing it
You can make it alone if you try
They never see your fire
Til' you make it out
Well are you with them, if not let it go
You're either going to rock the boat,
Or have what they're handing out
Now you're somewhere remote
They think you got a wire broke
But what you hashing up?
Something that you wrote
Is going to make a good lifeboat
Asylum for the torn
A rumbling below
Said if not now you'll never go
So while we wait it out
(2x)You can make it alone if you try
Til' the beat come home
I know you'll sing it
You can make it alone if you try
They never see your fire
Til' you make it out
It's what you know
But you can't tell a soul
Just where it is you let it go
For fear they'll turn it sour
You can see through the smoke
And though you know
That something's broke
You're holding on for now
Aiming for the mark
How is it that your scars light up
Like flashlights in the dark
Leading with the heart
You know your battle from the start
Don't let it wear you down
(2x)You can make it alone if you try
Til' the beat come home
I know you'll sing it
You can make it alone if you try
They never see your fire
Til' you make it out
For now you leave them alone
Ah, they'll see on their own
Ya ya yo
Out on your own, out on your own
Ya ya yo
And you're going
Now you now you'll go
(4x)You can make it alone if you try
Til' the beat come home
I know you'll sing it
You can make it alone if you try
They never see your fire
Til' you make it out
