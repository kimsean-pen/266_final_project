Breeze has blown; leaves have fallen
Days grown short; river flowin'
Bird has flown; misty mornin'
Path well worn; river flowin' (ay)
Finally home; sun is shinin'
Where the sweet river windin'
Like a river flowin'; like a river windin' its way
Like a river flowin'; like a river windin' its way
Like a river flowin'; like a river windin' its way
Like a river flowin'; like a river
Ayoh Ayoh Ayoh Ayoh Ayoh Ayoh Ay
Time has come; world in motion
Heart of man swept into the ocean
(ay) Like a river flowin'; like a river washes away
Like a river flowin'; like a river washes away
(ay) Like a river flowin'; like a river windin' its way
Like a river flowin'; like a river
Ayoh Ayoh Ayoh Ayoh Ayoh Ayoh Ayoh
