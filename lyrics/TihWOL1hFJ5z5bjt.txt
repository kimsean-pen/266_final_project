Night after night I cry
Night after night you're never home
Night after night I get disappointed,
cause i'm sick and tired of being alone (alone)

Night after night I go for a walk
Looking at the stars in the sky
Night after night I look in the mirror
And wonder why a lover has to cry
(Ohh)

I cry in the night
Because girl your never ever with me
I know it makes no sense to cry
But this ain't the way my life should be

In the mornings i go to the pond
All my friends see me walking down the street
And they all know that somethings bothering me
Because my smiles so weak
(Ohh)

Every night I chase you down
Night after night you disappear
It's hard for me to comprehend
What exactly do you fear
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone
But I have no choice if I want you
You have so many friends your always on the phone
You make my life so blue
