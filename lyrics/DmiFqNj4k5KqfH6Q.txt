Somebody called me on the phone
Say hey hey is Arty home
You wanna take a walk
You wanna go cop
You wanna go get some Chinese Rock

I'm living on a Chinese Rock
All my best things are in hock
I'm living on a Chinese Rock
Everthing is in the pawn shop

The plaster's falling off the wall
My girlfriend's crying in the shower stall
It's hot as a bitch
I should've been rich
Now I'm just digging a Chinese ditch

I'm living on a Chinese Rock
All my best things are in hock
I'm living on a Chinese Rock
Everthing is in the pawn shop

Oh, ah
Oh, ah

The plaster's falling off the wall
My girlfriend's crying in the shower stall
It's hot as a bitch
I should've been rich
Now I'm just digging a Chinese ditch

I'm living on a Chinese Rock
All my best things are in hock
I'm living on a Chinese Rock
Everthing is in the pawn shop

I'm living on a Chinese Rock
I'm living on a Chinese Rock
I'm living on a Chinese Rock
I'm living on a Chinese Rock
