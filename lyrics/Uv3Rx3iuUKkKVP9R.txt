Leave behind all the mess that you've made
And never ever do it again
Balance out all the love that you saved
You will need it to the bitter end

And now that you realize
You've seen it in my blue eyes, my blue eyes
There's nothing more I can do but sing you:
La-la la-la-la la-la-la-la la-la-la, la-la-la-la la-la-la [2x]

Make your run, make a fool of yourself
You're an accident that's waiting to happen
Life's so short, so forget all the past
It'll be there till the bitter end

And now that you realize
You've seen it in my blue eyes, my blue eyes
There's nothing more I can do but sing you:
La-la la-la-la la-la-la-la la-la-la, la-la-la-la la-la-la [4x]

And now that you realize
You've seen it in my blue eyes, my blue eyes
There's nothing more I can do but sing you:
La-la la-la-la la-la-la-la la-la-la, la-la-la-la la-la-la [4x]
