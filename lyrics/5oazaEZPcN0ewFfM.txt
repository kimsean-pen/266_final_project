Now that your picture's in the paper being rhythmically admired
And you can have anyone that you have ever desired
All you gotta tell me now is why, why, why, why?

Oh, I know it don't thrill you, I hope it don't kill you
You gotta do it till you're through, so you better get to it

All of your family had to kill to survive
And they're still waitin' for their big day to arrive
But if they knew how I felt, they'd bury me alive

Oh, I know it don't thrill you, I hope it don't kill you
You gotta do it till you're through, so you better get to it

I hear you sayin', "Hey, the city's alright"
When you only read about it in books
Spend all your money gettin' so convinced
That you never even bother to look

Sometimes I wonder if we're livin' in the same land
Why d'you wanna be my friend
When I feel like a juggler running out of hands?

Oh, welcome to the working week
