Even though your faded glow
Won't bend through all your bars
You put out to put up
Even while your widening smile
Was shaking in the smoke
Your hand was full of hope

Because I am a member of the butterfly culture
Where we work and we take
We play and we pray to god
That the girl in that dress will undress
And distress you with the way that she moves

Even now when you know
How to measured up the risk
You're still not tired of this
Even when the pills you take
Turn you to a ghost
You still spin around the most

Because I am a member of the butterfly culture
Where we work and we take
We play and we pray to god
That the girl in that dress will undress
And distress you with the way that she moves

I am a member of the butterfly culture
Where we work and we take
We play and we pray to god
That the girl in that dress will undress
And distress you with the way that she moves
