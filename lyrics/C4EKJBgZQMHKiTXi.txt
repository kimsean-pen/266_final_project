Give The Human Devil His Due

attack fire against fire, when your enemies attack you
throw the first stone, before something hit you
you well know that the best defence is the attack
and shan't rest until hear the enemy's last breath
peace just will come, when you triumph over the last one
eye by eye
tooth by tooth
you shall retribute evil by evil
ashes to ashes
dust to dust
the one who has made more victims will be named the new god
sometimes, i've given love and haven't received anything back
you are confounding human feelings with merchandises
i've seen, all my life, the people doing thus
why don't you follow your own instinct of discernment?
but i've followed it!
the focus of tyranny and hate
more despotic than the megalomaniac god
but he isn't a god and he is lacking his strength
now he feels the shock of the negative discharge in his mind
now i am here submerged in this mud. i am the worst!
an old and useless trash full of wrinkles
face our destiny watch my sad example
the world of fatality that we are creating for our fellow beings
revive yourself as me
our greatest fault is the fear to admit our wrong
hindsight won't help me to recover the time i've lost
the doors are closing. wake up!
i must open your eyes to the truth
the chances are against us. stand up to
the man is born as a pure and wise animal,
but the society blinds him and taints him
if he become contrary to it, he'll suffer, like me, the consequences
threatened, imprisioned, tortured, humiliated, doomed, killed and
decaptated
no god, no devil, no one can save us from the human justice
eye by eye
tooth by tooth
destroy the false conceptions which they've trained you
ashes to ashes
dust to dust
happily, for our luck, the sun rises for all
it's never too late to go off the course of our life
