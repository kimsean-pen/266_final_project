Tonight I'm sending you a message
This is the end of an era
The end of second chances
In the face of defeat
I'm winning
Yet you still have so much left to say
Oh they're coming straight for me
Ow they're coming straight for me
Read between the lines
We can't give in this time
Just let me go for now I'll be just fine (I'll be just fine)
Don't ya know don't ya know
Now that I'm back on my own
Just let me go for now I'll be just fine(I'll be just fine)
Don't ya know don't ya know
Now that I'm back on my own
Tell me how it feels
To watch the walls of your security crumble
I remember you
You took the easy way out when I gave you something to stand for
Oh they're coming straight for me
Ow they're coming straight for me
Read between the lines
We can't give in this time
Just let me go for now I'll be just fine (I'll be just fine)
Don't ya know don't ya know
Now that I'm back on my own
Just let me go for now I'll be just fine (I'll be just fine)
Don't ya know don't ya know
Now that I'm back on my own
I was just another promise you couldn't keep
I was just another promise you couldn't keep
Read between the lines
We can't give in this time
Just let me go for now I'll be just fine (just let me go)
Don't ya know don't ya know
Now that I'm back on my own
Just let me go for now I'll be just fine (I'll be just fine)
Don't ya know don't ya know
Now that I'm back on my own
