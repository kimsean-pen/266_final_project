I could have told you why
It would have made me cry a little
I could have told you lies
It would have made me die a little
I could have told you anything
Except the truth which burns my middle

Run away that's what I did today
Run away there's nothing I could have said

You found another love
Someone to wipe away your tears
I left it all behind of me
Never to turn and face my fears
We may have fought with teeth and nails
I still recall your banking details

Run away that's what I did today
Run away there's nothing I could have said

those who cry and run away
Live to cry another day

Run away that's what I did today
Run away there's nothing I could have said
Run away that's what I did today
Run away there's nothing I could have said
Run away that's what I did today
Run away there's nothing I could have said
But cry a little
Lie a little
Die, just a little
