The Land Is Silent... Before The Storm!

On the vast fields of snow, the wind is blowing strong
With it's frozen cold and relentless touch
it leaves a dead and hollow land of ice

I have seen through the eyes of a wolf
and felt all its pain and loneliness
The beautiful land opened before my eyes
wild as a beast I ran into the night

The Calling Of The Howling Wind
Is Raging In The Realms Of North
Creations Of Ice Rising Mighty Into The Skies
And Treacherous Gods Shall Fall

Watching through the falling snow
there's no sign of life
The fire has gone out in the whirl of time
Behold the face of thunder
the storm is getting near
When the sky calls my name, I have no fear

The Calling Of The Howling Wind
Is Raging In The Realms Of North
Creations Of Ice Rising Mighty Into The Skies
And Treacherous Gods Shall Fall
They brought us misfortune, but their honor is about to be crushed
My blood flows cold as streams of the North
We'll never let them take our souls
The calling of the howling wind is raging in the North
Creations of ice, rising mighty into the skies
and Treacherous Gods shall fall

Time And Time Again
I Witness The Birth Of A New Born Star
I Climb The Highest Mountain
To Find The Essence Of A New Era

Time And Time Again
