Most people I know wouldn't know that they're living a lie
Tracing every penny, clinging on to a lonely life
We have a choice to define our fate
Fall in line or break the chain
Empty vessels, empty lives

You could run away or you could be mine
Travel round the world everyday, everynight
Know whatever you are chasing, I'll be waiting here for you
Cause I got a whole lotta love, whole lotta love for you
Yeah, I got a whole lotta love, whole lotta love for you

Most people I know don't know any other way to survive
Scraping at the bottom of a battle is a way of life
You came along and you showed me a way
You said, "don't fall in line, don't fade away
Don't be another empty vessel, free your mind"

You could run away or you could be mine
Travel round the world everyday, everynight
Know whatever you are chasing, I'll be waiting here for you
Cause I got a whole lotta love, whole lotta love for you

I don't wanna be an empty vessel, wasting life
Tracing every penny, clinging on
Tracing every penny, clinging on

You could run away or you could be mine
Travel round the world everyday, everynight
Know whatever you are chasing, I'll be waiting here for you
I got a whole lotta love, whole lotta love for you
Yeah, I got a whole lotta love, whole lotta love for you
Cause I got a whole lotta love, whole lotta love for you
