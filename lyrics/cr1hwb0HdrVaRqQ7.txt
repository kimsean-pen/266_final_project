It's been so hard
Get some sleep
And now it's getting hard to breathe
There's confusion on the streets
And a war in the Middle East

But no one seems to ask the reasons why
Yes, no one seems to ask the reasons why

Everyday I play the game
I'm just a number not a name
Some have fortune, some have fame
Some seek shelter from the rain

But no one seems to ask the reasons why
Yes, no one seems to ask the reasons why

So how are we to know
Yes, how are we to know
What direction we came from
And where we are to go

Yes, no one seems to ask the reasons why
