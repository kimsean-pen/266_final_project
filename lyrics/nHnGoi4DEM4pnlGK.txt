So this is the end of you and me
We had a good run and I'm setting you free
To do as you want, to do as you please
Without me

Remember when you were my boat
And I was your sea
Together we'd float so delicately

But that was back when we could talk about anything
Cause I don't know who I am
When you're running circles in my head
And I don't know just who you are

When you're sleeping in someone else's bed
Three whole words and eight letters late
And that would have worked on me yesterday
We're not the same, I wish that could change

But it can't
And I'll say your name and in the same breath
I'll say something that I'll grow to regret
So keep your hands on your chest and sing with me

That we don't wanna believe
Cause I don't know who I am
When you're running circles in my head
And I don't know just who you are

When you're sleeping in someone else's bed
So it's true what they say
If you love someone, you should set them free
Oh, it's true what they say

You went and threw it away
I don't know who you are
And I don't know who you are, and oh
Cause I don't know who you are
When you sleep with somebody else
Cause I don't know who I am
When you're sleeping with him
It's true what they say
You went and threw it away
