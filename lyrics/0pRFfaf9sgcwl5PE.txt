There was this guy and me
I never thought that we could have that chemistry
But he became the one to show me

Stars in the sky
That light up the night
My fantasy fell into something true
He put a spell on me under the moonlight
And I knew
Now I can stop thinking 'bout that
Taste like cherry pop

Pop pop
Che-cherry che-cherry pop
Pop pop
Che-che-cherry che-che-cherry pop

Last night we made out
Then we saw the blackout
But it tasted like a cherry pop
Pop pop

When I look into his eyes
All I see is paradise
You're tasty like a cherry pop
Pop pop
Never felt like this before
I just want more
Che-che-cherry che-che-cherry pop
Pop pop pop

And now they're asking me
Are you and him together?
How is it gonna be?
Or he's it just still playing, playing

Tricks on your mind
I bet that he's not your kind
My fantasy fell into something true
He put a spell on me under the moonlight
And I knew
Now I can stop thinking 'bout that
Taste like cherry pop

Pop pop
Che-che-cherry che-che-cherry pop
Pop pop
Che-che-cherry che-che-cherry pop

Last night we made out
Then we saw the blackout
But it tasted like a cherry pop
Pop pop

When I look into his eyes
All I see is paradise
You're tasty like a cherry pop
Pop pop
Never felt like this before
I just want more
Che-che-cherry che-che-cherry pop
Pop pop pop

Pop pop pop
Cherry cherry cherry cherry pop
Cherry cherry pop
Cherry cherry cherry cherry pop
Cherry cherry pop

Ouhouhou

Cherry pop
Pop pop
Che-che-cherry che-che-cherry pop
Pop pop
Che-cherry che-cherry
Pop

Last night we made out
Then we saw the blackout
But it tasted like a cherry pop
Pop pop
When I look into his eyes
All I see is paradise
You're tasty like a cherry pop
Pop pop
Never felt like this before
I just want more
Che-che-cherry che-che-cherry pop
Pop pop pop
