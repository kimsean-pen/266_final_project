One step away from the grave
Tryin' to get out
Of my head everyday
These voices gettin' loud
And I'm hearin' them say
They, whoa, yeah they
Could talk me to the grave

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Red lights, blue lights
Face down on Hollywood and Vine
They said, I drunk
Enough to die too young

Catch me runnin' from my feelings
'Cause you know I'm
12 steps from what I've been needin'
Yeah you know I'm

One step away from the grave
Tryin' to get out
Of my head everyday
These voices gettin' loud
And I'm hearin' them say
Za be dum be zum be dum
Oh and they, whoa, yeah they
Could talk me to the grave

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Talk me to the grave)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Yeah you know I've
Been broke, been paid
Few years back I lost my way
Big hopes, big dreams
Big bottle, now big problems

I can't keep running from these feelings
Well you know I
I need something to believe in
Well you know I'm

One step away from the grave
Tryin' to get out
Of my head everyday
These voices gettin' loud
And I'm hearin' them say
Za be dum be zum be dum
Oh and they, whoa, yeah they
Could talk me to the grave

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Talk me to the grave)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

One day
Wake up and say
Where the hell did my life go?
It's okay
It's not too late
I'ma take back the control
Oh you're no good
Oh you're no good for me
No I don't want
No I don't wanna be

One step away from the grave
Tryin' to get out
Of my head everyday
These voices gettin' loud
And I'm hearin' them say
Za be dum be zum be dum
No they, whoa, yeah they
Could talk me to the-

One step away from the grave
Tryin' to get out
Of my head everyday
These voices gettin' loud
And I'm hearin' them say
Za be dum be zum be dum
No and they, whoa, yeah they
Could talk me to the grave
