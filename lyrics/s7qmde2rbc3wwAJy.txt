Darlin, there's fire in the house tonight
Burning hot, raging wild, but I love you.

Sweetheart, the dogs are running wild today
Dogs of war that howl and bay, but I love you.

Yeh I love you, yeh I love you
Yeh I love you, yeh I love you...

Baby I need you tonight, we ain't got time to fuss and fight
So tonight call out when the love is gone
Do you remember, do you recall?
When the good times filled your heart and soul and
We'd dance, all night, we'd kiss in the morning light

'Til I burn up, 'til all that's left is dust I'm yours
Protect you from the coming storm
Cos I love you, yeh I love you
Yeh I love you...

Baby I need you tonight, we ain't got time to fuss and fight,
So tonight call out when the love is gone
Do you remember, do you recall?
When the good times filled your heart and soul and
We'd dance, all night, we'd kiss in the morning light

There's fire in the house tonight...
Burning hot, burning wild...
If you let it.
Baby, baby, I love you, love you...

Do you remember, do you recall?
When the good times filled your heart and soul and
We'd dance, all night, we'd kiss in the morning light
Baby I need you tonight, we ain't got time to fuss and fight
So tonight call out when the love is gone
Do you remember, do you recall?
When the good times filled your heart and soul and
We'd dance, all night, we'd kiss, all night, baby...

There's fire in the house tonight
