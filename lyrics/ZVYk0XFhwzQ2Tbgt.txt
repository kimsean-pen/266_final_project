You never know the way it goes
'Till you've said enough
You never know the way it goes
'Till you've had your fill of me
Big girls, the way we are
You know we're driving far
Downtown, the radio, oh, oh

That's why we're working hard
We try to fight it 'till we make it 'till we at the stars
That's why you oughta know
We drive alone

I'm not your fantasy
And I don't like the way you look at me
So drive, I'm leaving this behind
Big girls never cry

We never know the way it goes
'Till you've said enough (said enough for me)
You never know the way it goes
'Till you've had your fill of me (had your fill of me)
We never know the way it goes
'Till you've said enough (said enough for me)
You never know the way it goes
'Till you've had your fill of me

Night time is when we ride
It's when we feel alive
Top down, the streetlights glow, oh, oh

That's why we're playin' hard
Try to stay up 'till we wake up underneath the stars
That's why you oughta know
We drive alone

It's just reality
I'm not the kind of girl you want from me
Sometime you've gotta say goodbye

We never know the way it goes
'Till you've said enough (said enough for me)
You never know the way it goes
'Till you've had your fill of me (had your fill of me)
We never know the way it goes
'Till you've said enough (said enough for me)
You never know the way it goes
'Till you've had your fill of me (had your fill of me)
We never know the way it goes
'Till you've said enough (said enough for me)
You never know the way it goes
'Till you've had your fill of me (had your fill of me)
We never know the way it goes
'Till you've said enough (said enough for me)
You never know the way it goes
'Till you've had your fill of me
