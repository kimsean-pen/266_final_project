Oh is that all you think of, money?

Oh, I also think of you. Very often
How nice it would be for us to see each
other all the time, not just a few hours each week

Oh, you can be cruel when you want to be

I know what I want and I take it when
I want it. Woud've realized it by now

Well, I'll try

Quick, get into the front seat, George
Stop the car, you fool
(sigh) It's finished
The rest is easy
