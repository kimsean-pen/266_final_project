Fight fair, high class subterfuge
Raw thought, rethink, pretend
Eye dance, coat your mouth and start again
Raw thought, rethink, just pretend

Contort, reshape
Matchstick mind at ease

Charcoal hands erode, slight spine
Brazen picture rooted

Contort, reshape, matchstick mind at ease
Contort, reshape, matchstick mind at ease

Prideful preaching crosses solace's disdain
Still circle "stray" and know that we are meld that way

And you spit blood from across the room
Just brace yourself and spit in tune
High stakes silence while their tongues loom
The wolf inside resumes, won't see you soon
