Never got around desire
Never felt complete
Doused in oil, and tried by fire
But never to be clean

Kerosene
Kerosene
Kerosene
Kerosene

So throw another on the fire
Turn in your humanity
Apology is uninspired
So hang 'em from the tree

Kerosene
Kerosene
Kerosene
Kerosene

Animals around the pyre
Gather for the feast
To look upon the new messiah
But the flame is all that's seen

Kerosene
Kerosene
Kerosene
Kerosene

Rejected by the purifier
And chosen by the beast
The ones who really lit the fire
Start to show their teeth
