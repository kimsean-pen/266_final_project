Mama don't make me put on the dress again
I can't stand the way it opens when I spin
Ribbon bows around my shoulder and I'm only getting older
Mama don't make me put on the dress again

Daddy don't make me fancy dance around
Painted up in that makeup like a clown
If I see another stocking Lord, I swear to God I'm walking Lord
Daddy don't make me fancy dance around

Well I'm coming home alone for the hundredth time or so
It gets harder on my hard earned money's dime
To the bottle in my basket, will it answer if I ask it:
Doing right or am I doing time?

Lover don't make me hit the road again
I can barely feel your fingers on my skin
I've been booking every city
Lookin sad but lookin pretty, lookin
Lover don't make me hit the road again

Brother don't make me tell you where I've been
Running round in circles made of sin
I've been drinking like my daddy
And he ain't ever had his last one had he?
Brother don't make me tell you where I've been

Well I'm coming home alone for the hundredth time or so
It gets harder on my hard earned moneys dime
To the bottle in my basket, will it answer if I ask it:
Doing right or am I doing time?

The farther from my home the more I wish it
The longer I've been gone the more I miss it
Ribbon bows around my shoulder and I swear I'm only getting older
Mama don't make me put on the dress again

Well I'm coming home alone for the hundredth time or so
It gets harder on my hard earned money's dime
To the bottle in my basket, will it answer if I ask it:
Doing right or am I doing time?

Doing right or am I doing time?
