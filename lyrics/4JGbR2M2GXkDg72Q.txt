Woke up in the evening
To the sound of the screaming
Through the walls that were bleeding
All over me

Untied & weightless
Unconscious as we cross
The international dateline
Let's end it here

Grow tired of the shokos(?)
And the ones that we toast
There are no zeroes
Around here

Untied & weightless
Unconscious as we cross
The international dateline
Let's end it here

Let's end it here
Let's end it here
Let's leave her here
Let's end it here

Woke up in the evening
To the sound of the screaming
Through the walls that were bleeding
All over me

Untied & weightless
Unconscious as we cross
The international dateline
Let's end it here

Let's end it here
Let's end it here
Let's leave her here
Let's leave her here

Let's end it here
Let's end it here
Let's leave her here
Let's leave her here
