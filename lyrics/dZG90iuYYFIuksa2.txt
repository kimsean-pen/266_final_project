Well I got my life together
Everything's right in place
So why do I feel like I'm losin' it
Every time I see your face

I got 24 hours in my day
I got 7 days in my week
I got time for work, time for play
And a little time left to sleep, but

I got no time for love
No mind for love
I'm way too busy makin' plans
I got no time for love
Oh yeah

The way you walked right into my life
And tried to win me with your kiss
But I got places to go and things to do
And your kiss ain't on my list

I got no time for love
No mind for love
I'm way too busy makin' plans
I got no time for love

Oh, no time for love
I got no mind for love
I'm way too busy makin' plans
I got no time for love
