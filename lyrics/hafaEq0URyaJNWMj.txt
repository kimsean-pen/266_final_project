The quick spider weaving
Keeping the web alive and well
Like the black widow male
Just another victim
To a love so rare

I saw no light in your eyes
I know that others have tried

I thought I was the one!
But you turned me into stone!
And when you look back at people
You turn them into dust

I count the snakes in your hair
Growing stronger with every breath
I will be the one who waits
Picking up the pieces until
You come again

I saw no light in your eyes
I know that others have tried
I heard your tears sold like gold
One more of your lies unfold

I thought I was the one!
But you turned me into stone!
And when you look back at people
You turn them into dust

Malignia

I thought was the one!
Thought was the one
Thought was the one
