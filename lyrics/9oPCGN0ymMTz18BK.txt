I say goodbye to all at once
To dare to face you all alone
I went from wreckage to work class
With a box of t-shirts and some records to sell

But times have changed
I have to defend my actions
The foundation crumbles
And I have to leave

Thanks for everything
We couldn't ask for more
I say I love you all
I say vanish through the Jester's door
