Sense awaken
So deep a breach against the ice
Signs up stepping
Give way a flower of the time

Old oak standing
Woven a temple to the times
New growth coming
Green sheet a fabric of the lies

Black void yawning
This mass will bury us alive
Dead roots stirring
New life's shining in our eyes
Not stay rooted to the shore
Let the waves consume our bones
Don't you know it's hard to live
When we go it all alone
