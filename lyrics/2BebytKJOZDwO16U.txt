Tree of disbelief
With broken harmony in the resin
Taste the tempting fruit
And be an outcast from the paradise

Pass the sea of darkness
To another world

Join me to the other side
Night side of the paradise
Sitra Ahra

Kiss the Queen of Qelipot
Listen to the serpents voice
Sitra Ahra

"Pass the gate across the line
Take a step and enter Ayin"
Sitra Ahra

Pandemonium
A secret residence in the exile
Build another house
God is left behind and now you see

Eden you are losing
You will once regain

Join me to the other side
Night side of the paradise
Sitra Ahra

Kiss the Queen of Qelipot
Listen to the serpents voice
Sitra Ahra

"Pass the gate across the line
Take a step and enter Ayin"
Sitra Ahra

You will break the seventh seal
Sitra Ahra
All the secrets are unveiled
Sitra Ahra

Walk across the mirror
To another world

Join me to the other side
Night side of the paradise
Sitra Ahra
Kiss the Queen of Qelipot
Listen to the serpents voice
Sitra Ahra
Kiss the Queen of Qelipot
Listen to the serpents voice
Sitra Ahra
"Pass the gate across the line
Take a step and enter Ayin"
Sitra Ahra
