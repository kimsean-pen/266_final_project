Can't be trusted! Can't be trusted!
Can't be trusted!
I don't trust no-one running my middle with a loaded gun

(can you trust it) Oh the CIA
(can you trust it) They wanna put me away
(can you trust it) Oh the FBI
(can you trust it) They send another spy
(can you trust it) Oh the TSA
(can you trust it) Get your hands off me!

Can't be trusted! Can't be trusted!
Can't be trusted!
I don't trust no-one running my middle with a loaded gun

There's no judge, no jury
Patriot act took the liberty
Tapping out phones working down outdoor
Waiting on the people of the civil war
Yeah you! It is a police state!?

Can't be trusted! Can't be trusted!
Can't be trusted!
I don't trust no-one running my middle with a loaded gun

(can you trust it) Oh the CIA
(can you trust it) They wanna put me away
(can you trust it) Oh the FBI
(can you trust it) They send another spy
(can you trust it) Oh the TSA
(can you trust it) Get your hands off me!

Can't be trusted! Can't be trusted!
Can't be trusted!
I don't trust no-one running my middle with a loaded gun
