Take off your wig
Oh, let me stare
I'll keep un-cross-dressing you no matter where

Paint my nails
And when they're dry
Undo my hair, you're taking me out for a drive

Ouh, I can live without
You but I forgot
Cause you're so baby

Take me upstairs
Let's go get down
And if I don't know the tune I'll dance around
Cause you've got ways, you've got ways
You've got ways, you've got ways
You've got ways, I haven't seen on anyone

Ouh, I can live without
You but I forgot
Cause you're so baby, you
I can live without
You but I forgot
Cause you're so baby

You've got ways, I haven't seen on anyone
You've got ways, I haven't seen on anyone
You've got ways, I haven't seen on anyone

You've got ways, I haven't seen on anyone
