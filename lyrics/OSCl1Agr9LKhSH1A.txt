Can I come around this evening
Can I have something to believe in
Can I come around to see
If this heart inside of me is still beating
All this time
From the womb down to the frontline
I've been dealing with harassment and defeat
by a body that would cheat
on its own mind
Comes to question if I know
I'm right, I'm wrong
As long as there's a moment I feel
That I belong
Not to care about the loss
I came across
I will lay my head
Patch up where I bled
Have I told you about the dreams I kept chasing
about the times I kept wasting
about the temptations of sisters
and their addictiveness of numbness
and their holiness, I kept feasting
I don't mind
It'll all get lost by nightfall
And I will tell you all the truths that I heard
Through the grapevine and the thin walls
on our last call
Comes to question if I know
I'm right, I'm wrong
as long as there's a moment I feel
that I belong
Not to care about the loss
I came across
I will lay my head
Patch up where I bled
