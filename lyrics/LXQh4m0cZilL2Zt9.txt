Again from above the
Gate we stride at hand
Leading the charge
Into battle
Ravaging the lands

Shadows flow on the
Windrippled steps
Our black sparkling
Eyes
Celebrating death

Again from beyond
Our realm
We come forth
The moon is setting
On a grim world
Swallowing the sun
Shades gather on
The thundra
Ascend from the gods
Who once walked the
Earth

Before the might
Of our wrath
Hear the mighty sound
Of damnation
Of dust all lands will
Lay in a savage of chaos

Before the menace
Strike you all
By the blaze of
Glorious victories
Before batallions storm
You all
Hear the mighty sound
Of damnation

Again from above the
Gate we stride at hand
Leading the charge
Into battle
Ravaging the alnds
Shadows flow on
The windrippled steps
Our black eyes sparkle
Celebrating death
