I tremble
They're gonna eat me alive
If I stumble
They're gonna eat me alive

Can you hear my heart beating like a hammer?
Beating like a hammer
Help, I'm alive, my heart keeps beating like a hammer

Hard to be soft, tough to be tender
Come take my pulse, the pace is on a runaway train
Help, I'm alive, my heart keeps beating like a hammer

Beating like a hammer
Beating like a hammer
Beating like a hammer
If we're still alive, my regrets are few
If my life is mine, what shouldn't I do?

I get wherever I'm going
I get whatever I need
While my blood's still flowing and my heart's still

Beating like a hammer, beating like a hammer
Help, I'm alive, my heart keeps beating like a hammer
Hard to be soft, tough to be tender

Come take my pulse, the pace is on a runaway train
Help, I'm alive, my heart keeps beating like a hammer
Beating like a hammer

Beating like a hammer
Beating like a hammer
If we're still alive, my regrets are few

If my life is mine, what shouldn't I do?
I get wherever I'm going, I get whatever I need
While my blood's still flowing and my heart's still beating like a hammer
Beating like a hammer, beating like a hammer
Beating like a hammer

I tremble
They're gonna eat me alive
If I stumble
They're gonna eat me alive
Can they hear my heart beating like a hammer
Beating like a hammer
Beating like a hammer
Beating like a hammer
Help, I'm alive, my heart keeps beating like a hammer
