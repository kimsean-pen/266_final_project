- Shortline -
Rushing water
Unkeeps the colour
Turn the cheeks in shadow
At the shortline

Who am willing
Undress your heart string
Follow the thick thing boy
On your shortline

Let's run to shelter
From violence for us that haven't
Hold our tounges and feel our lungs
On the shortline
On the shortline

On the shortline

On the shortline

On the shortline

On the shortline

This is an amazing song- Love Lizette
