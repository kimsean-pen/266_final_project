Aurora Borealis, me for her for real it's lust
The love can't be heard above
Everyone acts like a day drinker (yeah)

We eat crickets
In the future
Just tastes like
"Far-from-home"
Drink Chicha
In the Jungle
That sounds great
Im kinda busy, could you call back again?
Im sure you'll come back
Til then I

Can't keep checking my phone (no)

We read the universe might be holographic
Traffic lights might reverse my love
Go ahead and traverse the winter (yeah)
