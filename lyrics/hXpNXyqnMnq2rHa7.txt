She's callin' too late now, it's 2 a.m
What's the word that I'm looking for? Inappropriate
You say she's just a friend, just a friend, but I know (I know)
I know (I know)

She's callin' you baby (baby)
Tryna hold your hand
Bitch only wants what she can't have (have)
You say she's just a friend, just a friend, but I know (I know)
I know (I know)

You send me pics that you're sending her
You tell me things that you told her first
You look at me like I'm the worst
That thing you do gets on my fucking nerves
Come at me in the morning with your excuses, excuses
(Excuses, excuses)

I know you lie, I can always tell
The last three nights haven't ended well
We talked too much and you gave me hell
I don't know why
Why I do this to myself
Come at me in the morning with your excuses, excuses
(Excuses excuses)

Never felt jealousy like I do right now
Wanna get through to you but I don't know how
Tries to wrap you 'round her little finger, oh no (oh no)
Hell no (hell no)

You send me pics that you're sending her
You tell me things that you told her first
You look at me like I'm the worst
That thing you do gets on my fucking nerves

I know you lie, I can always tell
The last three nights haven't ended well
We talked too much and you gave me hell
I don't know why
Why I do this to myself
When it comes to you and me I've got excuses, excuses
(Excuses excuses)

I swear I'm gonna cut her off
I'm sorry, I know I was wrong
I've never felt like this before

You say she's just a friend, just a friend, but I know
