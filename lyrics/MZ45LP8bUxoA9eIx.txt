Standing on the edge
Battle in my head, I'm dying to know
I'm dying to know
If I take this leap
To fail or succeed, I'm dying to know
I'm dying to know

This is it, I'm shaking
My body's aching, I lose my hold
I will let go
This is it, I'm falling
My wings need to grow, I lose my hold
I will let go

There's so many roads
Pitfalls filled with doubt, I'm dying to know
I'm dying to know
Grabbing what I need
Grip until it bleeds, I'm dying to know
I'm dying to know

This is it, I'm shaking
My body's aching, I lose my hold
I will let go
This is it, I'm falling
My wings need to grow, I lose my hold
I will let go

If I... if I take this, this leap
Will I be broken?
I'm dying to know

This is it, I'm shaking
My body's aching, I lose my hold
I will let go
(I lose my hold) This is it, I'm falling (I lose my hold)
My wings need to grow, I lose my hold
I will let go
I will let go
I will let go
