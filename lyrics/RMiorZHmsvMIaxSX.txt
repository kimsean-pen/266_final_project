The birds still sing outside these
These windows
Where we sat together
Like nothing ever happened here oh
The white house on the hill
And black clouds the weather
And the church spire, over the river
She still sits there
Warmin' the evening glow
But you don't care about
These scenes I treasure
About these wore swimmers
I know, I know
Seems everything around here
Stays like stone
Seems it's about time darling
About time we let this all go

Cause everything will start again anew
Cause everything just goes away my friend
And every king knows it to be true
And every kingdom must one day come to an end
And the sun vanished, may be long gone
And all these memories we've found
But she'll be here
When it's all done
When I buy this land beneath the ground
She knows everything that goes around
Comes, comes around here
She knows everything that stays here somehow
Guess we'd all begin

Everything will start again anew
Cause everything just goes away my friend
And every king knows it to be true
And every kingdom must one day come to an end
