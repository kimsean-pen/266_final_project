Forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who have trespassed against us
Give us this day our daily bread
Daily bread, daily bread

In cello et in terra fiat voluntas tua
Gloria Spiritui Sancto

What language do you speak if you speak at all?
Are you some kind of freak
Who lives to raise the ones who fall?
Hey, would you tell me why the cat fights the dog?
Do you go to the mosque or the synagogue?

And if our fates have all been wrapped around your finger
And if you wrote the script, then why the troublemakers?

How do you do?
How does it feel to be so high?
And are you happy?
Do you ever cry?
(I sometimes cry)

You've made mistakes
Well, that's okay 'cause we all have
But if I forgive yours
Will you forgive mine?

Hey, do you feel our pain and walk in our shoes?
Have you ever felt starved?
Or is your belly always full?
How many people die and hurt in your name?
Hey, does that make you proud?
Or does it bring you shame?

And if our fates have all been wrapped around your finger
And if you wrote the script, then why the troublemakers?

How do you do?
How does it feel to be so high?
And are you happy?
Do you ever cry?
(I sometimes cry)

You've made mistakes
Well, that's okay 'cause we all have
But if I forgive yours
Will you forgive mine?

Forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who have trespassed against us
Sameh Zoonoobee Allah
Give us this day our daily bread
Ya Allah (s'lach lanu) (daily bread)
Ya Allah (s'lach lanu) (daily bread)
Ya Allah

Forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who have trespassed against us
Sameh Zoonoobee Allah
Give us this day our daily bread
Mechilah (daily bread)
Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory
Amen!

How do you do?
How does it feel to be so high?
And are you happy?
Do you ever cry?
(I sometimes cry)

You've made mistakes
Well, that's okay 'cause we all have
But if I forgive yours
Will you forgive mine?
(Will you forgive mine?)

How do you do?
How does it feel to be so high?
And are you happy?
Do you ever cry?
(I sometimes cry)

You've made mistakes
And that's okay 'cause we all have
But if I forgive yours
Will you forgive mine?
