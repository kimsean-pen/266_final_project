She's only fifteen, she's the reason
The reason that I can't sleep
You say illegal
I say, legal's never been my scene, oh yeah
I try like hell but I'm out of control

All in the name of, all in the name of rock 'n' roll
All in the name of rock
All in the name of rock 'n' roll
All in the name of rock
For sex and sex I'd sell my soul
All in the name of, all in the name of rock

Pretty, pretty so innocent
She says you ain't seen nothing yet
Brings me a dirty, dirty magazine
There she was for all the world to see, oh yeah
I try like hell but I'm out of control

All in the name of, all in the name of rock 'n' roll
All in the name of rock
All in the name of rock 'n' roll
All in the name of rock
For sex and sex I'd sell my soul
All in the name of, all in the name of rock

Says to me, Daddy
Can I have some candy?
Wanna be your nasty
Anytime you want
You know you can have me

All in the name of, all in the name of rock 'n' roll
All in the name of rock
All in the name of rock 'n' roll
All in the name of rock

All in the name of rock 'n' roll
All in the name of rock
All in the name of rock 'n' roll
All in the name of rock
All in the name of, all in the name of rock
