Verse:
Work it
Girls, we gotta work it like we do
Turn a head or two

'Cause we're worth it
And I ain't gonna waste my time waiting on you
Gotta make your move

You had my number for
two or three days or more
If you're a real man, then you can't ignore
mmm, mmm this

Sometimes it's physical,
but I want supernatural
I ain't got wings but I'm ready to fall
I deserve it all

CHORUS:
Headturner, yeah
Soul burner
If you're gonna watch me walk,
then watch me walk

Headturner, yeah
Are you a slow learner?
Come and take my hand
'Cause I'll find another man

If you're gonna watch me walk,
then watch me walk.

Verse:
You gotta earn it
Nothing in life is free
You gotta bring your love to me, baby, baby, baby
Emotional (ooh, I got it)
Sexual (ooh, I got it)
Spiritual (God knows I got it)
What you want, baby I got it

CHORUS:
Headturner, yeah
Soul burner
If you're gonna watch me walk,
then watch me walk

Headturner, yeah
Are you a slow learner?
Come and take my hand
'Cause I'll find another man

If you're gonna watch me walk,
then watch me walk.

Bridge:
No one can love you like I love you
No one can do the things that I would to do you
I'd do something about it, if I were you
Or feel my heels as I'm walking over you

CHORUS: (x2)
Headturner, yeah
Soul burner
If you're gonna watch me walk,
then watch me walk

Headturner, yeah
Are you a slow learner?
Come and take my hand
'Cause I'll find another man

If you're gonna watch me walk,
then watch me walk.
