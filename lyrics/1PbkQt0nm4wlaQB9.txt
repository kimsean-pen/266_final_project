I won't be nervous when everybody around us
Says "God we don't deserve this" and begs before they accept our fate
I want the world but I'm not prepared to work for a change
I think I'd rather be dead

I'm not anti-social
I'm anti-bullshit
I'm not anti-social
I'm anti-bullshit

You're gonna follow like a freelance sucker of the next biggest trend
We're pissing into the wind, to be heard by the indifferent
Shit talker, you've double crossed your own
You're gonna suffer like a rat in the smoke

How the hell am I supposed to know
We're only human is a valid excuse
For why my mind's polluted
Do you want the truth or do you want to assume it?

I'm not anti-social
I'm anti-bullshit
I'm not anti-social
I'm anti-bullshit

So raise it up, up, up!
If you're sick of this fake smile politics
Up up if you're sick of this race we're running
What you living for if you can't even feel it?
What is living without letting go

How the hell am I supposed to know
We're only human is a valid excuse
For why my mind's polluted
Do you want the truth or do you want to assume it?

Serves you right, to justify the face that keeps you up at night
The mask you wear to cover it up and we can see it in your eyes
Serves you right, to justify the face that keeps you up at night
The mask you wear to cover it up and I can see it in your eyes

I'm sick of the sound
I'm sick of the hand we've been dealt
Sick from the drugs that they tell me to take
I'm sick of the drugs that we take to rebel
Sick of corruption in wealth
Sick of corruption itself
Sick of division in colour, religion
When we're all the same
(We're all the same, we're all the same, we're all the same)

I'm not anti-social
I'm anti-bullshit
I'm not anti-social
I'm anti-bullshit

Just leave it alone!
My head's about to explode!
So sick of the same sound syndrome!
Thank fuck for headphones!
