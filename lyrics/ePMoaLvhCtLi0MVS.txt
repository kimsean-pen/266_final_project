Sleep tight
I will come to your defense
Whatever road you're taking
Tonight
I know nothing's making sense
But I'll guard the room you wake in
Close your eyes
Follow the sound of my voice
My voice

'Cause I'm gonna sing
You are the boat I'm the ocean that rocks you to sleep
You're the balloon I'm the ballast attached to the string
If you're into deep
Or you climb too high
On this wild
This wild ride

Sleep tight
There are dreams you have not dreamed
And doors to worlds unopened
Don't fight
Some questions aren't worth answering
Some hearts that break aren't broken
Close your eyes
Follow the sound of my voice
My voice

'Cause I'm gonna sing
You are the boat I'm the ocean that rocks you to sleep
You're the balloon I'm the ballast attached to the string
If you're into deep
Or you climb too high
On this wild
This wild ride
This wild ride
Don't know what you'll find
On this wild
This wild ride
