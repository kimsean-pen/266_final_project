I'm with you always
You're ever on my mind
In a light to last a whole life through
Each way I turn
the sense of you surrounds
in every step I take
In all I do
Your thoughts your schemes
captivate my dreams
Everlasting, ever new

Sea returns to sea
And sky to sky
In a life of dream am I
When I'm with you

Deep in my heart
How the presence of you shines
In a light to last a whole life through
I recall the wonder of it all
Each dream of life I'll share with you

Sea returns to sea
And sky to sky
In a life of dream am I
When I'm with you

I'm with you always
You're ever on my mind
In a light to last a whole life through
The hand above
turns those leaves of love
All and all a timeless view
Each dream of life
Flung from paradise
Everlasting, ever new

Dream of Life
Dream Of Life
