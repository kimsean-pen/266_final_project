I remember that first night we met
Dancin' to the sound of clarinets
Dancin' cheek to cheek (Do-do-do-do-ah), oh, how sweet? (Do-do-do-do-ah)
You and me and this fantasy (Do-do-do-do-ah)
Oh, I remember our first night

I remember how we carried on (Do-do-do-do-ah)
On and on until the light of dawn (Do-do-do-do-ah)
From the very start (Do-do-do-do-ah), you stole my heart (Do-do-do-do-ah)
I knew right then we would never part (Do-do-do-do-ah)
Oh, I remember that first night

Remember that first night
Remember that first night
Remember that first night

I saw your lovelight through the candle's glow
Champagne was flowin', and so I let myself go
And when the night was over (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
We both looked around the room (Ooh, ooh)

Remember darling, chairs on the table (Ooh)
And only me and you (Remeber that first night)
I remember how we carried on (Do-do-do-do-ah)
On and on until the light of dawn (Do-do-do-do-ah)
And from the very start (Do-do-do-do-ah), you stole my heart (Do-do-do-do-ah)
I knew right then we would never part (Do-do-do-do-ah)
I remember that first night

Remember that first night
Remember that first night
Remember that first night

Walk me home in spring-time showers (Do-do-do-do-ah)
In the early morning hours (Do-do-do-do-ah)
You took me to my door (Do-do-do-do-ah), we were sure (Do-do-do-do-ah)
So we swore that forever more (Do-do-do-do-ah)

I'll remember our first night
Remember that first night
Remember that first night
Remember that first night
