Fast approaching Monsters, marching in a row
Grab what slips your mind and what your memory won't hold
Run, darling run. I'll stall them if I can
You'll escape and I'll be left rotting on the vine

Ah, ah, oh, oh
Ah, ah, oh, oh

Run, darling run. I'll stall them if I can
You'll escape and I'll be left rotting on the vine
Avert the childrens eyes, forget left untold
Don't look back to see the blood river in the road

Ah, ah, oh, oh
Ah, ah, oh, oh

Get revenge with my blood
River in the road
