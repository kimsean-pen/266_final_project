Remember the feelings
Remember the day
My stone heart was breaking
My love ran away
This moment I knew I would be someone else
My love turned around and I fell
Be my bad boy be my man
Be my weekend lover
But don't be my friend
You can be my Bad boy
But understand
That I don't need you in my life again
Would you be my bad boy be my man
Be my weekend lover
But don't be my friend
You can be my Bad boy
But understand
That I don't need you again

No I don't need you again
Bad Boy
You once made this promise
To stay by my side

But after some time

You just pushed me aside
You never thought that a
Girl could be strong
Now I'll show you

How to go on
Be my bad boy be my man

Be my weekend lover
But don't be my friend
You can be my Bad boy
But understand
That I don't need you in my life again
Won't you be my bad Boy
Be be my man
Be my weekend lover
But don't be my friend
You can be my Bad boy
But understand
That I don't need you again
No I don't need you again
