I went down to the bank just to get me my pay
I'm gonna get me, outta here
I got me some cash, I'm headed back to LA
I'm gonna get me, outta here

I'm sick of the man, 'cause the man is a thief
I'm kicking the plan, before the plan kicks me
I'm gonna get me getme outta here
I'm gonna get me getme outta here

I went down to the duke, ten times a day
I'm gonna getme outta here
Drink all night, and talking shit all day
I'm gonna get me outta here

I'm sick of the man, cause the man is a thief
I'm kicking the plan, before the plan kicks me
I'm gonna get me getme outta here
I'm gonna get me getme outta here

I don't mind how I live my life without the lucky guys
I ain't trying to keep in time so get off of my back
You won't hang your ruty sign on me

I went down to the bank just to get me my pay
Get me outta here
I'm gonna get me, get me outta here
I'm gonna get me, get me outta here
I'm gonna get me, get me outta here
