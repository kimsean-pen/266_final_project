they say love had played no part
cupid's arrow shot... blasted my head

"blast"

left no mark when it hit my heart

"tie the noose around the love caboose"

mirrored glass reflected at me
if i try i won't look too hard
eyes that greet meet tragedy

"Oh No!"

they say love had played no part.

"would you die for me?"
i do

"l love you"
you're just stoned.

"when looks alone turn you to stone"

you should have known better
leave me alone

"what's to miss when there's nothing to kiss"

every hiss will remind me of this
tie the noose around the love caboose
