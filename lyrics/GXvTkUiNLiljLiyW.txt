Nightsky, death awaits
I fall to die, wings of funeral
The curse of the old cemetery
That goes on, watch your hold
? curse of death
Satan've been tortureing my soul

Sorcery. I wish to die
Winds of death, winds of funeral
The curse of the old cemetary
A magic so pure, winds of funeral
? curse of death
Satan've been eating, tortureing my soul
