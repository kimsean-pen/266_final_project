Stopped over in Austin
First sold out show and a lone star beer
I kept thinking 'bout Oakland
There's too much change coming over the years
It's 10 o'clock in the morning
And I'm too stressed out, walking down South Congress
I don't know if I got this
I drank too much coffee and I didn't eat breakfast

Don't tell me how to sing this song
Don't tell me how to sing this song
'Cause I got everything it takes so
Don't try to tell me how to sing it and
Don't tell me how to sing this song

Another break from the road
And I'm stuck to a couch in New York City
Been trying to turn my thoughts into gold
'Cause I'm barely getting by on coffee and dumplings
Struck nude, I'm still inside
'Cause I wake three times in the middle of the night
I'm on edge, I'm off beat
I got no bounce in the bottom of my feet 'cause

Don't tell me how to sing this song
Don't tell me how to sing this song
'Cause I got everything it takes so
Don't try to tell me how to sing it and
Don't tell me how to sing this song

I'm not stopping at all
It's summer in the district and it's humid
I'm trying to get you to fall
In love with the music, it'll save us all

I got everything it takes so
Don't try to tell me how to sing it and
Don't tell me how to sing this song

Don't try, don't try to tell me how
Don't try to tell me how
