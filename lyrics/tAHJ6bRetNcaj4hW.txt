Coming in, coming in kill the radio silence break down in envy.
Giving up giving in to a feeling of violence there's hell to pay.
So lets light another match, stop
living in the past where nobody can hear me now
Blow the lock off the cage
watch the children come of age
when their parents have to take a bow

Nothing takes root in this barren soil
Nothing takes root in this barren soil
Maybe there's no one there at all.

Hold on, the worst is yet to come.
Save your life for higher guns.
Hold strong that everything you loved is gone.
Slow down, stop living in the shadow of a helicopter.

Line them up on the wall coming out with their hands up
give them all their share
Let it burn, let it fall, let the end of the world come.
Who's left to care?

Nothing takes true in this barren soil
Nothing takes true in this barren soil
Maybe there's no one there at all.

Hold on, the worst is yet to come.
Save your life for higher guns.
Hold strong that everything you loved is gone.
Slow down, stop living in the shadow of a helicopter.

Hold on, the worst is yet to come.
Save your life for higher guns.
Hold strong that everything you loved is gone.
Slow down, stop living in the shadow of a helicopter.

Stop living in the shadow of a helicopter.
