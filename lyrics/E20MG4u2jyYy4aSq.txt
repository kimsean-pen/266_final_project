"I had a lot of time to think in South Dakota, alright?
And you know what I realized?

I'm burned out."

(4, 3, 2, 1. . .) Edit

Don't eat glass, 'cause it's bad for your teeth (hold up)
In a Honda Civic with a hatchet in my sheath (hold up)
Skinny-ass Gary Paulsen readin' motherfucker
From the bottom-left corner of the state of South-Dakota (Ah!)

Red rover, red rover, goddamn (goddamn)
Send me over to be never seen again (where'd he go?)
Put the garbage in the fuckin' trashcan (trashcan?)
Up at dawn like a garbage man (goddamn)

Try my best, like canned spray-tan
In the middle of the winter time high-school dance
I know they give no chance
Goddamn, cause this-

What South Dakota sound like (yeah)
When it's done by me
This what South Dakota sound like (yeah)
In the middle of the street
This what South Dakota sound like (yeah yeah)
When it's done by me
This what South Dakota sound like (yeah, yeah, yeah)
When I'm gone, I hope you fuckers rest in-

Don't eat glass, 'cause it's bad for your teeth (hold up)
In a Honda Civic with a hatchet in my sheath (hold up)
'96 Civic, and you know that shit is green
Overflowin' all the seats, we blow the speakers till they squeak (Ay!)
("Ow, ow!")

You got the pool in the back, I got a pile of snow
You got a city to map, I memorize all the roads
You got the people to see, I got the people to know
You get the internet fast, I get the internet slow (But-)

I never let DSL keep me from teaching myself
All the skills that I wanted to know
I dropped out of school when I realized that college
Amounted to me being nothing but broke

I'm fucking it up, I'm fucking it up
How the fuck do I know when the fuckin is done?
Fe, fi, fo, and fum
All I smell is fuckin blood (cause this-)

What South Dakota sound like (yeah)
When it's done by me
This what South Dakota sound like (yeah)
In the middle of the street
This what South Dakota sound like (yeah yeah)
When it's done by me
This what South Dakota sound like (yeah, yeah, yeah)
When I'm gone, I hope you fuckers rest in peace

When I leave
Oh, when I leave
Oh, when I leave
Oh, when I leave
Oh, when I leave
Oh, when I leave
When I leave
I'm gonna take you home with me
