It's a little bit funny Lord, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money but, boy, if I did
I'd buy a big mansion where we both could live

If, if, if I was a sculpture Lord, honey, but then again, no
(Then again no, no)
Or a man who makes potions in a travelin' show
I know it's not much, I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
You gave me a gift Lord, and I'm gonna sing it for you

And you can tell everybody that this is your song
(This is your song)
It may be a quite, quite simple, but that's how it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
What I wrote down in words, words
How wonderful life is when you're in the world, world, world

If, if, (if), if I was on a rooftop
I'd kick off my shoes (kick off my shoes, kick my shoes off)
I'll write a few verses and then I get the blues
But the sun's been quite, quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you and people like me
I wanna, I wanna keep turnin' on

So excuse me for forgetting, but these things I do Lord
(These things I do Lord)
You see, you see I've forgotten if they're green or blue
Anyway the thing is, anyway the thing is, what I really mean
You are the sweetest eyes, you've got the sweetest eyes
The clearest eyes I've ever seen, I hope you go back

I hope you, I hope you go back and tell everybody
That this is your song (this is your song)
It may be quite, quite simple, but now that's how it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
But I wrote down in words Lord, words
I'm doin' beautiful, how wonderful it is when you're in the world, world, world, world

If, if, (if), if I sat upon a rooftop and kicked off my shoes, oh yeah
(Kick off my shoes, kick my shoes off)
I'll write a few verses and then I get the blues
But the sun's been quite, quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you, people like me
I wanna, wanna keep turnin' on, so excuse me, so excuse me

So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
(These things I do Lord)
You see, you see I've forgotten if they're green or blue, baby
And anyway the thing is, anyway the thing is, what I really mean
You are the sweetest eyes, the sweetest eyes
The sweetest eyes I've ever seen

I want you to go back, go back and and tell everybody
That Billy Paul's got a song (Billy Paul's got a song)
I'm, I'm gonna sit upon a, a rooftop and kick my shoes off
I'm gonna write it (write it), write it (write it), write it (write it)
I might come out with the Gospel (Gospel), the blues (blues)
The jazz (jazz), the rock and roll

I'm gonna, got to, got to write me a simple song for everybody
Because this is my song (this is my song)
It may be quite, quite simple but that's the way it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
What I wrote down in words, words
You come on back, you try to try again, try again

Tell everybody that Billy Paul's got a song
(Billy Paul's got a song)
It may be quite, quite simple but that's how it's done, baby
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
What I wrote down in words
Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it ooooh
Get back, get, got, oh no
