Running through a cold rain
As if the pace could keep you dry
The trap 'round my leg
Underneath this maze of pine

Clothes catching nails
Under the wire
Over the rail
As if they were always there for you
Where I belong is to the crows and carrion
Following a harpy song
So easily amused

Hell fires roar
Pulling the iron out of the ore
Fashioning a bastard sword to carve through
Frail worlds away covered in holes
Cleansed in flame
And if there is another way
I would choose the blade

Cutting through the fog bank
Underneath this diving bell
In this world
On this plane
I could never quite break the spell

Down
Down the stairs and up the steps again
My compendium of concrete
And they try to bend me to their will
And they're trying still
Darkness
Held in shadow of the ashen hill
Incorporeal bloodbath
Up the stairs and down the steps again
My compendium concrete
