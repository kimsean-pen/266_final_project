Oh, Father Time, grow me, change me
Age and shed the infant skin that was mine
Did you hear the wind howling, growling?
She knows something, she is older than I am

Progress is slow on this heart that I grow
I'll never learn next year

Beat to the drum, constant ocean vessels
Pulsing every second we die
Hands to the sun, burning, breathing
Glowing, healing sustenance of the sky

[?] and coal are better for the soul
But I believe in blood and lust

Oh, Father Time, rock me gently
I'm not ready, can't we stay for a while?
And listen in to the wind, melody of
Melancholy, she's a lullaby

Oh send me to sleep, and my mother, she will weep
And here's to the womb, and the human catacomb
I am not a child quite yet
And I am not a child quite yet
