Ever since I was young
Your word is the word that always won
Worry and wake the ones you love
A phone call I'd rather not receive
Please use my body while I sleep
My lungs are fresh and yours to keep
Kept clean and they will let you breathe

Is this the way a toy feels when its batteries run dry?
I am the watch you always wear but you forget to wind

Nobody plans to be half a world away at times like these
So I sat alone and waited out the night
The best part of what has happened was
The part I must have missed
So I'm asking you to shine it on and stick around
I'm not writing my goodbyes

I submit no excuse
If this is what I have to do
I owe you every day I wake
If I could I would shrink myself
Sink through your skin to your blood cells
Remove whatever makes you hurt
But I am too weak to be your cure

Is this the way a toy feels when its batteries run dry?
I am the watch you always wear but you forget to wind

Nobody plans to be half a world away at times like these
So I sat alone and waited out the night
The best part of what has happened was
The part I must have missed
So I'm asking you to shine it on and stick around
I'm not writing my goodbyes

I'm not letting you check out
You will beat this starting now
And you will always be around
I'm there to monitor your breathing
I will watch you while you're sleeping
I will keep you safe and sound

Does anybody remember back when you were very young?
Did you ever think that you would be this blessed?

Nobody plans to be half a world away at times like these
So I sat alone and waited out the night
The best part of what has happened was
The part I must have missed
So I'm asking you to shine it on and stick around
I'm not writing my goodbyes
