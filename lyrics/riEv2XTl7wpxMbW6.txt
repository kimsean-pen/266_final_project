You
I did it all for you.
I'll do my best to teach you to fly,
Please don't cry or say goodbye.
And I'll love you until the day I die.
Every night if that's alright.

Do you know who I am?
Do you know just what to do?
Now you're all that I have,
Is it fair to love me too?

You, it hurts because of you.
And I'll kiss you through a hazmat suit,
That's what I'll do if I have to.

You seem to know who I am, as though you know just what to do.
Now you're all that I have, is it fair to love me too?

And you, I did it all for you.
And I'll love you if I don't have to.
