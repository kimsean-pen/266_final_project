Uh, uh
Uh-uh, I'll push and pull it out
Breed it
More
I'll push and pull it out
It's too much for me to take

It's too much for me to take

I'll push and pull it up, wait
It's too much for me to take

It's too much for me to take, ok?

Workin' thick all week to push it
I don't feel my body leaning

Worst comes to worst
I'm feeling like a natural heathen
Superstitious blood [?]
Wait for you

Now all I can see
It's too much for me to take
It's too much for me to take
So where you goin'?
I'll push and pull it out, breed it
It's too much for me to take
It's too much for me to take
It's too much
