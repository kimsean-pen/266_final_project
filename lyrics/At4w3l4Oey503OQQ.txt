Shed me from the universe
Carry me from life
It's been beautiful to find this world
I'm sure it will when it ends
Step into the corners the darker colder corners fit best
Hang me from the ceilings little mobile constellation lights

When the war ends, yeah
We'll wonder what it was about
And when we grow old, yeah
We'll all wonder how we missed out

I've got soulful days to counter evil ways
Will we need it?
Will we need it?
When the war ends, yeah
We'll wonder what it was about
And when we grow old, yeah

No one will ever miss you so you know that you'll not be missed
Closer to the clouds than any people ever cared to see
Closer to the mountains, woods, oceans, and rivers and trees
Closer to the soulful days that counters all our evil ways

I've got soulful days to counter evil ways
Will we need it?
Will we need it?
When the war ends, yeah
We'll wonder what it was about
And when we grow old, yeah
We'll all wonder how we missed out

Bring you all along with me
Bring you all along with me
Bring you all along with me
Bring you all along with me
(When the war ends)
Bring you all along with me
(Yea)
Bring you all along with me
(We'll wonder what it was about)
Bring you all along with me
Bring you all along with me

I've got soulful days to counter evil ways
Will we need it?
Will we need it?
When the war ends, yeah
We'll wonder what it was about
And when we grow old, yeah
We'll all wonder how we missed out
