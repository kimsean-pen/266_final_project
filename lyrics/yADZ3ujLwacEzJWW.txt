You think my life's a dream.
I'm dreaming my life away.

You think my life's a dream.
I'm dreaming my life away.

Run, run in circles, barely running.

You think my life's a dream.
I'm dreaming my life away.

Barely running.

You think my life's a dream.
You think my life's a dream.
You think my life's a dream.
You think my life's a dream.
