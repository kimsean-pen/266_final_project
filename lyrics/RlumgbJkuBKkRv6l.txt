E-oh, e-oh

I'm underneath it all tonight
Out my window there's a million lights
A thousand hearts feeling just like me
Man, it feels like heaven out here in the street

I know I got a lot to learn
Breaking bottles only left me hurt
Played with fire till I burned myself
Don't you know that love will bring us somewhere else

So you take the left, I'll take the right
Under arrest, we're under fire, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't wanna go to heaven if I can't get in

You take the low, I'll take the high
You lock the gate, I hear the choir, yeah
Everybody got a problem with the way I live
I don't wanna go to heaven if I can't get in

Maybe I should take my time
And build this life by my own design
With no direction and it's in between
Everything I love and everything I need

So bring it back, all I want is understanding
To live my life the way that I planned it
Wouldn't change a thing
Man, it feels like heaven underneath my feet

So you take the left, I'll take the right
Under arrest, we're under fire, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't wanna go to heaven if I can't get in

You take the low, I'll take the high
You lock the gate, I hear the choir, yeah
Everybody got a problem with the way I live
I don't wanna go to heaven if I can't get in

So raise 'em up, raise 'em up
All I ever wanted was a shot at your love
I know and I believe
Everything we got is everything we need

Oh, love will get you higher
It set my heart on fire
I know it's what you see
Don't wanna go to heaven if they don't want me

'Cause I'm no criminal
I'm not your enemy
All I have is life
And I don't wanna go to heaven if I can't get in

So you take the left, I'll take the right
Under arrest, we're under fire, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't wanna go to heaven if I can't get in

You take the low, I'll take the high
You lock the gate, I hear the choir, yeah
Everybody got a problem with the way I live
I don't wanna go to heaven if I can't get in

Oh, oh
Raise 'em up, raise 'em up
Everything you wanted is inside your cup
Drink up, love will get you higher, oh, oh

Oh, I'm not your enemy
I never met no criminal
And in the end I'd do it again
I don't wanna go to heaven if I can't get in, oh

Oh, I'm not a criminal
Yeah, I'm no enemy
It's just the way I live
I don't wanna go to heaven if I can't get in
