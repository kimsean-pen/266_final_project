Out of the dim
The ships were closing in
Warriors...
Worrying...
Painted to kill
Kill and be killed
More than fight to survive
I'll give you strength to continue the fight
I'll feed you anger and soft little lies
Out of blood hatred grows
No place to hide
Kill and be killed
More than fight to survive
I'll be your shining star
I'll be your guide

Wounded and dying
The screaming of men
To death it will be
Enemies attacking again and again
So much pain
So many tears
Out of blood
Hatred grows

Beneath the flags
He watched them row in
Warriors...
Worrying...
Painted to kill

Seeking the courage to stand up and fight
The war drums were sounding from ships out of sight
My god is great
I've killed before
All is fair in love and war and peace

Mayhem...
The vultures awaited their feast
Eagerly...
Circling low...
Where dead takes the dead only our ancestors know
So much pain
So many tears
Out of blood
Hatred grows
