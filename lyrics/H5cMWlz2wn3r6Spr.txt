I think I did it again
I made you believe we're more than just friends

Oh baby
It might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious

'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Oh baby, baby

You see my problem is this
I'm dreaming away
Wishing that heroes, they truly exist
I cry, watching the days
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways

Oops!...I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Oh baby, baby

Oops!...You think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

Oops!...I did it again
to your heart, got lost in the game
Oh baby
Oops!...You think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

Oops!...I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Oh baby, baby

Oops!...You think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

Oops!...I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Oh baby, baby

Oops!...You think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent
