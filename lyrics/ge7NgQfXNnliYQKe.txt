I used to live out west in the collective

We used to live out west in the collective
Everybody got arrested cause nobody wanted sleep
I used to dish out verses on purpose
And if you wanted to purchase when you weren't as good as me
I don't know if that time is comin' to an end
I hope the band gets back together when it's over

Don't you go runnin' for the hills
You can't outrun it by yourself
By yourself

And when I call you up you barely answer
You think you got it all figured out
You act like you don't even remember
Oh you're all by yourself

Don't you go runnin' for the hills
You can't outrun it by yourself
By yourself
