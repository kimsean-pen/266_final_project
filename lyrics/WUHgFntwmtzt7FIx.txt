Do you remember?
The snow is falling
And I held you in my arms and we kiss
I think it was November
The very last time

We never said goodbye
And now I cry
On crystal night

Where do they take you?
Where have you gone?
I keep wishing and hoping and praying
But it's been so long
Since the very last time

We never said goodbye
And now I cry
On crystal night

I wanna know
Why you have to go
Are you still alive?
You still in my mind

On crystal night
Crystal night
Crystal night
Crystal night

Do you remember first time I so you
I look in to your eyes and thought
That you would be my sugar
Not in this life

We never say goodbye
Now you sent to die
On crystal night

So I'm leaving from this planet
If I not see you
I just wait until the day
That we could meet in heaven
Up in the sky

And then we never cry
Or have to said goodbye
No more crystal night

I wanna know
Why you have to go
I like you to tell
Our love never ends
But things just seem right
Crystal night
Crystal night
Crystal night
Crystal night
