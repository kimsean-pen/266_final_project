I told you once, I told you twice
Keep it up and they might come calling for ya
Take it up as good advice
You are all they want now that they've got everybody

Sometime if feels like we're just walking away

You're breaking hearts, you're breaking news
But it's alright coz summer days are numbered
And one by one, and two by four
Don't close the door when you're talking to a stranger

Sometimes it feels like we're just walking away
Sometimes it feels like we're just walking away
(We're walking out of step and walking out of the line
You're taking all the money, taking all the time)
Sometimes it feels like we're just walking away

Turn forever, forever
It's all that you had
But you lost it, you said
You lost it, you said, in your way

Sometimes it feels like we're just walking away
Sometimes it feels like we're just walking away
(We're walking out of step and walking out of the line
You're taking all the money, taking all the time)
Sometimes it feels like we're just walking away
(We're walking out of step and walking out of the line
You're taking all the money, taking all the time)
