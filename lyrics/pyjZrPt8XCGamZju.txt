Do you remember?

We were kings of the town,
Upside-downed (Oh no)
Warriors of the streets,
And we screamed out loud
Gonna take the world
All by ourselves
There was something
In the air (Oh no)
'Cause nothing was as
Big as the dreams we shared

Now what could compare?
You were my protection
Will you be there for me now?
I know we had our problems
But we always come back around
'Cause you're always my reflection
Will I see you in the crowd?
You were my protection
Now I hold my ground

Do you remember when
I gave you life?
(Oh no)
Do you remember when
We used to hide?
(Oh no)
Do you remember
We were so alive?
(Oh no)
Do you remember?
We were so damn wrong,
it was right
(Oh no)
Do you remember?

We would fight 'til the
Death just for fun
(Oh no)
Pretend you would
Lose so I think I've won
Yeah, we could be anyone

You were my protection
Will you be there for me now?
I know we had our problems
But we always come back around
'Cause you're always my reflection
Will I see you in the crowd?
You were my protection
Now I hold my ground

Do you remember when
I gave you life?
(Oh no)
Do you remember
When we used to hide?
(Oh no)
Do you remember we
Were so alive?
(Oh no)
Do you remember?
We were so damn wrong,
it was right
(Oh no)
Do you remember?

I still remember when
You gave me life
I still remember when
We used to hide
But our time together
Was the time of my life
Yeah, our time together
Was the time of my life
(Ooh)
(Oh no, oh no, oh no)

Do you remember?
Do you remember when
I gave you life?
(When I gave you life, oh no)
Do you remember when
We used to hide?
(Oh, when we used to hide, oh no)
Do you remember we
Were so alive?
(Woo ooh, oh no)
Do you remember? We were so damn wrong, it was right
(We were so damn wrong, it was right, oh no)
Do you remember?
