On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong
This is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song
To lead you on
I learned a lot today
Not sure if I'll get laid and
Not sure if I'll fail or pass
Kissed every girl in class
Everybody would waste it all
To have a summer that they could call
Memory that's full of fun
Fucked up when it's all done
On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong
This is gonna shock them
Nothin' to hold on to
We'll use this song
To lead you on
An' break the truth
With more bad news
We left a scar
Size extra large
Sip a drink of the alcohol
End up kneelin' in bathroom stalls
Eyes are red, my movements slow
Too high, got vertigo
He took a shit in the bathroom tub
An' fed the dog the brownie drugs
Tried hard to not get caught
He fucked the chick in a parkin' lot
On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong
This is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song
To lead you on
An' break the truth
With more bad news
We left a scar
Size extra large
Break a window and bust a wall
Makin' fun of your friend's Mom
Turn the music up way too loud
Charge the pizza to the house
Everybody would waste it all
To have a summer that they could call
Memory that's full of fun
Fucked up when it's all done
On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong
This is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song
To lead you on
And break the truth
With more bad news
We left a scar
Size extra large
