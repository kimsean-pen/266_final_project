Every time, i look in thé mirror
All these lines in my face getting clearer
The past in gone
And way back nahaha dust to gold
isn't That the way,
That everybody's got to do
is enough to pray?
I know
nobody knows
where it comes and where it goes
I know
Everybody sins
you've got to lose to know
how to win
All my life
is pulled to foreign pages
Every love from fools and from sages
you know it's true
And all thé feelings
Come back to you
Sing with me
Sing for thé wiyeuya
Sing for thé love
Sing for thé tear
Sing with me just for today
Maybe tomorrow, good love take you away
(...)
Sing with me
Sing for thé wiyeuya
Sing for thé love
Sing for thé tear
Sing with me just for today
Maybe tomorrow, good love take you away
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on
Dream until your dream come true
Dream on
Dream On Dream on Dream until your Dream until come true
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on
DREAM ON
DREAM ON
DREAM ON
HAAAAAAA A A A A A. A A A A A AAAAAA
Sing with me
Sing for thé wiyeuya
Sing for thé love
Sing for thé tear
Sing with me just for today
Maybe tomorrow, good love take you away
Sing with me
Sing for thé wiyeuya
Sing for thé love
Sing for thé tear
Sing with me just for today
Maybe tomorrow, good love take you away
