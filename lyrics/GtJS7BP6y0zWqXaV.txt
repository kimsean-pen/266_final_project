Finally feeling change
New life, new book with a fresh page
I know I shouldn't feel down
But every night these thoughts keep staying around

And my heart it breaks
Every time I wake up with a new case?
I know I shouldn't feel down
Every night these thoughts keep staying around

And I swear I've changed
Why do I even complain in the first place

or is it in my head?

If my feet are off the ground
My head is in the clouds
How hard can it be to breathe?
I saw myself for what [?]
Sometimes it's not enough
How hard can it be to breathe?
I've gotta find a way out

Or is it in my head?

I get closer, it brings me further
Or is it in my head?

If my feet are off the ground
My head is in the clouds
How hard can it be to breathe?
I saw myself for what [?]
Sometimes it's not enough
How hard can it be to breathe?
I've gotta find a way out
