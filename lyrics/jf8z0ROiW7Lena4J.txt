Oh I climbed a mountain
So I could see you coming
I dug a river to the sea
So you could sink into me
And I've got somewhere to go
But I won't go if you say you love me
But it's pretty obvious, she'll never love me

If all we shared means nothing
Then all my life is empty

And when I see you outside
I have to run inside and hide
We used to turn coal into stone
And stone into gold
Oh you didn't make it easy on me, baby

If all we shared means nothing
Then all my life is empty

How do I say goodbye to
Something I love so much
This boy I cradled in my heart
Closer than anything else
I know the Dutch build damns
Oh but this time I'm the guilty one

If all we shared means nothing
Then all my life is empty
