in times of great vexation
when one must choose between what's right and wrong
freedom so they say
amounts to the choices you have made
through all the arbitrary
rationale concerning liberty
freedom i must say
exists within unconditioned minds
reason has come of age
how can you be satisfied with things the way they are
when all that surrounds us now and so much more
remains inside the keeper's dark embrace?
the insatiable thirst for power has made
idols out of mortals gods into clay
soldiers into heroes children into slaves
all damned desires their hopes betrayed
who will suffer the laws that state can decide
your child's education unless you pay the price?
who will suffer their laws?
who will suffer their minds?
who will suffer their words?
who will suffer their designs?
