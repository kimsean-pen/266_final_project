(Verse)
I live so much inside my head
And all this feelings, all my fears
So what it's happening to me,
And the time is so, the time is so,
The time is so much that I can see.

And I hear your shines in the street,
But I couldn't go against my dreams
So if it's carelessness we need
Whatever doesn't mean so, doesn't mean so
Doesn't mean so much when it's just clean.

Sometimes I'm hanging by the flight
I'll follow these memories I share
I let my heart feel no regrets
I feel so careless in my head.
