Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
'Cause she's always gone too long anytime she goes away

Wonderin' this time where she's gone
Wonderin' if she's gonna stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home anytime she goes away

And I know I know I know I know I know
I know I know I know I know I know
I know I know I know I know I know
I know I know I know I know I know
I know I know I know I know I know

Hey, you're gonna leave your thing alone
'Cause ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home anytime she goes away

Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
