See the leaves how slow they tumble down
covering the green and yellow lawn
as proof of what has been and what will come
enjoying hazy lights of early dawn
it ain't good enough
good enough, good enough to try and not succeed (succeed)

Anger never dies
it's part of life
it's part of you
the end will cease the fire
and make us accept
we tend to lose

See the tears how slow they tumble down
covering believe in empty vows
as proof of what has been and what will be
alcohol puts us both to sleep
it ain't good enough
good enough, good enough to try and not succeed (succeed)

Anger never dies
it's part of life
it's part of you
the end will cease the fire
and make us accept
we tend to lose

Anger never dies
it's part of live
it's part of you
the end will cease the fire
and make us accept
we tend to lose
we tend to lose...
