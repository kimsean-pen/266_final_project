I still remember
Days you've forgotten
Now youre just acting
Like nothing ever happened

I poured my feelings
When I thought you felt it
Now nothing's changed
I really regret this

You're a mindwinder
You're a mindwinder

I still remember the time
When your eyes, they would shine
Your hand would reach out to mine
And now I am losing my mind
