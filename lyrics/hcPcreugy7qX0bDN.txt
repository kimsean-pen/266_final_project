Wrapped up in some powdered wool

I guess I'm losing touch.
Don't tell me this is dying
'cos I ain't changed that much.
The only sound is water drops
I wonder where the hell I am

Some kind of jam?
Cuckoo Cocoon have I come to, too soon for you?
There's nothing I can recognise
this is nowhere that I've known.
With no sign of life at all

I guess that I'm alone
And I feel so secure
that I know this can't be real
but I feel good.
Cuckoo cocoon have I come to, too soon for you?

I wonder if I'm a prisoner
locked in some Brooklyn jail
or some sort of Jonah
shut up inside the whale.
No - I'm still Rael
and I'm stuck in some kind of cave.
What could've saved me?
Cuckoo cocoon have I come to, too soon for you?
