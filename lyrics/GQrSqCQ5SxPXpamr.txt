phone rings at night
you calling me one more time
things will never change?

i let my guard down
ring finger heart
a new summer went

a conversation that can choke you out
it's something that's really going on
last chance to rolling around on the floor
it's something that's really going on
bet you never tought!

(the) right time to explain
(in the) past six years or ten
(you) inspired me a lot

hold me in your arms
sweet skin alive
honesty plays the game

always you turn away
for how long...
you turn your heart down as a cold stone

how long...
your heart is a cold stone

a conversation that can choke you out
it's something that's really going on
last chance to rolling around on the floor
it's something that's really going on
bet you never tought!
