I never believed in chance girl
I never believed it at all
And I never believed in providence
Or the writing on any wall

But now you stand before me
And everything is alright

I'm willing to give
To let you in
To the center of my life

I'm gonna take my chance
And live my dreams

'cause it can change in a heartbeat

Take me to the other side
Deep within your love and eyes
Is where I wanna be
Your serenity

Take me to a state of calm
Deep within your love and arms
Is where I wanna be
Your serenity

Now I know I was the blind man
A single-minded fool
When all I ever needed
Was right here with you

And now my fate has been decided
My destiny is yours
The -something- is us, is written in stars
Let the future run its course

I'm gonna take my chance
And live my dreams

'cause it can change in a heartbeat

Take me to the other side
Deep within your love and eyes
Is where I wanna be
Your serenity

Take me to a state of calm
Deep within your love and arms
Is where I wanna be
Your serenity

I'm gonna take my chance
And live my dreams

'cause it can change in a heartbeat

Take me to the other side
Deep within your love and eyes
Is where I wanna be
Your serenity

Take me to a state of calm
Deep within your love and arms
Is where I wanna be
Your serenity

(Your serenity)
I wanna be
Serenity
(your serenity)
