This one's for the bouncers
Big, big monkey man

Ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Them a-tell me, you huggin' up a big monkey man
Ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Them a-tell me, you huggin' up a big monkey man

I never saw you, I only heard of you
Huggin' up the big monket man
I never saw you, I only heard of you
Huggin' up the big monkey man

It's no lie, it's no lie
Them a-tell me, you huggin' up the big monkey man
It's no lie, it's no lie
Them a-tell me, you huggin' up the big monkey man

Now I know that, now I understand
You're turning a monkey man on me
Now I know that, now I understand
You're turning a monkey man

Ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Them a-tell me, you huggin' up the big monkey man
Ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Them a-tall me, you huggin' up the big monkey man

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la

I was on my way to bandury cross
Then I see a monkey man upon a white horse
With rings on he fingers, bells on him toes
Sing a little song, wherever he be
Cause he's a monkey, cause he's a monkey
Cause he's a weedy-weedy-tweedy-weedy monkey man

Ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Never should you huggin' up the big monkey man
Ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Never should you huggin' up the big monkey man
