Now don't look away when you speak to me
I wish you'd care the way I still do
But you don't feel anymore
All my wishes gone away

From my eyes, lies
From my head, decay
From my grave, all my wishes gone away

I want to feel again
And live another day
I want to bleed the pain
And wash away the poison from my veins

You're inside my head, so speak to me
You're telling me I care what you do
I can't go on anymore
Make this feeling go away

From my eyes, lies
From my head, decay
From my grave, all my wishes gone away

I want to feel again
And live another day
I want to bleed the pain
And wash away the poison from my veins

I'm not gonna lie
I'll just tell you anything
Showing you how I feel
Now I'm sharing my life with you
Because nothing seems to be real
It goes on and on and on

All my wishes gone away

I want to feel again
And live another day
I want to bleed the pain
And wash away the poison
I want to feel again
And live another day
I want to bleed the pain
And wash away the poison from my veins
