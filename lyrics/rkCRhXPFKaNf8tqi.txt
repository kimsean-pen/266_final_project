Bring in the Night
Wrapped in Twilight
We can only Care
If we Cull...

From Nowhere to Nothing
From Nothing to Nowhere

The Body has poisoned
The Light of The Truth

The Runes of Dead Men
The Runes of Dead Loves
The Runes of Dead Dreams
The Runes of Dead Thoughts
The Runes of Dead Memories
The Runes of Past Lives
The Runes of Past Lies
Laying Old Ghosts
And the Slaying of Time.
