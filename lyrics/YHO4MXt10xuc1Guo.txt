It's always the same, tears for a time we can never regain
As life drifts away, we search for the reasons we can't make it stay
We walk in a shadowland, turning to dust, blown away in the wind
One last soul to save that hangs from a thread off the end of a dream!

But you jumped the great divide
So we'll meet you on the other side!

It's always the same, mourn for a life we can never reclaim
As time drifts away, we search for the reasons we can't make it stay
Alone in a shadowland, turning to dust, blown away like the sand
One last soul to save that hangs off a dream at the end of a thread!

But you jumped the great divide
So we'll meet you on the other side
We'll jump the great divide
And you'll greet us on the other side!

On the other side!

On the other side!

But you jumped the great divide
So we'll meet you on the other side
We'll jump the great divide
And you'll greet us on the other side!

On the other side!

On the other side!

We'll jump the great divide!
