One by one
Rooted from a place of intolerance
I won't cater to a coward
That hides behind a fraternity
Just so he can feel empowered

Institutions supporting murder
No, I won't support it
But the pressure
I feel the pressure to be like you

Forced into a life of repentance
Searching out for a cure
Made to believe that acceptance
Is all that were looking for
Is what we need

Oblivions Peak

But in the end
When it's your turn to be judged
You'll get what you fucking deserve
You son of a bitch
