Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Miami, south beach bringing the heat
Can y'all feel that, can y'all feel that
Check it out

Here I am in the place where I 'com let go
But Miami the place and the sun set low
Everyday like a Mardi gras everybody party all day
No work all play, okay
So we sip a little something leave the rest to spill
Me and Charlie at the bar running up a high bill
Nutin' less than ill when we dress to kill
Every time the ladies pass they be like, hi Will

Y'all feel me all ages and races
Real sweet faces every different nation
Spanish, Asian, Indian, Jamaican
Black, White, Cuban or Asian
I only came for 2 days of playing
But every time I come I always wind up staying
This the type of town I could spend a few days in
Miami the city that keeps the roof blazing

Party in the city where the heat is on
All night on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami and Bienvenido a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm going to Miami, welcome to Miami

Yo I heard the rain storms ain't nutin' to mess wit
But I cant feel a drip on the strip, its a trip
Ladies half dressed, fully equipped and they be screamin' out
Will we loved your last hit
So I'm thinking I'm a scoop me something hot
In this salsa Merengue melting pot
Hottest club in the city and its right on the beach
Temperature, get to ya' its about to reach

500 degrees in the Carribean seas
With the hot mommies screaming ayy papi
Every time I come to town they be spotting me
In the drop Bentley ain't no stoppin' me
So cash in your dough and flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound anywhere you go
Yo ain't no city in the world like this, and if you ask how I know
I gotsta plead the 5th, Miami

Party in the city where the heat is on
All night on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami and Bienvenido a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm going to Miami, welcome to Miami

Don't get me wrong Charlotte town got it going on
And New York is the city that we know don't sleep
And we all know that L.A. and Philly stay jiggy, but on the snake
Miami bringing heat for real, y'all don't understand
I never seen so many Dominican women with cinnamon tans
Mira, this is plan, take a walk on the beach
Draw a heart in the sand give me your hand

Damn you look sexy, lets go to Yacth in the west keys
Ride my Jet Skis lounge under the palm trees
'Cause you gotta have cheese for the summer house
Piece on south beach
Water so clear you can see to the bottom
100, 000 dollar cars, everybody got 'em
Ain't no place in a club to see sly
Stallon, Miami, my second home, Miami

Party in the city where the heat is on
All night on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami and Bienvenido a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm going to Miami, welcome to Miami
