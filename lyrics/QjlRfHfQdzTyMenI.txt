Glowing hearts truly glow as marrow cooks and boils through wire thin fractures
tensed by plangent torridity.
Charred bodies marred in undersized beds,
reaching for their mothers in vacuous pain.
Eyes shine, wax and wane.
Cherub arms snap as laden boughs in the heat.
Forty years of unbending faith unwinding.
Stagger in the wondrous smell of burning hair.
Gas escapes from withering cavities.
Nerves howl and ache in such sweet melody.
Inhale ash. Exhale lung fiber.
Eyes shine, wax and wane.
Cherub arms snap as laden boughs in the heat.
Forty years of unbending faith unwinding.
Stagger in the wondrous smell of burning hair.
God bless.
