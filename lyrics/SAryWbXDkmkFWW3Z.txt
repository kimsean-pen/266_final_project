There's this one guy
There's no one like him in all the world
Because, you can always see
Those girls down on their knees
In those dark sweaty rooms
Planning out his thoughts

He's waiting for just the right
One by one as they walk right through the door
They keep on coming back, I guess that they just want more
He has fun, fun, fun, and you might call him a whore
But just look where he's at because he is the one that scores

I saw my friend there out on the field today
I asked him where he's going, he said all the way

Now one by one as they walk right through the door
They keep on coming back, I guess that they just want more
He has fun, fun, fun, and you might call him a whore
But just look where he's at because he is the one that scores
