Found myself in the darkness
Can't break down if you're heartless
See me shine like the moonlight
I'd love to get lost with you tonight

Baby, my heart's been haunted
Ghosts living in it even though I don't want 'em
Try to get 'em out but they're still calling
So I drown 'em with a message in a bottle
But you take me away from the pain
You're warmer than the blood in my veins
Wonder why it always seems to rain
When I can't figure out anything to say

Found myself in the darkness
Can't break down if you're heartless
See me shine like the moonlight
I'd love to get lost with you tonight

Crossing a bridge over water
Tried to escape, I got caught up
Hop in the range, roll the windows up
Like lines on a plate, I won't be here long
If something don't change
If something don't change
If something don't change
But I think you might be one I need

Found myself in the darkness
Can't break down if you're heartless
See me shine like the moonlight
I'd love to get lost with you tonight
