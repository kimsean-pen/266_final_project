Can you hear me?
Am I speaking clearly?
Are you star-struck or just made of stone?
Do you need a savior?
Some bad behavior?
Or you can cash it all in, I suppose

Because you're in deep, resisting repeats
Face forward and don't come unhinged
I've got the actors and all these bastards
That took all the fun out of reach and revenge

Don't be so quick to judge
We're having fun above
I think I've had enough
Time to raise the dead
It's all subliminal, supernatural
I might be mental but I've still got my cred
So welcome to the party, won't you please come inside?
We're having (?) teeth and the world's carrying knives
You enter at your own risk, so don't be surprised
Welcome to the darkside

Spare me your sorrow, there's no tomorrow
That's an empty promise at best
I tried to play nice, you were baptized in ice
So don't tell me you're just depressed

Don't be so quick to judge
We're having fun above
I think I've had enough
Time to raise the dead
It's all subliminal, supernatural
I might be mental but I've still got my cred
So welcome to the party, won't you please come inside?
We're having (?) teeth and the world's carrying knives
You enter at your own risk, so don't be surprised
Welcome to the darkside

Your equilibrium has been spun all around
And everything you know turned upside down
The symptoms are contagious so please be advised
So welcome to the darkside

Don't be so quick to judge
We're having fun above
I think I've had enough
Time to raise the dead!
It's all subliminal, supernatural
I might be mental but I've still got my cred
So welcome to the party, won't you please come inside?
We're having (?) teeth and the world's carrying knives
You enter at your own risk, so don't be surprised
Welcome to the darkside

Your equilibrium has been spun all around
And everything you know turned upside down
The symptoms are contagious so please be advised
So welcome to the darkside (darkside, darkside)
Welcome to the darkside (darkside, darkside)
Welcome to the darkside (darkside, darkside)
So welcome to the darkside (darkside, darkside)
So welcome to the darkside
