You let the fire out, and it's right in front of me
You let the fire out, and it's right in front of me

You stood tall the fire began to let out,
I trusted you'd refrain and keep closed your mouth

You let the fire out, and it's right in front of me
You let the fire out, and it's right in front of me

Words crashing through the flames smoke spreading far
And I thought we'd remain free from it's harm

You let the fire out, and it's right in front of me
You let the fire out, and it's right in front of me

Will we burn
Will we burn
From the fire will we learn,
To be mindful and keep away from the words that ignite the flame
Our words will ignite the flame

You let the fire out, and it's right in front of me
You let the fire out, and it's right in front of me
You let the fire out, and it's right in front of me
You let the fire out, and it's right in front of me
Right in front of me
Face it don't turn around, there's no running from the heat
