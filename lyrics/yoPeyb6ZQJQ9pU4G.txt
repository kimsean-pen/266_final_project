Meet me at the turnaround
Stop your car and look around
There I will be waiting
Forget for once how everything
Fades...
It fades away
I'll never get over what we said.
It lingers
In my head
I'll always remember what we knew
One hundred
Percent to be true
To be right
To be real
Set in stone and cast in steel
Made a pact
Eye to eye
Cross your heart and hope to die
Can you see the end of things
Can you see it happening
Feel the ashes on the wind
Don't you hate how everything
Falls...
Just falls away
I'll never get over what we said
It lingers
In my head
I'll always remember what we knew
One hundred
Percent to be true
To be right
To be real
Set in stone and cast in steel
Made a pact
Eye to eye
Cross your heart and hope to die
It lingers in my head...
I'll always remember what we knew
One hundred percent to be true
Set in stone and cast in steel
To be right and to be real
Set in stone and cast in steel
