Our destination is nowhere
Our feelings are destroyed
We've got nothing at all
This is life in the fall
We keep searching for the positive
We're using everything
We got nothing at all
This is life in the fall

Are you receiving... Are you receiving... Are you receiving

When you're watching TV...? tweaty? lunacy
We'll treat your heads with our ideas of space
We're like a beam to infinity
We'll let you use your? mind?
Don't you see what we mean
I'm sure you'll understand... yeah

Are you receiving... Are you receiving... Are you receiving

There's some survival here
It's so boring out there
To find a group control
Cause they're frightened of your soul
But my motivation... shuffled admiration
? to say it's getting subtle

This is an order from the United Police Force of Great Britain
The minds of the young people today are being infiltrated by the
so-called "beat generation"
These people's identification are on file
We have orders from the new government to detain these people
immediately
These people must be detained immediately
These people must be detained immediately
Ha Ha Ha

Are you receiving... Are you receiving... Are you
receiving... receiving... receiving... receiving
Are you receiving... Are you receiving... Are you
receiving... receiving... receiving... receiving
