There's something strange about the way
The tap-water tastes
Making speeches for the walls
Gets harder with every phrase

I woke up and everyone had gone
I woke up when the sun was setting
I woke up and you were gone away

On any given day
We might fall apart
We might fall apart
On any minute now
We might fall apart
Just like a house of cards

There's something strange about the way
The horizon glows
We'll lie down on the road
And the cars drive inches from our toes

I woke up and everyone had gone
I woke up when the sun was setting
I woke up and you were gone away

On any given day
We might fall apart
We might fall apart
On any minute now
We might fall apart
Just like a house of cards

Maybe it's the chloroform kicking in
The chloroform is kicking in
Or maybe we've given in

Maybe it's the chloroform kicking in
The chloroform is kicking in
Or maybe we've given in

On any given day
We might fall apart
We might fall apart
On any minute now
We might fall apart
Just like a house of cards

Just like a house of cards
Just like a house of cards
Just like a house of cards
