Here is my story, I've got my type
Tattoos and skinny jeans
Black boots and piercings
A public enemy

Not Cinderella, still got my shoes
I like the animal
The supernatural
Maybe I'm crazy but

If you were Dracula (Hey)
I'd be letting you take that bite
Hot and hazardous (Hey)
Like playing with dynamite

Yeah, I want Dracula (Hey)
Forever be young and wild
Dark and dangerous (Hey)
I love, I love the tragically beautiful

I am a night owl, I come alive
I'll make the sun go down
So I can see you out
Straight to the underground

I like the broken, imperfect rules
That's why you're wonderful
It's undeniable
I might be crazy but

If you were Dracula (Hey)
I'd be letting you take that bite
Hot and hazardous (Hey)
Like playing with dynamite

Yeah, I want Dracula (Hey)
Forever be young and wild
Dark and dangerous (Hey)
I love, I love the tragically beautiful

Only one kiss, only one
Only one kiss, you'll be k-k-k-k-killing me
Only one kiss, only one
Only one kiss, you'll be k-k-k-k-killing me
Hey, hey

If you were Dracula (Hey)
I'd be letting you take that bite
Hot and hazardous (Hey)
Like playing with dynamite

Yeah, I want Dracula (Hey)
Forever be young and wild
Dark and dangerous (Hey)
I love, I love the tragically beautiful
