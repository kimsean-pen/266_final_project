Call of the Sea
We hail to our Gods
Men of North
We're leaving from the shores

No storm is too wild
No ocean too deep
We are the riders
Riders on the Wind

Land of Fjords
The home of our hearts
Came and pride
Raid and plunder overseas

No land is too far
No wall is too big
We are the riders
Riders on the Wind

Riders on the Wind
[Riders on the Wind
Riders on the Wind]
Riders on the Wind
[Riders on the Wind
Riders on the Wind]

Call to arms
We fear no enemies
Valhalla
Our fallen heroes feast

No storm is too wild
No ocean too deep
We are the riders
Riders on the Wind

Axe and sword
Our weapons shining bright
Spears and shield
Pagans come for you tonight

No coast is too far
No wave is too big
We are the riders
Riders on the Wind

Riders on the Wind
[Riders on the Wind
Riders on the Wind]
Riders on the Wind
[Riders on the Wind
Riders on the Wind]

[Three Norns behold us
The weavers of fate
Sisters of Nafri
The father of the night]
Riders on the Wind

{Three Norns behold us
The weavers of fate
