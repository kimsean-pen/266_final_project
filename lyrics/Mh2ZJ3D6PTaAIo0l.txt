And we believed her then, oh
And we believed her then, oh
And we believed her then, oh
And we believed her then, oh

And now outside you see the waves in her eyes
And I, I won't mind what you decide to swear by
And now outside, you see the waves in her eyes
And I, and I won't mind what you decide to swear by

And now outside I see your eyes meet the sky
And I, I don't mind what you decide to swear by
And now outside, I see your eyes meet the sky
And I, I won't lie, I kept you here tonight

And I believed her then, oh
And I believed her then, oh
And I believed her then, oh
And I believed her then, oh
