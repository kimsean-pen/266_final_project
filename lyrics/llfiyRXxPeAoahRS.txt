Hey you
With the hand-me-downs
Ripped up shoes and the Buster Browns
No tattoos, you don't stand out
It's all about the Lincolns in your bank account

What does it matter?
What does it matter?
What does it matter?
What does it matter?

High School kids do you got enough
Of all those silly monkeys who think they're tough
And teen queen babies who whine and whine
About their brand new car that works just fine

What does it matter?
It doen't matter
What does it matter?

What does it matter?
It doesn't matter
What does it matter?

So what?
Look what we do got
Hey kid!
What do we got?
Not a lot
So what?

What ever happened to my radio?
It must have happened a long time ago
Disc jockey dudes really make the scene
But did you spend a lot of money on those cool white jeans?

What does it matter?
It doen't matter
What does this matter?
Underwater
What does it matter?
It doesn't matter
What does this matter?

Hey kid!
What do we got?
Not a lot
So what?
Look what we do got
Hey kid!
What do we got?
Not a lot
So what?

When all those people
Try to hold us down
With what they got
I said, hey kids
What do we got?
Not a lot
So what?

You don't got nothing
You got nothing to lose
So what?
I'll tell you something
It's gonna be alright
