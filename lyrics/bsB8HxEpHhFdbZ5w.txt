I was running out in the cold light
Wondering where to go
To run away
Without you
All my fear is coming home
Handing scripts out for the show
You can't be me
I will become you, tonight

I was wandering under black skies
Clutching at what is mine
No control
Left to lose
When I thought that it wouldn't phase me
But i'm running like a child
I feel so guilty
I'll make it up to you tonight

Creatures I've been dreaming are coming down
They're changing my future
Visions I had buried underground
Return as our abusers

I was breaking out of my own skin
Choking upon release
I'm in no state
To judge you
Scratching itches best left alone
Chasing memories I used to own
I can't wait
Till this is over tonight

Creatures I've been dreaming are coming down
They're changing my future
Visions I had buried underground
Return as our abusers

All inside the voluntary
She and I were one
By design the same reaction
They did this, I've gone and found there's one

Well the nightmares I've been having have arrived
They're changing my future
Signs of my creation at my door
How could you do this to her?
