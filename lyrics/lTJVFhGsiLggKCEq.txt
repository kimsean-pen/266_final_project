(?)'s friends ask me why i look so down
why come they haven't seen me around town

cause i let him get to me but he don't let me get to him
i let him get to me, he don't let me get to him
i let him get to me but he don't let me get to him
i let him get to me, he don't let me get to him

i see him walking around so cool
and i am feeling like such a fool

cause i let him get to me but he don't let me get to him
i let him get to me he don't let me get to him
i let him get to me but he don't let me get to him
i let him get to me he don't let me get to him

i think about why i feel this way
i think about it most every day
i try to change the way i feel about you
but when i try i see that i'm not being true

cause i let him get to me but he don't let me get to him
i let him get to me but he don't let me get to him
i let him get to me but he don't let me get to him
i let him get to me he don't let me get to him
