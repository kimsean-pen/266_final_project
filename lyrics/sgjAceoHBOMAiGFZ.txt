It's the way you look tonight
And I wanna keep you by my side forever
It's the way you pick me up
Not just once or twice
But every time I fall
And I know beyond a shadow of a doubt
I'll be here 'till the river's dry
Our love will never drought

So take me to the chapel and wear my mother's ring
Follow me when I'm wandering and teach me how to lead
Keep me grounded, keep me still
I swear I choose forever
Love you true, I will

And in magnolia white
You'll be standing there a vision fair, my beating heart's delight
And as I'm watching you
Sweeping down the aisle my precious bride I'm gonna say "I do"

So take me to the chapel and wear my mother's ring
Follow me when I'm wandering and teach me how to lead
Keep me grounded, keep me still
I swear I choose forever
Love you true, I will

And the tides, they will rise
But I'll be true
I will swim the seas for you
And the darkest depths of blue
I'll run to you [?]
To swim the seas for me

So take me to the chapel and I'll wear your mother's ring
I'll follow you when you're wandering and teach you how to lead
Keep you grounded, keep me still
It's you I choose forever
Love you true, I will
Oh, It's you I choose forever
Love you true, I will
