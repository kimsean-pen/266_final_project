Athene
Shes the woman of war
She gives us the reasons
Reasons worth fighting for

Athene
She offers protection
She taught me how to make
Make my life's reflection

How i yearn for her wisdom
I look in every face
The grey eyes, the gentle kiss
I look for the safe place

Athene
Not perfect but still strong
Warring with her own love
Singing a woman's song

Athene
With her hand she could give
Through the battles of her life
She's shown me how to live

How i yearn for her wisdom
I look in every face
The grey eyes, the gentle kiss
I look for the safe place
