Oh, well look what we have here boys, everybody give a warm welcome to Johnny
Haha, what do you say we show Johnny a thing or two about what it's like to die?

How could this really have happened?
One second life was looking up, the next I'm on my way down
I thought my story had ended
But if it is hell where I'm trapped then I will seek my revenge

I've come for blood, blood, blood
And I'm not leaving till I have your heart
You're going to pay for all that you have done, done, done
I'll feel alive when I have blood, your blood (Blood, your blood)
Because revenge is all I haven't lost

You thought I was through?
You may have killed me but now I'll come for you
You thought I was through?
Well, that was far from your first mistake

I have a twisted mind and I have seen your fate
You think the end is close for you when really, you're fucking late
Your reign is over, there's no forgiveness
There's no forgiveness for all that you've done

I've come for blood, blood, blood
And I'm not leaving till I have your heart
You're going to pay for all that you have done, done, done
I'll feel alive when I have blood, your blood (Blood, your blood)

Because revenge is all I haven't lost
You've taken everything I've ever loved
So give me blood, blood, blood
I'll feel alive when I have blood, your blood (Blood, your blood)

I want it all, I want it all

See the way your blood spills on the ground?
But then before my eyes, he turned into a man
I've been fooled again, I've been fooled again
You are just a slave

You've dug your bed, deep inside of your grave
Now slave, you will sleep for eternity, for eternity

I've come for blood, blood, blood
And I'm not leaving till I have your heart
You're going to pay for all that you have done, done, done
I'll feel alive when I have blood, your blood (Blood, your blood)

Because revenge is all I haven't lost
You've taken everything I've ever loved
So give me blood, blood, blood
I'll feel alive when I have blood, your blood (Blood, your blood)

I want it all
