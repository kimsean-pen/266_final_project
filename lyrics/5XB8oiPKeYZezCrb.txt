Hold on
I've been gone too long, I think it's time I get back
Put a nigga in a box like a Big Mac
Man, they love me in the hood
They say: Big Whack, Big Whack
Big Whack, Big Whack
What's up?
Why you wanna see me down?
You should give up
I've been calling on my niggas just to lift up
Think I want me a new Lamb', the doors
Lift up, lift up, lift up, lift up

I'm gonna win regardless
Swear that I work the hardest
Most of y'all dudes are garbage
I'm a starving artist
I'm so sorry, darling
Don't mean to be rude
Stepping on your shoes
I just made the moves
I ain't even dead yet
Why they want me dead?
You just made your bed
Heard you talking to the feds
My feet don't touch the floor, mmm
Hit 'em with the new flow
Love the way my skin glow, yeah

Hold on
I've been gone too long, I think it's time I get back
Put a nigga in a box like a Big Mac
Man, they love me in the hood
They say: Big Whack, Big Whack
Big Whack, Big Whack
What's up?
Why you wanna see me down?
You should give up
I've been calling on my niggas just to lift up
Think I want me a new Lamb', the doors
Lift up, lift up, lift up, lift up

I don't see no opponent, yeah
This my time, my moment, yeah
Mama told me, just own it
If she want, she own it, yeah
Need her necklace frozen, mmm
Need her wallet swollen, uh
I know I been chosen
Got the golden token, yeah, yeah
I was raised in the gutter, yeah, yeah
I would die for my brother, yeah, yeah
I put that all on my mother, yeah, yeah
I won't go out like no sucker, yeah

Hold on
I've been gone too long, I think it's time I get back
Put a nigga in a box like a Big Mac
Man, they love me in the hood
They say: Big Whack, Big Whack
Big Whack, Big Whack
What's up?
Why you wanna see me down?
You should give up
I've been calling on my niggas just to lift up
Think I want me a new Lamb', the doors
Lift up, lift up, lift up, lift up

Hold on
I've been gone too long, I think it's time I get back
Put a nigga in a box like a Big Mac
Man, they love me in the hood
They say: Big Whack, Big Whack
Big Whack, Big Whack
What's up?
Why you wanna see me down?
You should give up
I've been calling on my niggas just to lift up
Think I want me a new Lamb', the doors
