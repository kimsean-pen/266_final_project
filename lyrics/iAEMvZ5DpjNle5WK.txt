Sick of you playing on that Xbox thing
You're never gonna get me with the diamond ring
Look at you so confused
No you don't have a clue
I bet you think you got me good

So tell me when's the last time you changed that shirt?
Instead of sitting here you should be going to work
Like I do for you, you're down and it's not cool
Time for me to move on
Nothing I could do so

Leave, you're not the boy you said you'd be
And it's so hard for me to breathe
How can I love you boy if you're going nowhere?
We're going nowhere
Bye, don't have the strength to see you cry
I'm tired of asking myself why
How can I love you boy if you're going nowhere?
We're going nowhere

How am I supposed to look at you like that?
When all you ever really do is hold me back
No more for sure
It's you who's out the door
I think I should press delete and clear my history

I got my ambitions, yes I dream so big
While I'm ticking boxes you'll be counting sheep
So you, do you and I'll be me
Time for me to move on
Nothing left to see so

Leave, you're not the boy you said you'd be
And it's so hard for me to read
How can I love you boy if you're going nowhere?
We're going nowhere
Bye, don't have the strength to see you cry
I'm tired of asking myself why
How can I love you boy if you're going nowhere
We're going nowhere

I'm sick of dragging you up
All you do is pull me down
I wish you good luck, as of now I ain't around
See, I can recollect every other rain fall
But I stayed, you won't change, that's my only downfall
Little boy boy pull your trousers up, I ain't bruv
Ha, I deserve some respect (yeah)
Are you a man or a mouse?
You don't provide or protect
Stay stuck in the mud, I'll be on to the next

Leave, you're not the boy you said you'd be
And it's so hard for me to breathe
How can I love you boy if you're going nowhere?
We're going nowhere
Bye, don't have the strength to see you cry
I'm tired of asking myself why
How can I love you boy if you're going nowhere?
We're going nowhere

Bye, yeah
Cry, I'm sick and tired of asking why
You're going nowhere
We're going nowhere
