You are like broken ribs, you are scratched up skin
You sleep softly tonight, don't know the pain I'm in
You are a starry ache, can't decide if you're cruel
But it's better to be burnt by the sun than to be chased by wolves

I will skip to you slick with love til you've had enough
Stroll in my patchwork skin til the love I'm in rests inside you too
Don't make me blue, blue, blue
Don't make me blue, blue, blue

Drunk on the evening sun, sleeping in the blue
Angels break bread then they run, I could fall right through
I can feel you running through my veins, and my soul goes cold
I fall harder when you say my name, moontime never gets old

I will skip to you slick with love til you've had enough
Stroll in my patchwork skin til the love I'm in rests inside you too

Don't make me blue, blue, blue
Don't make me blue, blue, blue
