Friday night in the Kingdom of Doom
Four ravens fly across the moon
All in now, there's a noise in the sky
Following all the rules and not asking why

When the sunset wheel begins
Turning into the night
I see everything in black and white and then

Drink all day 'cos the country's at war
You'll be falling off the palace wall
I can't be any more than I say
Oh in the flood, you'll be washed away

When the sunset wheel begins
Turning into the night
I see everything in black and white become

A love song for the collaboration
You and me will never be undone
We'll let it blow away
