Who do you root for?
Deep in the touch
You're waking up my senses
All this time I didn't know how

Pulling your hair out
Wipe all the years off
Hiding to all my skin
You washed out every scent of me

Earth Sick
Earth Sick
Without you

Blow out for me
Empty lungs
You can't sleep
And I drive in to deep
High from hopes and sensibility

Am I missing out?
Many ways to not give in
My love, in every word
Oh so weak

Who do you root for?
Deep in the touch
You're waking up my senses
All this time I didn't know how

Pulling your hair out
Wipe all the years off
Hiding to all my skin
You washed out every scent of me

Earth Sick
Earth Sick
Without you

Tight ropes and chains
Held in place
No one moves
A soft spot to the touch
Never found the ways to leave you

Am I missing out?
Many ways to not give in
My love, in every word
Oh so weak
Who do you root for?
Deep in the touch
You're waking up my senses
All this time I didn't know how

Pulling your hair out
Wipe all the years off
Hiding to all my skin
You washed out every scent of me

Earth Sick
Earth Sick
Without you

Earth Sick
Earth Sick
Without you
