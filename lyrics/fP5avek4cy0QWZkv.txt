War, war

Divided doubt, grown to separate
Our weathered hearts search for home again
Too afraid to take those uncertain steps
But two years ago we were stronger then
Yeah, two years ago we were stronger then
(Yeah, two years ago we were stronger)
When we dove head first, we were so alive
Risking everything trying to change lives
Now, my red eyes filled with shallow compromise
Ripping tickets, split commitment, future undefined

I never wanted to watch us fight like war
And turn away from each other
We had to stop and surrender to restore
And find a way to recover
Losing all we should have been
Consequences made in this failure on to feel again, feel again

Blacked out, misguided rage
Grown to separate our hardened hearts from our resentful brains
No way to see how far down you'll land
When the fall you take wasn't part of your plan
Doomed if you do, disowned if you don't
No way out for any one of us
Doomed if you do, disowned if you don't
No way out for any one of us

I never wanted to watch us fight like war
And turn away from each other
We had to stop and surrender to restore
And find a way to recover
Losing all we should have been
Consequences made in this failure on to feel again, feel again

Cold like war
Cold like war

I bit my tongue, let the blood fill my mouth
I just smiled while I sat there and bled out
But, through this I found out where I stand
I will never betray me again
(Cold like war)
Cold like war
(Cold like war)

I never wanted to watch us fight like war
And turn away from each other
We had to stop and surrender to restore
And find a way to recover
Losing all we should have been
Consequences made in this failure on to feel again, feel again
