Inges gloria
We wait for the call
To break down the wall
To fight for the end of days

We conquer the land
The bible in hand
The glory of war and praise
Are you praying for the final grace?
With power and pride
And God on our side

We follow the holy way
Stand and scream for all the world today
Raise your fist, evangelist

Raise your fist, evangelist
Ave mater dolorosa
Eos crucem lacrimosa

Ave mater dolorosa
Eos crucem lacrimosa
Get down by the roar
We march into war

We strike down the enemy
In triumph of Christ
No pagan survives
To hell if you don't believe
With power and pride
And God on our side

We follow the holy way
Stand and scream for all the world today
Raise your fist, evangelist
Raise your fist, evangelist
Ave mater dolorosa
Eos crucem lacrimosa

Cantus dominus
Lupus animus
We raise in the name of God
Raise, raise, raise your fist
Raise, raise, raise your fist
Raise, evangelist
Raise, raise, raise your fist and pray
Raise, raise, raise your fist
