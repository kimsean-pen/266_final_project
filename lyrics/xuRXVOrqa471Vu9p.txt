An icy rock came from the stars.
It melted on Earth,
dripping hearts of stone;
they grew into abominable horrors.

There was no end to it.
The ettins consumed the Earth
with dangerous sorcery
and neverending hunger.

Until they came,
the three gods:
WÃ´dhanaR, ThunaR and FraujaR.
They cast the horror into the abyss.

But many ettins remain,
dead and cold but alive,
dreaming and waiting
in the deep and dark places of the Earth.
