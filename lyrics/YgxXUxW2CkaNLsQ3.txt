Missy don't think she's pretty no more
Starin' at the stars through her back screen door
She tries and tries to make it all work out
No matter what she does
She's left standin' in the middle of doubt
In a lonely night
And in the pourin' rain
You can count on me

Sometimes she cries
When she's alone at night
Sometimes she weeps
When she's feelin' cold and weak
Sometimes the pain
It just tears her up inside
Sometimes she cries
Ooh, I wonder why

Missy don't have a lover no more
She plays with her pillow
Stares at the bedroom floor
Used to have a million
They've come and gone
No matter what she does
She can't figure out what she's doin' wrong yeah
In a lonely night
And in the pourin' rain
Sometimes she cries

When she's alone at night
Sometimes she weeps
Yeah when she's feelin' cold and weak
Sometimes the pain
It just tears her up inside
Sometimes she cries
Ooh, yeah
Livin', lovin', give it everything you've got

After all the heartache
Maybe give love just one more shot yeah
In a lonely night

And in the pourin' rain
Sometimes she cries
When she's alone at night

Sometimes she weeps
When she's feelin cold and weak
Sometimes the pain
Oh, it just tears her up inside
Sometimes she cries
Yeah
Ooohooh
