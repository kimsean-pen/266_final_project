Don't know how to feel
When you want to see
All the pain you cause
To your family
Suffering the most
I hear what you say
Everything is clear
I can't live that way
Don't know how to feel
When you want to break
All the things you love
Thinking it's OK
Cutting into flesh
Til the loop returns
Everything is black
Now that you confess

I begin to try
I can't shake the urge
Burying the fear
Stifling the cry
It's not like they said
Best time of your life
Giving all you can
Love you til your dead
I can hear a voice
It begins to shout
Making me believe
I would have no choice
I can feel the eyes
Looking over me
Following my skin
Cannot cease to be

I can't let you in
It takes too much to get out
If I don't let you in
That full force pushes me down
I can't let you in
It takes too much to get out
If I don't let you in
That full force pushes me down

When I was fourteen
I hid in his room
Hoping I would sleep
Never be exhumed
History and the past
It was always there
Swallowing the pill
Til I breathed my last
Suffering the most
I hear what you say
Everything is clear
I can't live that way
Don't know how to feel
When I want to end
All the time I've had
Thinking it's not real

See
Shout
See
Shout

I can't let you in
It takes too much to get out
If I don't let you in
That full force pushes me down
I can't let you in
It takes too much to get out
If I don't let you in
That full force pushes me down

When I was fourteen
I hid in his room
Hoping I would sleep
Never be exhumed
History and the past
It was always there
Swallowing the pill
Til I breathed my last

I can't let you in
It takes too much to get out
If I don't let you in
That full force pushes me down
I can't let you in
It takes too much to get out
If I don't let you in
That full force pushes me down.
