No, one knows what it's like?
Behind these eyes, behind this mask
I, wish we could rewind, and turn back time
To correct the past
Oh, baby, I wish I could tell you
How I feel but I can't 'cause I scared to
Oh, boy, I wish I could say that

Underneath it all
I'm still the one you love
Still the one you're dreaming of
Underneath it all
I'm missing you so much
Baby, let's not give it up

Now, I'm lost in my mind
Don't want to hide, but I'm can't escape
I, I wanna a new start
'Cause you're my true heart, no more masquerades
Oh, baby, I wish I could tell you
How I fell but I can't 'cause I scared to
Oh, boy, I wish I could say that

Underneath it all
I'm still the one you love
Still the one you're dreaming of
Underneath it all
I'm missing you so much
Baby let's not give it up

I don't wanna give this up
So I'm putting on a show
'Cause what we have it's true
And I don't want to let it go
I know that you feel in love
Keep it if you can't see
I know one day you will discover
Underneath it's me

Oh, baby, I wish I could tell you
How I fell but I can't 'cause I scared to
Oh, boy, I wish I could say that

Underneath it all
I'm still the one you love
Still the one you're dreaming of
Underneath it all
I'm missing you so much
Baby let's not give it up

Underneath it all
I'm still the one you love
Still the one you're dreaming of
Underneath it all
I'm missing you so much
Baby let's not give it up
Let's not give it up
