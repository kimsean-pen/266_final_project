It's time for you to strike back, they're lookin' at you
Whitney Houston, Muhammad 2 G
They're watching your every move
They're watching you

Why you lookin' at me?
Don't get mad at me, 'cause I'm still gonna be
Tell me, tell me, tell me, whatchulookinat
Tell me, tell me, tell me, whatchulookinat

I feel your eyes on me, you've been tellin' lies on me
Tell me, tell me, tell me, whatchulookinat
Tell me, tell me, tell me

See I don't understand, why you keep peepin' me?
When you don't even like me
You're after me and my man, don't think you're stressin' me
'Cause your lies don't excite me, no no

Never thought, never thought, never thought
Never knew, never knew that you would do this to me
Try to ruin me, be my enemy

Never thought, never thought, never thought
That you, would act as if you're cool with me
So why you lookin' at me, why you lookin' at me?

Don't get mad at me, 'cause I'm still gonna be
Tell me, tell me, tell me, whatchulookinat
Tell me, tell me, tell me, whatchulookinat

I feel your eyes on me, you've been tellin' lies on me
Tell me, tell me, tell me, whatchulookinat
Tell me, tell me, tell me, whatchulookinat

Oh, you know you're wrong
Don't wanna respect my song
But it's okay 'cause either way
My following is real strong

You try so hard to show the whole world what I do
Now I'm turnin' the cameras back on you
Same spotlight that once gave me fame
Tryin' to dirty up Whitney's name, no no

Never thought, never thought, never thought
Never knew, never knew that you would do this to me
Try to ruin me, be my enemy

Never thought, never thought, never thought
That you, would act as if you're cool with me
Why you lookin' at me, why you lookin' at me?

Don't get mad at me, 'cause I'm still gonna be
Tell me, tell me, tell me, whatchulookinat
Tell me, tell me, tell me, whatchulookinat

I feel your eyes on me, you've been tellin' lies on me
Tell me, tell me, tell me, whatchulookinat
Why you lookin' at me?

Don't get mad at me, 'cause I'm still gonna be
Tell me, tell me, tell me, whatchulookinat
Tell me, tell me, tell me, come on, huh

Messing with my reputation
Ain't even got no education
Tryin' to mess with my concentration
Don't even have a clue of what I'm facin'

All you know you need to stop it
Defamin' my name for a profit
God is the reason my soul is free
And I don't need you looking at me

Don't get mad at me, 'cause I'm still gonna be
Tell me, tell me, tell me, whatchulookinat
Tell me, tell me, tell me, whatchulookinat

I feel your eyes on me, you've been tellin' lies on me
Tell me, tell me, tell me, whatchulookinat
Tell me, tell me, tell me, whatchulookinat

Don't get mad at me, 'cause I'm still gonna be
Tell me, tell me, tell me, whatchulookinat
Tell me, tell me, tell me, whatchulookinat

I feel your eyes on me, you've been tellin' lies on me
Tell me, tell me, tell me, whatchulookinat
Tell me, tell me, tell me, whatchulookinat

Look atcha self
