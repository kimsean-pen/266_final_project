Oh when it's summer and the skies are glass
Oh when it's summer and the skies are glass
I just have to make the evenings last they're always flying past
Oh when it's raining and the skies are black
Oh when it's raining and the skies are black
I just have to hear the thunder roll and hear the lightning crack

With fading powers, we sit for hours by a television screen
With funny cigarettes and talk for hours of the places that we've seen

Oh brother can you hear my voice?
Oh brother can you hear my voice?
Every second that you cling to life you have to feel alive
Well it's an easy thing to sell your skin
It's an easy thing to sell your skin
With the devil banging on the door, you always let him in.

With fading powers, we dream of hours that'll never come again
Old defenders are themselves defenceless when the mad attack the sane

What can you do, when you see no future in front of you?
Food for the few
So many it seems, stand in front of you
I see my face reflected there in a sweating brow.
You hate what you see, but what can be done when there's no way out
No way out

Now brother can you hear my voice
Brother can you hear my voice
Every second that you cling to life you have to feel alive
And now it's summer and the skies are glass
When it's summer and the skies are glass
I just have to make the evenings last, they're always flashing past

So there we cower
We sit for hours by a television screen
With funny cigarettes and talk for hours of the places that we've seen

But when you sleep
But when you sleep
Where do you go?
Where do you go?

But when you sleep
But when you sleep
Where do you go?
Where do you go?

I don't know
I don't know
