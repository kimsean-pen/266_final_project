Have you ever had an empty heart?
Have you ever had an empty heart?
Did you think it'd ever fall apart?

Have you ever had a lonely heart?
Have you ever had a lonely heart?
You didn't think you'd ever fall apart

You, you make me feel so good
You make me feel so good
You make me feel so good
Just like I knew you would

Like I knew you would, like I knew you would
And if time will pass us by
I know that it will try
I'll wait for you
I'll be there at the end
I'll be there at the end

I'll wait for you
You, you make me feel so good
You make me feel so good
You make me feel so good

Just like I knew you would
Like I knew you would, like I knew you would
Waiting for you

Waiting, waiting
Waiting for you
You, you make me feel so good
You make me feel so good
You make me feel so good
Just like I knew you would
Like I knew you would
Like I knew you would
Like I knew you would
Like I knew you would
Like I knew you would
Like I knew you would
