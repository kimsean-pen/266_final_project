I think about that day
I left him at a Greyhound station
West of Santa Fe
We were seventeen, but he was sweet and it was true
Still I did what I had to do
Cuz I just knew

Summer Sunday nights
We'd sink into our seats
Right as they dimmed out all the lights
The Technicolor world made out of music and machine
It called me to be on that screen
And live inside its scene

Without a nickel to my name
Hopped a bus, here I came
Could be brave or just insane
We'll have to see
'Cuz maybe in that sleepy town
He'll sit one day, the lights are down
He'll see my face and think of how he used to know me

Behind these hills I'm reaching for the heights
And chasing all the lights that shine
And when they let you down
You'll get up off the ground
As morning rolls around
And it's another day of sun

I hear them everyday
The rhythms in the canyons that will never fade away
The ballads in the ballrooms left by those who came before
They say we got to want it more
So I bang on every door

And even when the answer's no
Or when my money's running low
The disc and mic and neon glow are all I need

And some day as I sing the song
A small-town kid will come along
That'll be the thing to push him on and he'll go

Behind these hills I'm reaching for the heights
And chasing all the lights that shine
And when they let you down
You'll get up off the ground
As morning rolls around
And it's another day of sun

When they let you down
The morning rolls around

It's another day of sun
It's another day of sun
It's another day of sun
It's another day of sun
Just another day of sun
It's another day of sun
The day has just begun
It's another day of sun

It's another day of sun
