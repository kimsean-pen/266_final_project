I've made a good living by dying
Endless wait, grey solace ruling my mind
Constrained by time and drained by the cold
Still I found myself shivering under the rising sun

You are the star, you are the moon
You are the soil where shadows bloom
Casting a light which brings me peace
Where the caverns of death will freeze

The flower never grew
But I love you just the same
Even though like a bird you flew

I will love you just the same
I am the blood; A fire in your soul...

And I will grow in landscapes so cold
Oh, how I feel you in every single detail
As you lurk inside my troubled dreams
There is no hope as long we walk this Earth
But you should know my universe screams

It screams for you
I cry for you!
The flower never grew
But I love you just the same
Even though like a bird you flew
I will love you just the same
