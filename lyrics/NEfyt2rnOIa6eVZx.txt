Community saw the best in me
Exchanging the common heart for the salt in the sea
Children of the sun on a highway of hope
The beauty of coming together
In sorrow

Tahiti we don't got no name
Tahiti we don't got no home
Tahiti we don't got no money
Tahiti we don't got no
Honey

But we do the dishes, we make the bread
We are powdered ashes in the light of the beauty
He said

Wear those dark glasses to help us see
Hot tears rolling down and our arms are knitted

Creatures of the night on a highway of hope
And the beauty that we'll leave each other
Tomorrow

Tahiti we don't got no name
Tahiti we don't got no home
Tahiti we don't got no money
Tahiti we don't got no
Honey
