Who would have known: that a boy like him
would have entered me lightly restoring my blisses

Who would have known: that a boy like him
after sharing my core would stay going nowhere

Who would have known: a beauty this immense
Who would have known: a saintly trance
Who would have known: miraculous breath
To inhale a beard loaded with courage

Who would have known: that a boy like him
possessed of magical sensitivity
would approach a girl like me
who carresses
cradles
his head in a bosom

He slides inside
half awake, half asleep
we faint back
into sleephood
when I wake up
the second time in his arms: gorgeousness!
he's still inside me

Who would have known?

A train of pearls cabin by cabin
is shot precisely across an ocean
from a mouth

from

a

from a mouth of a girl like me

to a boy

to a boy

to a boy
