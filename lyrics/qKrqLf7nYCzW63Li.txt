First time ever getting her alone
Never talked on the phone
And I thought it was going alright
Only tried to make her comfortable
And then she lets me know
That she finna be moving on

Love will let you down
Love will let you down

Then she asks me why I act so shy
I'm not the kind of guy
That can show you what I got inside
Cause I've been hurt so many times before
So baby please ignore
All these words coming out of my mouth

Love will let you down
Love will let you down
Love will let you down
Love will let you down
