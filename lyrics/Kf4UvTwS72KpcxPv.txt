Is this all we get, one short life?
Tell me we got time
I saw a world without you there
Somehow, you were mine

And no, please don't go
Please don't go and leave me alone

Don't wanna give my heart to someone new
Won't be anybody after you
And even if one day, our time is through
Won't be anybody after you, after you
I'll never find another lover after you

If you have to go, be my ghost
Hope you haunt my dreams
So I won't be alone 'cause I'd give up hope
If you weren't there for me

And no, please don't go
Please don't go and leave me alone

Don't wanna give my heart to someone new
Won't be anybody after you
And even if one day, our time is through
Won't be anybody after you, after you
I'll never find another lover after you

I won't be able to move on, baby
I won't be able to love nobody else
So if you go, won't you take me with you?
Don't leave me alone

I don't wanna give my heart to someone new
There won't be anybody after you
And even if one day, our time is through, whoa
Won't be anybody after you, after you, oh, after you
I'll never find another lover after you
