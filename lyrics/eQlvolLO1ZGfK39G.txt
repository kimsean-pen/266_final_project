I can feel a new expression on my face
I can feel a strange sensation taking place
I can hear the guitars playing lovely tunes
Everytime that you walk in the room
I close my eyes for a second and pretend
It's me you want
Meanwhile I try to act so nonchalant
I see a summer night with a magic moon
Everytime that you walk in the room
Maybe it's a dream come true
Standing right alongside of you
Wish I could tell ya how much I care
But I only have the nerve to stare
I can feel that something pounding in my brain
Just anytime someone speaks your name
Trumpets sound and I hear thunder boom
Everytime that you walk in the room
Everytime that you walk in the room
