Oh, my love, what have we done?
I don't know where to start
What will now become of us
And of our little hearts
There's no need to justify
Our love is not a crime
Let's buy ourselves a house in Spain
And gladly do our time

Won't you take my hand now, babe
We'll have a wonderful time
The whole world might be ending but
We'll be just fine
If only for tonight
You and I

I'll never really know myself
I've come to terms with that
But when you say you're with me then
I'm wiling to pretend
People are the worst and, baby
Dating's such a bore
A happy ever after's really all I'm looking for
