(Verse)
Love fights love invading my zero gravity
The crowd grows and grows illusions
Down on quantity street.
High speed under approach,
Wait till smog, shall on innocence.
Dark fin, heaven eyes,
I believe it all but I don't feel it.

(Pre-Chorus)
My head's in the South now, individual citizen, hear it.
I hassen up now, individual citizen

(Chorus)
Here is the start, just gotta lit,
On the right seem right, we gonna right it.
Hear me, the wonder of it,
On the right seem right, I'm on the right thing.

(Verse)
Every words, yeah, I mean it,
Loses me and now I'm so loud, I can't resist.
I'm what you're asking,
Seem to be your voice, so now I can be reached.
I'm with, I'm with, I'm with, I'm with, I'm with,
Individual citizen.

(Chorus)
Here is the start, just gotta lit,
On the right seem right, we gonna right it.
Hear me, the wonder of it,
On the right seem right, I'm on the right thing.

(Bridge)
Love finds love, is following.
And what left us to be a voice so far it can't be reached.
I'm with, I'm with, I'm with, I'm with, I'm with,
Individual citizens.

(Chorus)
Here is the start, just gotta lit,
On the right seem right, I'm on the right thing.
Take it, life just gotta hit,
On the right seem right, I'm on the right thing.
Hear it, the sight just won't quit,
On the right seem right, I'm on the right thing.
Hear me, the wonder of it,
On the right seem right, I'm on the right thing.
