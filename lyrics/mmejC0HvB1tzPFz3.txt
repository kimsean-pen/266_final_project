These are the best years of my life
Drifting away from anger
Passive and eager to submit
I will do anything you want

You can bury me alive
I'll bring the shovel
You can bury me alive

Once I was violent and possessed
I was a ticking time bomb
Took me a long time to admit
I was a worthless piece of shit

You can bury me alive
I'll do the digging
You can bury me alive
You can cover me with soil
You can bury me alive

Looking back on all I've done
I enjoyed those final moments
When the light would leave their eyes
I would do it all over again

You can bury me alive
You can cover me with soil
You can bury me alive
