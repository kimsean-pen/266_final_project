Wide awake in bed at 4:16am,
trying to grab a hold of thoughts around her head.
Constant existential questions have been keeping her from living free.

Living through a screen for most part of the day.
The City holds her dreams in all too many ways.
Wondering what's beyond The City's endless
limits. No one knows. Rumour has it no one's ever been.

At times you realise this wasn't how
you wrote your life in classroom expos√©s.
And looking at the sky should alleviate
the worst in us, not keep it trapped inside.

Pack your things and leave.
Head for the border, whatever is outside The City.
Please tell me these buildings don't go on forever.
It's for sure,
whatever existence is out there can't
be any worse than this one already is.

Wait, I'll follow but first I need the time to go find a place we see
the sunset and more than just three
stars. I know you're down with that.
There must be more to life than
concrete walls, with endless corridors.
So push aside your biggest regrets, to learn your mother tongue.
We've still got time for that.
There must be more to life than concrete walls
