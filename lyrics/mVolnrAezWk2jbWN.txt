Stopped
In the middle of my street
And I'm needing some clarity
In the car
The radio
To find a song like you, like you

Oh, no I'm not looking back
To rewrite our stories past
I gave up years ago
And as guarded as I am
I've got things I've left unsaid
Now forever I'll keep

Well, I'm livin' in the shade of my mind
I just stopped for a second and I reasoned
I move forward like the seasons

Named
To advances, I can't see
And I'm dreamin' of some time to breathe
And I'll walk to dance
Till I'm black and blue
In search of the new
Won't wait until I'm older

Oh, no I'm not looking back
To rewrite my fucking past
I gave up years ago
And as guarded as I am
I've got things I've left unsaid
Now forever I'll keep

Well I'm livin' in a state of my mind
I just stopped for a second and I reasoned
I move forward like the seasons
I move forward like the seasons
I move forward like the seasons
I move forward like the seasons
I move forward like the seasons
