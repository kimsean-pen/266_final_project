God save the Queen
A fascist regime
They made you a moron
Potential H-bomb

God save the Queen
She ain't no human being
And there's no future
In England's dreaming

Tell me something, do what you wanted
Tell me nothing, do what you need
There's no future, no future
No future for you

God save the Queen
We mean it, man
We love our Queen
God save

God save the Queen
'Cause tourists are money
And our figurehead
Is not what she seems

God save history
God save your mad pride
Oh Lord God, have mercy
All crimes are paid

When there's no future, they can't keep saying
We're the snake and we're done right in
We're poison of the human machine
We're the future, your future

God save the Queen
We mean it, man
We love our Queen
God saves

God save the Queen
We mean it, man
And there's no future
In England's dreaming

No future, no future
No future for you
No future, no future
No future for me

No future, no future
No future for you

No future, no future
