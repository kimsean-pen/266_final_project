I am an American aquarium drinker
I assassin down the avenue
I'm hiding out in the big city blinking
What was I thinking when I let go of you?

Let's forget about the tongue tied lightning
Let's undress just like cross eyed strangers
This is not a joke, so please stop smiling
What was I thinking when I said it didn't hurt?

I want to glide through those brown eyes dreaming
Take you from the inside, baby, hold on tight
You were so right when you said I've been drinking
What was I thinking when we said goodnight?

I want to hold you in the Bible black pre-dawn
You're quite a quiet domino bury, me now
Take off your band-aid, 'cause I don't believe in touchdowns
What was I thinking when we said hello?

I always thought that if I held you tightly
You would always love me like you did back then
Then I fell asleep in the city kept blinking
What was I thinking when I let you back in?

I am trying to break your heart
I am trying to break your heart
But still I'd be lying if I said it wasn't easy
I am trying to break your heart

Disposable Dixie cup drinker
I assassin down the avenue
I've been hiding out in the big city blinking
What was I thinking when I let go of you?

Loves you
I'm the man who loves you
