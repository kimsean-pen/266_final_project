Stuck on the wall, the note that you left
I wait and stop for the moment
Your reckless heart, you know you got it
Into the past, I try to sort it

Sort it, sort it, sort it, sort it, sort it, sort it

Out of the fog, you're calling my name
I wanted to call for nothing
Your careless heart, you know you got it
Crawl into bed and try to forget

Forget, forget, forget, forget, forget, forget

And when we go down you lost the courage
When we go down, you're so ferocious
When we go down you lost the courage
When we go down, you're so ferocious

Blanket of cloud, the sky hovering
Winter is long and forgiving
You melt your doubt and fall into me
I find your mouth and try to hold it

Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it

You bring your love, you know it's homeless
But we'll both rise, we're falling
The summer arrives, the garden's alive
With the mud and the mortar, we're gonna save it

Save it, save it, save it, save it, save it, save it, save it
Save it, save it, save it, save it, save it, save it, save it

When we go down, you lost the courage
When we go down, you're so ferocious
When we go down, you lost the courage
When we go down, you're so ferocious

When we go down, you lost the courage
When we go down, you're so ferocious
When we go down, you lost the courage
When we go down, you're so ferocious
