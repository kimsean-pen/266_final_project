You in brown checked suit
Said my dress was very cute
I found, you found me
Dancin' in this melody
Heavenly

Oh we were swingin' on so nice
Bubbly pink champagne on ice
Nancy, Jacques, Closeau and Claire
I believe they all were there
Having the time of their lives

You had rose's lime
Mixed with vodka, I had wine
People having fun
Cocktails in the evening sun
Give me one

We were swingin' on so nice
Bubbly pink champagne on ice
Nancy, Jacques, Closeau and Claire
Well I believe they all were there
Having the time of their lives

We were swingin' on so nice
Bubbly pink champagne on ice
Nancy, Jacques, Closeau and Claire
I believe they all were there

La la la do be do be do
