It's been like a year since I've been home
Falling with an addiction I can't shake up
My mouth is dry, I self medicate
It's come down, cure itself
It's driving you away
It's driving you away
Piece by piece
Day by day

Baby
Tell me if I'm being strange
And if I need to rearrange my particles
I will for you
My particles, I will for you

And I'm the shadow of a ghost
It's feeling as if somebody has taken yours
Babe, I don't want to make a scene
But I get self-destructive
And it's driving you away
It's driving you away
Piece by piece
Day by day

Baby
Tell me if I'm being strange
And if I need to rearrange my particles
I will for you

Oh, doctor please, this don't feel wrong
Oh, can't you give me something
To get me through the night?
Oh, if it all falls apart
If this thing goes wrong
Oh, put me back together
Oh, if you would
My mind plays tricks

And I don't sleep no more
Doctor, please
I can't switch off

Baby
Tell me if I'm being strange
And if I need to rearrange my particles
I will for you
My particles, I will for you
