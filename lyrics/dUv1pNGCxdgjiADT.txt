Let me be the one
To hold you close tonight
Let me be the one to say that I've tried
Don't you know
I don't wanna do this no more
If you can't be mine

Lighting up the corner of my heart
When all the hard was gone
Got my attention that just watch you do
But I was just a part of the game to you

I'll try to hide
The pain I feel inside
Don't change your mind
'Cause baby you just can't decide

Let me be the one
To hold you close tonight
Let me be the one to say that I've tried
Don't you know
I don't wanna do this no more
If you can't be mine

Then I can tell you're just playing pretend
Isn't it easy to see
Is it hard for you to understand
That I'm the only one you'll ever need

I'll try to hide
The pain I feel inside
Don't change your mind
'Cause baby you just can't decide

Let me be the one
To hold you close tonight
Let me be the one to say that I've tried
Don't you know
I don't wanna do this no more
If you can't be mine

Don't change your mind (Don't change your mind)
I'll try to hide (I'll try to hide)
The way I feel inside

Let me be the one
To hold you close tonight (Close tonight)
Let me be the one to say that I've tried
I don't wanna do this no more
If you can't be mine
The way you feel inside
When you want no more
You know it's easy to see
That you're just playing
'Cause you're never coming back to me

Let me be the one
To hold you close tonight
Let me be the one to say that I've tried
Don't you know
That you'll never get anyone better than me

Let me be the one
To hold you close tonight
Let me be the one to say that I've tried
Don't you know
I don't wanna do this no more
If you can't be mine
