When the world fall into pieces
You'll be the one voice of reason
When I can't face all my demons
You are the one I believe in

Through the thunder and the rain
Together we fall together we fly away
You are my one and only

You're the Queen of hearts
Make me your king
You'll be the diamond
I got the ring

We could rule the world
Own everything
I'll be the Jay-Z
You'll be the B

Cause you've got me upside down
I know you inside out
They'll call me crazy
But baby you saved me

When the world fall into pieces
You'll be the one voice of reason
When I can't face all my demons
You are the one I believe in

Through the thunder and the rain
Together we fall together we fly away
You are my one and only

One and only
You are my one and only

You're Mona Lisa
The smile on your face
Is all that I need

You could be my wild
I'd be your west
You know that I'd be your
Cause I've got you upside down
You've got me completely inside out

They'll call me crazy
But baby you've saved me

When the world fall into pieces
You'll be the one voice of reason
When I can't face all my demons
You are the one I believe in

Through the thunder and the rain
Together we fall together we fly away
You are my one and only

One and only
You are my one and only

You're everywhere I want to be
Even when you're far from me
I still hold you closer
Than you know

Well even if you wanna leave
I'd let you take that part of me
I know that it would kill me
But I'd swear I'd let you go

When the world fall into pieces
You'll be the one voice of reason
When I can't face all my demons
You are the one I believe in

Through the thunder and the rain
Together we fall together we fly away
You are my one and only

One and only
You are my one and only

(Oh yeah, that's the one)
