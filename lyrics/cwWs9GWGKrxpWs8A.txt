Lovesongs, they kill me
They kill me... Now

Aaah, aaah, aaah
Aaah, aaah, aaah

The curtain's closed
No way home
The nectar of life run dry
These tainted words
Made to hurt
Cut in me with its knife

Eating my mind
And with each bite
I'm begging "Please Lord, no"

This place is a mess
The one has gone

Lovesongs, they kill me
They kill me... Now
Lovesongs are killing me
Are killing me... Right now

Trained to attack
Bull eye shot in black
I never thought they'd get me
These pictures in my head
Lying in my bed
These whips make me bleed

This place is a mess
My one has gone

Lovesongs, they kill me
They kill me... Now
Lovesongs are killing me
Are killing me... Right now
Lovesongs are killing me
Are killing me... Right now

I can't hear the sceneries
Of constant tragedies
Of what I meant to feel no more
'Cause I'm already dead
And I just cannot bear
To hear another word no more

Lovesongs, they kill me
They kill me... Now
Lovesongs are killing me
Are killing me... Right now
Lovesongs are killing me
Are killing me... Right now

Lovesongs are killing me
Are killing me... Right now

Lovesongs, they kill me
