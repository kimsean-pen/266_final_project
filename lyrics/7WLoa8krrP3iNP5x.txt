Magnificent creatures of glory
We've climbed down from the stars
To stand (shining) before you as idols
In splendor and perfection

Supreme luminous beings
Warrior sons from the sky
Lunar born daughters of pleasure
We are the triumph of creation

Star matter shapes of power
Cast from the seed of the gods
As instruments of perfection
We are sovereignty in flesh

Radiant race of pure beauty
Shaped perfectly as the pagan beast
In elegance we welcome our future
As stellar master elite

Ah... in glory
Ah... we shine
Ah...
We revel in our time

We are sovereignty in flesh
Radiant race of pure beauty
We revel in our time
As stellar master elite
