All day I dream about shhh with you
All day I dream about shhh with you
They say that it's overrated but they ain't doin' it right
All day I dream about shhh with you

Since I met you I been thinkin' all day
I been googlin' ways to keep you entertained
It's been three weeks since we started to play
Now it's serious, babe
'Cause what you do is crazy
I never had somebody who could do that things
Make me say oh oh oh
So come on, baby, baby
Come on, pretty baby
You're gonna get it tonight

All day I dream about shhh with you
All day I dream about shhh with you
They say that it's overrated but they ain't doin' it right
All day I dream about shhh with you

Slavin' in the kitchen iced you a cake
Then I served you a plate but that ain't what you ate, no
We been busy doin' all fifty shades while we listen to Drake
We on that hot love and emotion
I never had somebody who could do that things
Make me say oh oh oh
So come on, baby, baby
Come on, pretty baby
You're gonna get it tonight

All day I dream about shhh with you
All day I dream about shhh with you
They say that it's overrated but they ain't doin' it right
All day I dream about shhh with you

You got that goodie goodie and I'm addicted
I'm on that kissy kissy bang bang delicious
All day I dream about it
Baby, so how's about it?
You know I'm all about that
All day I dream about wait
All day I dream about wait
All day I dream about shhh with you

Excuse me, do me or lose me
Get me to the bedroom, do your duty
Milkshake, milkshake
Bet you like some of that strawberry
Like a wave gonna come tsunami
Wanna take this ride? Better hurry
'Cause me one you there's a million
And they all want, huh, my brazillian
They say that it's overrated, well they ain't doin' it right
All day I dream about shhh with you
