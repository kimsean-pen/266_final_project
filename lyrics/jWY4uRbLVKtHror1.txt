you cut her name into your heart
you burn his name into your arm
cast out the pig you kiss as love
heaven is closed for now you are alone

this too, this too shall pass away
this too, this too will pass away
listen, Steven is singing to you
the pain of life you wipe away

a reason,
that a fine gray ash shall recall these days
inquire
the serpent
to become a rag of a dream interred
you arrive
and you wave your hand as if she could care
but she can't
nor can you
the relinquishing and a flickering
out of loss

this too, this too shall pass away
this too, this too will pass away
listen, Steven is singing to you
the pain of life you wipe away

this too, this too shall fade away
this too, this pain will pass away
listen, Steven is singing to us
the pain of life you wipe away

perhaps depraved is who you are
why not?
depraved at least you're not alone

overcome
by the truth you face
that you can't get up or look up
at the moon
without throwing up
and it stays the same all the time

lie and wait
it could stop again
like a bee
it will die
when it stings you once
and its small bee's head will fall off

this too, this too shall pass away
this too, this pain will pass away
listen, Steven is singing to you
the pain of life you wipe away
