Complicity
How can I handle it a hundred times
Wondering
What that was?
Hoping you won't slip out this time
Hide in the night
We're kissing and mummbling
You hold me tight
Whatch us! we're shambling

Publicity
Dignity is forcing me to keep out of you
But I quit
You've secceeded
It benefits me rocking with you
Hide in the night
We're kissing and mummbling
You hold me tight
Whatch us! we're shambling

I look into your eyes
They're the eyes of my enemy
We can run wild your imagination
You can go
You can hide
You can run throught the night
