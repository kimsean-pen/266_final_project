Off... White... Limousine

Before the show
I saw you saw me
Pullin' up
In all my glory
I made my way
To the scene
And everything
That I need
Is in my

Off.
White
Limousine

Pullin up in my
Off
White
Limousine

Don't you wanna ride in my Off White Limousine
Don't you wanna come in my Off White Limousine
Interior pleasures she'll give you whatever you need
Your skin on the leather its glistening ever so sweet

I know you want to
Come back stage
But thats so basic
So pass√©

If you wanna know
Whats on my mind
Follow me
And slip inside

Into my
Off
White
Limousine

But I seen a
Off
White
Limousine

Don't you wanna ride in my Off White Limousine
Don't you wanna come in my Off White Limousine
Interior pleasures she'll give you whatever you need
Your skin on the leather its glistening ever so sweet

You can't burst our bubble
We made our own scene
Collins Street's the jungle
Surf the CBD

Take a call from my
Off
White
Limousine

Lose your cool in my
Off
White
Limousine

Pullin up in my
Off
White
Limousine

Lose your cool in my
Off

Limousine

Pullin up in my
Off
White
Limousine

Lose your cool in my

White
Limousine

Don't you wanna ride in my Off White Limousine
