Calm down, don't run again
I'll soothe you, I'm mechanical
Brave soldier, kill again
Before we all expire

Think for yourself
And be the renegade
Don't give in to him
And his ugly ways

I can feel you getting closer
I can sense you start to smile
I see colossal eyes
There's a shadow on the sun
And no wonder why

Drain all the sick away
You've proven you are an animal
Stalking me, you are a mannequin
Your form is menacing

This is another one of his ways
To control me

I can feel you getting closer
I can sense you start to smile
I see colossal eyes
There's a shadow on the sun
And no wonder why
