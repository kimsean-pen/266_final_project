Baby I am hurtin'
Oh, you cut me deep
I guess I don't deserve you
And you don't deserve me

Don't tell me that you're busy, no
While you're pressed against her body now
I sip away another as I wait for you to call
Burning down the heartache

Hear me out, hear me out,
Before you call me out, call me out
I need you now, I need you now

I told you to love somebody else,
'cause I want you right here with me
I only meant to keep you to myself
Don't hide away and leave me guessing
(Oh-oh) Now I'm lost now I'm losing my mind
(Oh-oh) Now I'm lost now I'm losing my mind

Why you keep on lying?
'Cause we know where you've been
I smell her on your sheets,
I taste her on your skin

I'm a nightmare in your daydream
You can shake me just nicotine
I shake you again, I poison you again
I'll love you 'till the end

Hear me out, hear me out,
Before you call me out, call me out
I need you now, I need you now

I told you to love somebody else,
'cause I want you right here with me
I only meant to keep you to myself
Don't hide away and leave me guessing
(Oh-oh) Now I'm lost now I'm losing my mind
(Oh-oh) Now I'm lost now I'm losing my mind

I left my heart in your hands but,
You won't look when I call your name
Am I so hard to handle?
I am waiting for you, I am

I left my heart in your hands but,
You won't look when I call your name
Am I so hard to handle?
I am waiting for you, I am (Hey-yeah)

I told you to love somebody else,
'cause I want you right here with me
I only meant to keep you to myself
Don't hide away and leave me guessing
(Oh-oh, Yeah) Now I'm lost now I'm losing my mind
(Oh-oh) Now I'm lost now I'm losing my mind
