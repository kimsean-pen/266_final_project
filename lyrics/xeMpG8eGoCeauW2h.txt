Broken
You were the only thing holding my life
I'm hoping
That you realize and take me back inside
I'm broken
You were the only one holding my mind
I'm hoping
That you would bring me back to life

You'll never know how much you mean to me
I'll never sleep without you in my dreams

You know that I know when you look in my eyes
That life's not the same when you're not by my side
With no one i'd rather be spending my time
but loving you slowly been taken my life
You know that we know that you won't make the time
You'll never revolt what you did to my mind
You take a step back and then you realize
The love that we had has been buried alive

You'll never know how much you mean to me
I'll never sleep without you in my dreams
