We're not indestructible
Baby, better get that straight
I think it's unbelievable
How you give into the hands of fate

Some things are worth fighting for
Some feelings never die
I'm not askin' for another chance
I just wanna know why

There's no easy way out
There's no shortcut home
There's no easy way out
Givin' in can't be wrong

I don't wanna pacify you
I don't wanna drag you down
But I'm feelin' like a prisoner
Like a stranger in a no named town

I see all the angry faces
Afraid that could be you and me
Talkin' about what might have been
I'm thinkin' about what it used to be

There's no easy way out
There's no shortcut home
There's no easy way out
Givin' in can't be wrong

Baby, baby, we can shed this skin
We can know how we feel inside
Instead of goin' down an endless road
Not knowin' if we're dead or alive

Some things are worth fightin' for
Some feelings never die
I'm not askin' for another chance
I just wanna know why

There's no easy way out
There's no shortcut home
There's no easy way out
Givin' in, givin' in can't be wrong, no

There's no easy way out
(There's no easy way out)
There's no shortcut home
(There's no shortcut home)
There's no easy way out
(There's no easy, no easy, no easy way out)
There's no easy way out
(There's no easy way out)
There's no shortcut home
(There's no shortcut home)
There's no easy way out
(There's no easy, no easy, no easy way out)
There's no easy way out
There's no shortcut home
There's no easy way out
