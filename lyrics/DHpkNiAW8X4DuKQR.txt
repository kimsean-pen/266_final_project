The last word
is the lost word
Why don't you say so

I sleep light
on these shores tonite
I live light on these shores

Elevation... don't go to my head
Now you give me no trouble
and you give me no help
It is the clown
that works so well

I sleep light on these shores tonite.
I live light on these shores.

Elevation don't go to my head
Our lips are sealed our breath is burning
These cold wild seas have left us turning
But I sleep light on these shores tonite
I live light on these shores
