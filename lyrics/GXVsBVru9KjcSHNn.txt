It's not what I took from you
It's not what I stole
We are born like this
Like this

The time has come to change this
To stretch the thought a mile
We've lost that kind of spirit
We want it back today

The time is right to change this
To make the life we know
They took what we were given
We'll get it back again

Somewhere, someone's gun
Someone's gun is laughing

Hey, it's not what I gave to you
It's not what I stole
We are born like this

No, it's not what I took from you
It's not what I stole
We are born like this

You try your best to mock me
You're always in my way
You've lost what you've been given
You'll get it back today

The time is right to change this
To make the life we know
They took what we were given
We want it back again

Somewhere, someone's gun
Someone's gun is laughing

And it's not what I gave to you
It's not what I stole
We are born like this

No, it's not what I took from you
It's not what I stole
We are born like this

Somewhere
You're floating high
You're not living, we are
Somewhere, someone's gun
Someone's gun is laughing, laughing
It's not what I gave to you
It's not what I stole
We are born like this
Hey, there it's not what I gave to you
It's not what I stole
We are born like this
It's not what I took from you
It's not what I stole
We are born like this
