Have a drink, have a drink, have a drink on me
I can read what you need 'cause it's clear to see
So you tried and you tried and you made a mess
Got your pride, let it slide, 'cause I'm not impressed

If you were to use your head
Then you would, just forget her
Listen what what the wise man said
Lover good, friend better
Lover good, friend better

I could swear I was there when you hit the ground
Don't you care, don't you care
That I'm still around
It's a fact that I lack certain kinds of charm
Come on strong, get it wrong
But I mean no harm

If you were to use your head
Then you would, just forget her
Listen what what the wise man said
Lover good, friend better
Lover good, friend better

Have a drink, have a drink
Have a drink on me
Pick a card, any card, it's your destiny
Took a trip on a ship but you ran aground
I declare sorrow shared is a sorrow drowned

If you were to use your head
Then you would, just forget her
Listen what what the wise man said
Lover good, friend better
Lover good, friend better
Lover good, friend better
Lover good, friend better
