I will survive

I had it all figured out
A career, a future, I had no doubts
I was never a stranger to substance
I never thought it would end up like this

Watching the best of your life
Slip through your hands and pass you by
Constantly reminded
That you've clipped your wings
And can no longer fly
Time wasted on hearts of stone
And stares that cut my flesh
Please tell me there is more to this

Lift me up so I can see
Past the darkness inside of me
Show me who I'm meant to be
I know that I'm worth saving
Lift me up ('cause I'm worth saving)
I'm worth saving
Lift me up ('cause I'm worth saving)
Show me hope and lift me up

This is my cry
This is my cry
This is my cry
Let me feel cared for
This is my cry
Let them see who I really am
The world needs to know
That I'm more than just failed aspirations
I am more than nameless

I've been spit on
I've been cast away
I am more than decay
You'll never hold me down

Rise up
I'm not nameless

I was once
A great man with so much to gain
But now
You call me scum with nowhere to turn
I don't care what you say
I will pick myself up
And survive today

Lift me up so I can see
Past the darkness inside of me
Show me who I'm meant to be
I know that I'm worth saving
Lift me up ('cause I'm worth saving)
I'm worth saving
Lift me up ('cause I'm worth saving)
Show me hope
