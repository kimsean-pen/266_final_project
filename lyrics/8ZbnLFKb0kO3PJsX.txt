Yeah

Yeah, Yeah

Yeah

Yeah, Yeah

Walkin' home
I passed by a funeral
There was a woman there
She was cryin'
Cursin' at the Gods
And it made me wanna
Run home to you
And I ran, ran, ran
Ran as fast as I could

Oh
No one knows, yeah
What tomorrow holds, yeah
All we got is here and now
All we got is here and now

I'm not gonna waste no more time
Oh, no, no

I'm out of words, babe
No way to explain
Why you lookin' at me
What you doin' to me
I'm out of words, babe
No way to explain
Why you lookin' at me
I can't get enough
I can't get enough
I can't get enough
I can't get enough
I can't get enough

My thoughts
Moving like a speedin' train
Runnin' home to you
Tryin' to catch up with them
But
So many things
I forgot to say
Now that I want to
Don't know how to, babe

Oh
No one knows, yeah
What tomorrow holds, yeah
All we got is here and now
All we got is here and now

Oh
No one knows, yeah
What tomorrow holds, yeah
All we got is here and now
All we got is here and now

I'm out of words, babe
No way to explain
Why you lookin' at me
What you doin' to me
I'm out of words, babe
No way to explain
Why you lookin' at me
I can't get enough
I can't get enough
I can't get enough
I can't get enough
I can't get enough

People always said
I got a way with words
But when it comes to you
I don't know what to say
Oh, nah, nah, damn
Won't do you justice, babe
Won't do you justice, babe
Oh, nah, nah, damn

Words, babe
No way to explain

What you doin' to me
I'm out of words, babe
No way to explain
Why you lookin' at me
I can't get enough
Oh, no, no
I can't get enough
Oh, no, no, no
I can't get enough
I can't get enough
Do you wanna be my baby
I can't get enough

Get enough
