It bothers me, it bites me, stings me, deprives me
Off my track, the ways you make me pass, by highways
I am forced to trust your wicked ways
You use me, abuse me, control me, but...
Nothing really matters, Nothing really matters,
This broken heart's a shatter
As long as you love me
But something is the matter, when love deceives it batters
These gunshots are a shatter... So you must love me

In my mind I have killed you, long ago
Born pretender, spirit high jacker, you killed my love for you
Innocent blood, excuse me now, Mr. Right, knight tell me
Stuck in a days, can't even understand no more,

Well, Nothing really matters, Nothing really matters,
These broken hearts are shattered
As long as you love me
But something is the matter, when love deceives it batters
These gunshots are a shatter... So you must love me

Born pretender, spirit high jacker, in the name of love
You heart snatcher, backbiter,
yes they are partakers of sucking innocent blood,
nights walking vampires, excuse me now
duce me to your industry
'cause with me you will definitely go very far,
stuck in a daze, can't even understand unknowingly
Approaching the world through a vivid glance
But it concerns me, and it concern us, yet it condemns us
For this is the fact, the truth and it will forever hunt us but...

Nothing really matter, Nothing really matters,
These broken hearts are shattered
As long as you love me
But something is the matter, when love deceives it batters
These gunshots are a shatter... So you must love me
