(Handcuffed in the present tense
Variations on your violence
Mind games and pretty girls
A cracked song in the universe
I think it's time that I showed you what I'm made of
I am afraid there is much to be afraid of
I kill the fire so I don't get burned
Kill the fire and you won't get burned)

Deadwood, if you care to listen
Looks the same, but there's something missing
It wears me out
Stripped bare, I'm the same old savage
How in God's name did we ever manage?
It's not enough

Look me in the eye
I'm about to dive
Can you live your life
Without me?

I don't need you anymore
I can't use you anymore
Killing the fire
And you kill the desire
I don't need you anymore

Loud and clear, but you still don't get it
I call you up and then I regret it
It gets me down
You want the truth, but you look right through it
Deadwood, but you hold on to it
It's such a shame

Look me in the eye
I'm about to dive
Can you live your life
Without me?

I don't need you anymore
I can't use you anymore
Killing the fire
And you kill the desire
I don't need you anymore

(First comes love
Then comes marriage
Then comes baby in a golden carriage
First comes love
Then comes marriage
Then comes baby in a golden carriage)

I don't need you anymore
I can't use you anymore

Killing the fire
And you kill the desire
Killing the fire
And you kill the desire
Killing the fire
(Symptomatic of what we've become)
And you kill the desire
(I used to think you were the only one)
Killing the fire
(Symptomatic of what we've become)
And you kill the desire
(I used to think you were the only one)

(First comes love)
Killing the fire
(The only one)
(Then comes marriage)
And you kill the desire
(The only one)
(Then comes baby in a golden carriage)
Killing the fire
(The only one)
(Then comes loneliness)
And you kill my desire
(The only one)

(First comes love)
(Then comes marriage)
