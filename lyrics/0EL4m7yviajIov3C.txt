I've been thinking about lately
That's the hardest part
There are things only you can make me feel
Be wrapped up in my arms
I still wonder if we're ever gonna work around
Your touch will ., your touch
And you still think I don't ., I want it
Your love, your love
Yeah
Oh nanananana, oh nanananana
Don't look now
But she's moving too fast, about to ...
Oh nanananana, oh nanananana
Only words
Cause if she's on the rhyme, I'd never keep her
You get me spinning round, round, round
You don't have to make your sound, sound, sound
And it's hard enough keeping my head above the ground
Because your touch, your touch, your touch
Is pulling me under
Pulling me under
I've been thinking about the same things
... effort in your heart
There's not many you can break me
But you really left the scars, scars
Oh nanananana, oh nanananana
Don't look now
Cause she's moving too fast, about to ...
Oh nanananana, oh nanananana
Only words
Cause if she's on the rhyme, I'd never keep her
You get me spinning round, round, round
You don't have to make your sound, sound, sound
And it's hard enough keeping my head above the ground
Because your touch, your touch, your touch
Is pulling me under
Pulling me under
Oh nanananana, oh nanananana
Settle down
Cause you're moving too fast, she's about to ...
Oh nanananana, oh nanananana
Only words
Cause your name's on the rhyme, you'd never keep her
You get me spinning round, round, round
You don't have to make your sound, sound, sound
And it's hard enough keeping my head above the ground
Because your touch, your touch, your touch
Is pulling me under
Pulling me under
Yeah, pulling me under
Pulling me under
