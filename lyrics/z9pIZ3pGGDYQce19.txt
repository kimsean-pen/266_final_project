Have you ever, ever lost something you can't replace
But you still, yeh you still search anyway
And the earths in reverse it's so lonely in the crowd
And I scream in my pillow and I break

If I could just go back to yesterday
I'd take it all back
I'd take it all back
I'd take it all back again
Yeh the world got lost since you went away
Everything's black
Everything's black
It's as black as rain

Oh ohhh oh

Do you wish that your tears didn't come to late
Or the days and the nights blur into one, no
There's a place that I go in my sweetest memories
Where i see, see a smile in the sun

If I could just go back to yesterday
I'd take it all back
I'd take it all back
I'd take it all back again
Yeh the world got lost since you went away
Everything's black
Everything's black
It's as black as rain

Oh ohhh oh

And the sun turned black
And the sky turned grey
And the crows all flew away
And the flowers died
And the old man cried
Yeh the stars all seemed to fade
What do I do without you
What do I do without you
What do I do without you
I'll do

If I could just go back to yesterday
I'd take it all back
I'd take it all back
I'd take it all back again

Yeh the world got lost since you went away
Everything's black
Everything's black
It's as black as rain

If I could just go back to yesterday
I'd take it all back
I'd take it all back
I'd take it all back again
Yeh the world got lost since you went away
Everything's black
Everything's black
It's as black as rain
