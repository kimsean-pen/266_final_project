I'm breaking static, I'm changing my frequency
If I don't speak out, then no one's listening
But I won't live in vain, in vain

We stand on the edge wondering, wondering
If I take one step will I live, will I sink?
We're dying for more every day, every day
So count down from ten and jump when I say
Zero
Zero

We're breaking static, just radio frequencies
If we don't speak out, then there's no one listening
Is anyone listening to me?

We stand on the edge wondering, wondering
If I take one step will I live, will I sink?
We're dying for more every day, every day
So count down from ten and jump when I say...

We won't hesitate
We won't close our eyes
We won't turn away
We're taking back our lives
We won't hesitate
We won't close our eyes
We won't turn away
We're taking back our lives for the first time
For the first time
(We won't hesitate
We won't close our eyes
We won't turn away)

We stand on the edge wondering, wondering
If I take one step will I live, will I sink?
We're dying for more every day, every day
So count down from ten and jump when I say
Zero
Zero
Zero
Zero
