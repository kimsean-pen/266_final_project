It happened the moment
when you were revealed
'cause you were a dream
that should not have been a fantasy real
You gave me this beating baby
this ryhthm inside high
well you made me feel good
'n nice 'n feel lovely
gave me paradise
so...

Shouldn't I reallize
youre the highest of the high
'n if you don't know then i'll say it
so don't ever wonder
don't ever wonder So tell me how long
how long it's gonna take until you speak baby
'cause I can't live my life
without you here by my side

You gave me the feelin' feelin', in my life so

Shouldn't I reallize
youre the highest of the high
'n if you don't know then i'll say it
so don't ever wonder
don't ever wonder (fade out)
