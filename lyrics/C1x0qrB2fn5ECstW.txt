fire in my lungs
the blood isn't red
the things i could do
if you only knew
you'd pray that i cut you loose
i feel it all the time
crawling up my spine
i was calm and composed
now you won't let it go
i told you to leave it alone
chimera, chimera
chimera, chimera
the only way i see it
you got one chance to be there
had it under control
now you won't let it go
i told you to leave it alone
chimera, chimera
yeah
chimera, chimera
chimera, chimera
chimera, chimera
better hit the road like a wanted man
say i couldn't hurt you
and of course i did
one thing is for sure
you don't understand
better keep an eye over your shoulder
you don't know if i'll ever come for you
no need now for words
this is the word
chimera, chimera
chimera, chimera
chimera, chimera
chimera, chimera
better hit the road like a wanted man
say i couldn't hurt you
and of course i did
one thing is for sure
you don't understand
better keep an eye over your shoulder
you don't know if i'll ever come for you
no need now for words
this the word
was this it? (was this it?)
was this it?
was this it? (was this it?)
was this it? (this is it)
was this it? (was this it?)
was this it?
was this it? (was this it?)
