Rah, rah, ah, ah, ah
Roma, roma, ma
Gaga, ooh la la
Want your bad romance

I want your ugly, I want your disease
I want your everything as long as it's free
I want your love
Love, love, love, I want your love

I want your psycho, your vertical stick
Want you in my rear window, baby, you're sick
I want your love
Love, love, love, I want your love
(Love, love, love, I want your love)

You know that I want you
And you know that I need you
('Cause I'm a freak, baby)
I want it bad, bad romance

I want your love, and I want your revenge

You and me could write a bad romance
I want your love, and all your love is revenge
You and me could write a bad romance

Oh, caught in a bad romance

Walk, walk, fashion, baby
Work it, move that thing, crazy
Walk, walk, fashion, baby
Work it, move that thing, crazy

Walk, walk, fashion, baby
Work it, move that thing, crazy
Walk, walk, passion, baby
Work it, I'm a freak, baby

I want your love, and I want your revenge
I want your love, I don't wanna be friends

Want your bad romance
(Oh, caught in a bad romance)
Want your bad romance

I want your love, and I want your revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
I want your love, and all your love is revenge
You and me could write a bad romance

Want your bad romance
(Oh, caught in a bad romance)
Want your bad romance
Want your bad romance
(Oh, caught in a bad romance)

Rah, rah, ah, ah, ah
Roma, roma, ma
Gaga, ooh la la
Want your bad romance
