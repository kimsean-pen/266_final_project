Now there was a time
When you loved me so
I could have been wrong
But now you needed to know
See, I've been a bad, bad, bad, bad man
And I'm in deep, yea
I found a brand new love for this man
And I can't wait till you see
I can't wait

So how you like me now
How you like me now
How you like me now
How you like me now

How you like me now
How you like me now
How you like me now
How you like me now

Remember the time
When I eat you up
Yeah, I wasn't lyin'
That you can't give up

If I was to cheat
Oh no, would you see right through me
If I sing a sad, sad, sad, sad song
Would you give it to me

Would you...
So how you like me now
How you like me now
How you like me now
How you like me now

How you like me now
How you like me now
How you like me now
How you like me now

Does that make you love me baby
Does that make you want me baby
Does that make you love me baby
Does that make you want me baby
