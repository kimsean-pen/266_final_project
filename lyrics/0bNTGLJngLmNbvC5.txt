Out of our head
Out of our mind
Into your hands
Into your eye
Warm in your mouth
Warm in your mind
Warm in your belly
Just like a drug
Sha la la la
Cool on your tongue
Soft in your hands
Down on the floor
Red in your mind
Out of our head
Out of our mind
Into your head
Just like a drug
Sha la la
Sha la la la
Hard in your hands
Hard in your mind
Hard in your belly
Hard in your face
Down on the floor
Hard in your mind
Into your head
Just like a drug
Sha la la la
Sha la la la
