Care to be clean
Purse to be free
You spilled my blood
That's what curt signs mean

There's poison in them
Drunken pretense
And it makes no sense to me

I knew all along
You would become a rope

Thought I'd go up in flames, is that alright?
Strike the match and set me alight
You can watch my fire burn bright
'Cause babes never die, babes never die

Keep the [?] for another who [?]
I'm not going to be cut this time
When I go I'll be the one who decides
'Cause babes never die, babes never die

Watch if I float, damned if I don't
Watch if I float, damned if I don't
Watch if I float, damned if I don't
Watch if I float, damned if I don't

All this time I was waiting for you to go and tell me all the things I've done wrong
Thank my lucky stars you're here to tell me all the things that I've done wrong
Go and tell me all the things that I've done wrong

Babes never die!
Babes never die!
Babes never die!
Babes never die!
