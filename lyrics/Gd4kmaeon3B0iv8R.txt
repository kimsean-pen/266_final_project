Uh

You ain't got only one time,
'cause we got only one life.
So if you're up for tonight
Yeah, yeah

We're gonna dance 'till we're high,
you know I'm out of my mind.
I only put it full time,
Yeah, yeah

Uh

I see your thirsty eyes,
you're waiting for the bright light.
Just follow me tonight,
'case now you're killing my vibe.

Shut up, let us have fun,
Rock up like we so punk,
We're living the good life,
(Good life) good life.

Good nights become good times,
We stay up the whole night
We're living the good life
Good life

Shut up, let us have fun,
Rock up like we so punk,
We're living the good life,
(Good life) good life.

Good nights become good times,
We stay up the whole night
We're living the good life
Good life

Uh

Let's start living my live,
Like in the night's desire
No worries if it feels right,
it's right.

Turn up the damn pulse,
now we gonna go slow,
just wanna let it go, let it go.

I see your thirsty eyes,
you're waiting for the bright light.
Just follow me tonight,
'case now you're killing my vibe.

Shut up, let us have fun,
Rock up like we so punk,
We're living the good life,
(Good life) good life.

Good nights become good times,
We stay up the whole night
We're living the good life
Good life

Shut up, let us have fun,
Rock up like we so punk,
We're living the good life,
(Good life) good life.

Good nights become good times,
We stay up the whole night
We're living the good life
Good life
