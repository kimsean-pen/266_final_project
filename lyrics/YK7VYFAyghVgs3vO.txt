This stays in this room
Don't take it with you
If I told the truth
Then what would you do

How can we rely
Demand and supply
If you said goodbye
Would that be a lie

Breathe aloud
I promise it won't freak me out
I'm not running away
Awkward mouth
I wanna hear that broken sound
Tell me to stay
Oh I'm not running away

Too far to be near
Are you really here
It's alright to be scared
I feel you had fear

Breathe aloud
I promise it won't freak me out
I'm not running away
Awkward mouth
I wanna hear that broken sound
Tell me to stay

Oh I'm not running away (Breathe aloud)
(I promise it won't freak me out)
(I'm not running away)

Oh I'm not running away (Awkward mouth)
(I wanna hear that broken sound)
(Tell me to stay)

Oh I'm not running away (Breathe aloud)
(A voice that would freak me out)
(Not running away)

Not running away (Awkward mouth)
(I wanna hear that broken sound)
(Tell me to stay)

I'm not running away
