When I find the sweet hereafter
Put a blanket on my soul
Cast a shadow on my heart
Slide the chain across my door

Ever turning all the seasons
Ever fading all the days
And if there ever was a reason
I just haven't found a way

To fall like rain
Fall like rain
Fall like rain
Fall like rain
Only to rise again

I was longing for the wind
On the tress begin to sway
But I never grow my wings
No, I never fly away

For the anchor of my love
To which my heart is bound
Is [?] for the cage
That keepes me on the ground

To fall like rain
Fall like rain
Fall like rain
Fall like rain
Only to rise again

Now I'm dreaming to myself
With a tear behind my eye
For a shelter is my mind
In the quiet of the night

Ever turning all the seasons
Ever fading all the days
And if there ever was a reason
I just haven't found a way

To fall like rain
Fall like rain
Fall like rain
Fall like rain
Only to rise again
