I never thought it was anything
I never thought the feeling seemed so small
I never thought at all

You couldn't see what it meant to me
You couldn't see the writing on the wall
You couldn't see at all

You take me too seriously
I'm fine, the feelings go to ground
I know what I have found

Stop trying to take it away from me
I'm fine, I guess I'm heading soured
I'm always falling down
You're only fooling around

Was I the one that took you for a ride
Was I the one who held the wheel too long
I never was that strong

You never told me what was happening
You never told me where this could have gone
Before our time moved on

You take me too seriously
I'm fine, the feelings go to ground
I know what I have found

Stop trying to take it away from me
I'm fine, I guess I'm heading soured
I'm always falling down
You're only fooling around

I never thought it was anything
You take me too seriously
You couldn't see what it meant to me
I'm always falling down
Was I the one that took you for a ride
You take me too seriously
You never told me what was happening

You take me too seriously
I'm fine, the feelings go to ground
I know what I have found

Stop trying to take it away from me
I'm fine, I guess I'm heading soured
I'm always falling down
You're only fooling around
