All Around The World
We could make time
Rompin' and a stompin'
'Cause I'm in my prime
Born in the north
And sworn to entertain ya
'Cause I'm down for
The state of Pennsylvania

I try not to whine
But I must warn ya
'Bout the mother fucking girls
From California

Alabama baby
Said hallelujah
Good God girl
I wish I knew ya

I know I know for sure
That life is beautiful Around The World
I know I know it's you
You say hello and then I say I do

Come back baby
'Cause I'd like to say
I've been Around The World
Back from Bombay

Fox hole love
Pie in your face
Living in and out
Of a big fat suitcase

Bonafide ride
Step aside my Johnson
Yes I could
In the woods of Wisconsin

Wake up the cake
It's a lake she's kissin' me
As they do when
When they do in Sicily

I know I know for sure
That life is beautiful Around The World
I know I know it's you
You say hello and then I say I do

Where you wanna go
Who you wanna be
What you wanna do
Just come with me

I saw God
And I saw the fountains
You and me girl
Sittin' in the swiss mountains

Oh me oh my oh
Me and guy ho
Freer than a bird
'Cause were rockin' Ohio

Around The World
I feel dutiful
Take a wife
'Cause life is beautiful
I know I know for sure
ding ding dong dong ding ding dong dong ding ding
I know I know it's you
ding ding dong dong ding ding dong dong ding ding
Mother Russia do not suffer
I know you're bold enough
I've been Around The World
And I have seen your love
I know I know it's you
You say hello then I say I do.
