It's run and...
It's run and...

It can't be easy
Holding fast to our dreams
City to city
Moving at the same speed

Beauty is skin deep
Looking for the in between
It doesn't take just anything
To bring out the extreme

We live to keep score
For us it's run and go
For us it's all we know
It's run and go

We think ahead how to force out
We run and go
For us it's in our bones
It's run and go

We live to keep score
For us it's run and go
For us it's all we know
It's run and go

We think ahead how to force out
We run and go
For us it's in our bones
It's run and go

It's run and...
It's run and...
It's run and go...
It's run and...

We live to keep score
For us it's run and go
For us it's all we know
It's run and go

We think ahead how to force out
We run and go
For us it's in our bones
It's run and go

We live to keep score
For us it's run and go
For us it's all we know
It's run and go

We think ahead how to force out
We run and go
For us it's in our bones
It's run and go

It's run and...
