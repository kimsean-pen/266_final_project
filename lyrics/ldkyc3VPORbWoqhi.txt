All trees are oaks
And all birds are blue
In the mountains of a magnet
Are the mountains of you

I'm proud of my genius just like a painter
and dumb like a poet I think I can, I think I can
Just say it, From the throats, From the throats of our wrists
With full sets of teeth, Vanilla almond teeth
From vanilla almond tea
Spent afternoons, Spent afternoons, Measuring time in spoons

Where forget-me-nots and marigolds and other things
That don't get old, Just don't get old
But between one June and September you're all I rememember
But I'm a lantern, my head a moon
I married a room. I married a room

All trees are oaks
And all birds are blue
Well I do

What's 80 miles in Canada or 18 years in mountain time, time
A southern run for a late longing to drink
All trees are oaks and all birds are blue, Well I do
All trees are oaks and all birds are blue, I do

I thought everyone was you

Where forget-me-nots and marigolds and other things
That don't get old, Just don't get old
Between one June and September
You're all I remember
But I'm a lantern, My head a moon
I married a room I married a room

Forget me not's and marigolds
And other things that do't get old
(Forget-me-nots and marigolds)
But between one June and september you're all I remember
(Forget-me-nots and marigolds)
I'm a lantern, My head a moon. I married a room.
(Forget-me-nots and marigold)

Where I'll keep my hands in order
And what about the air, The air lying awake
And what about the air, The air, lying awake.
What about about the air, The air, lying awake.
