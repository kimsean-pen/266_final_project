Open up my eyes
To no surprise the light is blinding, just like the sun
No matter, I try
To face my pounding head
I need a solution

Drinking for breakfast
Has become a routine I've invested in
When my life is the mess that it's been
Perpetuality
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever
This probably never ends

Fucked up and calling for a ride
Had shit to do today
It's showing in my eyes
That I am fading away
It's an average day
Fuck, life hits you fast
One moment you're fine
And the next day you're stuck in a trap
Of the habits you have
Where is the glass?
Pour me up, I'll just drink 'til it passes

Is this what I had planned for my life?
I need a hand of some type
To pull me up and break this cycle of...

Drinking for breakfast
A routine I've invested in
My life is the mess that it's always been
Perpetuality festers for ever and ever when...

I'm drinking for breakfast
A routine I've invested in
My life is a mess
And perpetuality festers
And ever and ever and ever and ever
And never win

Fuck!
Goddamn it!
