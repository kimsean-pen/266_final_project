You held me down and took the fight
To the heart of my life
You set me up all of this time
Yeah, you did this

I am black and blue
(Oh yeah you took your shot)
And facing you
(Yeah you took your shot)
You've got me firmly in your sights
(You took your shot)
Come on and do this

It's time to make your move
It's time to make your move
It's time to make your move
It's time to make your move

And I am back and blue
(Oh yeah you took your shot)
And facing you
(Yeah you took your shot)

It's time to make your move
It's time to make your move

It's time to make your move
It's time to make your move
