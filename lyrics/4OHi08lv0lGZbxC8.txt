How did you know 'cause I never told
But you found out I've got a crush on you
The words you read, my heart's been displayed
You found out I've got a crush on you

You must have heard it from my best friend
She's always talkin' when she should be listenin'
Can't keep a secret to save her life
But still I trusted her with all I felt inside

I never knew a rumor could spread so fast
'Cause now the word is out all over town
That I'm longing for you

How did you know 'cause I never told
But you found out I've got a crush on you
The words you read, my heart's been displayed
You found out I've got a crush on you

Maybe I was the one who left the trace
Was there a message written on my face
Were my emotions so easily read
That you would know my thoughts before a word was said

Was it my eye that let you know you had control
Because the way you moved was so self assured
You knew I would surrender

How did you know 'cause I never told
You found out I've got a crush on you
The words you read, my heart's been displayed
You found out I've got a crush on you

Oh? oh? oh? oh? oh? oh?
Oh? oh? oh? oh? oh? oh? oh?
How did you know 'cause I never told
You found out I've got a crush on you

The words you read, my heart's been displayed
You found out I've got a crush on you
You found out I've got a crush on you
You found out I've got a crush on you
You found out I've got a crush on you
You found out I've got a crush on you
You found out I've got a crush on you
Crush on you
Crush on you
Crush on you
