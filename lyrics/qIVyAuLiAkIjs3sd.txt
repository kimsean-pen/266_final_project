She plays wipe out on the drums
The squirrels and the birds come
Gather 'round and sing the guitar
Oh I have you got nothing to say?

When all words fail she speaks
Her mix tape's a masterpiece
Walks through the garden so the roses can see
Oh I have you got nothing to say?

And you can see Daisies in her footsteps
Dandelions, butterflies, I wanna be Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate

Everyday she wears the same thing
I think she smokes pot
She's everything I want, she's everything I'm not
Oh I have you got nothing to say?

She never gets wet, she smiles and it's a rainbow
And she speaks and she breathes, I wanna be Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate

Down by Rosemary and Cameron
She hands out the Bhagavad Gita
I see her around every couple days
I wanna see her so that I can say hey Kate

She never gets wet, she smiles and it's a rainbow
You can see, I wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna
Wanna be Kate, Kate, Kate, no, no Kate, Kate, Kate
No, no, no, no, no, no
