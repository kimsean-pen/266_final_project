Meet me in the blue bed
I'll be drawing out your flaws
And clawing at what's caused
My knees to tremble
Meet me in the back shed
I'll be hanging up the knives
Humming melodies that rhyme
Building castles out of shovels

Hang my head about
As if we never had the time
To draw it on the walls
What's all the trouble
Push my mind around
As if it's warming up your hands
As if it's softer than the land
All soaked and supple

Don't be afraid if it's a little bit close
I built a kingdom of your throes
I'm seeing double
Don't be afraid if there's no wind in my hair
There's a stillness left in there
I'm seeing double

I'm seeing double, I, oh
I'm seeing double, double
Ah-ah, uh-oh
I'm seeing double, double

Dry it out for days
And then I'll beckon every rain
I'll hover like refrain
O push the cloud out
Meet me in the back shed
Throw the wind and he'll not pause
Hold up what's cast and listen close
To how my knees prey

O pry the door from it's post
I've been hiding out for days
And nothing's growing
There's a breath left in there
O I would say
Wait for the storm
Take it away
I'm seeing double

Don't be afraid if it's a little bit close
I built a kingdom of your throes
I'm seeing double
Don't be afraid if there's no wind in my hair
There's a stillness left in there
I'm seeing double

I'm seeing double, I, oh
I'm seeing double, double
Ah-ah, uh-oh
I'm seeing double, double

I built a kingdom of your throats (don't be afraid)
But it's a little bit close (if it's a little bit close)
There is a stillness in our woes (don't be afraid)
If it's a little bit cold (if it's a little bit cold)
(Sound)
