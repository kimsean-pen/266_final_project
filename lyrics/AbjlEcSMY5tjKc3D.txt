Said you wouldn't be home late tonight
I gave up waiting at seventeen past midnight
Now my only company's a half full glass of wine

You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge.

You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge.

It's been so long since I held your hand, you don't know how hard it can be.

I Thank god I've been blessed with a patient mind
Because what I want to happen won't happen in a very long time.
Now my only company's a half full glass of wine.

You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge.

You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge.

You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge.

It's been so long since I held your hand, you don't know how hard it can be.
