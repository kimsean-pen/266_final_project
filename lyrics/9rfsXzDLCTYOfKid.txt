It's easy to fall in love
It's easy to fall in love with you

It's easy to fall in love
It's easy to fall in love with you

You go outside dressed like that
You knew what was going to happen didn't you
You talk to me like that
You knew I was slowly falling in love with you

And I... ooh

And I... ooh

You know it's your neglect
is the reason that I'm so obsessed with you
And when I asked you your name you said John Wayne
And I guess it's true
Coz then you shot me down
Doubled over and I hit the ground right in front of you
I guess in the Wild West
it's ok to shoot the pest that's annoying you

And I... ooh

And I... ooh

It's easy to fall in love
It's easy to be alone
It's easy to hate yourself
when all your love is inside someone else
It's easy to take it all
It's easy to give it to
when there's more people out there to love
than people who love you

And I... ohh

It's easy to fall in love
(It's easy to fall in love with you)
The reason that I'm so obsessed
(You knew what was going to happen didn't you)
I guess in the Wild West
(You knew I was slowly falling in love with you)
It's easy to fall in love
It's easy to fall in love with you
