Usher
Yeah, man

So we back in the club
With our bodies rocking from side to side, side-side to side
Thank God the week is done
I feel like a zombie gone back to life, back-back to life

Hands up
And suddenly, we all got our hands up
No control of my body
Ain't I seen you before?
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes, eye-eyes

'Cause baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah, baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
So dance, dance
Like it's the last, last night of your life, life
Gon' get you right
'Cause baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again

Keep downing drinks like there's
No tomorrow, there's just right now, now, now, na-na-now, now
Gon' set the roof on fire
Gonna burn this motherfucker down, down, down, da-da-down, down

Hands up
When the music drops, we both put our hands up
Put your hands on my body
Swear I've seen you before
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes, eye-eyes

'Cause baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah, baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
So dance, dance
Like it's the last, last night of your life, life
Gon' get you right
'Cause baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again

Usher, don't lie!
Hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil
Get it, baby, hope you catch that like T.O
That's how we roll
My life is a movie and you just TiVo
Mami got me twisted like a dreadlock
She don't wrestle, but I got her in a headlock
Yabba-dabba-doo, make her bedrock
Mami on fire, red hot
Bada bing, bada boom
Mr. Worldwide as I step in the room
I'm a hustler, baby, but that, you knew
And tonight it's just me and you, dale

'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah, baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love, falling in love
So dance, dance
Like it's the last, last night of your life life
Gon' get you right
'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah, baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
So dance, dance
Like it's the last, last night of your life, life
Gon' get you right
'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again

Yeah
Thank you, DJ
