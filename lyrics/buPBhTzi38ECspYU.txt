Listen honey
Let me see you smile
Don't be look at me funny
You got a better style

See me coming
Don't look the other way
Don't start running
You stole my heart away

Don't give me that runaround
You know I treat you fine
You don't understand the way I feel
Got my heart rolling like a wheel

I'm in the black (I'm in), I'm in the black (I'm in)
I'm in the black again
Can't go back (can't go), can't go back (can't go)
Can't be who I was back then

It's only me (only me), it's only me (only me)
It's only me outside your door
Let me be (let me), let me be (let me)
I'm the one you're waiting for

Here me talking
You hear what I say
I see you walking
Every time it makes my day

Got a notion
I might stay a while
If you fall in the ocean
I'll swim a hundred miles

Coming over to ask you out
Ah, honey, please say yes
I don't like it when you stomp and pout
I don't like it when you run your mouth

I'm in the black (I'm in), I'm in the black (I'm in)
I'm in the black again
Can't go back (can't go), can't go back (can't go)
Can't be who I was back then

It's only me (only me), it's only me (only me)
It's only me outside your door
Let me be (let me), let me be (let me)
I'm the one you're waiting for

You're a vision
Make me shout out loud
I made my decision
Goodbye to the old crowd

Send you a message
I've gotta chance my arm
Scramble through the wreckage
To keep you safe from harm

I'm gonna be right around your house
I hope you're good to go
If you're not, it's gonna hit me hard
I'm gonna fold up like a house of cards

I'm in the black (I'm in), I'm in the black (I'm in)
I'm in the black again
Can't go back (can't go), can't go back (can't go)
Can't be who I was back then

It's only me (only me), it's only me (only me)
It's only me outside your door
Let me be (let me), let me be (let me)
I'm the one you're waiting for
