Late last night, I lost track of time
And I knew I was waiting for the sun to rise
These summer days, they keep stretching on
As our friend's in and out of time and tide
We spent our nights hoping for nice things
We should have known, don't need nice things
What's that, don't know your way back home?
You want to know why?
All this time and you read my mind, you read my mind
All those thoughts that I knew you'd find
I hid between the lines
We could dress for anywhere else
It's been a long, long time since your kingdom fell
But I can hear something over these engines
It sounds like ghosts in the back seat of your car
It sounds like our mysteries in skin
Just to steal away again
All this time and you read my mind, you read my mind
All those thoughts that I knew you'd find
I hid between the lines
All this time and you read my mind, you read my mind
Those countries where we could have been
I left them all behind
Why would you bother the hurt your among?
When all that you needed was here all along
All this time and you read my mind, you read my mind
All those thoughts that I knew you'd find
I hid between the lines
All this time and you read my mind, you read my mind
Those countries where we could have been
We left them all behind
