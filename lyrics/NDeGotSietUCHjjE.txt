Wild, wild

I go wild, 'cause you break me open
Wild 'cause you left me here
I go wild 'cause your promises are broken

Wild because the chips are down
Wild because there isn't anybody else around
Wild when the waves start to break
And God knows they're breaking in me now
I go wild because it doesn't make sense
For me to cry out in my own defense
And wild because I would do anything
To tear you off your precious fence

So this is what it's like living in limbo
First I'm high, then I'm so low

I go wild 'cause you break me open
Wild 'cause you left me here
I go wild 'cause your promises are broken
Wild when I know you're near
I go wild
I go wild...

Tell me what you've come here for
Moving like a hunter through my back door
Leaving the perfume of all you adore
To die nameless on my floor
Yeah, well we both know that you don't play fair
I guess you really think that you'd get me there
Let's be honest, perhaps it's alright
It's too much for even you to bear

You've got some nerve to come back here
You're not the only one who can smell fear

I go wild 'cause you break me open
Wild 'cause you left me here
I go wild 'cause your promises are broken
Wild, don't you get it dear
You're not the only one who runs on instincts
No, I got instincts of my own

You've got a lot of nerve to come back
Plan your attack and I am still waiting
Did you want something?
You wrote the rules to try and contain me
You broke them now, you'll haven't tamed me
And I'm wild
I go wild

Tell me what you've come here for
What is it you adore, won't you tell me?
What would you cry for?
Swallow your pride for?
What would you, oh, go wild for?

You've got a lot of nerve to come back here
Speak up now, darling, I have been waiting

I go wild 'cause you break me open
Wild 'cause you left me here
I go wild 'cause your promises are broken
Wild, don't you get it dear?
You're not the only one who runs on instincts
No, I got instincts of my own

You got a lot of nerve to come back
Plan your attack, and I am still waiting
Did you want something?
You wrote the rules to try and contain me
You broke them now, you haven't tamed me
And I'm wild...

Oh, oh, oh...
Wild...
Tell me what you've come for...
I go wild...
Like a hunter...
Tell me what you've come for...
(come back here)

La da da da da da

Like a hunter...

Communication is not just words.
Communication is architecture.
Because of course it is quite obvious
That a house which would be built without the sense,
Without that desire for communication
Would not look the way your house looks today.
