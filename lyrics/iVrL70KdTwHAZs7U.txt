Everyone stares when you walk in the room
They stare when you go
You've got so much control
How could anyone say no
They rarely do
That's why you're you
And why you're winning

And I don't even miss you at all
No no

Caught in the light, you would idly spin
Your skeleton ring
See it shine when you sing
To the window with no meaning
From Tennessee your harmony
Would leave your spirit

And I don't even miss you at all
No no

Silver the shores of isles I've known
Boulevards of dancing boats

You keep the old ember burning
With meadows in mind
As the coaches go by
These thoughts of you will die
They rarely do
That's why you're you
And why you're winning

And I don't even miss you at all
No no

Silver the shores of isles I've known
Boulevards of dancing boats

Silver the shores of isles I've known
