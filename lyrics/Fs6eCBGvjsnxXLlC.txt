Just kind of float around the house,
my white noise, it always howls,
and I'm dancing to the motion of what I need,
when you just want to dance with me,
just kind of goes back to the old
half-assed tries and the Pigtown mold,
I was much better then, when we started again,
you're the better half best of me
grip me,
grab me down,
paint me certain,
paint me yours,
I should know, it's where you take it from,
where you take it to, and what you take it for,
our sugar was earned so let's take it some more,
white like the lack of paint behind the radiator,
paint me,
white like the blue bottle bedside reflection,
paint me,
back then it was too early to tell, too early to see,
just kind of float around the house,
my white noise sings a howling sound,
and keep dancing to the motion of what I need,
and your dancing is all I see.
