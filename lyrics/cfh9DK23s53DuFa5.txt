So you sayin' that you want me baby
That you want me baby
Like that, like that, like
Don't you think that I learned my lesson
From the time you dropped me out
But maybe I said that I want you baby
That I want you baby
Like that, like that, like
And play a little game of my own
Just to get my, get my own back

Yeah, it's time to show you what you walked out on
Time to get inside your head
So pick up your jacket, honey, fix up, look sharp
It's my time to mess you up

I'll cross my heart and hope to die
That you're the only one
I'll build your hopes up just to
Watch them come tumbling down
I love you then, I love you not
Did I commit? Oops I forgot
I'll cross my heart and hope to die
Before I cut and run

So you have the cheek to call me baby
Call me up and try it, on it, on it, on
Like the last time that you spoke to me
You didn't have me so I'm done
I'll admit you really hurt me baby
Really hurt me, it wasn't fun, no fun, no
But now I'm getting pretty good at this game
And I won't stop till I've won

So pick up your jacket, honey, fix up, look sharp
It's my time to mess you up

I'll cross my heart and hope to die
That you're the only one
I'll build your hopes up just to
Watch them come tumbling down
I love you then, I love you not
Did I commit? Oops I forgot
I'll cross my heart and hope to die
Before I cut and run
I'll cross my heart and hope to die
Before I cut and run

How predictable
That you should get in touch
Just as soon as you see
Me blowing up, yeah
I'm doing well and you want a piece
But, honey, can't you see I'm over this?
Yeah, how predictable
You're so predictable
