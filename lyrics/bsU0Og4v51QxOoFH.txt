I've never had clouds follow me each day
Years of sun that never went away
I lie here awake but I'm not one to pray
Everything's changed and now I'm not okay

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
I am falling apart
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Now I'm scared of the dark

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
All I can hear is my heart
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh, ooh-ooh

I need you to bring me home
I need you to bring me home
My life is out of control
I need you to bring me home

Yeah, I know, yeah, I know
This ain't forever
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know
I will get better

If I go, if I go
And lose it ever
I'll need you to bring me home

I'm rattled this time, can someone lift my chin?
Keep my head above water 'fore I'm too deep in
I've never had problems, where do I begin?
But it's not a problem, I'm just being human

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
I am falling apart
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Now I'm scared of the dark

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
All I can hear is my heart
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh, ooh-ooh

I need you to bring me home
I need you to bring me home
My life is out of control
I need you to bring me home

Yeah, I know, yeah, I know
This ain't forever
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know
I will get better

If I go, if I go
And lose it ever
I'll need you to bring me home

I am breaking down
I am losing my patience
They say that winding roads
Lead to great destinations

But I'm so far from home
Can you help me to change this?
Can you help me to change this?

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
I am falling apart
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Now I'm scared of the dark

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
All I can hear is my heart
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh, ooh-ooh

I need you to bring me home
I need you to bring me home
My life is out of control
I need you to bring me home

Yeah, I know, yeah, I know
This ain't forever
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know
I will get better

If I go, if I go
And lose it ever
I'll need you to bring me home
