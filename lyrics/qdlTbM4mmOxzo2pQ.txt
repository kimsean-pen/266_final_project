It's a sunny day on the west coast
And currently my shades are drawn
My TV's on
I haven't left this place for days
It's funny how things change

I take what I get
And I throw it away
And I break it
I had everything and you took it from me
And I hate it
My thoughts run fast from me
Like a lethal injection

Like a lethal injection

Why does the world as I know it
Keep on bringing me down
Do my best to hide it
But it keeps bringing me... Down
No matter how hard that I try to climb
I'll be pulled back down again
Why does the world, as I know it
Keep on bringing me down

Keep on bringing me down
Keep on bringing me down

It's 5PM and I'm still locked in
And my guitar's tuned wrong

My voice is gone
I haven't seen sunlight in days
It's funny how things change

I take what I get and I throw it away
And I break it
I had everything
And you took it from me

And i hate it
My thoughts run fast from me
Like a lethal injection
Like a lethal injection

Why does the world,
As I know it
Keep on bringing me down
Do my best
To hide it
But it keeps on bringing me... (down)
No matter how hard that I try to climb
I'll be pulled back down again

Why does the world,
As I know it
Keep on bringing me down
Keep on bringing me down
Keep on bringing me down

Why does the world,
As I know it
Keep on bringing me down
Do my best
To hide it
But it keeps on bringing me... (down)
No matter how hard that I try to climb
I'll be pulled back down again
Why does the world,
As I know it
Keep on bringing me down
Keep on bringing me down
Keep on bringing me down
