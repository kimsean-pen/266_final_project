In the eye of eyes, the mind of minds
We paint the truth and then defend it
Meet yourself, find your hell
But keep believing you've got the answers
Climb inside the mirror
Backward, the words
"Darkness is a perspective"
And we've got our heads in dirt

I've been watching the ego work
I've been watching the ego work

A toxic tongue, a song unsung
We know the signs, we know possession
Feel the rage manipulate us
Just beyond the looking glass
Down the tunnel, go ask Alice
Tender nerves spin the earth
We've got our heads in dirt

I've been watching the ego work
I've been watching the ego work

Climb inside the mirror
Backward, the words
"Darkness is a perspective"
And we've got our heads in dirt

I've been watching the ego work
I've been watching the ego work
I've been watching the ego work
I've been watching the ego work
