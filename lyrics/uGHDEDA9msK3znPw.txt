On my mind
Sit out in the car and cry
Waste my time
Don't you ever wonder why
We're not fine
Foggy morning afterglow
Panicked rhyme
Static on the radio

Play your part
Don't let me down
Eat my heart
Brawling going pound for pound
Frozen ground
I'll be in the lost and found

I wanted to
Shoot you down
You'll move on
I move slow
Keep control

Never think about god damn dying when I'm floating on the ice
Never think about the sun when I'm floating through the night
Never think about you and I'm feeling alright

I want to know
Do you think the ice will hold
Spell your name
Feet parting seas of snow
Feeling
Cattails dying in the cold
