Horse, you left yourself at the beginning
That's the place they said that we would fall
Now horse is just a game out there for winning
Horses in a field sweep in the mud

She ran out, she thought she heard them whinny
I don't think I'd jump a horse, nuh-uh
Some just see four-legged foals for petting
Horses in a stall chewing on straw

Our modern tweakers, they don't need their horses
Some horses, for an apple they will part
As we ascended from the time of horses
I wondered if the horses missed their job

I am old story
I am a horse story
I am old story
I am a horse story

We'll kick them off, we'll kick them off
We'll kick them off, we'll kick them off
We'll kick them off, we'll kick them off
We'll kick them off, we'll kick them off
We'll kick them off, we'll kick them off
We'll kick them off, we'll kick them off
We'll kick them off, we'll kick them off
Off, off, off, off, off, off, off, off, off
