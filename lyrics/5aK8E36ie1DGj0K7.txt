Spent our time
In an apartment
Growing exhausted
A beheaded sun king
Who hadn't come out since
The first white fell
Upon the balcony
Where before we would melt
Flock of three
Pigeons hatching
I considered cracking
Their eggs from our house
Instead we watched them grow
Fed them in a row
Sweet avoidance
For what we already know

That we feel like giving up
Why's there so much trouble?
Go and lay under another
Feels warm like summer

I knocked my tooth out on a swing
So high and not realizing
The come down it would bring
My eyes go running like a fountain

Cause I feel like giving up
Why's there so much trouble?
Go and lay under another
Feels warm like summer

You and I fall away
Sway my fate deciding we are friends
It's over now it's over
So nice to think of when we slept in the same bed
I wake up on my side with you still on my mind
Kneel down again to what's no longer mine
If you ever wonder now know you're always in my heart
And there is no end, and there is no start
Because you're always in my heart
There is no end, and there is no start
Because you're always in my heart
