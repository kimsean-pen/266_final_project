How do you get out of bed in the morning
How do you wait to carry the day

Yeah i sing for pleasure
Ive sang for pain
Im still half way to nowhere
Im still nothing today

They tell me good things come to those who wait
Despite the process along that came from fame

Yeah i sing for pleasure
Ive sang for pain
Im still halfway to nowhere
Im still nothing today
Yeah i sing for pleasure
Ive sang for pain
Im still halfway to nowhere
Im still nothing today
