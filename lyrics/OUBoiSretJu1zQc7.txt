If you shared all these loves of mine
Could you hold these feelings in time?
I know you're gonna leave this place behind

Can you see yourself in a new place?
Can you call me when you find your space?
With your new friends and feelings
The sweet circle of blush on your face

I pet your head I know I can't find my place
I just don't want to be forgotten now
Cause I know it's hard to love someone
That's too far to hold onto

I don't want you to slip away
Even if I don't have much to say
I know that me and you are important in each other's lives

Me and you were friends that day
You said that band everyone thought was gay
Really meant the world to you

And I know, I know
It's hard to love someone that's too far to hold onto
So don't wake up now
We'll figure this out somehow

I can't fade
Lay in all day
What did you want me to say?
Just don't go away
