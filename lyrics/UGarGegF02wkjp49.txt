We walked arm in arm
But I didn't feel his touch
The desire I'd first tried to hide
That tingling inside was gone
And when he asked me:
'do you still love me?'
I had to look away
I didn't want to tell him
That my heart grows colder with each day

When you've loved so long
That the thrill is gone
And your kisses at night
Are replaced with tears
And when your dreams are on
A train to train-wreck town
Then I ask you now, what's a girl to do?

He said he'd take me away
That we'd work things out
And I didn't want to tell him
But it was then I had to say
Over the times we've shared
It's all blackened out
And my bat lightning heart
Wants to fly away

When you've loved so long
That the thrill is gone
And your kisses at night
Are replaced with tears
And when your dreams are on
A train to train-wreck town
Then I ask you now, what's a girl to do?
What's a girl to do? x3
