We is them ghetto witches
Speaking in tongue bitches
Fall on the floor
Got sage on the door

We is them ghetto witches
Speaking in tongue bitches
Fall on the floor
Got sage on the door

We is them ghetto witches
Speaking in tongue bitches
Fall on the floor
Got sage on the door

We is them ghetto witches

Talk shit, we can cast spells
Long weaves, long nails
Corn rows, pig tails
Baby fathers still in jail
Good witches, I fuck with
Bad bitches, we run shit
Four bitches, four corners
North, East, West, South shit
Good witches, I fuck with
Hopped off of my broomstick
Witchcraft, bitch craft
Light magic, it's nothing

Orisha, my alter
Orisha, my alter
Orisha, my alter
Got coins on the counter

I'm that Black a-Rican bruja straight out from the Yoruba
And my people come from Africa diaspora, Cuba
And you mix that Arawak, that original people
I'm that Black Native American, I vanquish all evil
I'm that Black a-Rican bruja straight out from the Yoruba
And my ancestors Nigerian, my grandmas was brujas
And I come from an island and it's called Puerto Rico
And it's one of the smallest but it got the most people

Orisha, my alter
Orisha, my alter
Orisha, my alter
Got coins on the counter

Orisha, my alter
Orisha, my alter
Orisha, my alter

Don't you fuck with my energy
Don't you fuck with my energy
Don't you fuck with my energy
Don't you fuck with my energy
Don't you fuck with my energy
Don't you fuck with my energy
Don't you fuck with my energy
Don't you fuck with my energy

Casting spells with my cousins
I'm the head of this coven
I'm a shapeshifting bitch, you don't know who you loving
Better light you a candle
I heard the nighttime was black
And if you don't watch your step the greatest bitch will be back
I cast a circle in white and I can vanquish your spite
And if you hex me with hate then I'ma conjour the light
Your evil ways put no fight
I ain't no queen of the night
I'm a bruja, I'm a bruja, and I'ma dress in all white

I'm your supreme
I'm your supreme
I'm your supreme
I'm your supreme
I'm your supreme
I'm your supreme
I'm your supreme
I'm your supreme
