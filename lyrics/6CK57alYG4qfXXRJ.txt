I can feel
These circles will always touch in more than one point.
Repelled and pulled towards each other: repelled again.
Unconditional projection alternates with short,
Fervid intervals of perfection and boundless bonding.

But be sure: trust needs to be reevaluated
While our ageing promises turn to plights
And their weight and meaning changes.
Differing sizes of intersections:
Territories abandoned, lost and reclaimed.
Everything's in constant motion.

So let them live with the contradictions
Between what they call passion
And the constraints of our modern living
Which leave no space for the arational.

And most importantly,
Let them have confidence and peace.
Let them be powerless.
But most surprisingly,
They're not afraid of how they'll feel
When they come closer.

All these restrictions are self-inflicted:
Let them be helpless.
Let them embrace symbols of commitment
To compensate for the lack of it.

I can feel
These circles will always touch in more than one point.
Repelled and pulled towards each other: repelled again.
Regulations and restrictions determine how we live
And what we've got to give.

But be sure: trust needs to be reevaluated
While our ageing promises turn to plights.

Change is what scares us shitless.

Most importantly,
Let them have confidence and peace.
Let them be powerless.
But most surprisingly,
They're not afraid of how they'll feel
When they come closer.

Symbols of commitment to disguise the lack of it.
Let them believe.
Let them believe in themselves.
And let them live with their contradictions.
What they call passion is just the turmoil
Caused by repression of their ambitions.
Let them believe.
