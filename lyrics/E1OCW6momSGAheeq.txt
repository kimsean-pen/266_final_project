We saw him burn within death

Can we be still
What makes you kind
From where comes
Your sparkling mind

Was it under the earth?
Tied up in a knot
Which I forgot
You were ever there

Do not be afraid
Do not be afraid

What's that I see?
I think it's The Wild
Puts the fear of God in me

And was ever thus
Up from the dust
Inconceivable love

What's that I see?
I think it's The Wild
Puts the fear of God in me
