What a drag it is
The shape I'm in
Well, I go out somewhere
Then I come home again
I light a cigarette
'Cause I can't get no sleep
Theres nothing on the TV, nothing on the radio
That means that much to me

All my life
Watching America
All my life
There's panic in America
Oh oh oh, oh
There's trouble in America
Oh oh oh, oh

Yesterday was easy
Happiness came and went
I got the movie script
But I don't know what it meant
I light a cigarette
'Cause I can't get no sleep
Theres nothing on the TV, nothing on the radio
That means that much to me
Theres nothing on the TV, nothing on the radio
That I can believe in

All my life
Watching America
All my life
There's panic in America
Oh oh oh, oh
There's trouble in America
Oh oh oh, oh
There's panic in America
Oh oh oh, oh

Yesterday was easy
Yes, I got the news
Oh, when you get it straight, you stand up, you just can't lose
Give you my confidence, all my faith in life

Don't stand me up
Don't let me down
No, I need you tonight
To hold me, say you'll be here
Hold me, say you'll be here
Hold me, say you'll be here
Hold

All my life
Watching America
All my life
There's panic in America
Oh oh oh, oh
She's just in America
Oh oh oh, oh

Tell me how does it feel
Tell me how does it feel
Tell me how does it feel
Tell me how does it feel
