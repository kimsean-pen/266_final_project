even though you're far away from me
you're in my dreams
even though you're far away from me
you're in my dreams

and it's hard to erase you from my memories
yes it's hard to erase you from my memories

the flowers are dying
now that you've left me
there's no one to hold anymore
the city is haunted
and nobody loves me

cause this is the time for loving you
but you're not here with me

even though you're far away from me
you're in my dreams
even when you're far away from me
you're in my dreams
