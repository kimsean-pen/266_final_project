Here I am believing words again
Here I am trying to find your love again
Here I am down on my knees again
Praying for a love we used to know

Both of us know how hard it is to love and let it go
Both of us know how hard it is to go on living that way
But so few know what it means to fall in love
And so few know how hard it is to live without it

Lord I must have been blind
Lord I must have been blind
Lord I must have been blind
Lord I must have been blind

To hold something real and not believe it
To live in her life and never trust it
To give all you know and never feel it
Hold back each day until it dies away

Both of us know how hard it is to love and let it go
Both of us know how hard it is to go on living that way
But so few know what it means to fall in love
And so few know how hard it is to live without it

Lord I must have been blind
Lord I must have been blind
Lord I must have been blind
