I felt no guilt 'til I was caught and I was told that I was guilty.
And even then, I wasn't really sure. (Yeah, yeah)
The thing I felt was guilt itself, though maybe it was something else.
Frustration at the fact that I was ever caught at all.

I told a lie that multiplied it by the time I realized it.
I'd given up everything I ever loved. (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause the thing you'll lack when you're looking back is the pressure to feel that you have to act.
Yeah, everything is clearer when you're looking at the past, oh no.

And I don't care if I lose,
because my heroes did, too.
They shouted, "Court should be adjourned!"
Because the jury are fools.
And the judge can't decipher his left from his right,
or his right from his wrong.
And we will bite the hand that thieves,
we will not turn the other cheek.
This is no threat, it's a promise we will keep
So what's the point pretending when we've seen behind the curtain and there's nothing much to see, oh yeah.

I felt no pain 'til I was down and I was told that I was bleeding.
And even then, I knew I wasn't done. (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause the wounds I get, they will just collect.
Assuring that I won't forget, reminders of the battles that I've lost and that I've won.

And I will fight 'til I have died, or all my enemies are allies.
And even then I will sleep with an open eye. (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause the night is long, and our bulls(?) are strong and I know that the road that I traveled on,
it only seemed so dark because we've almost reached the dawn, oh no.

And I don't care if I lose,
because my heroes did, too.
They shouted, "Court should be adjourned!"
Because the jury are fools.
And the judge can't decipher his left from his right,
or his right from his wrong.
And we will bite the hand that thieves,
we will not turn the other cheek.
This is no threat, it's a promise we will keep
So what's the point pretending when we've seen behind the curtain and there's nothing much to see, oh yeah.

And everyone will claim that they knew from the beginning,
that what they did was wrong, but they still just went on sinning.
The son and rest(?) will fear when realizing everything you know will fade away.
It haunts you deep, but you won't wanna let it go.
Some day we'll lose the war, but 'til then we will dream of winning.

I won't forget the things you said.
When I was down and I was tired of it,
the words you spoke, they brought me home.

When it was time to fight, we chose a side,
but everyone knew that something didn't feel right.
So, we stood our ground and waited for a sign.

You said, "Don't look back!"
(Oh! no!) (Oh! no!)
(Don't look back, don't look back, we've gone too far, we're too high off the ground)
(Bridges burned, lesson learned)
Don't look back!
(Oh! no!) (Oh! no!)
(Don't look back, don't look back, we've gone too far, we're too high off the ground)
(Bridges burned, lesson learned)

You said, "Don't look back!"
(Oh! no! Oh! no! Ohhhhh!)
(Don't look back, don't look back, we've gone too far, we're too high off the ground)
(Bridges burned, lesson learned)
Don't look back!
(Oh! no!) (Oh! no!)
(Don't look back, don't look back, we've gone too far, we're too high off the ground)
(Bridges burned, lesson learned)
