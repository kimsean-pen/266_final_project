Theres something about you,
Tears me inside out whenever you're around
There's something about you
Speeding through my veins until we hit the ground

And there's something about this rush
Take it away
It made me feel so good
I got a feeling, you got a feeling, we get a feeling
Like we could die

Mother
We just cant get enough
We just cant get enough
Lover
We just gotta get it up
We just gotta get it up

Theres something about you
That tears me inside out whenever you're around
And theres something about you
That makes me fly
You're a heart attack, just the kind I like

There's something about your kiss
Haunting and strange
That makes me feel so good
I get a feeling, you get a feeling we got a feeling
Like we're alive

Mother
We just cant get enough
We just cant get enough
Lover
We just gotta get it up
We just gotta get it up

This world ain't got too much time
But baby I'm fine 'cause maybe you're mine
Yeah, we just can't get enough
You better give up, come on and give up, yeah
Give up your life

It's you for me, and me for you
You make my dreams come true
Off the wall, I wanna say
"I gotta be with you now, baby"
You're on my mind all the time
I found a billion diamonds
I rolled the dice, lost them all
And baby I just dont mind, mind, mind, mind--

Mother
We just cant get enough
We just cant get enough
Lover
We just gotta get it up
We just gotta get it up

This world ain't got too much time
But baby I'm fine 'cause maybe you're mine
We just gotta get it up, we just gotta get it up
Because Mother...

Wooo, yeah
