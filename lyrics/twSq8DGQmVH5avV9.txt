You've got the best of both worlds
You're the kind of girl who can take down a man
And lift him back up again
You are strong but you're needy
Humble but you're greedy
Based on your body language
And shouted cursive I've been reading
Your style is quite selective
But your mind is rather reckless
Well I guess it just suggests
That this is just what happiness is

Hey what a beautiful mess this is
It's like picking up trash in dresses

Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you write
Kind of turn themselves into knives
And don't mind my nerve you can call it fiction
But I like being submerged in your contradictions dear
'Cause here we are, here we are

Although you are biased I love your advice
Your comebacks they're quick
And probably have to do with your insecurities
There's no shame in being crazy
Depending on how you take these
Words they're paraphrasing this relationship we're staging

And it's a beautiful mess yes it is
It's like, we're picking up trash in dresses

Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you say
Kind of turn themselves into blades
And kind and courteous is a life I've heard
But it's nice to say that we played in the dirt, ohh dear
'Cause here we are, Here we are
Here we are, Here we are
Here we are, Here we are...
Here we are, We're still here

And what a beautiful mess this is
It's like taking a guess when the only answer is yes
And through timeless words
And priceless pictures
We'll fly like birds
Not of this earth
And tides they turn
And hearts disfigure
But that's no concern
When we're wounded together
And we've tore our dresses
And stained our shirts
But it's nice today
Oh the wait was so worth it
