every day
without you
feels so new
different views
different states
i wish i had stayed
to see you read
all my signs
and make time
when we're both free
lust is hard
because you are busy
and i'm far away
this round is not the same
i miss all your favorite things
i feel low but i know
you are worth the wait
i'm tired all the time
my sleep is missed on you
whenever i get back
i'll stay awake for you
if it's not too late
we should go around chasing
the light that is keeping me
up with these feelings
i'd like to court you
beneath the moon
it sways two
it's hard to get through
these weeks when i miss you
i like the theme
of you and me
swaying slowly
let's make time
where we will be
within each other's reach
swaying slowly
