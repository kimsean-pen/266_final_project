Another morning I wake up without exception
Though I guess now it's closer to the afternoon
And I am not the first one tired of this tradition
But the last to go sleep alone with you

And I breathe in the scent of coffee from the kitchen
I hear the laughter spilling from the other room
So I drag my body up and join the living
An exception almost right on cue

I never would have thought
It could ever be this good
And I know each moment's fleeting
But right now I feel like I'm right where I should be

I am not a perfect man, I fuck up often
At least I never have to wonder why I came
If you're honest with yourself, I'll bet it's painful
But you and I are far less different than they say

So where do you fit in?
So where do you fit in?

Another night the sun goes down without exception
I hear the matches playing from the other room
It's been a day since I have glanced at my reflection
No words of judgment coming from our crew

We start a fire just as the stars arrive
And I am lost within the flames
Until a touch from you brings me back
To what feels like the perfect day

So why is it she'd think
Some people never feel alive
Don't they know each moment's fleeting
I can't help but feeling I'm right where I should be

I am not a perfect friend or perfect lover
Oh, I admit sometimes I have too many drinks
But we are all degenerates, half on the inside
And you and I are far less different than they say

So where do you fit in?
So where do you fit in?

I think I found my place to fill that empty space
That feeling we all chase
(So where do you fit in?)
And we can sing off key as long as we all see
We sing it beautifully

My head was heavy with thoughts when I got home
I started to focus on my fears
I thought of dying alone

But how I hate to get caught in pointless thought
Self pity gets me nowhere
I guess we've all got things we're still working out

I think I found my place
I think I found my place
I think I found my place
I think I found my place
