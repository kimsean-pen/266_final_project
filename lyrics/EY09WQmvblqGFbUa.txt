Two paths away
And move into another shell
It takes my breath
Dislocate a second cell
Our faces show the timeline
Her heart stops being loved
Your voice sets the edition
To move into another self
To pass away

Let me bend all
Into another
Where we get our way
Take me in your arms
Into another
Where we get our way

Your voice was unforgiving

He's locked away
And move into another shell
He took my place
And no one there could even tell
Our faces show the timeline
Her heart stops being loved
To pass away
And move into another dream

Let me bend all
Into another
Where we get our way
Take me in your arms
Into another
Where we get our way

Your voice was unforgiving
This feelings eating me alive
Our faces show the timeline
(The guilt can't stop spinning)
Our hearts stop being loved
Your voice sets the edition
To move into another dream
(It breaks and tears me from inside)

Let me bend all
Into another
Where we get our way
Take me in your arms
Into another
Where we get our way

Let me bend all
Into another
Where we get our way
Take me in your arms
Into another
Where we get our way
