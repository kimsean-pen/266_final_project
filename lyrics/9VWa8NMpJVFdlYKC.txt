And we're dancing to the beat of the drum, baby
Dancing in the morning sun, baby
Like the moon, we've been up all night
Pretending everythings all right
Heaven knows we're like fire and light, baby
You hold me like I would run away, baby
I can't give you a promise i'll stay, baby

When you tell me I don't really care
And how I treat you is so unfair
Girl I have taken more than I can bare
I know I love you
I tell you I now

Love don't bother me, don't bother me
(love don't bother me)
Love don't bother me, don't bother me
love don't bother me, don't bother me
(don't bother me at all)

In a while I'm gonna leave you alone.
You say time will kill the pain when I'm gone, baby
From the moment I woke up and you're gone
hoping for some miracle cure
You say boy with this you can't be sure
This means forever, it's now or never

Love don't bother me, don't bother me
(don't bother me)
Love don't bother me, don't bother me
Love don't bother me, don't bother me
(don't bother me at all)

And we're dancing to the beat of the drum, baby
dancing in the morning sun
And I'm fighting with a worried man
There's a moment when you cross the line
Is it love? I've got a feeling this time
Nothing's forever, it's now or never

love don't bother me, don't bother me
Love don't bother me, dont bother me
Love don't bother me, don't bother me
(don't bother me at all)

Love don't bother me, don't bother me
Love don't bother me, don't bother me at all...
