I wish I had a secret
Something I could share
But no one knows me better than
I know myself but I'm forgetful
When it seems to suit me most
There's something I should say
This is real talk
In real time

And I'm hanging in
To the thinnest piece of string that's ever existed
Eh-eheh

I wish I had the gall
When something's on my mind
But no one knows you better than
You know yourself so don't be nervous
And maybe I'll admit it
I know I'm not so smart
No one knows me better than
I know myself but I'm forgetful

And I'm hanging in
To the thinnest piece of string that's ever existed
I'm hanging in
If I turn around and blink I'm sure I can miss it
I-I-It

I-I-It
I-I-It

You're walking me, talking me
Pushing me under the bus
You're walking me, talking me
Pushing me under the bus

Don't push me, don't push me, don't push me, don't push me, don't push
Don't push me, don't push me, don't push me, don't push me, don't push

You're walking me, talking me
Pushing me under the bus
You're walking me, talking me
Pushing me under the bus

Don't ask me, don't ask me, don't ask me, don't ask me, don't ask
Don't push me, don't push me, don't push me, don't push me, don't push

You're walking me, talking me
Pushing me under the bus

Don't rush me, don't rush me, don't rush me, don't rush me, don't rush
