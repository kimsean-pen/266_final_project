Turn the lights out
This shit is way too fucking bright
Wanna poke my eyes out
If you wanna mess with my eyesight
Just let me get my head right
Where the hell am I?
Who are you? What'd we do last night?
Hey yeah yeah
Who are you? What'd we do last night?
Hey yeah yeah

Can't remember what I did last night
Maybe I shouldn't have given in but I just couldn't fight
Hope I didn't, but I think I might've
Everything, everything is still a blur
Can't remember what I did last night
Everything, everything is still a blur
Can't remember what I did last night
Everything, everything is still a blur

What's your name?
And can you come and hand my all my things?
I think I need an asprin
But yet I need to get up out of here
I gotta get my head right
Where the hell am I?
Who are you? What'd we do last night?
Yeah yeah yeah

Can't remember what I did last night
Maybe I shouldn't have given in but I just couldn't fight
Hope I didn't, but I think I might've
Everything, everything is still a blur
Can't remember what I did last night
Everything, everything is still a blur
Can't remember what I did last night
Everything, everything is still a blur

What happened last night?
'Cause I don't, I don't remember...
Ohh...
What happened?

Can't remember what I did last night
Maybe I shouldn't have given in but I just couldn't fight
Hope I didn't, but I think I might've
Everything, everything is still a blur
Can't remember what I did last night
Everything, everything is still a blur
Can't remember what I did last night
Everything, everything is still a blur
