Tommy
Dear
I can never
I can never be
I can never be myself when you're around
Where are you going?
Sunrise
Sunset
Kill me
Kiss me
Help me forget me
Pleasure
Pain
Reality
Dreams
Nightmares
Parties
Distortion
Birth
Death
In-between
Love everything
Tick tock, tick of the clock
Enemy
Enemy
Enemy
You're around
