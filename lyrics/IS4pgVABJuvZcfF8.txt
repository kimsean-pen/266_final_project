Over and under, I'll dissolve and use charm as
my cover. Left over right, walk a careful line
between you and the outside. There is confidence
and delusion. I reside between that
confusion. It's a misstep down a black hole.
It's a long way down and a mouthful. So overcome
and become one. Over and under we
learn to grow and we learn to recover. Over
and out, I'll play the card that holds me in less
doubt. There's promiscuity and devotion. Only
one fulfills an emotion. It's a big step to end a
yearning. It's accepting love but I'm learning to
overcome and become one. I'll find my way and
follow through and maybe there I'll meet you.
