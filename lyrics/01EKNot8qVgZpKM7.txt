Say the words I cannot say
Say them on another day
Fragile words like these will cut your tongue
Was I good enough, was I bad enough
When I wanted more, yeah, you had enough
But nobody's gonna try for you
Nobody's gonna do like I for you

And every slow-lit cigarette
That nervous hands can barely get the courage
I could always feel your eyes.
And those dresses you made look like gowns
You're a sinner but the devil even turned you down

Cause, nobody's gonna try for you
Nobody's gonna do like I for you
And nobody's gonna try for you
And nobody's gonna lie for you
Nobody's gonna do like I for you (oo, ooo, oo, ooooo)

Hold me like you never could
I'll hold you like I said I would.
Air or light won't breathe nor shine between.
With your feather lips, yeah you fly away
Well I hope they come back down someday

Cause, nobody's gonna try for you
Nobody's gonna do like I for you
Somebody's getting by for you
I don't bend, I just break in two
Somebody like me
I'd die for you
