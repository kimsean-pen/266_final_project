I'm stuck inside of these lines I drew
I didn't speak it, but I always knew
That I was too far gone
Can you ever be too far gone?

Nevermind the things I said before
I overstated and I shouldn't have sworn
That I'm too far gone
Can I ever be too far gone?
Too far gone

For you to save me, save me
How couldn't you see that I was crazy?
Can we start from the beginning now?
It feels like I'm really living now
Maybe, maybe everyone's a little bit jaded
Can we start from the beginning now?
It feels like I'm really living now

They always preached it was black and white
So [?] in the middle feels right
Are we too far gone?
Can we ever be too far gone?

Am I arrogant, should I not assume
That the answer's mine, it can't belong to you
Am I too far gone?
Can I ever be too far gone

For you to save me, save me
How couldn't you see that I was crazy?
Can we start from the beginning now?
It feels like I'm really living now
Maybe, maybe everyone's a little bit jaded
Can we start from the beginning now?
It feels like I'm really living now

It feels like I'm really living now
It feels like I'm really living now
It feels like I'm really living now
Am I too far gone

For you to save me, save me
How couldn't you see that I was crazy?
Can we start from the beginning now?
It feels like I'm really living now
Maybe, maybe everyone's a little bit jaded
Can we start from the beginning now?
It feels like I'm really living now

It feels like I'm really living now
It feels like I'm really living now
