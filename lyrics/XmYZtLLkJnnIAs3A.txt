In my eyes, you are beautiful
Not just bright, perfect spiritual
I did what I had to do to get high
I just spinned myself another
Ain't like any other not quite done, not quite died

Stepping in and out of madness
Such a dedicated drone
I know you found it rather tragic
I'll stay here and feed my fat, black drone

In my time, I have spent with you
I'm confiding in our physical
I did not regret my time oh no
I have spinned myself another
Ain't like any other not quite done, not quite died

Stepping in and out of madness
Such a dedicated drone
I know you found it rather tragic
I'll stay here and feed my bad, black drone

I've been a constant of my anger
And that's fine
Built up in sad, obscuring danger
It's a lie

In my eyes, you are beautiful
Not just bright, perfect spiritual
I did what I had to do to get high
Spinned myself another
Ain't like any other not quite done, not quite died

Stepping in and out of madness
Such a dedicated drone
I know you found it rather tragic
I'll stay here and feed my bad, black drone
bad, black drone
bad, black drone
bad, black drone
bad, black drone
