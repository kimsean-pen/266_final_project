My eyes aren't what you say they are
My hands they don't reach that far
My heart is open like a door
But I don't trust you like before

I don't know who I am this year
My feelings are nothing but fear
My head my heart open wide
You came and took me by surprise

Maybe one day you'll be the one
Maybe one day I'll see a setting sun
Maybe one day you'll be the one
But until then, baby I'm crying.
Babying I'm crying

My life has come and gone so fast
I don't remember much from the past
I searched through every open book
Can you please come and take a look

Maybe one day you'll be the one
Maybe one day I'll see a setting sun
Maybe one day you'll be the one
But until then, baby I'm crying.
Babying I'm crying
