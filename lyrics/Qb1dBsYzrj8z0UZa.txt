Do me this solid
If you would pretty lady
Please grab your martini
And meet me on the balcony
I've prepared a light show
You could fake a melody
We could argue over where and when
The cymbal hits should be

Hannah takes the stairs
And I usually take the elevator
Every now and then she offers me
A lemon Now and Later
Please don't play the matchmaker
Please don't be a player hater
If you dig her recent work
Then you should go congratulate her

And if you're partial to the night sky
If you're vaguely attracted to rooftops
Hannah takes the stairs
Cause she can't tell
That it's a winding spiral case
Is she right side up
Or upside-down?

So Hannah let your roots grow
Let your blue veins show
If I need to take a breath
Then you can take a trumpet solo
I'll work on the limbs if
You work on the torso and
If it gets to be too much
Then you could lend a helping hand

And if you're partial to the night sky
If you're vaguely attracted to rooftops
Hannah takes the stairs
Cause she can't tell
That it's a winding spiral case
Is she right side up
Or upside-down?

Hannah takes the stairs
Cause she can't tell
That it's a winding spiral case
Is she outside-in
Or inside out?
