What you want
Honey you've got it
And what you need
Baby you've got it

All I'm asking
Is for a little respect when I come home

Do me wrong
Honey if you wanna
You can do me wrong
Honey while I am gone

But all I'm asking for
Is for a little respect when I come home

Hey little girl, you're so sweeter than honey
And I am about to just give you all my money

But all I'm asking, hey
Is a little respect when I come home

Hey little girl, you're sweeter than honey
And I am about to give you all of my money

But all I want you to do just give it, give it
Respect when I come home

Respect is what I want
Respect is what I need
Respect is what I want
Respect is what I need

Got to, got to have it
Got to, got to have it
You got to, got to have it
Got to, got to have it

Give it, give it
Give it, give it
Give it, give it
Give it, give it
Give it
Give it to me baby, everything I need
Give it to me baby, everything I want
Give it to me
