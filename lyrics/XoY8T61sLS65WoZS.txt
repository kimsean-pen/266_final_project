You know when you're gone I struggle at night
Dreams of you fucking me all the time
And I know you're tied up
And I know your phone's fucked
I'm craving your calls like a soldier's wife

I wanna bring you home myself
Bring you home myself

Come back, move in, mess my place
Chest infect me, waste my days
'Cause I know you love to drive my up the wall
I know you love to drive me up the wall

I wanna bring you home myself
Bring you home myself

And I'm so impatient when you're not mine
I just want to catch up on all the lost times
And I'll say I'm sorry if I sound sordid
'Cause all I really ever want is you

Offer my hand and I'll take your name
Share my shower, kiss my frame
'Cause I wanna carry all of your children
And I wanna call 'em stupid shit
