When I get old, I'mma be real cool
Sittin' on the porch with a fresh pair of shoes
Whole bunch of stories for the neighborhood kids
Tell 'em to believe that we makin' it big

And I know
That life is nothin' easy, nothin' easy
One day, I'mma change the world
And they'll finally believe me

From the outside lookin' in it seems that I'm fine
But they don't know shit about the everyday grind
Time is money, money is time
They tell me, get there at five but I'm runnin' behind

I try and live a lil', go and have a lil' fun
You only young once so the hatin' that be dumb
If life a joke then I'm waitin' for the pun
You all about the beef but me, I'm 'bout the bun the bread

'Cause I was just a little knucklehead
Now I got my shit together spittin' what they fuckin' with
If they ain't, it's great no intention to the hate
Nothing changed still cuttin' up, Henny's still my drink

I'm still the same old dude now makin' moves
It's like everythin' I do front page news
I ain't playin' in this game to lose
I want it all, no secret, the change, they can keep it

When I get old I'mma be real cool
Sittin' on the porch with a fresh pair of shoes
Whole bunch of stories for the neighborhood kids
Tell 'em to believe that we makin' it big

And I know
That life is nothin' easy, nothin' easy
One day I'mma change the world
And they'll finally believe me

Hey, my grandpa told me one day I'll be everythin' and more
It's better never to question every lesson that's in store
See it's a blessin' that I'm gettin' through the door
The money gonna fall, when it rain, it pours

Dear music, you're everythin' I have now
When there's an army comin' for me I won't back down
'Cause I never was a kid in the background
Just a class clown but who's laughin' now

My mom's cried when she saw me in a cap and gown
It feels great to see my family proud but
I make mistakes too, my people always tell me
"Mac, please don't ever let the fame change you"

They say I'm so different but it ain't true
Still got the same girl, roll with the same crew
I'm just doin' what it takes for me to make do
And everyone around me gettin' paid too

When I get old I'mma be real cool
Sittin' on the porch with a fresh pair of shoes
Whole bunch of stories for the neighborhood kids
Tell 'em to believe that we makin' it big

And I know
That life is nothin' easy, nothin' easy
One day I'mma change the world
And they'll finally believe me
