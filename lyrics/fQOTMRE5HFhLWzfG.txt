I'm out the door
I left a note
With all the words that made me choke
It says I know you feel alone
You're scared to death of letting go
Sometimes you have to lose it all
To find yourself
I'd cross the world for no one else
Save for you
But one more word before I go
I'm scared to death
You're scared you'll die alone
I'm out the door
To chase what I've been searching for
The spaces in between us grow
You'll never know
I'm scared to death of letting go
So take me out of the dark
Are we seconds apart
My heart needs a break
It's an honest mistake
Until I find my way back
Help me find my way back

Bring me home
I'm not ready to believe
That we were made for this collision
And it's just not what I need
So bring me home
If I make it back
Maybe you can be the reason
And fix this part of me
Cause it's just not what I need

Can you fix this part of me?

It's not living if I'm not living with you
