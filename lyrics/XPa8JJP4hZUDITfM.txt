I'm called a cow,
And I'm not about to blow it now for all the cows.
It's funny how
Money allows all to browse and be endowed.

This wish is true.
It falls into pieces new.
The cow is you.
The cow is you.

My kind has all run out,
As if kinds could blend.
Some time if time allows,
Everything worn in, everything worn in,
Everything worn in like it's a friend.

I said you're all
A painted doll, and it caused the walls to fall.
How far is he?
Impatiently
That's as far as far can be
As far can be.

My kind has all run out,
As if kinds could blend.
Some time if time allows,
Everything worn in, everything worn in,
Everything worn in like it's a friend.
