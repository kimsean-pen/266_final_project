Be generous with your life, with your love
Be generous always
Is this final?
Are we but seeds beneath the snows?
Is my faith only burning faintly
As my disobedience grows?

Because
I decided to be what anger made of me
I decided to be what hatred made of me
I decided to be what the lions left of me
I decided to be what cowards are meant to be

For it was all, all for naught
It was all, all for naught

What black sea shall be our mistress, our mother?
What brothers, what ghosts
Can populate a song?
You know I was a different man
You know I was a fool
You know I was wrong

I decided to be what anger made of me
I decided to be what hatred made me be
I decided to be what the lions left of me
I decided to be what cowards are meant to be
And it was all for naught
Yeah it was all for naught

(Whispered)
Why be still
Why settle
My gypsy daughter
For it sure is less painful to be slapped
On the rough water

I decided to be what anger made of me
I decided to be what hatred made me be
I decided to be what the lions left of me
I decided to be what cowards are meant to be
I decided to be what anger made of me
I decided to be what hatred made me be
