I don't know how you do it
But somehow you always will be there
And there's nothing to it
But somehow you always understand

There's no way to wake up now
Too many times I saw you cry
No one can make up if
You wait for the sun to make the sky

No one elevates you, elevates you now
No one's gonna take you, gonna take you there

All this time, never thought I would see you smile
Know that I, and I know that I see it now
But I know I can't walk it
Never go back again
No matter how, tonight I'll
Never go back, never go back again

No one elevates you, elevates you now
No one's gonna take you, gonna take you there
No one elevates you, elevates you now
No one's gonna take you, gonna take you there

And no one elevates you, elevates you now
And no one's gonna take you, gonna take you there
And no one elevates you, elevates you now
And no one's gonna take you, gonna take you there
