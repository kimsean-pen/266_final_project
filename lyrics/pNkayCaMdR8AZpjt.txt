Don't give up on me
'Cause I'm just in a rut
I'm climbing but the walls
Keep stacking up

Can't keep my mind off of every little wrong
I see the mouths are open but I can't hear the song
I've done my best to fill 'em
But the cracks are starting to spread
Hey, I won't blame you baby
Go on, turn your head

But don't give up on me
'Cause I'm just in a rut
I'm climbing but the walls
Keep stacking up

I can't keep pretending this next stop isn't mine
The truth is on the table, and someone's gotta sign
I've done my best defending
But the punches are starting to land
I'm sliding into something
You won't understand

Don't give up on me
'Cause I'm just in a rut
I'm climbing but the walls
Keep stacking up

Don't give up on me
'Cause I'm just in a rut
I'm climbing but the walls
Keep stacking up

So I'm handing you a memory
I hope you understand
That steadily reminds you
Of who I really am
This city's always breathing
I wish that it would die
The kickbacks and the bachelors
The fever from the velvet rope
The money from my mother's men
I'm not like her, you're not like them

I'll climb and I'll climb
I'll climb and I'll climb
I'll climb and I'll climb
I'll climb and I'll climb
I'll climb and I'll climb
I'll climb and I'll climb
I'll climb and I'll climb
I'll climb and I'll climb
I'll climb and I'll climb

Oh but don't you give up on me
(Don't you give up, don't you give up)
Don't you give up on me
(Don't you give up, don't you give up)
Don't you give up on me
(I'll climb and I'll climb, and I'll climb and I'll climb)
(Don't you give up, don't you give up)
Don't you give up on me
(I'll climb and I'll climb, and I'll climb and I'll climb)
(Don't you give up, don't you give up)

Don't give up on me
I'm just in a rut
