I feel you in these walls
You're a cold air creeping in
Chill me to my bones and skin.
I heard you down the hall
But it's vacant when I'm looking in
Oh, who let you in?

You walk around like you own the place
But you never say anything.
I caught you walking straight through my walls
Guess it was all my fault, I think I let you in.
Never thought that I would feel like this

Such a mess when I'm in your presence.
I've had enough, I think you've been making me sick
Gotta get you out of my system, yeah.
It's my house

And I think it's time to get out.
It's my soul

It isn't yours anymore.
It's my house

And I think it's time to get out.
Yeah, I think it's time to get out.
You're at my bedroom door

Heard your footsteps on the floor
Closer than ever before.
And now you're in my room
You're a cold air creeping through
Under sheets avoiding you.
You walk around I can hear you pace

Circling my bed frame.
Oh.
But, now we're face to face
Head on my pillowcase
But darling, you can't stay.
Never thought that I would feel like this

Such a mess when I'm in your presence.
I've had enough, I think you've been making me sick
Gotta get you out of my system, yeah.
It's my house

And I think it's time to get out.
It's my soul

It isn't yours anymore.
It's my house

And I think it's time to get out.
Yeah, I think it's time to get out.
Haven't you heard?

I'm not yours anymore.
I'm not yours anymore.
It's my soul.
(And I think it's time to get out)
Haven't you heard?

I'm not yours anymore.
I'm not yours anymore.
It's my house.
I feel you in these walls

You're a cold air creeping in
Chill me to my bones and skin.
Never thought that I would feel like this
Such a mess when I'm in your presence.
I've had enough
I think you've been making me sick
It's my house
And I think it's time to get out.
It's my soul
It isn't yours anymore.
It's my house
And I think it's time to get out.
Yeah, I think it's time to get out.
Yeah, Yeah.
Woah.
Yeah, I think it's time to get out.
