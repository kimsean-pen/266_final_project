They're coming for us in the dead of night
They won't ignore us
Prepare to fight
We knew this day would come
Blackened souls fed by fear and hatred
Come to defile that which we hold sacred
It's them or us
That's all they know

From the darkness the roar of engines
They ask no quarter, none shall be given
They come to claim all that you own
Hear the sound, see the lights in the distance
It's coming down â€“ the battle for existence
Show no mercy
They'll take all they can

Set aside your peaceful ways
Prepare for war
Melt down your ploughshares
And take up swords
We will see the flesh laid low
The bodies fall
The Most High that none may know
Watches us all

They're coming for us in the dead of night
They won't ignore us
Prepare to fight
They come to kill
That's all they know

Set aside your peaceful ways
Prepare for war
Melt down your ploughshares
And take up your swords
We will see the flesh laid low
The bodies fall
The Most High that none ma know
Watches us all
