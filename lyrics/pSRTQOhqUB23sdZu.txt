This life is punctuated by some mistake
Failing to glean the right emphasis and the meaning
This life is punctuated like a texting session
Between two overheated, insecure teens

You try to say what you mean
"I have to leave but I'm not ready"
Lip-sync the comforting scene
Trembling jaws can't stop stuttering

I can't see you when I need to
How am I supposed to get through?
Method-actor, suffering
Try repeating once again this time with feeling

Premeditated like some sick joke
Waited all night for you
