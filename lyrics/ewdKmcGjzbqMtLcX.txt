The way I cast a net
Too many holes to swim through
As to not offend the fish
Even if they do want you
Safer not to presume
Safer still to up and leave the room
Is even eye contact rude?
You'll never know that I noticed you.

Too gutless to even try this
Incase I'm met with a hostile silence

If I were you I'd be throwing up.
