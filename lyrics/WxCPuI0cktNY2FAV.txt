Would you die to keep me out?
Cold black dragging under
I guess it's not working out
Dead and dreaming of the water

I wish you would
I wish you would
I wish you would
I wish you would

Would it kill you to be here
I guess I have seen it coming
Won't you suffer through the year
Dead and dreaming of the water

I wish you would
I wish you would
I wish you would
I wish you would

Now I hear you in my head
Walking to the gallows
Is that where you've always been?
I won't mind it if you hang around

I wish you would
I wish you would
I wish you would
I wish you would
