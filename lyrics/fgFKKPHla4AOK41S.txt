We're on our own
Somehow we found a way to speak it
I got some time
And I can't believe we're even breathing
You're right, you're gonna tell them I'm gonna take you back, I'll make you good, it's not my game
You're right, you know I'm gonna take you back and make you mine

So when you reach for me, I'm glad I'm by your side
And you're holding me, I'm alright, I'm alright
I wanna hold you, I wanna touch you
I wanna feel good and make you mine

When you're reaching out, reaching out for me, yeah
When you're reaching out, reaching out for me, yeah
When you're reaching out, reaching out for me, yeah
Yeah, yeah

It's never too late to leave yourself behind now
It's never too late if we know what we're looking for
You need a little conversation and some good vibrations
Headed into consummation, baby, thank you for your patience
You always keep me waiting, tryna build up the sensation
I know what you're doing

So when you reach for me, I'm glad I'm by your side
And you're holding me, I'm alright, I'm alright
I wanna hold you, I wanna touch you
I wanna feel good and make you mine

When you're reaching out, reaching out for me, yeah
When you're reaching out, reaching out for me, yeah
When you're reaching out, reaching out for me, yeah
Yeah, yeah
