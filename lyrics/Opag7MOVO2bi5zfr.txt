Out there on your own
Always in the field and air
Somethings out there waiting to tell you
All the truth about your ancient past
Futures you devise to help you
Satisfy your trace in your fear
To the dogmas you know
Episodes of your devotion

What's the use in starting over?
You're such servant to your work
Guess it's all about the silent ocean
It's not the fate that you deserve

You were getting on
You were catching praise again
Could it make the suffering easier?
And spare yourself the mystery
Spaces in your mind, that pressures
You inside I'm asking sincere
All the places you'll go
Spare the world you write with notion

Whats the use in starting over?
You're such servant to your work
Guess it's all about the silent ocean
It's not the fate that you deserve
