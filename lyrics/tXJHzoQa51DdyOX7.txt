Alright baby
You know how to have a good time don'tcha?
It's the way you stand
You're always attracting attention
[Incomprehensible]

Now with your hands on your hips
And a snarl on your lips
Your eyes wore the look of danger
There's a lion in your heart
That's set to quick start
To a glance from any stranger

You give as good as you get
And no one's beat you yet
You take the lead, you never need
You know all the moves you've got to make

Take it all, take it all the way
You take it all, you take it all the way

Ya never do things by half
You're a man with a reputation
You never shy when the problems fly
And you can cope with any situation

You take the wheel and crack the whip
You never slip
You rule the roost, you always boost
Yeah you're lookin' after number one

You take it all, you take it all the way
You take it all the way
You take it all, you take it all the way

You take it all, you take it all the way
You take it all, you take it all the way
You're going to take it, take it

Take it all, you take it all the way
You're going to take it girl, take it all, you take it all the way
[Incomprehensible] take it all the way [Incomprehensible]
You know how to take it don'tcha?

You take it all, you take it all
You take it all the way
You take it all, you take it all
You take it all the way

You take it all the way
You take it all the way
You take it all the way

You take it, you take it all away
