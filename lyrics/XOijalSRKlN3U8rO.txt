Things ain't been quite the same
Since you hit me with your hand grenade
I might be just a bit insane
I ain't scared of a little pain

Tell me tell me baby honestly
Do you think there's something wrong with me
Do you wanna stick around to see
How bad a boy can be

It's the feeling I get
It's the feeling I get
And I'm startin' to sweat
It's the feeling I get
It's the feeling I get
You ain't lived if you've got no regrets
Yeah, that's the feeling I get

I'm made of bad, bad, bad, bad blood
At least I know where I come from
And you could never hurt me none
'Cause it's in my veins, that's where it runs

Did you ever think I'd pull it off
Were you convinced that it was all just talk
I can't stop and I won't get caught
I won't, I won't, I won't

You do things in the honest way
They put your picture on the wall of shame
The more you care the more they make you pay
But I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't

It's the feeling I get
It's the feeling I get
And I'm startin' to sweat
It's the feeling I get
It's the feeling I get
You ain't lived if you've got no regrets
Yeah, that's the feeling I get

I'm made of bad, bad, bad, bad blood
At least I know where I come from
And you could never hurt me none
'Cause it's in my veins, that's where it runs

If you're gonna light my fire
Baby don't stand so close
Karma gonna come and find you
I know, I know, I know
If you wanna take it higher
Better be down to fall
Don't think it won't hurt ya
At all, at all, at all, at all

(Bad, bad, bad, bad blood)
Oh, bad blood
(Know where I come from)
At least I know where I come from
(Never hurt me none)
And never gonna hurt me none
'Cause it's in my veins, that's where it runs

I'm made of bad, bad, bad, bad blood
At least I know where I come from
And you could never hurt me none
'Cause it's in my veins, that's where it runs

If you're gonna light my fire
Baby don't stand so close
Karma gonna come and find you
I know, I know, I know
If you wanna take it higher
Better be down to fall
Don't think it won't hurt ya
At all
