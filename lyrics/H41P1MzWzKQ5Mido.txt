They say the past is said and done
But now I'm left in your wake,
these awful mistakes are taking hold now
You hurt me
I'm pulling out the splinters from my heart
These razor blades will pave the way and save me from the dark

This is just the fallout
Of when we used to fall out
This is just the fallout
Never wanted us to fall out
Fallout, fallout, fallout, fallout, fallout, fallout

This is just the fallout
This is just the fallout, fallout
This is just the fallout, fallout

This is just the fallout
This is just the fallout, fallout
This is just the fallout, fallout

Cage the bully
Throw away the fuckin' key
Cage the bully
Stay the fuck away from me
Cage the bully
Throw away the fuckin' key
Cage the bully

You hurt me I'm pulling out the splinters from my heart
These razor blades will pave the way and save me from the dark
