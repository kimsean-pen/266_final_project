Time never waited
He is not your best friend
Well, you've got to chase it

Inside her eyes the casino waits
Would you play now?
She always wins, necklace made of lies
It seems you held the wrong cards tonight

Pain is like a secret
You won't tell, you've got to keep it
When you're down and wasted

Inside her eyes the casino waits
Would you play now?
She always wins, necklace made of lies
It seems you held the wrong cards tonight

Inside her eyes the casino waits
Would you play now?
She always wins, necklace made of lies
It seems you held the wrong cards tonight
