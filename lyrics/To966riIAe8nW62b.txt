You know I'm no brando
Stitched together tight though
Hold me close like Lilo
Precious Venus
Breathless, you're my weakness
Say I'm sane

When you pull me deeper, we're like minded
Closely tied
Tell me when I'm nearer that
You'll be here for a while

Maybe this is just another way
Like I didn't deserve it to be close to you
What was I hoping for?
Maybe this is just another day
And I can lean towards the feeling
That you gave me when our time ran out
When there was time at all

Luci, Persephone
Devil whisper to me
Sell my soul you're still my honey
Mummy mummy, she thinks I'm funny
Say I'm sane

When you pull me deeper, we're like minded
Closely tied
Tell me when I'm nearer that
You'll be here for a while

Maybe this is just another way
Like I didn't deserve it to be close to you
What was I hoping for?
Maybe this is just another day
And I can lean towards the feeling
That you gave me when our time ran out
When there was time at all
