Wait, it's the morning
The night, never stayed
And there's so much going on inside my head
Wait, do you recall
Just what happened
Can't I come around and talk to you

I feel better when we are together
I know it's simple but I don't care
I tried to say the things to make up for the mess I've caused

Take this journey
Don't reject me
Ill' do whatever you ask of me
Heart beats in time
Power to streetlights
Eyes like I've never seen so beautiful

I feel better when we are together
I know it's simple but I don't care
I tried to say the things to make up for the mess I've caused

I feel better when we are together
I know it's simple but I don't care
I tried to say the things to make up for the mess I've caused
I feel better when we are together
I know it's simple but I don't care
I tried to say the things to make up for the mess I've caused
