I could tell, from the minute I woke up
it was gonna be a lonely lonely lonely lonely day
Rise and shine, rub the sleep out of my eyes
and try to tell myself I can't go back to bed
It's gonna be a lonely lonely lonely lonely day

Even though the sun is shining down on me
and I should feel about as happy as can be
I just got here, and I already want to leave
It's gonna be a lonely lonely lonely lonely day

It's gonna be a lonely lonely lonely lonely day
It's gonna be a lonely lonely lonely lonely day

Everybody knows that somethin's wrong
but nobody knows what's goin' on
We all sing that same old song
When you want it all to go away
It's shapin' up to be a lonely day

I could tell, from the minute I woke up
It was gonna be a lonely lonely lonely lonely day
It was gonna be a lonely lonely lonely lonely day

Everybody knows that somethin's wrong
but nobody knows what's goin' on
We all sing that same old song
When you want it all to go away
It's shapin' up to be a lonely day

I could tell, from the minute I woke up
it was gonna be a lonely lonely lonely lonely day
It was gonna be a lonely lonely lonely lonely
lonely lonely lonely lonely...
Everybody knows that somethin's wrong
but nobody knows what's goin' on
Everybody knows that somethin's wrong
but nobody knows what's goin' on
(Oh oh oh oooh... why can't we see...)
