Girl you know I love talkin' to you on the phone
I could listen to your sweet voice all night long
And sometimes I can get by
With the sweet dreams baby good night
But this time, well I don't wanna spend it alone

So I'm comin' over, I hope it's alright
Listen for me pullin' into your drive
Look out your window, you'll see my lights
Baby girl I gotta see ya tonight
The way the breeze is blowin', blowin'
Got me wishin' I was holdin', holdin'
On to you so tight under that porch light
Yeah, girl I gotta see ya tonight
Tonight, tonight
Girl I gotta see ya tonight
Tonight, tonight

I got a couple hundred pictures of your pretty face
On my phone, on my dash, all over the place
But I would drive a million miles
Just to see that little smile in real life
Baby it's worth the drive
You're worth the drive

So I'm comin' over, I hope it's alright
Listen for me pullin' into your drive
Look out your window, you'll see my lights
Baby girl I gotta see ya tonight
The way the breeze is blowin', blowin'
Got me wishin' I was holdin', holdin'
On to you so tight under that porch light
Girl I gotta see ya tonight
Tonight, tonight
Girl I gotta see ya tonight
Tonight, tonight oooh

No I don't care what time it is
I just gotta get a little moonlight kiss
Girl I can't help it when I feel like this
There's only one thing to do

Baby I'm missin' you
I'm comin' over, I hope it's alright
Listen for me pullin' into your drive
Look out your window, you'll see my lights
Baby girl I gotta see ya tonight
The way the breeze is blowin', blowin'
Got me wishin' I was holdin', holdin'
On to you so tight under that porch light
Girl I gotta see ya tonight
Tonight, tonight
Girl I gotta see ya tonight
Tonight, tonight, yeah, yeah
Girl I gotta see ya tonight
