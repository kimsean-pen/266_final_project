Well Lord I got to raise a fuss, Lord I got to raise a holler
Well I been working all summer just to try and earn a dollar
Well Lord I tried to call my baby, I tried to get a date...
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a-gonna do

Lord there ain't no cure for the summertime blues
You know my mom and papa told me, "Son you gotta make some money"

(Of course I do. I should, I work like a dog)
"Well if you wanna to use the car go riding next Sunday"
Well Lord I didn't go to work I told the boss I was sick
He said...
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a-gonna do

Lord there ain't no cure for the summertime blues
I gotta take three weeks, I gotta have a fun vacation

I gotta take my problem to the United Nations
I done told my congressman and he said quote
"Dig this, boy..."
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a-gonna do

Lord there ain't no cure for the summertime blues
OW!

I'd like to take my three weeks, I need to take a fun vacation
I'd like to take my problem to the United Nation
I tried to lay my congressman and he said quote...
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a-gonna do
Lord there ain't no cure for the summertime blues
Whoa no, there ain't no cure.
You got to live with this for the rest of your life!
