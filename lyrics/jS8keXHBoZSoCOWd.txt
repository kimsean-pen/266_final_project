There was a time when I saw you
There's someone that I could hold onto
I wanted to be there for you
Now we're slowly grown apart
You had the whole world headed to you
But you started to change and threw it away
For a lie that was caught in the shadows
Pulling you away from home
Leaving all you've ever known

You then prayed
And you lost your way
You then prayed
And it's not the same

After all of these things that we've been through
Now I feel like I don't even know you
You're a shell of the man that I once knew
Trying to find his way back home
Hoping that the ache will go

You then prayed
And you lost your way
You then prayed
And it's not the same

My broken hope
And he's really gone
You've come and you've gone
Now I'm all alone

My broken hope
And he's really gone
You've gone and you've come
Now I'm all alone

You then prayed
And you lost your way
You then prayed
And it's not the same
