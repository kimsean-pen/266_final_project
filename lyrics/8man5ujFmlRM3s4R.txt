There's a scar on your heart
But your journey's just begun
A distant light that's worth the fight
The story's far from done
Stop hurting yourself
Those tired sores have nothing more to bleed

Hey
Self hatred I know it well, it's dragging you down
Listen to me now

There's a reason to believe again
There's a reason to go on
Always keep on fighting my friend
There's a reason to believe

They don't understand you
And they hate what they don't understand
You are more than they'll ever know
Like sand through your fingers
Don't let your life slip away
This prison of glass can't hold you back no more

Self hatred I know it well, it's dragging you down
Listen to me now

There's a reason to believe again
There's a reason to go on
Always keep on fighting my friend
There's a reason to believe

There's a reason to believe again
There's a reason to go on
Always keep on fighting my friend
There's a reason to believe

There's a reason to believe again
There's a reason to go on
Listen to me
Always keep on fighting my friend
