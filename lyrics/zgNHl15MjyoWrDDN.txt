Don't look, just keep your eyes peeled
Thoughtless, traipsing my mind's field
Shotgun, never behind the wheel anymore
Danger, monsters of smoke and mirror
Slowly, can one so lost be found?

And I know, you will never believe
I play it as though I'm alright
If life is but a dream
Then wake me up

Fallen leaves realize they are no friend of autumn
The view from Hell is blue sky
So ominously blue
I daydream until all the blue is gone

And I know, you'll never believe
I play this as though I'm alright
If life is but a dream
Wake me

Underwater is another life
Disregarding every myth we write
Rag doll churning, eagerly alive (Over and over, gasping in horror)
(So breathless you surface, just as the next wave is...)

Big smile, really a show of teeth
Without a care in a world of fear
Lonely, you don't know how I feel
Praise God, nothing is as it seems
