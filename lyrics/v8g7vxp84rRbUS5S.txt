Woh-oh
(Gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up)
Woh-oh
(And time won't take my love away)

Woh-oh, woh-oh, o-oh-oh, o-o-o-oh-oh
You're such a, you're such a, you're such a, you're such a
Hot temptation!
You just walk right in
Walk, walk, walk right in and
Woh-oh, woh-oh, o-oh-oh, o-o-o-oh-oh
O-oh-oh, oh-oh, o-o-o-oh-oh, o-o-oh-oh

(Gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up)
Thank, thank, thank you baby
(Gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up)
Just don't move
(Gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up)
Thank, thank, thank you baby
(Gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up)
Walk right in and

'Cause you ride on time
'Cause you ride on time, ride on time
'Cause you ride on time
'Ca-cause you ride on time, ride on time

Let me tell you, let me tell you
What you do, what you do, what you do to me
You're such a
Hot temptation!
You just walk right in, walk, walk, walk right in and
Woh-oh, woh-oh, o-oh-oh, o-o-o-oh-oh
O-oh-oh, oh-oh, o-o-o-oh-oh, o-o-o-oh

(Gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up)
Thank, thank, thank you baby
(Gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up)
Just don't move
(Gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up)
Thank, thank, thank you baby
(Gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up)
Walk right in and
(Away)

'Cause you ride on time
'Cause you ride on time, ride on time
'Cause you ride on time
'Ca-cause you ride on time, ride on time
'Cause you ride on time, ride on time
'Cause you ride on time, ride on time
'Ca-cause you ride on time, ri-ri-ride on time
'Cause you ride on time, ri-ri-ride on time
(Away)

(And time won't take my love away)
