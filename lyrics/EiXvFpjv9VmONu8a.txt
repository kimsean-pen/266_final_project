I addressed this letter to dear father
I know you as complete unknown
I guess it's better you don't bother
All our truth should be left alone
Be left alone
Be left alone

I learned the things you never showed me
Took the chances you'd have blown
And to this day, the one and only
You remain a complete unknown
Complete unknown
Complete unknown

You're out there somewhere
I don't know if you care at all
It seems that you don't
It's as if the day will never come
So you remain a complete unknown (unknown, unknown, unknown, unknown, unknown, unknown, unknown, unknown)

So many years have been ignored
You've been gone without a trace
I'm getting used to knowing you're
Just a name without a face
Without a face
Without a face

You're out there somewhere
I don't know if you care at all
It seems that you don't
It's as if the day will never come
So you remain a complete unknown

You're out there somewhere
I don't know if you care at all
It seems that you don't
It's as if the day will never come
So you remain a complete unknown (unknown, unknown, unknown, unknown, unknown, unknown, unknown, unknown)
