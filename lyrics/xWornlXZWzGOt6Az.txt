I turn my phone off and head to the centre of the room
Where we resume the right to consume
I hear the sound all around me

From the madness to mayhem
I hear what you're sayin' alright
Alright (alright)

When you're by my side
I know you at least tried to stay away
To clear your tray
To end the day

From the madness to mayhem
I hear what you're sayin' alright
Alright (oooh)

I hear what you're sayin, alright
Alright, alright
