When hope and love has been lost and you fall to the ground
You must find a way
When the darkness descends, and you're told; it's the end
You must find a way

When God decides to look the other way, and a clown takes the throne
We must find a way
Face the firing squad, against all the odds
You will find a way

Dig down
Dig down
Dig down and find faith

When you're close to the edge
With a gun to your head
You must find a way

When friends are few among the crowd, and they try to divide us
We must find a way
We have entered the fray, and we will not obey
We must find a way, yeah

Dig down
Dig down
Dig down and find faith

When they've left you for dead
And you can only see red
You must find a way

Dig down
Dig down
Dig down, find faith

We won't let them divide
We will never abide
We will find a way

Dig down
Dig down
Dig down, find faith

Dig down
Dig down, find faith
