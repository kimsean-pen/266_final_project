Let meduce myself
I haven't been here for a long time
Been looking for somebody else
But only here I feel alright
How are you now?
I've been floating through the storms
Just to be inside your mind
I wanna wake up where you are
I wanna hold your hand tonight
How are you?
How have u been?
Did you miss me?
Where did you go?

Where were you all this time
When it feels like home
In the dreams I walk alone
And trying to find an escape for tonight
When it feels like home
In the dreams I sing this song
Please don't mind
Please don't wake for tonight
Please don't mind
Please don't wake for tonight
