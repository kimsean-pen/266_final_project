When everybody leaves you lonely
And times are worse than sad
And the world is falling on your head
Just remember for all you know
Good or bad, come what may
You're gonna live tomorrow if you don't die today

It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love

Now the fear got Annotatein me
It's got in me deep
That's where it's gonna stay and never leave
Someone come and lay my worry
Someone come and kill my pain
Someone come and put me on my feet again

It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love

We gotta love one another
That's what the good man say
But I got too much trouble going 'round my head
Someone come and pick up my love
Take it all away
Feel like i'll break down tomorrow
If I don't die today

It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love
