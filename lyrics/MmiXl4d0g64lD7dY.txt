Big night
Big winner
His pint
Your leather
And then you'll fight and then we'll go
When you start
No way you're not gonna finish
I spy with my little eye it all
In the wrong place at the wrong time is how you put it
You can't stay away from the wrong place at the wrong time
Every time
More wine
No dinner
Whole night babysitting
And when you cry is when we go
All smiles in the morning
Won't admit it
I spy with my little eye
In the wrong place at the wrong time is how you put it
You can't stay away from the wrong place at the wrong time
Come every night
In the wrong place at the wrong time
Always stuck in the wrong place
Can't stay away from the wrong place at the wrong time
Every time
And now I'm telling you
Not staying
No you're not staying away
That's why I'm telling you
Not staying
No you can't stay away
I spy with my little eye
Keep your head down boy
Think you'd feel much better
I spy with my little eye
You can let your hair down girl
But you'd feel much better if you don't
Always stuck in, you're always stuck in the wrong place at the wrong time
Always stuck in the wrong place
The wrong place at the wrong time
Every time
And now I'm telling you
Not staying
No you're not staying away
That's why I'm telling you
Not staying
No you can't stay away.
