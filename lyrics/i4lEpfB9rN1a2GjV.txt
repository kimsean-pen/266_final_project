My name is trouble my first name's a mess
No need to greet me I'm here to confess
But if you let me hold you I won't hold my breath
And if you let me love you I will love to death

My chances endless I tend to obsess
No game is out to my need to possess
But if you let me hold you I won't hold my breath
And if you let me love you I will love you to death

I'm petrified of emptiness a lot of signs of loneliness
Our love has tend to break me in two
If you're to come back to me, in pieces or in melody
There couldn't be a better way through

My name is trouble my first name's a mess
Born to deceive you brought up to redress
And if you let me hold you I won't hold my breath
But if you make me need you I will need you less

I'm petrified of emptiness a lot of signs of loneliness
Our love has tend to break me in two
If you're to come back to me, in pieces or in melody
There couldn't be a better way through

My name is trouble my first name's a mess
No need to greet me I'm here to confess
And if you let me hold you I won't hold my breath
And if you let me love I will love to death

If you let me hold you I won't hold my breath
And if you let me love you I will love you to death
