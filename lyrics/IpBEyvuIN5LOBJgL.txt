This world is sick
My heart feels it
This world is dark
My heart lights up
This world is vice
My heart was iced
This world is blur
My heart stays pure
This world is sick
My heart feels it
This world is dark
My heart lights up
This world is vice
My heart was iced
This world is blur
My heart stays pure

I don't see
I don't see
Deep inside you
I don't see
I don't see
I don't see
Deep inside you
I don't see
I don't see
I don't see
Deep inside you
I don't see
I don't see
I don't see
Deep inside you
I don't see
Get down on your knees
This is the last kiss
Crawl down to abyss
You have to make this
Get down on your knees
This is the last kiss
Crawl down to abyss
You have to make this

This world is sick
My heart feels it
This world is dark
My heart lights up
This world is vice
My heart was iced
This world is blur
My heart stays pure
This world is sick
My heart feels it
This world is dark
My heart lights up
This world is vice
My heart was iced
This world is blur
My heart stays pure
