Can we live on borrowed time
But his head shots pretty good
I've been scheming for too long
I was star struck by your mom

We fall in love by accident
A heavenly coincidence
No matter what you think is true
Let me introduce you to some friends of mine

oohhh...
Friends of mine
oohhh...
Friends of mine
oohhhhh
Friends of mine

Can we break for passing cars
In the pistol ripping chase
I regret the drugs you lost
So I skipped our second date

We fall in love by accident
A heavenly coincidence
No matter what you think is true
Let me introduce you to some friends of mine

oohhh...
Friends of mine
oohhh...
Friends of mine
oohhhhh
Friends of mine

We fall in love by accident
A heavenly coincidence
No matter what you think is true
Let me introduce you to...

Can't figure out this place
Guess someone hates my guts
I handed him the sign

ohhh... friends of mine
