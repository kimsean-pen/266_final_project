Should I use my heart or my head?
I wish that I could just replay the thoughts of things I never said
Should I use my heart or my head?
I wish that I could just turn back the time or start over again

But if we're laying it on the line this time
I better say this now

You make me feel low
Don't make me feel low
Cause I've tried so hard to convince myself
It's okay that I feel this way
You make me feel low
Don't make me feel low
If I can't have you I'd be by myself
Cause you know I need you so
Don't make me
Don't make me
Feel low

So tell me why did it take
Twenty-six years to figure out how to love
Just to throw it all away?
(Throw it all away she said)
Maybe if you'd been a little bit smarter
Maybe if you tried hard enough
I wouldn't question why I shouldn't stay
(Why I shouldn't stay)

You expect me to come back around.
You better show me that you've changed.

You make me feel low
Don't make me feel low
Cause I've tried so hard to convince myself
It's okay that I feel this way
You make me feel low
Don't make me feel low
If I can't have you I'd be by myself
Cause you know I need you so
Don't make me
Don't make me

Don't make me walk out the door
Don't you throw it away
Don't make me
Don't make me
Cause I'm leaving for good
And I'm not coming back again

(I'm not coming back again)

When I said it was over I meant it
But now I can't let you go
But still I can't accept
That you make me feel so
You make me feel so

You make me feel low
Don't make me feel low
Cause I've tried so hard to convince myself
It's okay that I feel this way
You make me feel low
Don't make me feel low
If I can't have you I'd be by myself
Cause you know I need you so

You make me feel low
Don't make me feel low
Cause I've tried so hard to convince myself
It's okay that I feel this way
You make me feel low
Don't make me feel low
If I can't have you I'd be by myself
Cause you know I need you so
You know I need you so
