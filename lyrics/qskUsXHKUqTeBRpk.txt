You're lazy you just stay in bed
Oh you're lazy just stay in bed
Don't want no money you don't want no bread

If you're drowning you don't clutch no straw no
If you're drowning you don't clutch no straw
You don't want to live don't want to cry no more

Well my trying ain't done no good
I said "My trying ain't done no good"
You don't make no effort no not like you should

Lazy you just stay in bed
Lazy you stay in bed
You don't want no money you don't want no bread
