Na na, na na na na
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, ohh
Ohh, this is just for me
Na na, na na na, na na, na na na

Kick off my shoes and relax my feet
Hit the kitchen grab a bite to eat
Now, it's been one of those crazy weeks
And I gotta do somethin' special for me

See, hit the salon get a mani and a pedi
Have a massage, get a sip and then I'm ready
Gotta take time out
And all my real ladies know what I'm talkin' about, sing

Ooh, baby, baby
You don't know what I've been going through
Sing it again now, ooh, baby, baby
It's obvious to see exactly what I need

One of those days
When the sun is shinin' bright
And my life is going right
And the simple things are not wasted

One of those days
When you're cruisin' in your car
An' you might just see the stars
And it's warm outside and beautiful, oh yeah

Tonight, it's all about me
Just wanna set my body free
Never mind the TV
Tonight, I'll just let a little TV watch me

Light the candles, aroma therapy
Hot tub bubbles surrounding me
Mr. Big is in the background
The "Isley Brothers" gonna hold it down, sing

Ooh, baby, baby
You don't know what I've been going through
Sing it for me now
Ooh, baby, baby
It's obvious to see exactly what I need

One of those days
When the sun is shinin' bright
And my life is going right
And the simple things are not wasted

One of those days
When you're cruising in your car
An' you might just see the stars
And it's warm outside and beautiful

One of those days
When the sun is shinin' bright
And my life is going right
And the simple things are not wasted

One of those days
When you're cruising in your car
An' you might just see the stars
And it's warm outside and beautiful, oh yeah

Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
I need one of those days
You don't know how, ooh, ooh, ooh

One of those days
When the sun is shinin' bright
And my life is going right
And the simple things are not wasted

One of those days
When you're cruising in your car
An' you might just see the stars
And it's warm outside and beautiful

One of those days
When the sun is shinin' bright
And my life is going right
And the simple things are not wasted

One of those days
When you're cruising in your car
An' you might just see the stars
And it's warm outside and beautiful, oh yeah
