Step on, I beg you please
It's a 100 degrees, I'm on my knees
If the one you blow is the one you show
Well then you know I'm right

This bitter place was built for you
Sit by the fire, tell me true
Don't blind my eyes, turn them blue
And then I'll dry my face on you

Step on, I beg you please
It's a 100 degrees, so I freeze
Drowning in that ice that fly
It's a great white place
And the heat's diseased

This bitter place was built for you
Sit by the fire, tell me true
Don't blind my eyes, turn them blue
And then I'll dry my face on you

One hundred degrees
One hundred degrees
One hundred
(Hundred)
