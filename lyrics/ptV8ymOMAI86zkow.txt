With my eyes on the prize
Not a thing to my name
With my head in the clouds
And my body a waste

Don't wanna ever wake up
Don't wanna ever wake up,
I don't wanna ever wake up
Next to somebody new

Don't wanna ever wake up
Don't wanna ever wake up,
I don't wanna ever wake up
Next to somebody new

With my eyes to the south
And my brain up in space
with my nervous looks around
I'm a step out a sync

Don't wanna ever wake up
Don't wanna ever wake up,
I don't wanna ever wake up
Next to somebody new

Don't wanna ever wake up
Don't wanna ever wake up, I don't
Don't wanna ever wake up
Next to somebody new

Don't wanna ever wake up
Don't wanna ever wake up, I don't
Don't wanna ever wake up
Next to somebody new

Don't wanna ever wake up
Don't wanna ever wake up,
I don't wanna ever wake up
Next to somebody new

Don't wanna ever wake up
Don't wanna ever wake up, I don't
Next to somebody new
