Despite of all our conflict
I still sit and adore you
A tragedy for the ages
Now at least I can say this

Even though our love has died,
You're still mine
You're still mine
Even though our love has died,
You're still mine
You're still mine

Despite of all our conflict
I still sit and adore you
A tragedy for the ages
Now at least I can say this
