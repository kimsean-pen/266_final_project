If you only knew how much I loved you
The sky would open up and shut from Heaven above
So come on up and give me your love babe
Tell me I'm the one you've been dreaming of
We're dancing in the dark, we're spinning in circles
I'll take you to the top when the beat don't stop
So sweet, all over
Tell me that you need me again!

I wanna take you high into the night
Like the stars in the sky, we could live our own lives
I wanna take you high into the night
Like the stars in the sky, we could live our own lives

If you only knew how much I refused you
Let on the way even though you; re gone
Maybe you'd come back and show me the way now,
Don't leave me in the dark here on my own
Hang by a thread from the love that you're spinning
Somehow hanging on as it's falling apart
So sweet, all over
Tell me that you need me again!

I wanna take you high into the night
Like the stars in the sky, we could live our own lives
I wanna take you high into the night
Like the stars in the sky, we could live our own lives
