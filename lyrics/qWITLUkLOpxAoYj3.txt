See you in my dreams
Wake up your with me
Into the hotel lobby

Know you through your songs
Wish I could be your one
Meet me at my front porch

You and all the things you do
You and all the things you do
I'll go anywhere for you

My heart breaks into two
When I remember our distance
The loneliness creeps in

You and all the things you do
You and all the things you do
I'll go anywhere for you
I'll go anywhere for you
I'll go anywhere for you
