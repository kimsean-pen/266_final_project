Let's get glam, glam
Let's get glam, glam, glam

Walk, turn, pose, stop
Give 'em what you got
Work those hips, side to side
Get that angle right, right

Paint your face like a movie queen
A naughty dream or a fantasy
Anything goes, gotta be the scene
Create a look, out a fashion book

Ready, set, now go

Let's get glam, don't let the clothes wear you
Let's get glam, it's all in how you move
Let's get glam, don't let the clothes wear you
Let's get glam, it's all an attitude

Now snap, now snap, here we go

Blush on, lashes long, mascara strong
Lips, eyes, cheeks, face, give it style grace

Better be ready for your photo op
Step in the light for your perfect close up
Be superficial, it's your one shot
Unleash the diva deep inside

Ready, set, now go, bitches

Let's get glam, don't let the clothes wear you
Let's get glam, it's all in how you move
Let's get glam, don't let the clothes wear you
Let's get glam, it's all an attitude

Now snap, now snap, here we go

Runway on fire, fashion gods inspire
Lose control, inhibitions run wild
Get on the floor in your best couture
Come on and take me higher

Live it, love it, breathe it, work it, glam
Live it, love it, breathe it, work it, glam
Live it, love it, breathe it, work it, glam
Live it, love it, breathe it, work it, glam

Now snap, now clap
Now dance, now stop
Let's get glam
Let's get glam, don't let the clothes wear you
Let's get glam, it's all in how you move
Let's get glam, don't let the clothes wear you
Let's get glam, it's all an attitude
(Fashion is a lifestyle)
Let's get glam, don't let the clothes wear you
Let's get glam, it's all in how you move
Let's get glam, don't let the clothes wear you
Let's get glam, it's all an attitude
(Fashion is a lifestyle)
Glam, let's get glam, it's all in how you move
Let's get glam, let's get glam, it's all an attitude
