Mother Moon
Mistress of the Sun
Say, I got you, I got you
Sister Sun
Lovers of the tune
Sing, I got you, I got you, I got you

Floating away, I think I'll stay
[As the view]
Floating away, I think I'll stay in blue light
Floating away, I think I'll stay
Next to you
Finding a way to make the loss in you
Cuz you don't deserve me
I know, that I deserve you

Mother Moon
Mistress of the Sun, Say,
I got you, I got you
Sister Sun
Lovers of the tune, Sing
I got you, I got you
Mother Moon
Mistress of the Sun, Sing
I got you, I got you
Oh I got you
Oh I got you
Mother Moon

Floating away, I think I'll stay
[as the fuse]
Floating away, I think a day with you
Floating away, I think I'll stay
Next to you
Finding a way to make the loss in you
Cuz you don't deserve me
But I deserve you
Flowers for the May Queen
But life for the prayers
If nobody wears
And what is loss, if I've got you
