You sold me out to the man, to the man, to the man with the nuclear plant
In his hands, now I don't understand the free world

Get together,
Get to the same mistake
With you want tomorrow ideas
I wanna tell me if I could care
Tell me how about here

You sold me out to the man, to the man, to the man with the nuclear plant
In his hands, now I don't understand the free world

If you feel alright
Let yourself dance
Don't sit out tonight
If you feel aright
Get off your phone
Take a road tonight
If you see the light
Don't turn away
It's reality
With no fear inside
We can begin to feel the happiness
Sooth lady wine
Not in the way that I know
You and I,
One??? two??? try for something new
I want it so long to write it down for one

If you feel alright
Let yourself dance
Don't sit out tonight
If you feel aright
Get off your phone
Take a road tonight
If you see the light
Don't turn away
It's reality
With no fear inside
We can begin to feel the happiness
