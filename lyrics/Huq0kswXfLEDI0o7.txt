Belial, Behemoth, Beelzebub
Asmodeus, Satanas, Lucifer

Belial, Behemoth, Beelzebub
Asmodeus, Satanas, Lucifer

Since dawn of time
The fate of man is that of lice
Equal as parasites
And moving without eyes

A day of reckoning
When Venice is to burn
Countdown together now
And say the words that you'll learn

Hail Satan, Archangelo
Hail Satan, welcome Year Zero
Hail Satan, Archangelo
Hail Satan, welcome Year Zero

Belial, Behemoth, Beelzebub
Asmodeus, Satanas, Lucifer

Crestfallen kings and queens
Comforting in their faith
Unbeknownst to them
Is the presence of the wraith

Since fate of man is equal
To the fate of lice
As new dawn rises you shalt recognize
Now behold the Lord Of Flies

Hail Satan, Archangelo
Hail Satan, welcome Year Zero
Hail Satan

He will tremble the nations
Kingdoms to fall one by one
Victim to fall for temptations
A daughter to fall for a son

The ancient serpent deceiver
The masses standing in awe
He will ascend to the heavens
Above the stars of God

Hail Satan, Archangelo
Hail Satan, welcome Year Zero
Hail Satan, Archangelo
Hail Satan, welcome Year Zero
