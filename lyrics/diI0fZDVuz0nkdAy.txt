16 year in a private ghost chain
But I know that the miracle changed
Summertime is a whirlwind away
And I know that the lights won't invade
16 years of mechanical joy
And I know that the lines show the way
Burn a candle for magical days
Now I know that the rest is okay

It's shooting light AND I'm feeling again
Is this love that I'm feeling again

16 years of mechanical joy
And I know that the lines show the way
Burn a candle for magical days
Now I know that the rest is okay

It's shooting light AND I'm feeling again
Is this love that I'm feeling again
