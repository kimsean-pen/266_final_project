Good arms, versus bad arms, will win hands down, down
They are built to hold and fit, look how far they go around
You don't need these now that you've found another pair
And the difference is astounding, i should expect, except

Leave the rest at arm's length
Keep your naked flesh under your favorite dress
Leave the rest at arm's length
When they reach out, don't touch them, don't touch them

I decided this decision some six months ago
So I'll stick to my guns, but from now on it's war
I am armed with the past, and the will, and a brick
I might not want you back, but i want to kill him

Leave the rest at arm's length
Keep your naked flesh under your favorite dress
Leave the rest at arm's length
When they reach out, don't touch them, don't touch them

Leave the rest at arm's length
Don't brush with him, he might have diseases
Leave the rest at arm's length
steer clear of the grasp, girl... run, run, away

Leave the rest at arm's length
Just roll over boy and don't make me do this
Leave the rest at arm's length
I am armed to the teeth and I'm heavy set

Leave the rest at arm's length
I'm not ready to see you this happy
Leave the rest at arm's length
I am still in love with you, can't admit it yet
