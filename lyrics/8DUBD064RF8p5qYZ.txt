Trust me, I will give you all
Just like kings and queens above all
Guess I'm not the only daughter
Golden wings is what we follow
Trust me, I will go there solo
Don't go mad for every dollar
Pain will drown in whiskey
But I don't go [?], oh, oh, oh

I never don't care what you think about
What it's all about
What it's all about
I never don't care what you think about
What it's all about
What it's all about
I never don't care what you think about
What it's all about
What it's all about
I never don't care what you think about
What it's all about
What it's all about

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Life is long without this sorrow
Give me chill down by the water
All there was will make you swallow
Feel that pain from no tomorrow
Stay and sold that you have borrowed
Take yourself on getting [?]
No one said that you are hollow
Don't go [?], oh, oh, oh

I never don't care what you think about
What it's all about
What it's all about
I never don't care what you think about
What it's all about
What it's all about
I never don't care what you think about
What it's all about
What it's all about
I never don't care what you think about
What it's all about
What it's all about

Oh my love is getting nowhere
My love is [?]
My love is getting nowhere
My love is getting oh, oh, oh

I never don't care what you think about
What it's all about
What it's all about
I never don't care what you think about
What it's all about
What it's all about
I never don't care what you think about
What it's all about
What it's all about
I never don't care what you think about
What it's all about
What it's all about
