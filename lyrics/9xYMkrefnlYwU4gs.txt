In the middle of a sleepless night
Got a feeling and it just ain't right
The feeling just grows in my mind
Something's missing in the way we kiss
Never had so many nights like this
Feels like a dream but it's true

I know I don't take you to heaven anymore
I can tell by the way you touch me
It's nothing like before
I know I don't take you to heaven anymore
I can tell by the way you love me
It's nothing like before
I can tell by the way you love me
It's nothing like before

In the middle of a lonely day
Though you're with me you're so far away
We used to be close, real close
Baby, don 't you see the danger signs?
A love like ours is hard to find
Something's gone wrong, can't you see?

I know I don't take you to heaven anymore
I can tell by the way you touch me
It's nothing like before
I know I don't take you to heaven anymore
I can tell by the way you love me
It's nothing like before
I can tell by the way you love me
It's nothing like before

Oh I know I don't take you to heaven anymore
I can tell by the way you touch me
It's nothing like before
I know I don't take you to heaven anymore
I can tell by the way you love me
It's nothing like before
