The waves are pounding on the shore today
The sun is shining on the sand
And we've been swimming in the water
We've been living off the land
Yeah, we've been breathing underwater
With all those animals that can
Yeah, we are living underwater
Yeah, we are living off the land

Hey, it's Christmas down under
Hey, it's Christmas down under
Hey, it's Christmas down under
Hey, it's Christmas down under

Some say that Jesus had a daughter
But I don't guess he ever met her
And she had never met her father
No, I guess this world couldn't let her
No, this world needed a martyr
And, hey, it's hard to understand
But if you need to make a martyr
You got to take away the man

Hey, it's Christmas down under
Hey, it's Christmas down under
Hey, it's Christmas down under
Hey, it's Christmas down under

One day my dog will be a dragon
It's so hard to understand
All dragon wings and dragon fire
And dragon bones beneath the land
So tonight, when the clouds break
With all the lightning and the thunder
Hey, come find me 'neath the lights of the tiki bars
Hey, it's Christmas down under

(Hey, it's Christmas down under)
(Hey, it's Christmas down under)
(Hey, it's Christmas down under)
(Hey, it's Christmas down under)
(Hey, it's Christmas down under)
(Hey, it's Christmas down under)
(Hey, it's Christmas down under)
(Hey, it's Christmas down under)
(Hey, it's Christmas down under)
(Hey, it's Christmas down under)
(Hey, it's Christmas down under)
