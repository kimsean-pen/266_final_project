You don't scream, you can't scream
Find yourself unaware of the room
Cut the difference so to be
At the same level of frequency
I have bothered to consume
You can do the same, if you come too
Like new versions of us ourselves
Keep a watch that they let us on land
With a handle on the laugh
Scradle the speech and cut off their hands

I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait until I see you die
Call me "a-rab." Call me a "spic."
I can't wait until I see you die

We can dream, we can dream
We can dream, dream, dream, dream, dream
We can dream to help my friends come to terms
And be way less uncomfortable around violence
We can dream to help my friends
You wish for it to come
You wish for it to come
And when it does I want to watch you eat those words
With someone else who cannot wait

I cannot wait, I cannot wait to see you die
To see you die, to see you die, to see you die
