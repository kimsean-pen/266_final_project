Oh the phone, you know it never stops
It's the last thing I hear at night and the first thing in the morning
And as I let it start to burn my head
You slowly creep into bed and I'm done with all the talking
You say you know how I'm feeling, I just need to try to settle down

Oh a million faces pass my way
Ooh they're all the same
Nothing seems to change anytime I look around
Oh who knows just what the future holds
All I want to know is if it's with you

Tired as hell and falling up the stairs
Filled with a thousand cares as you walk out from the bedroom
And though it feels like all my fire has gone
Girl you just turn me on, can't believe how much I want you
You say you know how I'm feeling, I just need to try to settle down

Oh a million faces pass my way
Oh they're all the same
Nothing seems to change anytime I look around
Oh who knows just what the future holds
All I want to know is if it's with you

We're distracted by the hard times and the troubles that we make
Let us throw them in the ocean, let it wash our cares away

Oh the phone you know it never stops
It's the last thing I hear at night and the first thing in the morning

Oh a million faces pass my way
Oh they're all the same
Nothing seems to change anytime I look around
Oh who knows just what the future holds
All I want to know is if it's with you
We're distracted by the hard times and the troubles that we make
Let us throw them in the ocean, let it wash our cares away
We're distracted by the hard times and the troubles that we make
Let us throw them in the ocean, let it wash our cares away
Let it wash our cares away, let it wash our cares away
