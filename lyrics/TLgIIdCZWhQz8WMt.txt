I guess I lose again
In the same way
I like habitual mistakes
I swear I am a good kid
Trapped in the modern day
I used my hands for the countdown
Till the numbers slipped away
I've been wash/repeating for so long
I forgot I had a face
But I won't get no relief
And I won't get relief
And I won't get relief
And I won't get relief
I pace
I backtrack
Till I walk the same path
I pace
I backtrack
Till I walk the same path
Two birds one stone
In the same day
Till they're dragging me away
I swear I am a good kid
Trapped in the modern day
I use my hands for the countdown
Till the numbers slipped away
I've been wash/repeating for so long
I forgot I had a face
But I won't get no relief
And I won't get relief
And I won't get relief
And I won't get relief
I pace
I backtrack
Till I walk the same path
I pace
I backtrack
Till I walk the same path
I pace
I backtrack
Till I walk the same path
I pace
I backtrack
Till I walk the same path
Oh no I'm drunk again
What do you ask of me?
I'm used exstensively
What's another?
What's another?
Oh no I'm drunk again
What do you ask of me?
I'm used exstensively
What's another?
What's another?
I pace
I backtrack
Till I walk the same path
I pace
I backtrack
Till I walk the same path
I pace
I backtrack
Till I walk the same path
I pace
I backtrack
Till I walk the same path
Till I walk the same path
