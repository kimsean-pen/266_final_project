You lied to me,
you tried to be,
everything i would want,
but everything you couldn't be.

The world that you have made,
has suddenly collided,
so youll have the chance to lead,
a new life...

Everything that i would want,
everything you couldn't be.

This is your cop-out to your life,
i will be the end of everything you love,
it rips my heart out and i cant take anymore,
heart out, I'm lying on the floor.

i cant, i cant believe this,
i cant, i cant believe this,
i cant, i cant believe this,
i cant believe this has happened,
i cant believe this is happening,
i cant believe this is happening,

i cant believe that this is happening to me,
i thought that you would be, everything i need.

The two worlds that you have made,
have suddenly collided,
so save yourself and make a lie,
i wouldn't be believing.

You want me back,
now that im on,
my own, again.

"please enjoy the music while your party is reached"

You thought that you could be my bride,
but no you lied...
