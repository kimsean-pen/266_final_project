When the days change, so does my attitude
I'm messy at home, I eat a lot of junk food
When the nights change, so do my nightmares too
I dream reality is my dream

All along, all along
I guess I'm meant to be alone
All along, all along
I guess I'm meant to be alone, out there on my own, yeah

When the weeks change, the rumors change too
I'm addicted to highs, would you like to know why?
When the months change, so do my love point of views
I don't want what I need, what I need hates me
What I need hates me

I know all along, all along
I know I'm meant to be alone
It's crazy, but all along, all along
I knew I was meant to be alone, out there on my own, yeah

Suppose somehow the lionhearted failed to end
Who will be the villain? All the strangers voted for him
Suppose somehow the lionhearted failed to smile
Who would be the villain? All the strangers voted for him

All along, all along
I guess I'm meant to be alone
All along, all along
I guess I'm meant to be alone, out there on my own, yeah
