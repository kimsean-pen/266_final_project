When the yellow dies under the velvet thoughts
Blood-bubbles nestled in thorns

I have travelled through suns,
And the darkness of the end
Now I surrender to the void
And join with the pulse of the universe

The world burns with worms of fire
The world burns

The beauty in twisted darkness
Raped by the light of Christ
We were not born to follow
We don't need your guiding light

I tear the skies with my bare hands
There is no death for me
The world burns with worms of fire

Sun or animal, star or beast
Alone all the way to the heart of Christ

I'm free to die when I wish
I'm born from scarlet songs
And when the time is right
I shall forever walk alone

The beauty in twisted darkness
Raped by the light of Christ
Worlds end, through a thousand suns
