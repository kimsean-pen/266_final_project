I bleed upon
Every straw
Every straw
You need
I bleed
You're blessed
Blessed with
Holy hands

If you could keep me together
I won't stay home
No I never
I lie in a pool of spit and fear
But I won't stay weak or hurt or shattered

Holding on
Holding on

Funny names
Second-skin
Third-skin
Second-hands
It's a life
Paranoid
You're blessed
With holy hands

If you could keep me together
I won't stay home
No I never
