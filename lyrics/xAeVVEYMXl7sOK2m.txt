Little birdie whispered in my ear
You been cooking up a world of fear
Put your hands in things.
You should have known
You was riding in the danger zone.
Well you had us all fooled with your quarter back smile
And your crocodile tears there for a while
My paradigm shifting man you're making me shout:
Hey, from here on out
Friends are gonna be hard to come by
Left us wondering what it all was about
You had it easy man you chose the hard way
Walk that old lonely road in a shadow of a doubt
From here on out.
Should I pass over, decide to cross?
You may wonder what the trouble costs
That don't matter now life goes on.
Hallelujah the trouble's gone
No sense in holding grudges and its best to forgive
These are things that I must learn to practice while I live
Got my paradigm shifting man you're making me shout:
Hey, from here on out
Friends are gonna be hard to come by
Left us wondering what was it was all about
You had it easy man chose the hard way
Walk that old lonely road in a shadow of a doubt.
Hey, from here on out
Let the bugle blow a song of peace time
Left us wondering what it's all about
You been denied but you carried it with ya
Down that old lonely road in a shadow of a doubt
Yeah from here on out.
