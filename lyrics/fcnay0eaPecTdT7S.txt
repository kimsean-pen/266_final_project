When I was younger I left my door closed
Then, all the monsters, they left me alone
They left me alone, they left me alone
They left me alone, oh
On a tree top, sitting
Will you help me scream again?
Will you come back with me?
Let me show you this freedom, friend
Oh, back then, we were free again
Oh friend, come be free again

Picked an orange for you
Got it from the tallest tree
Fed it to the monsters
Underneath your bedroom feet
Told 'em they can't live here anymore
Wonder imagination, freedom grows
Oh, back then, we were free again
Free, oh friend, come be free again

Will you come back?
Will you take my hand?
Will you sit up here with?
Will you come back with me?
