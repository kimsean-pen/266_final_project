Boy I'll never trade ya, or let another woman take ya.
I'm holding on to what I've got, I'm not a fool.
My girlfriends think I'm crazy, but I never let it phaze me,
when they criticize the love I feel for you. Cause

Chorus
I'm your woman, and I want the world to know it
so I try my best to show that, I love you.
I'm your woman, oh baby don't you know it?
If you don't just let me show ya. I love you.
Ooh I love you, I love you, I love you.
And I'm so proud to be your woman.
I love you, I love you I love you.
Baby I love you.

Boy I couldn't stand it, if you took my love for granted,
cause i cherish all the time I spend with you. Yes I do.
To be in love is special, it's worth more than any treasure.
Loving you forever is all I wanna do. Oh cause

Chorus
I'm your woman, and I want the world to know it
so I try my best to show that, I love you. ooh
I'm your woman, oh baby don't you know it?
If you don't just let me show ya. I love you.
Ooh I love you, I love you, I love you.
And I'm so proud to be your woman.
I love you, I love you, I love you.
Really really love you boy.

Something about the way you make me feel.
It keeps me spinning head over heels.
And I'm so proud to say that I'm your woman,
cause when I say it out loud, it just rings, so I sing
and start to shout.

Chorus
I'm your woman, and I want the world to know it
so I try my best to show that, I love you.
I'm your woman, oh baby don't you know it?
If you don't just let me show ya. I love you. (Yeah, yeah)
I love you, I love you, I love you, (really do love you)
I love you, I love you, I love you. (and I know you love me too)
I love you, I love you, I love you. (baby I love you)
I love you, I love you. I love you, (And I'm not ashamed to say it)

Proud to say I'm your woman because I'm so in love with you.
(and I'm gonna tell the world)
Proud to say I'm your woman because I'm so in love with you.

Too many words can get in the way, I'll break it down and simply say
I'm always gonna be here for you.

Proud to say I'm your woman because I'm so in love with you.
Proud to say I'm your woman because I'm so in love with you.

Nobody else can love me this way, and every night on my knees
I pray that the love you give is never ending. So in love with you.
Baby I love you.

Proud to say I'm your woman because I'm so in love with you.
(So in love with you)
Proud to say I'm your woman because I'm so in love with you.
