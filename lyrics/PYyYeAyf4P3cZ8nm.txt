You always come to me, moaning through the years
About your past.
And strange as it may seem, it never came to you,
The way ahead

Fears you try to hide, hurting deep inside
You can't deny the past!

Tears of a violet sky
Lost in the fallen rain

Seasons pass me by, the everlasting circle,
A wicked plan
Is it the destiny? Was it meant to be?
It will not matter anymore

Please, it's time to break the chains
The past you cannot change
Time to let it go

Things you try to hide, hurting deep inside
You have to live behind!

Tears of a violet sky
Lost in the fallen rain
Dead roses hear my cry
Flowing in vain
Fears you try to hide burning deep inside
You can't deny the past!

Rinnega il tuo passato
Risplendi nell' oscuritá
Stella senza etá

Riflessi di passioni
Celate tra le tenebre
Raggio di luce
