(Starlight callin'
Callin', callin')

Starlight, I hear you callin' out to me
(I hear you callin', callin', callin', callin')
Sweet love rollin' across my mind again
(Oh, you only cross my mind)
I want you, yes, I do
I need you, yes, I do
And then you run

You've gotta stop foolin' around
Keep your feet on the ground, little girl
And starlight will shine all around, little girl

(Starlight callin')

Starlight, your eyes are lookin' out so far away
(I hear you callin', callin', callin', callin')
Constellation in the sky is smiling down on me
I wonder, wonder why
(I wonder, wonder why)
I can feel you're so real
I can see you're so near
And then you run

You've gotta stop foolin' around
Keep your feet on the ground, little girl
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
And starlight will shine all around, little girl
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
You had me all the summer long, little girl
(It's no good at all, hey)

Moonglow, come, light the way up to my window
(I hear you callin', callin', callin', callin')
As you roll across the night
Don't tell nobody that I told you so
(Don't tell nobody 'bout it)
I need you, yes, I do
I need you, yes, I do
And then you run

You've gotta stop foolin' around
Keep your feet on the ground, little girl
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
And starlight will shine all around, little girl
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
You had me all the summer long, little girl
(It's no good at all)

Starlight, your eyes are lookin' down on me
So far away
Starlight, your eyes are lookin' down on me
So far away
Starlight, your eyes are lookin' down on me
So far away
