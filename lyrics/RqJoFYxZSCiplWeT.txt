(Ronnie Dunn/Tommy Lee James)

A man this lonely
A man this blue
A man whose world's been torn in two
Needs somebody
With a heart that's true
A man this lonely needs a woman like you

Two arms this empty
Need someone to hold
A man this lost needs somewhere to go
When the nights go on forever
And the days do too
A man this lonely needs a woman like you

I'd lost hope
I was so far down
Here you come turning all that around
I'd come to think
Of love as a lie
All that's on my mind now
Is you by my side

A man this lonely
A man this blue
A man whose world's been torn in two
Needs somebody
With a heart that's true
A man this lonely needs a woman like you
A man this lonely needs a woman like you
