Even more than philosophers
Aiming at no less than the total transformation of man and the world
Begin with the dissolution of superfluous matters
So that desire and conciousness are free

New man, new woman proud and free
New man, new woman happy to be

True life embodying pleasure principle's noblest triumph
Over the cowering mendacity of bourgeois/Christian civilisation
