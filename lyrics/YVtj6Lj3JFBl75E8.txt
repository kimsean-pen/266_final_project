Well don't you worry 'bout
What's been on my mind
I'm in no hurry
I can take my time
I'm going red
And my tongue's getting tired
Out of my head
And my mouth's getting dry, I'm hi-hi-hi-high
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now
I feel so strong
That I can't disguise, oh my
Well, I just can't
Apologise, no
Don't hang me up
But don't let me down
We could have fun
Just by fooling around and around and around round
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now
You know I'm smiling baby
You need some guiding baby
I'm just deciding baby
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now
This doesn't happen to me
Every day
No excuses
I've got anyway
I'll satisfy your
Every need
And I'll know
You'll satisfy me, oh my, my, my, my, my
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together
They said we were too young
Our kind of love was no fun
But our love comes from above do it
Let's make love
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together, now
