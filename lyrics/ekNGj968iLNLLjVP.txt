I'm thinking about the consequences
I know I did you wrong and now you left me high and dry
I didn't mean to burst you bubble
And I didn't mean to say goodbye
('cause you know)
You know that I been sleeping alone in my bed
('cause you know)
You know that I regret it every Word that I Said

So come on swallow your pride
So come on swallow your pride
I do anything you want to
So come on swallow your pride
Uhuhuhuhuh...
So come on swallow your pride
Uhuhuhuhuh...

So big and just course of Action
Forget about the past
Tell me now what you prefer
I don't need another cold heart injection
Even tho it mind just be what I deserve

('cause you know)
You know that I been sleeping alone in my bed
('cause you know)
You know that I regret it every Word that I Said

So come on swallow your pride
So come on swallow your pride
I do anything you want to
So come on swallow your pride
Uhuhuhuhuh...
So come on swallow your pride
Uhuhuhuhuh...
Swallow your pride
Uhuhuhuhuh.

('cause You know)
you know that I been sleeping alone in my bed
('cause you know)
You know that I regret it whatever I Said

So come on swallow your pride
so come on swallow your pride
I do anything you want to
So come on swallow your pride
So come on swallow your pride
So come on swallow your pride
I do anything you want to
so come on swallow your pride
Uhuhuhuhuh...
So come on swallow your pride
Uhuhuhuhuh...
Come on swallow your pride.
