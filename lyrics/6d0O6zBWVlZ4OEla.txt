I really hope i can do it
Cause they're all depending on me
I know i must leave the only home
I've ever known
And brave the dangers of the forest
Saving them before they're eaten
I mean, how hard can that be

Looking up at a sunny sky, so shiny and blue
And there's a butterfly
Well, isn't that a super fantastic sign
It's going to be a super fantastic day
Such marvelousness
It's gonna bring a pocket full of songs that I'm gonna sing
And I'm ready to take on anything
Hooray!
Some super fun surprise around each corner
Just riding on a rainbow, I'm gonna be okay

Hey
I'm not giving up today
Theres nothing getting in my way
And if you knock knock me over
I will get back up again
Oh!
If something goes a little wrong
Well you can go ahead and bring it on
Cause if you knock knock me over, I will get back up again
Woah! oh oh oh, get back up again
Woah! oh oh oh, ahhhh!

I'm marching along i got confidence
I'm cooler than a pack of peppermints
And I haven't been this excited since
I can't remember when!

I'm off on this remarkable adventure
Just riding on a rainbow
What if it's all a big mistake
What if it's more than I can take
No I can't think that way cause I know
I'm really really gonna be okay

Hey
I'm not giving up today
Theres nothing getting in my way
And if you knock knock me over
I will get back up again
Oh!
If something goes a little wrong
Well you can go ahead and bring it on
Cause if you knock knock me over, i will get back up again

Get up, get up, get up, (woah)
Get back up again
Get up, get up, get up, (woah)

I'm okay!

Get up, get up, get up, (woah)
If you knock knock me over, knock knock me over
I will get back up again
