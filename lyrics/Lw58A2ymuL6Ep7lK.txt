Out of the dark landscape
Is the fall of this ancient land
The scale and enormity of this disaster
Nothing at all remains
Decimated by the will of our gods
Leaving all in ruin
Out of the heavens came the furnace of flames
With ignited infernos
Fires spread across the lands
Absolving ancient cities in its path

Leaving devastation in its wake
Flash floods creating liquified ground
Under the veil of deceit and disdain
A catastrophe of devastating power

Ruins of a lost civilization
What lies beneath the waves of despair
The collapse of glorious land and its downfall
As the world crumbled beneath their feet

Unveiled wonders of a time now passed
Searing ash and burning flesh
The avalanche of doom
In the marsh lies remains of the past
Terrifying sight of death
The favor of the gods

The haunting ruins is what lies beneath
Sheer savagery and brutal viciousness
It shattered the foundations of society
Within the demise of a land once thriving
Absolve me

Under the blazing sun lies a world of phenom
The fabled palace upon the mountains
Stranded in puritanical sand
The empire of the lost temples
