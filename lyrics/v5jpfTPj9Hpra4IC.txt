I gotta give it to ya
Yeah, you talk real tough
Sayin' you're nothing but love
Bet it gets under your skin
And when it gets too much then the Devil steps in

I know you say that you don't want it, want it
You take a couple pills to stop it (coming for ya)
And he turns up without a warning, warning
I heard he's looking for you

You and I ain't friends
So stop strangling me
You get a lot, I'm getting free
There's no escaping me, I'm my worst enemy
Pack your bags and leave
You have caused me too much grief
I'm getting out, I'm getting free
There's no escaping me, I'm my worst enemy

I chew your ears off for hours
Yeah, I'm cool for a minute 'til the demons come 'round
And I feel empty and sad, yeah
Drinking 'til I'm poisoned, only then I can escape my mind

I know you say that you don't want it, want it
You take a couple pills to stop it (coming for ya)
And he turns up without a warning, warning
I heard he's looking for you

You and I ain't friends
So stop strangling me
You get a lot, I'm getting free
There's no escaping me, I'm my worst enemy
Pack your bags and leave
You have caused me too much grief
I'm getting out, I'm getting free
There's no escaping me, I'm my worst enemy

I go to bed and then lie awake up screaming
Why ain't I sleeping and why ain't I dreaming?
Have you come to me to tell me a secret?
You will not tell me 'cause you know I'll leak it

I go to bed and then lie awake up screaming
Why ain't I sleeping and why ain't I dreaming?
Have you come to me to tell me a secret?
You will not tell me 'cause you know I'll leak it

I go to bed and then lie awake up screaming
Why ain't I sleeping and why ain't I dreaming?
Have you come to me to tell me a secret?
You will not tell me 'cause you know I'll leak it

You and I ain't friends
So stop strangling me
You get a lot, I'm getting free
There's no escaping me, I'm my worst enemy
Pack your bags and leave
You have caused me too much grief
I'm getting out, I'm getting free
There's no escaping me, I'm my worst enemy

I'm my worst enemy
