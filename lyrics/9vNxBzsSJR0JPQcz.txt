Always told you not to love me
Now look what you made me do
I got poison in my pocket
Told you I was bad news
My demeanor made you wait
But the consequences stayed
I killed everything we were

Baby, murder was a case
Baby, murder was a case
Baby, murder was a case

So you like the fear of falling
But you stand there looking dumb
Why'd you come here in the first place?
Baby, I am not the one
How can you not walk away after everything I've done?

It's been 27 hours since we even saw the sun
Since we even saw the sun
Since we even saw the sun

Tears you cry rely on my disdain
While we waited, days that never came
Time just flies, but I still carry on

It's been 27 hours
Since we even saw the sun
Since we even saw the sun
Since we even saw the sun
Since we even saw the sun
Since we even saw
