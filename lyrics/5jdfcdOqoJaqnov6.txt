It wasn't until we reached the third reality that I became truly
convinced by the primitive,
angular landscape which had begun to
materialize around us from the moment we set out.
Deep down I knew it was false,
but we'd traveled far enough to confuse my senses for a while.
We trod upon a narrow path that
meandered through a forest dense with suicides.
Legions of putrid limbs brushed against
us as we struggled to reach the other side.
Finally we emerged on a level plain and stopped to rest.
With the dimensionless sky pressing down on us,
we swallowed the fraudulent air of that faraway place.
In the distance a convoy of figures approached.
They crossed a river of geometric
gore, then passed us without greeting.
Silently they marched in our tracks back into that terrible wood,
and with renewed purpose we followed their trail across the plain.
Soon we'd traveled so far West that we were East again.
I turned to you and shrugged before we continued further still.
