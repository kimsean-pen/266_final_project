I saw that mountain burn, or was it in my head?
I'll track down the words, if you dig up the dead.
Well I have never been free, but I have always been cheap.
I have never been free.
But nothing in my bones can say just where you've been.
Nothing in my bones can let me start again.
I'll start again.
My eyelids falling down, all my dreams in black and white.
I see so clearly now I won't ever get it right.
But I don't wanna be free. I don't wanna be me.
I don't wanna be free.
You want me scream at your ex-girlfriend.
But I wanna be much better than I am.
You want me scream at your ex-boyfriend.
But I wanna be, and I don't think I can.
Nothing in my bones can say just where you've been.
Nothing in my bones can let me start again.
I'll start again.
I'll start again.
I'll start again.
