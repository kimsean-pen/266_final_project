I'm reverse running
It doesn't mean anything
Hurling headling

Why would you even ask?
I've forgotten who I am
Snake's uncoiling

Pressed up to the glass
All things you shouldnt ask
But you see through me
It doesnt mean anything
A meaningless plaything
Reverse running
Running contrary-ways
Pulling off the anyways

I'm messing up
Messing up the balance
Breaking my trajectory
All the toys in the factory
Why you all lie down
Why you all lie down
I'm skipping back through the tapes
Skipping through the ad breaks

God in heaven
It makes me feel energized
All else is sanitzed
And with such joy
Running contrary-ways
Pulling off the anyways
I jump back round

Im reversing
Im reverse running
Falling under horses feet
All the things that I shouldnt see
Animal or bird
Animal or bird
Moving in slow motion
This shit is gonna mess me up
