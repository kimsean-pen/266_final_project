I'm through with illusions just dillusions for now
I've took a step to the edge but i've been walking for miles
It was a very temporary waste of time
Is there really sucha thing as a waste of time?
Can't let myself be restrained
Let perceptions be so torn
Kill confusin by killing options
Burn no bridges to stay warm
Can't keep running from the rain
Can't live my life on the edge of the storm
Kill confusion by killing options
burn no bridges to stay warm.
I'm sick of emotions always tearing the inside
Watching things crumble, letting all things slide,
very temporary wase of time,
is this really such a thing as a waste of time?
Can't let myself be restrained
Can't live my life on the edge of the storm
Kill confusion by killing options
Burn No Bridges to stay warm
Can't keep running from the rain,
let perceptions be so torn,
kill confusion by killing options,
burn no bridges to stay warm
Can't let myself be restrained
I can't live my life on the edge of the storm
Kill confusion by killing options
Burn no bridges to stay warm
Can't le myself be restrained
CAn't live a life on the edge of the storm
Kill confusion by killing options
Burn no bridges to stay warm
I'm through with illusions dillusions for now

Can't let myself be restrained
