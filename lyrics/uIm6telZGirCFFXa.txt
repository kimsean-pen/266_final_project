We made from nothing
So take it away
Take it away again
Take it away

Taking over Earth and beyond the skies
Show me a sign, you down to ride?
For progression
We stay alive 'cause we need the pain
For progression
I want it all, space time in sync
Life intertwines my desires in sonic speed
So we lift from the ground
Blasting off much higher and higher we go

You'll never take me under
Never gonna take me under

Broken down
This burden was mine
'Cause gravity holds nothing refined
Now forever
We'll live forever
I want to know if there's more to this
I want to know if there's more to this

(One small step for man, one giant leap
For mankind)

You'll never take me under
Never gonna take me under
Now we're falling, falling down
Falling, falling down to nowhere to nowhere
Now we are falling, falling down
Falling, falling down, to nowhere
Now we are falling down

The universe ain't big enough for all of us
Open the sky
This universe wasn't big enough for us
Open the sky

Taste of our past left in their future
View from the sky
I'm the rainmaker
This odyssey got me lit
'Cause I'm getting fired up in commotion
It's true
See beyond what you're supposed to
Choose to see what I see
You won't dare to deny it
Who is ever gonna find me
When gravity breaks away?
Who ever knew we'd go
Where gravity breaks away?
Now we've reached beyond
Where gravity fades away

You'll never take me under
Never gonna take me under
You'll never take me under
Never gonna take me under
Now we're falling, falling down
Falling, falling down to nowhere to nowhere
Now we are falling, falling down
Falling, falling down, to nowhere
Now we are falling down
