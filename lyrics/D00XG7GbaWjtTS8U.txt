Wanna load this on the pod
Call up my homegirls and put it up in the car
Ride through the city and run through the lights
This ganna be our theme song for trouble tonight
See a cutie pull up right next to me (next to me)
Give him the digits he can't stop textin me (textin me)
We just riding we rolling you know how we cruise
And when this come on yeah you know how we do

You wanna hear something to make you wild and crazy
Heat the block up like toasters
Everytime you chillin and you with ya homies
You need a little something for the turn up
