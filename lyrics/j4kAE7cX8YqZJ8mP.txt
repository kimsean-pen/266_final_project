You and I
You and I
Living together
Loving forever
At our distance
Another for instance
United United
You become me
And I becomy you
She is she
And she is you too
United United
A corresponding game to play
A special way for us to stay
United United
Its a lie
Its the same
It's a sigh
It's a game
Its the why
Its the where and the when we're United
United
You and I You and I
United United
Four faces blending blending blending
Neverending
Our places sending
Shades of evening
You and I You and I United United
Oceans between us
Sky between us
Land between us
Fire between us
We're United United

Can't stop it

United United
You are my Knight
You are my night-night my evening
Its very plain to say
Its a strange system
You miss them
You want to be them
You have to see them
You have to be them
United United
You and me la la la la
You and I
Make ourselves forever together forever and ever
United United
Love is the law
Love is the law
Love is the law
Love is the law
United United United You and I You and I United
TIme will see us
Time will free us
Time will be us
We are everywhere
There is no why
There is no sky anymore
There is just us United
