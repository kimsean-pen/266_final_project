Chameleon-like, you see the slithering ones
If you don't blend in, you're in danger
Which face saves face? It's a slippery slope
And you can't fight back on your own

Hot tongue, cold blood, our defense is up
Does everyone owe you something?
Lose-lose, win-win, we're up against the wall
It's that high school small town talk

I can't face the horror
I can't take the chameleon nights
Blindfold the voyeur
I can't take the chameleon nights

Behind the screen, you're on brave attack
You sacrifice to be righteous
Unfriend, unplug, there's a world outside
There's a place we see eye to eye

Everybody's talking but we don't know shit
You fight, I fight, it's an ego trip
It's a video game and you're an avatar
What you fake becomes what you are

I can't face the horror
I can't take the chameleon nights
Blindfold the voyeur
I can't take the chameleon nights
I can't face the horror
Can't take the chameleon nights
You fight pain with torture
I can't take the chameleon nights
