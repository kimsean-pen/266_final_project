In my heart is where I long for you
In my smile I search for you
Each time you turn and run away I cry inside
My silly way, too young to know any more

In my world the devil dances and dares
To leave my soul just anywhere
Until I find peace in this world
I'll sing my song everywhere, too young to know anymore

The wind covers me cold
The starry skies all around my eyes
Far behind the city moans
Well worthy of the people there, oh, the songs they love to hear

So please let me sing a song for you
One I've known so very long
Please let me sing a song for you
To help your day along, oh, please could you find the time?
