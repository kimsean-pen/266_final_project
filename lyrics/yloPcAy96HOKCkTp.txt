The burden of freedom's weight,
yearning for form and shape.
Riddles they spoke in tongues,
yearning for life undone.

Hands upon the oak
at the end of time,
and we scream the oath.

Crushing the weak, and grinding on
wheels of eternity foregone.

Lay dead weight.
Lay dead weight.
Lay dead weight.
Lay dead weight.

Lay dead weight.
Lay dead weight.
