Champagne ladies comin' round
And the first one off this plane gets crowned
And we all know why we go

Birthday party, thought it changed me
The last one took a bit arranging
We are smart enough to know: don't get old

Life is a bastard, life wants to kill you
Don't get old
Life is a bastard, it wants to kill you
Don't let go

Doin' wrong but feeling right
At least you'll get some sleep tonight
We just don't want to know

Last night was the fucking worst
As if you'd given me a curse
I just don't want to know

Life is a bastard, it wants to kill you
Don't get old
Life is a bastard, it wants to kill you
Don't let go

Business is a little bastard
If I could just sit back, relax
And we could go, we could go

Life is a bastard, it wants to kill you
Don't get old
Life is a bastard, it wants to kill you
Don't let go
