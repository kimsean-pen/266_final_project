Baby, you've got me sick
I don't know what I did
Need to take a break and figure it out, yeah
Got your voice in my head
Sayin', "Let's just be friends"
Can't believe the words came out of your mouth, yeah

I'm tryna be okay
I'm tryna be alright
But seeing you with him
Just don't feel right

And I'm like (oww!)
Never thought it'd hurt so bad
Getting over you-oh
And (oww!)
You're giving me a heart attack
Looking like you do-oh

'Cause you're all I ever wanted
Thought you would be the one
It's (oww!)
Giving me a heart attack
Getting over you-oh-oh-oh

Yeah!
Baby, now that you're gone
I can't stand dumb love songs
Missing you is all I'm thinking about, yeah

Everyone's telling me
I'm just too blind to see
How you messed me up, I'm better off now, yeah

I'm tryna be okay
I'm tryna be alright
But seeing you with him
Just don't feel right

And I'm like (oww!)
Never thought it'd hurt so bad
Getting over you-oh
And (oww!)
You're giving me a heart attack
Looking like you do-oh

'Cause you're all I ever wanted
Thought you would be the one
It's (oww!)
Giving me a heart attack
Getting over you-oh-oh-oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh... (oww!)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, every time you look like that (oww!)

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh... (oww!)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You're giving me a heart attack

But seeing you with him
Just don't feel right

And I'm like (oww!)
Never thought it'd hurt so bad
Getting over you-oh
And (oww!)
You're giving me a heart attack
Looking like you do-oh

'Cause you're all I ever wanted
Thought you would be the one
(Oww!)
Giving me a heart attack
Getting over you-oh-oh-oh

You... (oww!)
You're all I ever wanted (oww!)
Yeah...
Yeah, every time you look like that (oww!)

Come on
You're all I ever wanted (oww!)
You're giving me a heart attack
Oww!
