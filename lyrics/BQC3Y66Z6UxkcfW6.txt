I heard you might be
Concerned you like me
Your turn just try me
I won't take lightly
Your heart in my hand
No lies, no sin
I know you can breathe
It's not air that you need

Do I make waves in your body, love
Do you get high is it just too much
When you get down and you feel my touch
Everything stops but do you go up, up
In your body love
Do you get high is it just too much
When you get down and you feel my touch

Everything stops but do you go up, up

Sometimes you throw me
I go up slowly
It's just right you know me
It's time to show me
Your light in my hand
Too bright to spend

This time I need it
I like to breathe it

Do I make waves in your body, love
Do you get high is it just too much
When you get down and you feel my touch
Everything stops but do you go up, up
In your body love
Do you get high is it just too much
When you get down and you feel my touch
Everything stops but do you go up, up
