Long live the reckless and the brave
I don't think I want to be saved
My song has not been sung
So long live us

Looking out at a town called Suburbia
Everybody's just fighting to fit in
Little rats, running mazes, having babies
It's a vicious little world that we live in
Looking back at a life on the other side
I realize that I didn't fit in
Didn't hate it, but I didn't quite relate it
To my precious little world

So long live the reckless and the brave
I don't think I want to be saved
My song has not been sung

And long live the fast times, so come what may
I don't think I'll ever be saved
Our song has not been sung
Long live us

Breaking out of a town called Suburbia
I remember everybody always saying
"Little brat, must be crazy, never make it
In our vicious little world"
Still I'm leaving
Got a van, got a chance, got my dignity
Got a dream, got a spark, got somewhere to be
Take a breath, say goodbye
To their precious little world
And say goodbye to me

So long live the reckless and the brave
I don't think I want to be saved
My song has not been sung

And long live the fast times, so come what may
I don't think I'll ever be saved
Our song has not been sung
Long live us

Long live us

Long live the reckless and the brave
I don't think I want to be saved
My song has not been sung

Long live the reckless and the brave
I don't think I want to be saved
My song has not been sung

And long live the fast times, so come what may
I don't think I'll ever be saved, I know
Our song has not been sung
Long live us

Long live us
