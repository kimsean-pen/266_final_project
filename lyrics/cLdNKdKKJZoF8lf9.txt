Born in Kansas on an ordinary plain
Ran to New York but ran away from fame
Only seventeen when all your dreams came true
But all you wanted was someone to undress you

And all the stars you kissed could never ease the pain
Still the grace remains, the face has changed
And you're still the same

And it's a long, long way from where you want to be
Well, it's a long, long road and you're too blind to see

Frame of silence of an innocent divine
Is a dangerous creation when you fail the test of time

And all the photographs of ghosts of long ago
Still they hurt you, so won't let you go
And you still don't know

And it's a long, long way from where you want to be
Well, it's a long, long road and you're too blind to see

When you look around yourself now
Do you recognize the girl?
The one who broke a thousand hearts
Terrified the world

And all the stars you kissed could never ease the pain
Lift the face has changed, the grace remains
And you're still the same
And it's a long, long way from where you want to be
Well, it's a long, long road and you're too blind to see
And it's a long, long way from where you want to be
Well, it's a long, long road and you're too blind to see
And it's a long, long way from where you want to be
Well, it's a long, long road and you're too blind to see
And it's a long, long way
