Slappin' leather was devised,
During a wild streak in her life,
She had a cheap apartment up on Royal Street,
She brought home just enough to keep her on her feet.

She don't believe in anything,
But if you ask her, she'll say
"there's a plenty of things to believe in"

Sweet Rosalyn.
Sometimes you gotta give in.
Sweet Rosalyn.
Sometimes you gotta give in,
Sometimes you gotta be loved.

She got a number off the bathroom wall,
She was looking for a good time so she made the call.
Got a strangly calm voice on the other line,
Sneaky little priest tryin' to reach out to the swine.

He said, "Hello my name is Father Tim.
Seems to me your zeal for this life,
has been wearing a little thin."

Sweet Rosalyn.
Sometimes you gotta give in.
Sweet Rosalyn.
Sometimes you gotta give in,
Sometimes you gotta be loved.

Maybe we all could use a little grace,
To know when to run or when to,
stay in one place.

Sweet Rosalyn.
Sometimes you gotta give in.
Sweet Rosalyn.
Sometimes you gotta give in.
Sweet Rosalyn.
Sometimes you gotta give in.
Sweet Rosalyn.
Sometimes you gotta give in,
Sometimes you gotta be loved.
