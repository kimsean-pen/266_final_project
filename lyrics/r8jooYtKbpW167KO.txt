Someone to protect and be protected by
When that certain fury would come
Someone to respect and be respected by
When deprivation took its toll on you
No more to defend, fading away

'Cause we were always alone
We were born in the hunter's season
All I really ever wanted was for you
You to die in the arms of someone

Someone to remember only to the ground
When the sudden glory is gone
Mother, would you send a sign, a message down?
Consolidation with your only son
No more to defend, for someone to love

'Cause we were always alone
We were born in the hunter's season
All I really ever wanted was for you
You to die in the arms of someone

This destiny falls upon you
'Cause nothing remains so long
Only a miracle could have killed the pain
You see, now you go

A silent custody, you meet my eyes
Though life is long I know you're with me
Know it too

'Cause we were always alone
We were born in the hunter's season
All I really ever wanted was for you
You to die in the arms of someone
