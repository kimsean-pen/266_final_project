No one sees the real,
They think they know what you need, but they lie
Wishing that you're all alone and forgotten
Locked up in a cage

People change,
but jealousy never dies
Things they rearrange
Bridges burn
That's just life
In your darkest days
See the light
From the bottom, then you elevate

Both feet drumming on the earth
Can u feel the vibration?
Rhythm heard around the world
Your frequency is synched to the universe
Can u feel the vibration?
(Ghungroo Ghungroo Ghungroo Ghungroo Ghungroo)

Be careful what u choose
Eyes only on what's meant for you
So rise or fall
Give it all
'Cause your nothing if ur scared of war

When karma came
Like a thief in the night
Things they rearrange
Spin the circle of life
In your brighter days
Say a prayer for the light
Hope it never fades

Raja Kumari [??]
Daughter of the king
How long they think that they could
Keep up with my tempo
Dance to the rhythm
Dance in the Himalay
Ain't hearing what they say
(dhunna dhunna)
Heart beating like the bass

Sound wave coming off the earth
When your third eye is awakened
Rhythm heard around the world
Your frequency is synched to the universe
Can you feel the vibration?
