Made a lot of mistakes
Fell in love for love's sake
I gave my heart to Jesus
Just to take it back and tear it to pieces
It's been an awful long time
Speaking words that weren't mine
I'm over starting over
Riding on a broken down roller coaster
I know better but I never learn, oh

Everybody's telling me who I ought to be
Who I'm not and where I gotta be
The last thing I need are voices in my head
No, not me
I don't even know yet who I wanna be
I got miles and miles in front of me
And all that I can see are the mountains up ahead
Won't let them stop me
I'm going up, just watch me

What a colored, big sky
I got to cross the clothes line
I took back the history
The beauty's in the mystery
Sun is shining like gold
I'm saying "Hi" through my window
As I search the ceiling
For the answers I'm not sure I'm ready to hear yet
Oh, what is this feeling I get?

Everybody's telling me who I ought to be
Who I'm not and where I gotta be
The last thing I need are voices in my head
No, not me
I don't even know yet who I wanna be
I got miles and miles in front of me
And all that I can see are the mountains up ahead
Won't let them stop me,
I'm going up, just watch me

Everybody's telling me who I ought to be
Who I'm not and where I gotta be
The last thing I need are voices in my head
No, not me
And I don't even know yet who I wanna be
I got miles and miles in front of me
And all that I can see are the mountains up ahead
Won't let them stop me
I'm going up, just watch me

Everybody's telling me who I ought to be
Who I'm not and where I gotta be
The last thing I need are voices in my head
No, not me
I don't even know yet who I wanna be
I got miles and miles in front of me
And all that I can see are the mountains up ahead
Won't let them stop me
