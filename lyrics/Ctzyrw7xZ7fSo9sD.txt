Born to suffer, through a lifetime of darkness
Controlled by fear, held deep within your mind

As your mind reaches a distant point
Your soul beyond all pain

You shall realize all that has occurred
Were illusions formed from within your brain

You now know the truth - Your mind is now set free
You have broken the chains - That enslave all of humanity

Perceiving - life's reality
An insight - to man's destiny

A coherent existence, comprehension you cannot deny
A meaningless persistence, confirmation you cannot defy

We follow without thinking, as our life passes us by
This newly acquired knowledge, clarified as we die

In this kingdom of the mindless
We are born to suffer
