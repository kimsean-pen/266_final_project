From the unrelenting beat of a pounding drum, come alive.
From the ceasing breast of a wicked beast, we survive.
In the hallowed marriage of sound and revolt, come anew.
To the hollowed, disparaged - shed and molt, overdue.

Splintering fingers, gore strewn across each hand
(Sink deep, stone, sink deep, stone)
Splintering fingers, gore strewn across each hand
(Sink deep, stone, sink deep, stone)
Pray for a way out of here. Pray for a way.

No animal in all the kingdom
Shall ever strike me down.
A coward in his finest moment.
Heavy is the head that wears the crown.

Be swift and painless, not a glancing blow
To the back of the head, to the back of the head
Be swift and painless, not a glancing blow
(Sink deep, stone, sink deep, stone)
Pray for a way out of here. Pray for a way.

A long, slow pull on the briar.
Ready, aim... When the fire burns,
Callusing, topping off the urns, a sound remains.

Look to the actor in the heavy armor, his mettle shakes.
Listen well to the deafening clamor whimpering makes.
Look now to the unassuming, unwavering
Standing before the heavens screaming,
"Bring on the storm. Bring on the storm. Bring on the rain.
Bring on the jesters, and bring on the pain.
Bring on the storm. Bring on the rain.
Bring on the jesters, and bring on the pain."

The seed is planted. Let the roots reach far and wide.
Let it grow tall. Let the rings remain intact on the inside.
And though the autumn brings a fall of leaves (let it grow tall),
We come anew. We come anew. We come anew.
