Come a little closer
Do you feel like we are over
If not let me closer
Just saying that I want you
Come a little closer
Do you feel like we are over
If not let me closer
Just saying that I want you

Just saying that I want you
Just saying that I want you
Just saying that I want you
Just saying that I want you
Just saying that I want you

Slow down baby
Take a deep breath maybe
Come a little closer
Just saying that I want you

Slow down baby
Take a deep breath maybe
Come a little closer
Just saying that I want you

Just saying I would let you
You know I'd let you come through
I know we're on deep water
But let me hold you closer
I know we're burning out love
But let me see you open
Let me hold you closer
Let me hold you closer

Just saying that I want you
Just saying that I want you
Just saying that I want you
Just saying that I want you
Just saying that I want you
Just saying that I want you
Just saying that I want you
Just saying that I want you
Just saying that I want you
Just saying that I want you
Just saying that I want you
Just saying that I want you
Just saying that I want you
Just saying that I want you
Just saying that I want you
Just saying that I want you
