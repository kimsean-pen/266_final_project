The boundary is my stronghold
I push the glacier towards the edge
Stepping across the horizon's threshold
With unexplored domain to wedge

I catch the sun and tame the flares
As thunder strikes for a hundred years
A climd the hills, they are my stairs
To the starry sky and to the ardent spheres

Terminus
I catch the sun and tame the flares
Terminus
As thunder strikes for a hundred years

The culmination and the foundation
First man to the end of the world
The gateway and the manifestation
Of the borders I expand, in a storm swirled

Beyond the branches, deep in the sources
I have my home, I have my trust
A climd the hills, they are my stairs
To the starry sky and to the ardent spheres

Terminus
Beyond the branches, deep in the sources
Terminus
I have my home, I have my trust

The elemental outline of the universal courses
First man to the end of the world
While sea and land clash under stellar dust

Raised to seek, grown to see
The flames of creation and prosperity
At the end of the path I build my fortress
With pillars of dreams and nature's primeness
