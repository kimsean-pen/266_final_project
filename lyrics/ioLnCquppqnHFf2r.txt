Hey what were ya thinkin'
When they were startin' the show
Yeah, I was there
But I didn't care at all
I was tryin' to find you
When you got lost in the crowd
'Cause I'm drunk all the time
I like your helium voice

There was a guy in the seat next to mine
Watchin' the girls when the cops made us stand in line

Yeah, so if its sad
Well you still gotta live till ya die
Man, everyone's chewin' the apple you got in your eye

It's like at the circus
When you get lost in the crowd
You're happy but nervous
Definite sign that you lost it

There was a guy in the seat next to mine
Watchin' the girls when the cops made us stand in line
