Together we have this love
Even so it's not enough
Bruised and burned
We won't lose heart
Just because
Life gets hard

Writing lying emails to our friends back home
Feeling guilty if we sometimes wanna be alone

Hand cannot erase this love
Hand cannot erase this love

A love like this makes us strong
We laugh it off when things go wrong
It's not you, forgive me if I find I need more space
'Cause trust means we don't have to be together every day

Hand cannot erase this love
Hand cannot erase this love

Hand cannot erase this love
Hand cannot erase this love
