I love the way you tie me down
False words would never be allowed
When I am yours
When we are home

You loved the many faults you found
You kept what was worth keeping around
When I am yours
When we are home

Wanting you to know, before things become overgrown
There are reasons why I am this way
Wanting you to know, before things become overgrown
There are reasons why I am this way

I have opened my heart so many times
You have a hold of it now
I need you to breathe new life into me
You have a hold of it now

I tried to loosen off your hold
But you stayed and nothing made you fall
I knew when you took me over
That you where not like the others
I can be young and reckless
But you stayed

I have opened that heart so many times
You have a hold of it now
I need you to breathe new life into me
You have a hold of it now

Wanting you to know, before things become overgrown
There are reasons why I am this way
Wanting you to know, before things become overgrown
There are reasons why I am this way

All those times I tried to make you forget me
You stayed, you stayed
All those times I tried to make you forget me
You stayed

When I am yours
When I am yours
When we are home
When we are home
