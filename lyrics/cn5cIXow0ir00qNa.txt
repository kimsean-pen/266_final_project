be real
wake me
daydream every day
tell me
are we something
you look forward to
be real
show me how you feel
be real
i feel the same
you're hard to believe
we don't have the time
it's on your side
your words are empty
mine are not enough
be real
show me how you feel
be real
i know we have changed
i don't want to feel blue
i don't want to feel used
i'll forget when i see you
i'll forget when i see you
