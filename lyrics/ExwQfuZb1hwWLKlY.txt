We stood in your room and laughed out loud
Suddenly the laughter died, we were caught in an eye to eye
We sat on the floor and did we sit close
I could smell your thoughts and thought, do you want to touch a lot like me?

Too scared to say a thing

I left your house and kicked myself
I put those feelings on a shelf to die
I guess I'm not a gambling type
But think of what the two of us had lost

I needed some time to think it out
7-Eleven parking lot, a toothless woman turned and stopped
I gave her a dime and a Chesterfield
She leaned down and kissed my cheek, I was scared but it felt sweet

Felt so sweet

She asked me if I had a name
I told her I was glued up on some chick
We sat and smoked against the wall
Drank a beer, felt the chill of fall

I took my car and drove it down the hill by your house
I drove so fast
The wind it couldn't cool me down, so I turned it around
And came back up

You were waiting on your step, steam showing off your breath
And water in your eyes
We pulled each other into one, parkas clinging on the lawn
And kissed right there

Said all my chicks smoke these things
And handed you a Chesterfield King
Held your hand and watched TV
And traced the little lines along your palm
