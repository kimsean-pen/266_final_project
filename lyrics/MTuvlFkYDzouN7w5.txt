Supposed to be sleep, but over my covers I peak
Won't you terrify me?
Don't belong to me
But still your shadow leaves, chills on my cheek
And I know it's a no, no, how I'm feeling for you
I can't rid him of my sheets
Pain wants me to let go
I'd be lying if I said no
Hurts so much that it's sweet

La la la la
Can't calm down, stalker's round, yeah
La la la la
Can't make a sound, you force my love out
Scared in your arms

Coiled in your skin, is where I'm stuck
I'll be coming again
Sweet charcoal black
Is where I wanna be at
I'll be coming back
And I know it's a no, no, how I'm feeling for you
I can't rid him of my sheets
Pain wants me to let go
I'd be lying if I said now
Hurts so much that it's sweet

La la la la
Can't calm down, stalker's round, yeah
La la la la
Can't make a sound, you force my love out
Scared in your arms

How does it feel?
To know I'm wrapped around you, wrapped around you
How does it feel?
To know I'm wrapped around you, wrapped around you
Oh you love you love you love
You love, you love, you love

La la la la, Oh babe
Can't calm down, stalker's round, yeah
La la la la
Can't make a sound, you force my love out
Scared in your arms
