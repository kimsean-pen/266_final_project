Death... bound in mystic
Is it the only thing real in this dream?
Hate... coven of sin
Call into question the crucifixion

Life in reverse, sanctify hurt
Only contempt for the cross and the church

Rage... hearts are besieged
Empty, alone in this world of disease
Betray, endings unseen
Angles from god won't be waiting on me

Never will bend, vestige of sin
Spit on religion again and again and again
Rain darkness revenge
Without a reason, your god wants me dead

All that is evil, and always at war
Annihilation, denial and scorn
All that is evil, inherit disdain
Blind to assumption, your faith is disgraced

All that is evil, and all I despise
Nothing for nothing the gospel of lies
All that is evil, the eye of the storm
Holy destruction the light of the... lord

Death... bound in mystic
Is it the only thing real in this dream?
Hate... coven of sin
Call into question the crucifixion

Life in reverse, sanctify hurt
Only contempt for the cross and the church
