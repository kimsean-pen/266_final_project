You ain't got no kind of feeling inside
I got something that'll sho nuff set yo' stuff on fire
You refuse to put anything before your pride
What I got will knock your pride aside

CHORUS:
Tell me something good
Tell me that you like it, yeah
Tell me something good
Tell that you love me, yeah

Got no time is what you're known to say
(Got no time, no, got no time)
I'll make you wish there was 48 hours to each day
Your problem is you ain't been loved like you should
What I got to give will sho nuff do you good
