This has nothing to do with the next song, which is called '39

C'mon, everybody!

In the year of '39
Assembled here the volunteers
In the days when lands were few
And the ship sailed out
Into the blue and misty morn'
Sweetest sight ever seen

And the night followed day
And the story tellers say
The score brave souls inside
For so many a lonely day
Sailed across the milky seas
Never looked back, never feared, never cried

Don't you hear my call?
Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

In the year of '39
Came a ship in from the blue
The volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news
From a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavenly weigh

Now the earth is old and grey
Little darling went away
But, my love, this cannot be
For so many years have gone
Now I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes, from your eyes, cry to me

Don't you hear my call?
Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

Everybody!
Don't you hear my call?
Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you?
All your letters in the sand
Cannot heal me like your hand
For my life, still ahead, pity me
Oo-ooh, alright!
