As the sun steps down
and escapes the day
we'll calmly walk away
walk away from the fray.

When the structure falls
and all else fails
we will build it once again.

When the colors fade
and it turns to gray
we'll calmly walk away
walk away from the fray

When structure falls
and all else fails
we will build it once again

We can climb high
higher than before.
We can stand by
while it burns to the floor.
Though we cannot fly
we will build and the wounds will mend
as we build it once again!

We can climb high
higher than before.
We can stand by
while it burns to the floor.
We cannot fly
we will build and the wounds will mend
