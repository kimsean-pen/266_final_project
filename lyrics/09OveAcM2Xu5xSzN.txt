Come on, come on
You think you drive me crazy, well
Come on, come on
You and whose army?
You and your cronies

Come on, come on
Holy Roman Empire
Come on if you think
Come on if you think
You can take us all

You can take us all

You and whose army?

You and your cronies
You forget so easily

We ride tonight
We ride tonight
Ghost horses
Ghost horses
We ride tonight
We ride tonight
Ghost horses
Ghost horses
Ghost horses
