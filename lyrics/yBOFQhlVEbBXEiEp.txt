Are we really happy here with this lonely game we play?
Looking for words... to say...
Searching but not finding understanding anyway
We're lost in a mask masquerade
Both afraid to say we're just too far away
From being close together from the start...
We tried to talk it over but the words got in the way
We're lost inside this lonely game we play
Thoughts of weeping disappear every time I see your eyes
No matter how hard I try... ooh... ooh...
To understand the reasons that we carry on this way
We're lost in a mask masquerade
We're both afraid to say we're just too far away mmm...
From being close together from the start...
We tried to talk it over but the words got in the way
We're lost insidethis lonely game we play
Thoughts of weeping disappear every time I see your face
No matter how hard I... try... mmm...
To understand the reasons why we carry on this way
We're lost in a masquerade
Whoa in a masquerade mmm...
