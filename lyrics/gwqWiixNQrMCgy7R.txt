I got the letter back
Saying I can come and see you
I really don't have time
But promise that I'd come and see you
You're sitting far away
But do you know I sometimes need you
I know that you deserve the time you got of all the people
I know you never bend
Even in the strongest wind
I really wish to every God that you were innocent
I'm happy and I'm proud
That I can still call you my friend
I hope you read the letters and the magazines I've sent

You've got your head up
But I don't have my hopes high
I know that you are a good man
And that's what brings the tear to my eye

I'm like
Ohhhh
I hope you know you're not alone in that hell
And there ain't
No, no one can change it
No one can do it better but yourself

I was sixteen and we used to roll together
You told me back then
That I was meant for something better
You know in our life nothing is going to change but the weather
It seems it's been forever since we really stuck together
I'm living a crazy life and wish that you could see it too
See a thousand people sing my song from me to you
Every time I sing it
You know I'm bleeding too
Man, I accept you as you are, no I don't need the truth

I got my head up
But I ain't got my hopes high
See, I know you're a good man
And it, it brings a tear to my eye

And I'm like
Ooooh
I hope you know you're not alone in that hell
And there ain't
No, no one can change it
No one can do it better but yourself

I reminisce to back then when it was you and I
Smoking big fat blunts drive-in movie night
They tried to get you down
But you refused to die
They tried to give to angel wings
But you refused to fly
You'd rather stay in hell
And take your time in jail
They're only punishing a soul that you will never sell
We both know that we owe nothing to each other
But can you blame me for loving and missing my brother?

Ooooh
I hope you know you're not alone in that hell
And there ain't
No, no one can change it
No one can do it better but yourself

Ohhh
I hope you know you're not alone in that hell
And there ain't
No, no one can change it
No one can do it better but yourself
