I feel smothered and encumbered and defeated and drawn
Disappointed, overextended and frustrated and shaken
This over-giving, over-loving
This care-taking goes on
With no chance of intermission,
I'll be checked out, I'll be gone

How to remove myself from sensation?

Here comes a feeling
I run from the feeling and reach for the drug
Can't sit with this feeling
I'd rather be flying and comfortably numb

I feel anxious, I am nervous, I am bored
I'm overwhelmed; rather be out of my gourd

How to remove myself from sensation?

Here comes a feeling
I run from the feeling and reach for the drug
Can't sit with this feeling;
I'd rather be flying and comfortably numb

I am lonely, I feel hungry and unloved
I feel angry, I am livid, need a hug

Here comes a feeling
I run from the feeling and reach for the drug
Can't sit with this feeling
I'd rather be flying and comfortably numb
