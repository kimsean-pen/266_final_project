Through scapes of murmur
Noisy walls of sound
Without a starlit night
Shores are nowhere to be found
On seas of wonder
Ye confused strays
Without a guiding light
You see no ways

Into the eyes of fire
Into the gaze ablaze
Into the burning light
Of Satan's rays
Into the source of wisdom
Beyond the Bible lies
Into the endless depth
Of Satan's eyes

Spiral and Pulsating
His eyes are enthralling
His eyes like a vortex
A well in which you're falling

The swamp of feces
That is the world
Flatuates a whirlwind storm
in which you swirl

In disarray you ponder
Your soul malaise
Abandon the long lost man
Your child portrays

Into the eyes of fire
Into the gaze ablaze
Into the burning light
Of Satan's rays
Into the source of wisdom
Beyond the Bible lies
Into the endless depth
Of Satan's eyes

Into the eyes of fire
Into the gaze ablaze
Into the burning light
Of Satan's rays
Into the source of wisdom
Beyond the Bible lies
Look into the endless depth
Of Satan's eyes
