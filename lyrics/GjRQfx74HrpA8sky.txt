Cold is the night without you here
Just your absence ringing in my ears
Hard is the heart that feels no fear
Without the bad, the good disappears

Long is the road that leads me home
And longer still when I walk alone
Bitter is the thought of all that time
Spent searching for something I'll never find

Take this burden away from me
And bury it before it buries me

Many are the days I've wanted to cease
Lay myself down and find some relief
Heavy is the head that gets no sleep
We carry our lives around in our memories

Take away this apathy
And bury it before it buries me

Steady is the hand that's come to terms
With the lessons it has had to learn
I've seen the things that I must do
But Lord, this road is meant for two
So I am waiting here for you

Take my hand and set me free
Take my burdens and bury them deep
Take this burden away from me
And bury it before
Bury it before
Bury it before it buries me
