Everyday takes figuring out how to live
...
Sometimes it feels like a mistake
Sometimes its a winners parade
...

Delight and angers
I guess thats the way its supposed to be...'
...
Please heal me, I cant sleep

...
Thought I was unbreakable, but this is killing me
...
Call me, everything

Make me fell unbreakable, now you set me free
...
I feel the fear takes hold
Affraid this hell I create is my own

...
Come my fatigueness, I cant take it anymore
...
This used to be my own world, but now I've lost control

...
Please heal me, I cant sleep
...
Thought I was unbreakable, but this is killing me
...
Call me, everything
Make me fell unbreakable, now you set me free
...
Chasing leftovers
...
Under the fading sun
Searching for shelter
I feel my time has come
...
Please heal me, I cant sleep
Thought I was unbreakable, but this is killing me
...
Call me, everything
Make me fell unbreakable, now you set me free
...
