I feel the hope running low
we never found our way home
There is no more world
The land is gone
water is all that survived that one

There are no escapes, no escapes, no escapes
gone are the days of mistakes
our mistakes

And did you see
the night wore on
and became the days that never begun
The disappearing day
You know where I'm from
Is the only place that forever stays young

Lost at sea
we're lost at sea
I wouldn't know my face if you all were me
All we have is all we see
There is no more hope
There are no dreams
