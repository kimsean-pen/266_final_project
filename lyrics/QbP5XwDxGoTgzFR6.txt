Shores retreat in disarray
melting glaciers lead the demise
And connect the rapidly rising tide
A ramming fluid out of firm ice

A wall of waves and an abyss of water
Drench the land, coastal erosion
Submerged by the increasing sea levels slaughter
It stirs our inner ocean

Shores retreat in disarray
Melting glaciers lead the demise
A wall of waves and an abyss of water
Drench the land, coastal erosion

When chaos calls
A drowning of the skyline
A world ruled by horizontal waterfalls
They flood out of pandemonium's shrine

We're buried by persistent snowfall
It levels out topography

When chaos calls
A drowning of the skyline
A world ruled by horizontal waterfalls

No more hinderance for the storm to call
Out, to destruction and catastrophe

Periodic freezing unsettles
Building a kingdom of frost
Chaos dressed in a calm pettle
Set to efface and exhaust

Submerged by the increasing sea levels slaughter
It stirs our inner ocean

When chaos calls
A drowning of the skyline
A world ruled by horizontal waterfalls
When chaos calls
A rift in earth's core
A world ruled by horizontal waterfalls

They flood out of pandemonium's shrine
