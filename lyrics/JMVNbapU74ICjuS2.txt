(You live in a lie)
(You live in a lie)

Welcome to the freaky carnival
We have clowns and tigers
And a hungry cannibal
Jugglers, conjurers
Little ugly women
Smart little monkeys
They'll steal your heart and wallets
Dwarves from fairy tales
Fast like hurricanes
It's hot and spicy here
Don't believe what you see

Welcome
This place is magic
Welcome
The truth is tragic
Everything is shiny here
Everything is perfect here

You are wondering
What is happening
You want it all
To disappear
It's not a dream
Everything is real
Your filthy life
Belongs here

Big fearless lions
Jumping through biting fire
Topless dancers
Will teach you a lesson
Explosions, colors, fireworks
Relax, enjoy, you're on the hook
You're on the hook.

Welcome
This place is magic
Welcome
The truth is tragic
Everything is shiny here
Everything is perfect here

(You live in a lie)
(You live in a lie)
(You live in a lie)
(You live in a lie)

Filthy! Intoxicated minds
With cash and whiskey
You are begging for lies
You are begging for lies
You are begging for lies
...for lies
...for lies
You are begging...

(You live in a lie)
(You live in a lie)
(You live in a lie)
(You live in a lie)

Here magicians cut ladies to pieces
Dancing with death
Dancing with death
Dancing with death
Making rabbits appear from nowhere
Playing with flames
Playing with flames
Playing with flames

Welcome
This place is magic
Welcome
The truth is tragic
Everything is shiny here
Everything is perfect here
