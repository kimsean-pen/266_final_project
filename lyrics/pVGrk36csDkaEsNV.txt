Howl in the sky
It seems quite absurd
How we too believe that
There's a river in a corridor
It's aching for more
A seamless thapeze
It's all in your mind
And in other words
It's deeper than me cause
There's a river in a corridor
Howl in the sky
Right from the birth
How we too belive that
There's a fire in a corridor
It's aching to burn of simplicity
And the tree tops run in my blood
In the deep night under my stars
After he stops
Is there more war
And I zoned out
Saw a black wall
And at high reach
Humans don't fly
And you're so proud like a soap opera
You can not have my hideout
You can not have my hideout
It's all in your mind
And in other words
It's deeper than me cause
There's a river in a corridor
And it's all in the skies
The meaning's absurd
But then so are we and
There's a river in a corridor
It's waiting to flow of simplicity and
There's a fire in a corridor
And the tree tops run in my blood
In the deep night under my stars
After he stops
Is there more war
And I zoned out
Saw a black wall
And at high reach
Humans don't fly
And you're so proud like a soap opera
You can not have my hideout
You can not have my hideout
