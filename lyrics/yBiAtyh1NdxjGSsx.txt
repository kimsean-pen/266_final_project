they love to love / you love to love you when you're up
they never touch / you never touch your blood and guts

in neverland you're never free
you see what you want to see
I've been watching the swelling grow
I've always known...

when this is over
I'll need a surgery
'cause you were a TUMOR
you'll leave a hole inside of me
it's high risk
not hopeless
I'm conscious
when this is over
when this is over
I'll still be letting it grow

wish I could say / wish I could say I didn't know
I had the vision / had the feeling all along

still I followed, I took your lead
swallowed the toxic, magic weeds
I've been watching the swelling grow
I've always known...

when this is over
I'll need a surgery
'cause you were a TUMOR
you'll leave a hole inside of me
it's high risk
not hopeless
I'm conscious
when this is over
when this is over
I'll still be letting it grow

I'll still be letting it grow
I'll still be letting it grow

I'll still be letting it grow
