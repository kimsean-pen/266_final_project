Candle in night
There's a candlelight baby, ohh

Lonely in bed at night
And it never feels alright
I toss and turn, each night
Till the morning light

Just the thought of you
Sends chills up and down my spine
Just knowing you'll be here real soon
Makes everything alright

Candlelight, it makes it special
Me and you on a rare occasion
Candlelight, a special night
Seeing you is a sweet sensation

Memories of you, your arm baby
Squeezing me close to your heart
But shadows in the dark, baby
Of you kissin' ever part

And knowing we can share it all
And still be, still every
For each and every magic moment
Will last for eternity

Candlelight, it makes it special
Me and you on a rare occasion
Candlelight, a special night
Seeing you is a sweet sensation

Candlelight, it makes it special
Me and you on a rare occasion
Candlelight, a special night
Seeing you is a sweet sensation

My love for you will never fade away
I'll save a special spot for you baby, always
Don't you know my heart
Has made for you, special place?
Ohh, don't you know, don't you know, don't you know baby?
You call on me
When you want me
When you need me
I'm here for you

Candlelight, it makes it special
Me and you on a rare occasion
Candlelight, a special night
Seeing you is a sweet sensation

Candlelight, it makes it special
Me and you on a rare occasion
Candlelight, a special night
Seeing you is a sweet sensation

Candlelight, it makes it special
Me and you on a rare occasion
Candlelight a special night
Seeing you is a sweet sensation

Candlelight, it makes it special
