I'm smiling but I'm burning inside
I'm loosing my mi-ind
This Drama is filling my head
I'm screaming for something that I've never had

Keep your head up
Keep your heart strong
Like you've never been hurt
Keep your head up
Keep your heart strong
You make your own luck

Keep your head up
Keep your heart strong
Like you've never been hurt
Keep your head up
Keep your heart strong
You make you own luck

Drama will fill my head
I'm loosing the light
That I've never had
I've ben strong for too long
Nana nana na nana nan na

Drama will fill my head
I'm loosing the light
That I've never had
I've been strong for too long
Eheh eh eh

Running away from the rain
I've lost myself again
I hear a voice
I hear a voice inside
I hear a voice
Singing

Keep your head up
Keep your heart strong
Like you've never been hurt
Keep your head up
Keep your heart strong
You make your own luck

Keep your head up
Keep your heart strong
Like you've never been hurt
Keep your head up
Keep your heart strong
You make you own luck

Drama will fill my head
I'm loosing the light
That I've never had
I've been strong for too long
Nana nana na nana nan na

Drama will fill my head
I'm loosing the light
That I've never had
I've been strong for too long
(for too long)

I'm feeling so small (so small)
Or am I falling for your dirty mind?
I'm feeling so small
But I won't falling for your dirty mind?
