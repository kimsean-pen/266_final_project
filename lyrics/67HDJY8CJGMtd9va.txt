two in the dark
a competent heart
come and live with me
Just out of reach
the tape would repeat
Asked to find the flame,
could barely glow
Between Leos
on your own
Between Leos
you won't
You just say the words
I'll hop into the car and go
though we hardly spoke a word
setting off alarms
terrors of the afternoon
made you feel the fool
full of the old Adam
I expect the worst from you
made you feel I disapproved
Between Leos
on your own
Between Leos
you won't
you just say the word
I'll get into the car and go
come meet me halfway
come meet me halfway
half the way is easy
