The blade I swing is black as night
Black as my soulless heart
It bears the burden of many lives
But I don't feel remorse

I lent my sword to anyone
Willing to pay the price
No regrets for what I've done
A mercenary's life

But there I was on Battleground
Until I felt the jaws of death
Cut into my flesh
Defending old and weak
But I did not retreat

Now, here I lie in my own blood
And strangers cry for me
I'm prepared to meet the gods
I wished they'd let me be

I don't deserve their sympathy
I know who I am
My soul is death and misery
I am an evil man

I rest in my blood
Soon I will face the gods
Strangers cry for me
I wish they'd let me be

Show no sympathy
Shed no tears for me
I know who I am
I am an evil man
I know who I am
I am an evil man
