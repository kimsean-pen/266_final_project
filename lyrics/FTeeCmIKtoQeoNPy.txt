It's a good day,
Good cup of coffee to drink,
It's a good day,
No dishes piled up in the sink,
I'm a long way from the place I used to be,
It's a good day

Oh, tear drops are gone,
Oh, then I hear that song.

It takes me to me and you,
Black and white movie,
I made you watch then we kissed,
Oh I knew I was falling for you and I,
When it's on the radio,
That's when it hits me you're gone,
And baby to you it's probably just another song.

But for me it's a bullet out of a gun,
Yeah to me it's a knife and a damn rusty one,
It's a floodgate of memories I don't want to feel,
Oh it's all just a little too real.

Oh, just when the tear drops are gone,
Oh, why do I hear that heartbreak and take me back song.

It takes me to me and you 45 spinnin',
I made you dance then we kissed,
Oh I knew I was falling for you and I,
When it's on the radio,
That's when it hits me you're gone,
Baby to you it's probably just another song,
Baby to you it's probably just another song,
Baby to you.

It takes me to me and you under the street light,
You said goodbye then we kissed,
Oh I knew I was fallin' into pieces,
Oh when it's on the radio,
That's when it hits me you're gone,
Baby to you it's probably just another song,
Baby to you, it's probably just another song,
Baby to you, it's just a good day.
