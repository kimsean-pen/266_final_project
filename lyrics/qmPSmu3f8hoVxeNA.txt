I got no money in my hand or my coat or my pocket
Won't get to space 'cause I haven't got a rocket
But I have air in my lungs, eyes in my sockets
And a heart that beats like a tap that leaks
In the night when you haven't got a plumber who can stop it
Jack in a box without a key to lock it
Well this boat may sink but I'm not gonna rock it
'Cause the sea doesn't know my name
Yeah the boat may sink but I'm not gonna rock it
'Cause the sea doesn't know my name
Well if you can't get what you love
You learn to love the things you've got

If you can't be what you want
You learn to be the things you're not
If you can't get what you need
You learn to need the things that stop you dreaming
Oh the things that stop you dreaming
Well I got no one's word and nobody's promise

Not a lot to show, but this book full of sonnets

And my liver may be fcked but my heart is honest
And my word is true like the sky is blue
In the summer time when everyone gets on it
Warm my skin till I get sun burnt from it
And her eyes shine bright like a sky full of comets
That shoot like silver trains
Yeah her eyes shine bright like a sky full of comets

That shoot like silver trains
Well if you can't get what you love

You learn to love the things you've got
If you can't be what you want
You learn to be the things you're not
If you can't get what you need

You learn to need the things that stop you dreaming
Oh oh the things that stop you dreaming
Oh oh oh oh no

And oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh no
Well if you can't get what you love
You learn to love the things you've got
If you can't be what you want
You learn to be the things you're not
If you can't get what you need
You learn to need the things that stop you dreaming
Oh oh oh the things that stop you dreaming
Oh the things that stop you dreaming
