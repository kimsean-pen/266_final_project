The cold comes with a sting, a sting across my hands
Cracking and breaking like the weight upon my chest
It took me years to figure out it's what I needed
Needed to survive

What I need to survive
My resolve will be revived

I discovered the cure for my misery
By spending time with the unforgiving
Something so much more
Graceful than anything, anything living
Alone with the wind is where I hide,
As I find my place among the stars
This moment makes me feel alive
It's what I need to survive

Time stands still as my thoughts stop swimming
Time stands still as my thoughts stop swimming

My muscles may ache, my tendons may break
But tearing myself down to nothing
Has allowed me to become something
More than this, something greater
This is where I may seem lost,
But I promise you I'm more awake than ever
I'm facing up towards the never ending expanse
And finding my place among the stars

Alone with the wind is where I hide
As I find my place among the stars
This moment makes me feel alive
It's what I need to survive

Open soul, open mind
I'm finally focused on what's inside
I've gained a new perspective
I've gained a new perspective
Open soul, open mind
I'm finally focused on what's inside
I've gained a new perspective
