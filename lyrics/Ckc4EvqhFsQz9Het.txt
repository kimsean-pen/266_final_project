Weigh anchor, hoist the sails
Cruisin' for booty on watery trails
No exploiter we see can still sail on
Our cannons fire till his ship goes down

Fly our flag, we teach them fear
Capture them, the end is near
Firing guns, they shall burn
Surrender or fight, there's no return

Under Jolly Roger
Under Jolly Roger

Venerable scoundrels, no blood on our hands
Our engagement are tough but only for defense
Carefully we sail around the reefs
To force those die-hards to their knees

Fly our flag, we teach them fear
Capture them, the end is near
Firing guns, they shall burn
Surrender or fight, there's no return

Under Jolly Roger
Under Jolly Roger

Come on

Coming through the waves to free all the captives
Boarding the vessels, we know all the tactics
We're the menace, the curse of the sea
We pulverize the men o' war pay or flee

Fly our flag, we teach them fear
Capture them, the end is near
Firing guns, they shall burn
Surrender or fight, there's no return

Under Jolly Roger
Under Jolly Roger
Under Jolly Roger
Under Jolly Roger

Pay or flee
Ready for party
