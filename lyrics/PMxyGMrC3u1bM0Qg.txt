Baby, first of all let me say
You can't accuse me of all the things
You know that you are guilty of
And I see that it is easy for you to blame everything on me

If that's the case I should go have my fun
And do all the things you say I do
Boy, I can't continue to take this from you

I might as well have cheated on you
As much as you accused me of cheating
I might as well have lied to you
As much as you accused me of lying

I might as well have gone to the club
As much as you accused me of clubbin'
I might as well have given away my love
As much as you accused me, I should have cheated

When you say I was out with somebody else
When my girl told me she saw you with some girl
But I didn't accuse you of something that I didn't see myself
Realize that I would never do anything to disrespect you
Trust me, you gotta stop accusing me

I might as well have cheated on you
As much as you accused me of cheating
I might as well have lied to you
As much as you accused me of lying

I might as well have gone to the club
As much as you accused me of clubbin'
I might as well have given away my love
As much as you accused me

Don't you know I wish I knew
That you would treat me this way
If you don't promise me
That you've changed your ways I'm leaving today

And I ain't coming back and you made it like that
Was unfair to me, all this jealousy
I'm your everything, what will you do without me?
Why you trippin'?

I might as well have cheated on you
As much as you accused me of cheating
I might as well have lied to you
As much as you accused me of lying

I might as well have gone to the club
As much as you accused me of clubbin'
I might as well have given away my love
As much as you accused me, I should have cheated

I should have lied, I should have cheated
Maybe I should have went out to the club
Or maybe I, I should have done it
Should have given away all my love

Or maybe I, I should have played you
'Cause you don't appreciate me, no
And I tried to stay down with you
But you're making it hard for me

I might as well have cheated on you
As much as you accused me of cheating
I might as well have lied to you
As much as you accused me of lying

I might as well have gone to the club
As much as you accused me of clubbin'
I might as well have given away my love
As much as you accused me, I should have cheated

As much as you accused me of cheatin', I should have cheated
As much as you accused me of lying
As much as you accused me of clubbin'
As much as you accused me of cheatin', I should have cheated

I should have cheated
I should have cheated
I should have cheated
