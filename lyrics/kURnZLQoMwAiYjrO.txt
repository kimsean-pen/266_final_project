I wanna stay all day, all night
Tangled up in your sheets
And I'm not coming up for air
Not coming up for air
Through the curtains, the sun will rise
Feel the weight on my skin
And I'm not coming up for air
Not coming up for air

Your heart beats like a stampede, racing
Feel it on my chest like shotguns blazing
Oh, oh-oh
Makes me go, "Woah, oh-oh"
'Cause this beat, beat of your heart
Makes me go weak, makes me come apart
Like, oh, oh-oh
Got me going, "Oh"

I'm not coming up for air
Not coming up for air
Not coming up for air
Not coming up for air
'Cause all I need's right here

Like a movie in black and white
I see myself in a different light
Not coming up for air
Not coming up for air, no
Keep getting lost in those eyes
So close to your lips
No, I'm not coming up for air
Not coming up for air

Your heart beats like a stampede, racing
Feel it on my chest like shotguns blazing
Oh, oh-oh
Make me go, "Woah, oh-oh"
'Cause this beat, beat of your heart
Is all I need to breathe, to make mine start
Like, oh, oh-oh
Got me going, "Oh"

I'm not coming up for air
Not coming up for air
Not coming up for air
Not coming up for air
'Cause all I need's right here

And if this day should ever end
I'll be coming back again
I'll be coming back again, yeah
Here in your arms is where I belong
I'm taking my last breath, I'm diving in
And I'm not coming up for air
No-oh, oh-oh-oh
No, no, no, no

I'm not coming up for air
Not coming up for air (All I need's right here)
Not coming up for air
Not coming up for air
'Cause all I need's right here

I wanna stay all day, all night
Tangled up in your sheets
And I'm not coming up for air
Not coming up for air
