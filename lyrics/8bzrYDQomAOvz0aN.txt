I'm a woman
Lord knows it's hard
I need a real man
to give me what I need

Sweet attention
Love and tenderness
When it's real it's unconditional
I'm tellin Y'all

Cause a man just ain't a man
If he ain't man enough
To love you when you're right
Love you when You're wrong
Love you when you're weak
Love you when you're strong
take you higher
When the world's got you feelin low
He's givin you his last
cause he's thinkin of you first
Givin comfort when he's thinkin that you're hurt
That's what done when you really love someone
I'm tellin y'all

Cause You're a real man
And lord knows it's hard
Sometimes you just need
A woman's touch

Sweet affection
Love and support
When it's real it's unconditonal
I'm tellin y'all

Cause a woman ain't a woman
If she ain't woman enough
To love you when you're right
Love you when You're wrong
Love you when you're weak
Love you when you're strong
take you higher
When the world's got you feelin low
She givin you her best
Even when you're at your worst
givin comfort when she's thinkin that you're hurt
That's what's done when you really love someone
I'm tellin y'all

Sometimes you wanna argue
Sometimes you wanna fight
Sometimes it's gonna feel like it'll never be right
But something so strong keeps you holding on
It's don't make sense but it makes a good song

Cause a man just ain't a man
If he ain't man enough
To love you when you're right
Love you when You're wrong
Love you when you're weak
Love you when you're strong
take you higher
When the world's got you feelin low
He's givin you his last
cause he's thinkin of you first
Givin comfort when he's thinkin that you're hurt
That's what's done when you really love someone
I'm tellin y'all

I'm tellin y'all that a woman ain't a woman
If she ain't woman enough
To love you when you're right
Love you when You're wrong
Love you when you're weak
Love you when you're strong
take you higher (and Higher)
When the world's got you feelin low
She givin you her best
Even when you're at your worst
givin comfort when she's thinkin that you're hurt
That's what's done when you really love someone
I'm tellin y'all
I'm tellin y'all
