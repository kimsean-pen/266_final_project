When the world is darker than I can understand
When nothing turns out the way I planned
When the sky turns grey and there's no end in sight
When I can't sleep through the lonely night

I turn to you
Like a flower leaning toward the sun
I turn to you
Cause your the only one

Who can turn me around
When I'm upside down
I turn to you
When my insides are racked with anxiety

You have the touch that will quiet me
You lift my spirit, you melt the ice
When I need inspiration when I need advice
I turn to you

Like a flower leaning toward the sun
I turn to you
Cause your the only one
Who can turn me around

When I am upside down
I turn to you
Where would I be
What would I do

If you never helped me through
I hope some day if you've lost your way
You can turn to me, like I turn to you
I turn to you

Like a flower leaning toward the sun
I turn to you
Cause your the only one
Who can turn me around
When I'm upside down
I turn to you
I turn to you
When fear tells me to turn around
I turn to you
Cause your the only one
Who can turn me around
When I'm upside down
I turn to you
I turn to you
I turn to you
you...
you.
you.
you
you
you
you
you
you
you
you
