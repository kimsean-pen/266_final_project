My hate was born in the club that's why I'm leaving.
This place is more than a lie, you should believe me.
I am not happy here. You're not grown men, you're just kids playing.

So many things that you say I don't agree with.
You're living hypocrisy. I can't compete with.
You don't look happy here. You're not grown ups you're just kids playing.

If I lose my friends I hope that I'm told. I hope that someone tells me

So many things we don't say, so many things we should say.
So many things we don't say, so many things we should say.

All the things we never say. They'll never let you.
So many things we don't say, so many things we should say.
You're telling more than a lie I don't believe you.
So many things we don't say, so many things we should say.
All the things we never say. They'll never let you.
So many things we don't say, so many things we should say.
You're telling more than a lie I don't believe you.
So many things we don't say, so many things we should say.

If I lose my friends, I hope I'm told, I hope that someone tells me.
If I lose my friends, I hope I'm told, I hope that someone tells me.
If I lose my friends, I hope I'm told, I hope that someone tells me.
If I lose my friends, I hope I'm told, I hope that someone tells me.
