Uh, this one's dedicated to all the haters out there
Jealous of us because we're better than you
Yo-landi Vi$$er, bring the spice

Jou ma se poes in a fish paste jar

Yo-landi Vi$$er, fre$ in da fle$, vat n picture

He was the wrong ninja to fuck wif

Yo, I am the ninja in charge over here
Wat?
No fear when I skop a rhyme in your ear
Fuck
Wif the wrong ninja this time, what's the matter you
Should've known better to fuck wif a ninja wif a attitude?

I wasn't mad at you but now you mad at me and jealous
Little stink poofy rappers like Anthony and Dennis
Lemme help to make you famous, Jassis, but you rap kak
When you rap, you actually sound like you having a fat kak

Yo
Sis
Why you so obsessed with me?
Oh, oh

Jesus Christ, you should see how these boys stalk me
Follow my every move like a sea-point moffie
Fuck you and all your arb lyrics
Ek maak klaar met n spif quote from the liks

Yo, there's not a rapper out there who can touch me
If you don't believe me, run up and try to punch me

Jou ma se poes in a fish paste jar
Jou ma se poes in a fish paste jar
Oh, oh, vat's it yuketa

Do what I like 'cause I roll with the fucken Ninja

I hang with fucking coloreds 'cause I am a fucking colored
If I wannabe a colored
Ho$h
My inner color just wants to be discovered
Jou fokken naai skinner aan
Elke fokken poes is pienk aan die binnekant

Z to the E to the motherfuckin' F
One time, lekker fokken zef zef zef
Fuck this poes in the skinny jeans
Joh maar jy's trendy
Swak
Soos n fokken kak jol by assembly

Why do I call myself a ninja, you ask me?
Because my style is so motherfuckin' nasty
Is ja
Nothing you can say or do can harm me
Ek's kak fokken common, jy's n flou fokken laanie

Fuck with Die Antwoord, you fuck with our army
Our fans are mal bergie
When they bite they don't let go
Like skraal staffies, ask kyle saffy

Kyle's mamma is a big fat bitch

Jou ma se poes in a fish paste jar

Do what I like 'cause I roll with the fucken Ninja

Yo, I'm the ninja in charge
I can't even fucking believe my dick is so large
Make room
It's doom when we launch a full frontal assault with a boom
Yo-landi Vi$$er rub the fuckin' salt in the wound

My style is wild, make you warp your faces
Got style coming outta all sorts of places
Raak wys
Ninja flex fre$
Ek's original boy, fuck sweat X

Huh, wie die fok is dit?

Spoek matahmbo is a spank rock look-a-like
Rap-a-like, sif little parasite gag
Fuck every single one of your wack tracks
Markus worm storm is short and fat

I represent the underdog, you know my steez
I'm represented by a label in the overseas
Yo
Den-de-den, yes, I am the man
Got the cash in hand and I'm splashing Rands

Pounds, Dollars, Yen, Euros
I use to be a zero
Now I rap to the track like a super fuckin' hero
Super Ninja's coming faster than a bullet
Leaping over buildings, waving at the children

Jou ma se poes in a fish paste jar

'Cause I'mma be a ninja for life
Yo, I'm a ninja, he's a ninja, she's a ninja, we some ninjas
Wouldn't you like to be a ninja too?
