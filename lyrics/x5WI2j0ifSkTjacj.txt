We started like children
Lost in the building by the wall
Hope lost to fear
And nothing was clear when lost it all

This is how, how we tried
This is where, where it died
This is how, how we cried
Like the dogs left outside

We were so cautious
Guarding the locksets viciously
I'm never breathing
Tender like ribbons obviously

This is how, how we tried
This is where, where it died
This is how, how we cried
Like the dogs left outside

I am too shy to cry
You gave her one kind to provoke
Even with balance
Losing the hope with you again

This is how, how we tried
This is where, where it died
This is how, how we cried
Like the dogs left outside

His words are like sharp knives
Reading on my rights every time
Crying to our son
I was just so wrong every time

This is how, how we tried
This is where, where it died
This is how, how we cried
Like the dogs left outside
