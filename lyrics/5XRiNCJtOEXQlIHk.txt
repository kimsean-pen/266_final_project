Everything around me seems much different from where I'm from
And at this rate I think my faith's been sealed this life, so unpredictable
Well go cause if you live a life that no one knows where shes gonna go

Right here right now, this ends, gonna give it up in the end
And I won't say one single thing till we get this right
I'm moving on
I'm moving on

Hey mom I wrote you some soft songs, and tell dad I'm just fine
We have to choose we made our moves, now we gotta go, gooooo

Everything about me seems much different when I was young
I couldn't wait to take my place 5 years to pass
So why, I've never felt so alone in my whole life, times not on my side

Right here right now, this ends, gonna give it up in the end
And I won't say one single thing till we get this right
I'm moving on
I'm moving on

Hey mom I wrote you some soft songs, and tell dad I'm just fine
We have to choose we made our moves, now we gotta go, gooooo

And why's this make me so nervous
Why does everything go so wrong
Why's this make me so nervous
Why does everything go wrong

I'm holding onto a fairytale
We're moving forward but we're not there yet
I'm holding onto a fairytale
We're moving forward, we're moving forward

I'm holding onto a fairytale
We're moving forward but we're not there yet
I'm holding onto a fairytale
We're moving forward, we're moving forward
Hey mom I wrote you some soft songs, and tell dad I'm just fine
We have to choose we made our moves, now we gotta go, gooooo
Why's this make me so nervous
You make me so, you make me so
Why does everything go wrong
Why's this make me so nervous
You make me so, you make me so
Why does everything go wrong
