Turn around and meet me face to face
I feel you everywhere
And I can almost taste
The rhythm of your heart
The salt of your embrace
If you come back to me
Then I will live again

I still feel your magic move my soul
Give you control
You bring me home
The way my body moves like you
So smooth so criminal

And I want it all
Cuz when my feet start dancing off the wall
I'm not alone

Yours forever more
The Phantom of the dance floor

Close my eyes and I remember you
Wish you would move in me
The way you used to do
I cannot dance alone
And no one else will do
If you come back to me
I will return to you

I still feel your magic move my soul
Give you control
You bring me home
The way my body moves like this
So smooth so criminal

And I want it all
Cuz when my feet start dancing off the wall
I'm not alone

Yours forever more
The Phantom of the dance floor

Deep inside your mind you'll feel me
Caressing your soul
A memory of the faintest light
Can bend the walls of time

Here inside my arms
I hold you
Safe with me no fear can touch you
Look beneath the surface I've been there all along

The phantom of the dance floor
