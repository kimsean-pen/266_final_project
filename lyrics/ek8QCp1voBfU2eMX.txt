We run, faces to the wind
It'll get easier
When you breathe it in
Fall, gently give in
Swallow in the air
And rain on skin

Hurts will come undone
All that will become
Rise and fall behind
Weightless in rewind

I feel the shifting of you getting closer
My eyes wide open underneath the sun
Follow the feeling, but patiently waiting
I lose my feelings to oblivion

Days
I feel it
Days
I feel it

Quietly I keep you close to me
Quietly I feel you when I'm dreaming
Quietly I keep you close to me
Quietly I feel you when I'm dreaming
Quietly I keep you close to me
Quietly I feel you when I'm dreaming
Quietly I keep you close to me

Quietly I feel you when I'm dreaming
Follow the feeling, but patiently waiting
I loose my feelings to oblivion
The days to come
Feel it
the days
I feel it
Quietly I keep you close to me
Quietly I feel you when I'm dreaming
Quietly I keep you close to me
Quietly I feel you when I'm dreaming
Follow the feeling, but patiently waiting
I lose my feelings to oblivion.
