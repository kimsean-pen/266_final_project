Dusty and you are, dirty from chain
Lips of your kisses are sticking like tape
Woke you at sunrise, cold as a grave
I'll cut you some flowers, now don't be afraid
Now don't be afraid

I'm looking for something
To sink in my teeth without any crying
But I can't find no place or nothing
Where thrills are cheap and love is divine

Home by the river, tall grass and fields
Pond of willow oak, well for to kneel
Dusty o dusty, decision night, don't be so pretty
All laced up in white, all laced up in white

I'm looking for something
To sink in my teeth without any crying
But I can't find no place or nothing
Where thrills are cheap and love is divine

I'm looking for something
To sink in my teeth without any crying
But I can't find no place or nothing
Where thrills are cheap and love is divine

I'm looking for something
To sink in my teeth without any crying
But I can't find no place or nothing
Where thrills are cheap and love is divine

Where thrills are cheap, and love's divine
Where thrills are cheap, and love's divine
Where thrills are cheap, and love's divine
Where thrills are cheap, and love's divine
Where thrills are cheap, and love's divine
