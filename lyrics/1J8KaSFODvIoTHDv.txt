Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh
(When you're dead and gone)
Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh
(When you're dead and gone)

One year ago with a flower in hand
One year ago we wrote our names in the sand
The wind would blow your summer hair
(One year ago)

Once easy love, now you're making it rough
You know I try and say it's never enough
You left with ease and didn't care
(One year ago)

What used to seem like heaven
Feels like hell

I wanna breathe with ease again
I wanna get some fucking sleep again
You only ask forgiveness after it's gone wrong

I need to get upstate again
I need to get my head on straight again
You only get redemption when you're dead and gone
When you're dead and gone

Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh
(When you're dead and gone)
Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh

Ten years from now we'll be tired and old
Ten years from now we won't ever leave home
Singing "I'll be there for you"
(Ten years from now)

Give me the one and only reason that could make me believe
You were everything I want,
But not the thing that I need
It's hard to say, it's sad but true

What used to seem like heaven
Feels like hell

I wanna breathe with ease again
I wanna get some fucking sleep again
You only ask forgiveness after it's gone wrong

I need to get upstate again
I need to get my head on straight again
You only get redemption when you're dead and gone
When you're dead and gone

Nothing left here to say
Nothing to celebrate
Nothing left here to say
Nothing to celebrate

I wanna breathe with ease again
I wanna get some fucking sleep again
You only ask forgiveness after it's gone wrong

I need to get upstate again
I need to get my head on straight again
You only get redemption when you're dead and gone
You only get redemption when you're dead and gone
Oh

Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh
(When you're dead and gone)
Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh

When you're dead and gone
