I tried to fight the feeling, the feeling took me down
I struggle and I lost the day you knocked me out
Now everything's got meaning and meanings bring me down
I'm watching as the screening of my life plays out
Every day I fight these feelings
For your sake I will hide the real thing
You can run all your life; for mine, I will chase...
You should never fight your feelings
When your very bones believe them
You should never fight your feelings
But you have to follow nature's law
I'll live with never knowing, if knowing's gonna change
I'll stop the feeling growing, I will stay away
Like a broken record stuck before a song
A million beginnings, none of them the one
Every day I fight these feelings
For your sake I will hide the real thing
You can run all your life; for mine, I will chase...
You should never fight your feelings
When your very bones believe them
You should never fight your feelings
But you have to follow nature's law.
I wrote her letters and tried to send them
In a bottle I placed my hope
And it's the last will of good intentions
Seek your will, you'll give it to me
Don't make me wait
You build me up, now take down
But I will stand my ground
And I'm inspired when I'm found.
You should never fight your feelings
When your very bones believe them
If you let them show you'll keep them
I know you're hurt but soon you'll rise again
Again, again, again, again, again, again, again.
You should never fight your feelings
When your very bones believe them
You should never fight your feelings
I have to follow nature's law.
