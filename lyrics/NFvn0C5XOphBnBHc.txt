'Cause this music can put a human being in a trance like state and deprive it for the sneaking feeling
of existing. 'Cause music is bigger than words and wider than pictures. If someone said that Mogwai
are the stars I would not object. If the stars had a sound it would sound like this.The punishment
for these solemn words can be hard. Can blood boil like this at the sound of a noisy tape that
I've heard. I know one thing. On Saturday, the sky will crumble together (or something)
with a huge bang to fit into the cave.
