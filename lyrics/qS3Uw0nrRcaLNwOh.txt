I miss you more than you could know
I watch the grass on the backlawn grow
And I will not allow the winds of change to blow
And I hope you decide to come back home
Because this heavy heart, oh, how it's yearned
Because I have been alone far too long
When are you coming home, my love
My love
You reach out for me in the night
And an errant finger pokes me in the eye
And I'll your contact lenses on the bedside table
And I'm hoping you decide to come back home
Because this heavy heart, oh, how it's yearned
Because I've been alone far too long
When are you coming home, my love
My love
Oh, you when running with my heart
And it's a long, long, long way back
And this right here well it just ain't living
Oh, I want you to come back
Well I have been alone far too long
When are you coming home, my love
Well I have been alone far too long
When are you coming home, my love
My love
Well I have been alone far too long
When are you coming home, my love
Well I have been alone far too long
When are you coming home, my love
My Love
