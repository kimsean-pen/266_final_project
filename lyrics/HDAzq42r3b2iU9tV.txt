Hey I said you're godless and
It seems like you're a soulless friend
As spotless as you were back then
I swear that you are godless
Hey I guess you're lonely when
I gave you all it took so then
A stranger there is ever been
I guess, it's what you wanted

Of late, it seems lonely I would be
I begged, I plead
But this is all that I have gotten

Hey as for the day my friend
To hope that you could ever bend
I swear you are, I swear you are
I swear, that you are godless

Hey I said you're godless
Hey and you're a soulless friend
Hey I said you're heartless
And I swear, I swear
Godless
Godless
You're godless
