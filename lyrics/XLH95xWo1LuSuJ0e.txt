The winter wind
Is blowing so strong
My hands have got
No gloves

Wish to my sole
That I could have
The boy I'm dreaming of

Don't you remember me, babe
I remember you quite well
Caused me to leave
All of New York town
With a high sheriff on my tail

A high sheriff on my tail, boys,
High sheriff on my trail.

All because I've fallen for
A curly headed dark-eyed boy

Who's gonna stroke
Your coal black hair
And your sandy colored skin
Who's gonna walk you side by side
And tell you everything is alright

Who's gonna look
You straight in the eye
And hold your bad luck hand

Who's gonna walk you
Who's gonna talk to you
And who's gonna be your woman

The winter wind
Is blowing so strong
My hands have got
No gloves

Don't you remember me, babe
I remember you quite well
