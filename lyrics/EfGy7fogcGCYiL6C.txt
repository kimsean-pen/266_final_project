Wake up, wake up
Wake in the sound
To the rising sun
See a bright light
Shine on the lions
Morning red light
On the horizon

Stay up, stay up
If you wanna see
When the full moon comes
See a silver light
Shine on the island
See a silhouette
Off in the distance
Wake up, wake up
Bathe in the morning light
Safe in the warming light
Faith in the morning, alright

Time makes all things fall together
Time brings all things together, oh
Time makes all things fall together
Time brings all things together, oh

Wake up, wake up
Sleep till the sound
Of the nine 'o clock gun
Bright city lights in the reflection
Up all night till the morning comes
Stay up, stay up
Slip through the cracks
Of the morning rush
Find my faith in the place I love
Make my way to the place I love

Time makes all things fall together
Time brings all things together, oh
Time makes all things fall together
Time brings all things together, oh

Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up

Time makes all things fall together
Time brings all things together, oh
Time makes all things fall together
Time brings all things together, oh

Time makes all things
Fall together
Time brings all things together
Time makes all things fall
(Bathe in the morning light)
(Safe in the warming light)
)Faith in the morning)
Time brings all things together
(Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up)
Time makes all things fall
Time brings all things together
