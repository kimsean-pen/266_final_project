We are not invincible
Nor are we indestructible
There are choices - points of return
Will the path be easy?
Nothing is easy, but that's reality
For the sake of my loved ones
I will remain on this earth

It's the last chance to face the fears I have always known
Better that than to fear the unknown
How the years condemned
My heart to a plague of madness
How the years condemn, how the years condemn

How the years condemn
How the years condemn

I think back on a life of friendships
Now, more than ever I cherish them
Was it you that had my back,
My absent friend?
I have to take these challenges to head on
No more excuses or fragile promises
I hope now I finally understand,
My absent friend

It's the last chance to face the fears I have always known
Better that than to fear the unknown
How the years condemned
My heart to a plague of madness
How the years condemn, how the years condemn

How the years condemn
How the years condemn
How the years condemn
How the years condemn
