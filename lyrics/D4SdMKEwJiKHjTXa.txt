I feel like I'm fading
From the lack of love

Virgin love has such appeal
All your loving, I could steal
More affection, how I yearn
All your loving, I could burn
Restless 'cause I'm unfulfilled
Fantasizing someone will
Symptoms that are caused because
Hurting from the lack of love

From the lack of love
From the lack of love
From the lack of love
Hurting from the lack of love

Got to have it and my will
Just for pleasure and my thrill
I can't seem to get enough
Hurting from the lack of love

Feel like I'm fading
From the lack of love, from the lack of love
From the lack of love, from the lack of love
From the lack of love, from the lack of love
From the lack of love, from the lack of love

Hurting from the lack of love
Feel like I'm fading
Feel like I'm fading
Hurting from the lack of love
I feel like I'm fading
The lack of love
The lack of love
The lack of love
I feel like I'm fading
Feel like I'm fading
