Know enough to keep above
Watch you fall back down as we start to run
I feel it too as it calls to you
Hit the dark, I will come through

You think you're safe right behind the door
You think the worst of it happened before
You're all alone on the highest floor
What are you waiting for?

This is how it feels
No use in these tears
Shadows interfere
Reach into the clear
(I take the blame but you never know)
Even out this far
Who knows where we are
Never where you start

We're in the red, in empty air
Acting up, don't take me there
If you only knew what I've got to lose
It's enough that I'm losing you

You think you're safe right behind the door
You think the worst of it happened before
You're all alone on the highest floor
What are you waiting for?

This is how it feels
No use in these tears
Shadows interfere
Reach into the clear
(I take the blame but you never know)
Even out this far
Who knows where we are
Never where you start

And now
Even though you drag me down
I will keep you all around
And now
Even though you drag me down
I will keep you all around
