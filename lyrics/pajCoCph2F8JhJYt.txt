Pledged your faith, my heart embraced
Struggle to renew
Blurry mind so hypnotized
Fast enough who

Wonder
Where you are
Tristessa

Soul takes soul as I take eye
I will wait for you
What you believe, you'll wish to receive
I won't believe in you, to you

Hang on
To your life
Tristessa

I love you true
Surely I do
I love you true
Surely I do
Surely I do
Surely I do (no)

Do you ever wake up and find yourself alone?
Do you ever wake up far from home?
What you believe, you'll wish to receive
I won't believe in you
Tristessa
