You've got your lights turned so they
Can see you
The very best of what you've got
To offer
Tell them what your
Hands were made for
Tell them who your
Mouth was made for
You've got your prophets and your
Mathematicians
The vocal fuel of a
Generation
Tell me what my
Hands were made for
Tell me who my
Mouth was made for
And please don't be mad at me
Well, you'll get what you ask for
So come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on

So very close to what you had
Expected
It makes it hard to keep my head
Up level
Tell me I'm what your
Hands were made for
Tell me I'm who your
Mouth was made for
And if you come down on me
Well, you'll get what you ask for
So come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on

And I
I want to get myself back
High
I want to get myself back
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight-ni-ni-night

And all of the things that you promised us that you'd be
Well, now your hands are tired
But I was nice
Yeah, I was nice
But I
I'd give my life
For one night, one night, one night
Well I, I
Well I, I
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
What do you know?
What do you know?
What do you know? Oh-oh
What do you know? Oh-oh

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
