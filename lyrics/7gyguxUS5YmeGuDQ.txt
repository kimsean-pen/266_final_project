the scratches of a dark night
the rashes of foresight
and i wanted you ooh who ooh

the weight of my freezing
i have come to you
the face i was given
i have no similarities to

the spaces in the law look
like the faces in a word book
I get by I get by

the matches of opportunities
the last thing i've never seen
and i scream to you ooh-who-ooh

the pain i was needing
was sort of true
the one name i was clearing
was the walls that grew

and the crazes i overlooked
the leans into the cook
and i did and i did

and i was screaming bloody murder
and i was one with pain
and i stopped by the roadside
cuz it's from were i came

oh my god but its so far away
it would seem accidents have gone straight to you
and you've' changed your point of view
and the places you're going to
a get crowded i got crowded

and im so glad that you're mine
twist up the fabric of time
and im useless yes im useless

and the faces are bodies
and your hands are feet
let me roll around in things i cant believe
but i tried yes i tried and i tried you know i tried
