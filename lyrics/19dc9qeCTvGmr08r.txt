As a child, my mother said to me
Don't be afraid to lead the way you see
And it's only you who knows
Nobody else can see
But do I chase myself into the dark?
And a thousand ways to lead me back to the start
But you make it easier
To be who I want to be

And if the men in white coats are coming
I know you'll still be there for me
To chase down the walls around us
Oh, oh, oh, ooh
I keep the memories inside my mind
To show me how to leave the darkness
You will take me home one day believe me

Take my hand and lead me out from here
Hunted down, their footsteps drawing near
I knew you would come for me
I'm sorry you're in so deep

And if the men in white coats are coming
I know you'll still be there for me
To chase down the walls around us
I keep the memories inside my mind
To show me how to leave the darkness
You will take me home one day believe me

And I was so scared, I could not see the light
I didn't want to be alone
Would you just stand there watch them hold me down
I need to know that you're around
And I was so scared, I could not see the light
I didn't want to be alone
Would you just stand there watch them hold me down
I need to know that you're around
