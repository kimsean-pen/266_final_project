On armistice day
The philharmonic will play
But the songs that we sing
Will be sad
Shufflin brown tunes
Hanging around, ahoo
M-m-m-m-m-m-m
No long drawn blown out excuses
Were made
When I needed a friend she was there
Just like an easy chair

Oo, oo-o
M-m-m-m-m-m-m

Armistice day
Armistice day
That's all I really wanted to say

Oh I'm weary from waiting
In washington d.c.
I'm coming to see my congressman
But he's avoiding me
Weary from waiting down in washington d.c.

Oh congresswoman
Won't you tell that congressman
I've waited such a long time
I've about waited all I can
Oh congresswoman, won't you tell that congressman
