There has been an accident at the house built out of sticks
I will miss that little piggy
I can't believe this

Write this down and tell the world that the wolf has been found
When he dreams he dreams of flawless escape
Won't you try to get out of the way

Wait this is a cover up.

There has been one more victim
But I don't know his name
And the wolf has got a taste for bacon
But it's just a part of the game
When he dreams he dreams of flawless escape
Won't you try to get out of the way

Wait! This is a cover up
Let me see him
Alert the press!
