Sell the kids for food
Weather changes moods
Spring is here again
Reproductive glands

He's the one
Who likes all our pretty songs
And he
Likes to sing along
And he
Likes to shoot his gun
But he
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means when I say

He's the one
Who likes all our pretty songs
And he
Likes to sing along
And he
Likes to shoot his gun
But he
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means
When I say "yeah"

We can have some more
Nature is a whore
Bruises on the fruit
Tender age in bloom

He's the one
Who likes all our pretty songs
And he
Likes to sing along
And he
Likes to shoot his gun
But he
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means when I say

He's the one
Who likes all our pretty songs
And he
Likes to sing along
And he
Likes to shoot his gun
But he
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means
When I say "yeah"

He's the one
Who likes all our pretty songs
And he
Likes to sing along
And he
Likes to shoot his gun
But he
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means when I say

He's the one
Who likes all our pretty songs
And he
Likes to sing along
And he
Likes to shoot his gun
But he
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means
When I say "yeah"
