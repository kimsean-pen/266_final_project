I see you smoking on the lawn
You must be skipping class today
My heart stops for a second or two
All I want is to be near to you

Waiting for a train to come
Wondering if I should call
It feels so familiar now to me
Like I've heard this all before

And somebody loves you
It's been that way for a month or two

If all the lonely nights in your life
Piled up to block the sun
Are you crying in the kitchen sink?
Are you sleeping in too long?

Somebody loves you
It's been that way for a year or two

I'd wait a lifetime
Just for a chance to call you mine
Just for a chance to make you mine
