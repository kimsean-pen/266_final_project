I got a number on my wall
Someday soon I'm gonna call
Been trying reach you for a long, long time
Been trying reach you but I could not find a line

Finding an easy way to break your heart
Finding the hardest part is leaving
Finding an easy way to break your heart
Finding the hardest part is leaving

I got a number on my wall
And this time you know I want more
It takes a while before you really know what's right
It takes a while before you know what's right

Finding an easy way to break your heart
Finding the hardest part is leaving
Finding an easy way to break your heart
Finding the hardest part is leaving
