fragile figure
don't speak
the texture of your words
tortures me

deep blue desert
desperate idea
the pleasure of her touch
tortures me

surging blood
boiling streets
the pressure of my thoughts
tortures me

I can't see
I can't see
I won't accept
except my own ideas

it's a perversity
that's slowly
spiralling down in me

fragile figure
I want to make you scream
the texture of your cries
pleasures me

I can't see
I can't see
I won't accept
except my own ideas

it's a perversity
that's slowly
spiralling down in me

it's a perversity

I don't know if I care
