Come to seek our secret party
Forget all, just bring yourself in
And somebody
Somebody young, or you just feeling lonely?

Come inside
You can dream
Come inside
You won't feel

You can dream all, you can feel all
That there are no, leaves me in fear of
Just be sure to free your mind and
Welcome to the paradise land
Paradise land

People come and find a lifetime
I confess you, there's no place like this

Come to me, enter here
And enjoy, fall in laughter
Take my hand, I'll show
That in this world, we create the rain
