If you keep on repeating,
Repeating a word,
It becomes increasing,
Increasingly absurd.

SO LOVING,
I'm intending to,
Pretending.

I thought I was in,
But now I'm trying to get out,
I'm learning the twist,
Ignoring the shouts.

SO ADOR eye eyeing,
I'm enquiring,
Perspiring.

My options are open,
And it's up to me,
Things are so trying,
So trying for me.

SO TIR eye eyeing,
I'm spying something,
SO TIR eye eyeing,
I'm spying something.
