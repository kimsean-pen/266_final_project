everyone is gone
I turn the light on
he sme around
drove on the wrong side of the road
a bakers dozen
of bad affairs
but along came Ronnie
I climb up
the space between
I'm bitter like olives
that's why you like them
and I dont
rarely
I spend 80 dollars
Red-mouthed hulking
I stand beside Ali
In the mirror
hulking
that's why you like me and I don't
Leonie
I'm lonely
put pipe cleaner gold around me
Leonie
I'm lonely
I'm sitting where we'd sit
but now it's different
meet me at the pier
cigarettes and beer
I'll cut your hair
I don't care
Germany
takes you from me
