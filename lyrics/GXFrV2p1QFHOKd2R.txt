It's late enough to go drivin'
And see what's mine
Life's the study of dying
And how to do it right
If you're a holy roller
If you're bent on the loose
If you're hanging around
I'm holdin' the noose

Come a little bit closer
And get untied
In a hearse rollin over
Just a track in the line
Fuck it

Come on, let's go drivin'
Come on, let's take a little ride
Life's the study of dying
And how to do it right
