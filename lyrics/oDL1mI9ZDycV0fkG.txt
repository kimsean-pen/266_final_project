Changes Are No Good
The Stills

i wear a smile
i wear a laugh
on in the back stage changing heads
i am a weekday on weekends
i hate my best friends
spoken, choked up on my notes
this heart drones
as i try and act adult
but like a walkmen falls to pieces
all parts no heart
see me change, changes are no good
see me change, changes are no good
see me change
all the world's deranged
and i'm left crushed
people delayed
are in a rush
i'm on a roll
but i might throw up
will i ruin my make-up?
see me change, changes are no good
see me change, changes are no good
see me change
see me change, changes are no good
see friends change, changes are no good
see me change
