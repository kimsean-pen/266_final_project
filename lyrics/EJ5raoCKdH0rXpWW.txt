Used to cry about some crazy shit before
I used to feel so obligated to be so much more
I used to let some people tell me how to live and what to be
But if I can't be me, the fuck's the point?
No

I don't care about it anymore, oh
I don't care about it anymore

Now I laugh about the things
That used to be important to me
Used to have a hold on me (used to have a hold)
Like, what do you think?
And what he thinks and what they think
But I love me

I don't care about it anymore
I don't care about it anymore

Yeah

I, I, I don't care about it anymore, oh
I, I, I don't care about it anymore, oh
