To all the lovers in the place
This song is for you, baby
This song is for you

To all the haters in the place
I ain't singin' to you, baby
I ain't singin' to you

It's been a long, crazy week, all I want is a little time
Rest my hands and my feet, let it go tonight
Leave the stress at home, tell the drama no
You ain't gonna kill my vibe, oh no

I look at you, you look at me, we already know
What I want, what I need so move me on the floor
I can feel your love when our bodies touch
If anyone is feeling like me tonight

Now throw your hands up
For the next three minutes it's about the lovers
(You know it, you know it)
Baby stand up if you're single but you're looking for another
(You know it)

Ladies tell your men you love them
Fellows tell your girl you love her
So throw your hands up
For the next three minutes it's about the lovers
(About the lovers)

Thinking about the ones that are looking down on you and me
Lovers in together now, now I'm completely free
Life is way too short, you might as well get yours
lord knows i'm doing baby

So all the lovers in the place
This song is for you, baby
This song is for you

To all the haters in the place
I ain't singin' to you, baby
I ain't singin' to you
C'mon

Now throw your hands up
For the next three minutes it's about the lovers
(You know it, you know it)
Baby stand up if you're single but you're looking for another
(You know it)

Ladies tell your men you love them
Fellows tell your girl you love her
So throw your hands up
For the next three minutes it's about the lovers
(About the lovers)

And if your lover ain't around
That don't mean you can't get down
(You know it, you know it)
And if you came here all alone
Find someone and hold them close
(You know it, you know it)

So throw your hands up, yeah
And baby let me see you stand up
And if you're single it don't matter, no
'Cause this song is for everyone who believes in love

Now throw your hands up
For the next three minutes it's about the lovers
(You know it, you know it)
Baby stand up if you're single but you're looking for another
(You know it)
Ladies tell your men you love them
Fellows tell your girl you love her
So throw your hands up
For the next three minutes it's about the lovers
(All about the lovers)
To all the lovers in the place
This song is for you, baby
This song is for you
It's about the lovers
To all the haters in the place
I ain't singin' to you, baby
I ain't singin' to you, you, you, you, you
