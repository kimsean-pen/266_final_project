Some say this is a dangerous place
Dangerous women lipstick mace
Men disappear without a trace
Stay anonymous hide your face
In this town you'd need a
Bulletproof
Shatterproof heart

When I came here I was innocent
Soon found out what trouble meant
Now I regret the times I've spent
In your towerblocks and tenements

In this town you'd need a
Bulletproof heart
In this town you'd need a
Bulletproof
Shatterproof heart

Watch your step
Don't open your door
Watch your step
They want to settle a score
Watch your step
Don't open your door
Open your door

Some may say this is a dangerous place
Searchlights circles
Watch this space
Men disappear without a trace
Anonymous faces lost in the maze
In this town you'd need a
Bulletproof heart
In this town you'd need a
Bulletproof
Shatterproof heart
In this town you'd need a
Bulletproof heart
In this town you'd need a
Bulletproof
Shatterproof heart
Shatterproof heart
Shatterproof heart

In this town
In this town
In this town
In this town
