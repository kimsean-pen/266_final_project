I don't believe in fate
No psychic vision
But when things fall into place - superposition
In any universe you are my dark star

I want you to want me
Why don't we rely on chemistry
Why don't we collide the spaces that divide us
I want you to want me

Superstition aims with imprecision
But when things can't be explained, superposition
In any universe you are my dark star

I want you to want me
Why don't we rely on chemistry
Why don't we collide the spaces that divide us
I want you to want me
I want you to want me

No matter what we do
I'll be there with you!

I want you to want me
Why don't we rely on chemistry
Why don't we collide the spaces that divide us
I want you to want me
