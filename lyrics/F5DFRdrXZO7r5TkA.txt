You've got both ears on me
Constantly analyzing
Waiting for me to misspeak through selective hearing

Dissected nouns and verbs
Every single sounds been searched
This is not what I deserve
Is it fun to watch me burn?

Holding my head to the curb
Lighting the match with my words
This is not what I deserve
Is it fun to watch me burn?

I better watch what I say
With pitchforks and torches ablaze
You can't wait to turn the world against me
I better watch what I say
Before you tarnish my name
You won't stop until you've got my tongue tied with lies
You've got my tongue tied

You've got both hands on me
Your death grip, tightening
Showing no mercy or understanding

Waiting at every turn
Trying to dig up the dirt
This is not what I deserve
Is it fun to watch me burn?

Following me in a hearse
Haunting my words like a curse
This is not what I deserve
Is it fun to watch me burn?

I better watch what I say
With pitchforks and torches ablaze
You can't wait to turn the world against me
I better watch what I say
Before you tarnish my name
You won't stop until you've got my tongue tied with lies
You've got my tongue tied with lies
You've got my tongue tied

You've got both ears on me
Constantly analyzing
Waiting for me to misspeak through selective hearing

I better watch what I say
With pitchforks and torches ablaze
You can't wait to turn the world against me
I better watch what I say
Before you tarnish my name
You won't stop until you've got my tongue tied with lies
You've got my tongue tied
