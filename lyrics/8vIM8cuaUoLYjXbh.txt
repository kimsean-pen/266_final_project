So roll, roll down
rubber rowrow train
Dear Jessie James
heart full of love
but I'm only here to kill her.

Fear that the devil may have spoke to soon
and ran through the room
with a bottle of you
fell down in a chair
that was where I heard him sing.

And he sang
Love is only a heartbeat away
better save it for the darkest of your days
and he sang love
is only a heartbeat away
better save it for the darkest of your days

So I raised my glass
to the holy ghost
Father and Son that you love the most
St. Peter won't you please forgive her
turn yourself an old blind eye
damn heaven knows we tried
and now it's never heard more sin

And she sang
love is only a heartbeat away
better save it for the darkest of your days
and she sang
love is only a heartbeat away
better save it for the darkest of your days

And I know I wasn't around
half as much as I could have been
and I never you say
half as much as you would've.
as you would've

So roll, roll down
rubber rowrow train
Dear Jessie James
heart full of love
but I'm only here to kill her.
Remember me for mistakes I've made
I always did leave
when I should have stayed
and ohh
my sins taught me how to sing

And I sang
love is only a heartbeat away
better save it for the darkest of your days
and I sang love
is only a heartbeat away
better save it for the darkest of your days
