You think that I'm the devil
But I told you I'd be your clown
I couldn't help you if I was christ himself
You've got your head right under the ground
And you'd like me to get you out
Of the jam that your in

I'll tell you flat don't you look at me
I don't go floatin' for no 20 buck spin aww no
And you run to me in the night time
the look of fears in your eyes
My one life's goal is survival
I ain't got time for no rival oh no!
