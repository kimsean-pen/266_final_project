How can we let this happen and
Just keep our eyes closed till the end

The only thing that counts is the prosperity of today
Most important to us is that our bills get paid

Our good intentions have always been delayed

How can we let this happen and
Just keep our eyes closed till the end
When we will stand in front of heaven's gate
It will be too late!

Try to unlearn all that you've learnt
try to listen to your heart
No, we can't understand the universe
by just using our mind
We are so afraid of all the things unknown

A must we apeease is the lust to get laid
Nothing really matters, just devouring our prey

Our good intentions have always been delayed so
Our generous acts have always come too late

How can we let this happen and
Just keep our eyes closed till the end
When we will stand in front of heaven's gate
It will be too late!

Try to unlearn all that you've learnt
try to listen to your heart
No, we can't understand the universe
by just using our mind
We are so afraid of the things unknown
We just flee into a dream that never comes true

Low, low, low to the ground we feel safe
Low, low, low to the ground we feel brave

Oblivisci tempta quod didicisti

Open your eyes; we're not in paradise
How can't you see, this stress is killing me
Fulfill your dreams; life is not what it seems
We have captured time
so time made us all hostages without mercy

Seemingly generous fooling ourselves

Selfishly venomous time tells

Too much thinking goes at the cost of all our intuition
Our thoughts create reality
But we neglect to be!
So we're already slaves of our artificial world
We shoudn't try to control life
but listen to the laws of nature

Open your eyes; we're not in paradise
How can't you see, this stress is killing me
Fulfill your dreams; life is not what it seems
We have captured time
so time made us all hostages without mercy
Low, low, low to the ground we feel safe
Low, low, low to the ground we feel brave
We all think we're generous
But we only fool ourselves
The only thing that matters is
Our way and our vision
Selfishly we're venomous
But you know the time tells us
There is more to life than our
Higher positions, race for perfection
Better, faster
We must return to the laws of the nature
Free ourselves from madness
