I think I have wants
So much time
Over the course
Calling you mine
You say it's fine
But you won't go away
So, maybe next year
Things will go
Just as I planned
Maybe who knows
She could be done
But she won't go away
Two-oo hiding and I'm like
Two-oo no one really likes
Two-oo happy all the time
Two
How, do I forget
She's around
Is there a trick
Made up ground
To be ok with it
Cause she won't go away
Two-oo hiding and I'm like
Two-oo no one really likes
Two-oo happy all the time
Two
Two-oo hiding and I'm like
Two-oo no one really likes
Two-oo happy all the time
Two
