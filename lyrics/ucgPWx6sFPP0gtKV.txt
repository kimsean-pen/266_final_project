Jesus Christ seems super nice
I wonder if he'd save me
I've been on the wrong side of a bunch of arguments lately
Momma, I may never come home again
Momma said, "There's nothing wrong with being happy"
Happy trails, but momma, I've been feeling so alone
Mommy said she's busy working, spending time with that other guy
But momma, I just wanna come home
"But home is where your heart is, boy, at least you've got a phone"

And Jesus Christ seems super nice
I wonder if he'd love me
How come I only wonder when I'm sad or really hungry?
Jesus Christ, you're super nice
But don't expect much from me, I
Would kneel down, but I'm afraid that I would just feel nothing
Praise God
And other things that don't make sense to puny minds
Like ours designing roller coasters
That almost always seem to fall apart
Ain't it fun, ain't it fun, ain't it fun
Knowing that
That one day, you know, I fly to the sky, to the sun
And Jesus Christ, you're super nice
So I'll write a song about it
About no one ever knowing, but always claiming they're about it
Press "ignore"
On both sides that always claim to know that they're so sure
Or just not be a giant fucking prick and enjoy the show
I'll enjoy the show

And, and, and, and
And father, I just don't know what to make, you know
Of all these tiny specks with so much shit to fucking say
And father, I just hope that we don't fall apart and break
It'd be great if we didn't relive 1938 to '45
Man, there's just nothing we could change
If I'm not a giant prick, does that just mean that I am saved
Jesus Christ, you're super nice
I'm sure that you could love me
Even if I don't go to church every Sunday
Jesus Christ, you're super nice
How could you let me burn?
If I'm not murdering people, then smashing their fucking urn
But Jesus Christ, you're super nice
How could you let me burn
But if I go to hell, I'll grit my teeth and get to work
