(I'm still hungry
I'm still hungry
I'm still hungry
I'm still hungry!
I'm still hungry!)

I chew 'em up, I spit 'em out
I use the bones to clean my mouth
It gets me high, I'm out for blood
Sometimes it takes a sane enough

You think this a game to me?
It's just another day?
Fam and a feast, can't cage the beast
There ain't no stoppin' me

I can feel my heart beat out my chest
You know that I would die for this
I'm gonna live my life with no regrets
Just wanna have a life for this
Don't call me out 'cause I let you down
Ain't in it for the fame
Ain't in it for the money
And I will do whatever it takes
I'm still hungry

(I will do whatever it takes)
I'm still hungry
I'm still hungry
(I will do whatever it takes)
(Still hungry)
(Still hungry!)

No fear to grime, puttin' in my time
I've always had a one-track mind
Can't stone the fire, I feed the flame
There ain't no stoppin' me

I can feel my heart beat out my chest
You know that I would die for this
I'm gonna live my life with no regrets
Just wanna have a life for this
Don't call me out 'cause I let you down
Ain't in it for the fame
Ain't in it for the money
And I will do whatever it takes
I'm still hungry

(I will do whatever it takes)
I'm still hungry
(I will do whatever it takes)
I'm still hungry
(I will do whatever it takes)
(Still hungry)
(Yeah, I'm still hungry)

I will do whatever it takes
I'm still hungry
I make everyone of you pay
I'm still hungry

I can feel my heart beat out my chest
You know that I would die for this
I'm gonna live my life with no regrets
Just wanna have a life for this
Don't call me out 'cause I let you down
Ain't in it for the fame
Ain't in it for the money
And I will do whatever it takes
I'm still hungry

(I will do whatever it takes)
I'm still hungry
I'm still hungry
(I will do whatever it takes)
(Still hungry!)
(Yeah, I'm still hungry)
(I'm still hungry!)
(I'm still hungry!)
I'm still hungry
