Dance to the music

Keep on dancin' to the music
Keep on dancin' to the music
If them Joneses hey, us alone
Then them Stoner-bag get it on
And that's why, girl, me and you
Get along, girl, easy to

Keep on dancin' to the music
Keep on dancin' to the music
Keep on dancin' for the thing
Keep on dancin' don't you hear I sing

Dance to the music
Dance to the music
Dance to the music
Dance to the music

Take the floor then, you lookin' good
I'd get snowed in, if I could
You're the one girl and you know
Number one girl that's for sure

Keep on dancin' for the thing
Keep on dancin', hear me sing

Dance to the music
Dance to the music
