I woke up and he was screaming,
I'd left him dreaming.
I'll roll over and shake him tightly
And whisper, 'If they want you, they're gonna have to fight me.
Oh fight me.'

I woke up on a bench on Shepherd's Bush Green,
A candle at my chest, and a head on his knee.
I got up it was dark there is no one in the park at this hour.
How do I keep finding myself here?
'Oh fight me.'

If look back and he is screaming,
I'd left him dreaming
A dangerous feat.
And I'll run back and shake him tightly
And scream, 'If they want him they're gonna have to fight me.
Oh fight me.'

But if I wake up on a bench on Shepherd's Bush Green,
A candle at my chest, and a head on his knee
I'll roll over and hold on tightly
And scream, 'If you want him, you're gonna have to fight me.
Oh fight me. Oh fight me'
