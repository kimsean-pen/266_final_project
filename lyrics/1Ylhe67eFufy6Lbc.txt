Hi, honey, it's me
I went to see the doctor today
'Cause ever since you've been gone
I had a pain deep down inside
He says there's nothin' wrong with me
I'm just missin' my man
So honey, please
Come on home as soon as you can

Doctor's orders say
There's only one thing for me
Nothing he can do
'Cause only you can cure me

Says in my condition
Love's the best physician
He's prescribed a potion
Full of warm emotion

Every day
A lovin' spoonful to be taken
It's the only thing
To stop this empty heart of mine from breaking

Won't get better
'Till you're back again, he told me
Doctor's orders
Need your lovin' arms to hold me

Darlin', now I know
There ain't no doubt about it
I'm so hooked on your love
I can't live without it

You're away (You're away)
But please don't treat me like a stranger
'Cause doctor's orders say
One kiss for me and I am out of danger

Please say you understand how I feel, honey
I know you got a lot of things on your mind
Oh, but I'm missin' you so bad
Please, oh, please come on home (Hey, hey, hey)

Doctor's orders say
There's only one thing for me
Nothing he can do
'Cause only you can cure me

Says in my condition
Love's the best physician
He's prescribed a potion
Full of warm emotion

Doctor's orders say
There's only one thing for me
Nothing he can do
'Cause only you can cure me
