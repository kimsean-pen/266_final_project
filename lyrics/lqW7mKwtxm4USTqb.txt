Waited a long time for this
Feels right now
Uh, uh, ha, ha
Allow me to introduce myself
Want you to come a little closer
I'd like you to get to know me a little bit better
Meet the real me

Sorry you can't define me, sorry I break the mold
Sorry that I speak my mind, sorry don't do what I'm told
Sorry if I don't fake it, sorry I come too real
I will never hide what I really feel
No way, oh

So here it is
No hype, no gloss, no pretense
Just me
Stripped
