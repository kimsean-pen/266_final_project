It starts with a wanting to fit in
Addiction slowly setting in
I drifted off into dismay

Eyes looking back at me
I can't even see your face
The pressure is closing in
It's taking me again

Wait, it's all that I can take
And every single day
A part of my soul is fading
But now, by letting go somehow
Unshackled and unbound
I'm calling out your name I'm fading
So save me from what I've become
It's like a force that's pulling you
It's empty promise hides the truth

Eyes looking back at me
I can't even see your face

The pressure is closing in
It's taking me again
Wait, it's all that I can take
And every single day

A part of my soul is fading
But now, by letting go somehow
Unshackled and unbound
I'm calling out your name I'm fading
So save me from what I've become
Wait - Just about to break
Help me see the way
I'm shatter into pieces on the floor
Wait, it's all that I can take

And every single day
A part of my soul is fading
But now by letting go somehow

Unshackled and unbound
I'm calling out your name I'm fading - away
It's all that I can take
And every single day
A part of my soul is fading
But now by letting go somehow
Unshackled and unbound
I'm calling out your name I'm fading
So save me from what I've become
