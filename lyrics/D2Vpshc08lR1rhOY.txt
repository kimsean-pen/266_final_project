It's hard to believe that
I smile in my sleep
'Cause everyone leaves me
I'm so hard to keep company
I'm misery company

Most people don't mention
The stripes on my sleeve
Though I liked attention
I just want to live quietly
In Misery Company

Yeah

The weight of the world is in our hands, right
Straight as my oath that I live by
Don't even know what we're fighting for

A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-oh
A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-oh
A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-oh-oh-oh

Oh, what a cutie, here comes Officer Dave
Reporting for duty, a cut and a shave,
Number 3
For misery company

Our wonderful training kept us off the front line
Stops the kill, entertaining
Drops the bill everytime
Naturally, we're Misery Company

Oh yeah, yeah

The weight of the world is in our hands, right
Straight as my oath that I live by
Don't even know what we're fighting for

A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-oh
A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-oh
A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-oh-oh-oh

A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-oh
A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-oh
A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-oh-oh-oh

The weight of the world is in our hands, right
Straight as my oath that I live by
Don't even know what we're fighting for

A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-oh
A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-oh
A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-oh-oh-oh

A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-oh
A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-oh
A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-oh-oh-oh
