This time
I gotta put my guard down
Pick myself up off the ground
Take the pain

It'll pass
The swelling never really lasts
But the scar remains
Remind me that I'm still living

Well it's not too late
And it's not really worth the fight
No one's right
Well it's time to walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away!

Well the bigger that you come
The harder you're gonna fall
Walk away
Walk away

Did you win
Or maybe did you lose?
Now you're gonna lick your wounds anyway
When it comes back to you
When you fall

You're gonna need a parachute
Or use a pair of shoes to go and
Walk away!

Well it's not too late
And it's not really worth the fight
No one's right
Well it's time to walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away!

Well, the bigger that you come
The harder you're gonna fall
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away!

And the bigger that you come
The harder you're gonna fall
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away!
