Lucky cloud your sky
A little rain
A lot of fun
One kiss and I go overboard

I will find
More to see
I will see
More to find
It'a a two way, two way street
The more I look ahead
The more I see behind

Lucky cloud your sky
A little rain
A lot of fun
One kiss and I go overboard

What a day
As the sun peeps around the cloud
That's in the way
Like a two way, two way street
The weather at a point will show me what you will say

Lucky cloud your sky
A little rain
A lot of fun
One kiss and I go overboard

I see your light touch my eyes
And then the rest
Is history
One kiss and I go...
