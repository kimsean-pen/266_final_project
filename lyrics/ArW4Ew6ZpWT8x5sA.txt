I'm a white light that's burning
(Right across your sky)
Gonna light up the city
(And light up your night)
Like a flame that keeps burning
(Shining on bright)
I'm a flash across the sky

My name is Thunder!
Thunder, yeah!

Now they're running for shelter
And they run for their lives
Now they're looking for cover
Will you make it alive?

What ever happened to the sunlit skies?
When we were living in a different light
There's only lonely places left to hide
And everyone keeps hidden out of sight
Out of sight

So let's light up this city and make it our own
A call to the people
We'll turn up the sun
A new day is coming
We're writing our names
I'm a flash across the sky

My name is Thunder!
Thunder!

I'm a white light that's burning
(Right across your sky)
Gonna light up the city
(And light up your night)
Like a flame that keeps burning
(Shining on bright)
I'm a flash across the sky

My name is Thunder!
Yeah!
