There's a faerie in my head and I call her Lady Rosenred
Why she came there I don't know, no I don't know

We wander worlds sometimes
Green forests, stars and stories
A secret time under three moons

We walk the clouds at times
And ride on dragon faeries
A drink with friends under three moons

Say will you dream with me tonight, under moonlit skies

We run the hills sometimes
Do battles upon evil
A bard so sings within the shadows

We turn the ghosts around
And jam with angry mages
A silent dream within the shadows

Say will you dream with me tonight, under moonlit skies

And then we turn around
And find all forests gone
And find all stars and stories gone

And then we turn around
And find all faeries gone
And find all dragons faeries gone

Say will you dream with me tonight
