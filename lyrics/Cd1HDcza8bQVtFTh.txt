I see 22, oh, and I think of you
Lately that's all I do
Don't you know that I I'm always driving by
Wanna come home to you

Oh, I know I've always been afraid to say
How I feel, but that's got to change

Every time I'm with somebody I'm confusing them with you
Anywhere I go reminds me of the things we used to do
And I dream about the street where we kissed out of the blue
It's your house, number 22
Baby, where are you
Number 22

I see 22, oh, it's like déjà vu
Boy, if you only knew
This time I messed it up, but I can't give you up
Your face is all I got

Yeah, I know I've always been afraid to say
How I feel, but that's got to change

Every time I'm with somebody I'm confusing them with you
Anywhere I go reminds me of the things we used to do
And I dream about the street where we kissed out of the blue
It's your house, number 22
Number 22, yeah
Baby, where are you
Number 22

All alone tonight
Wishing you were laying by my side
So I just keep on driving by
To pass the time

(Every time I'm with somebody I'm confusing them with you)
(Anywhere I go reminds me of the things we used to do)
Any time I'm with somebody
And I dream about the street where we kissed out of the blue
It's your house, number 22
(Every time I'm with somebody I'm confusing them with you)
Everybody, no, no, no
(Anywhere I go reminds me of the things we used to do)
I remember you
Number 22
Number 22
