They blazed a trail I dared to run
They built this world and I have come
I need another, like a brother
For a crying shoulder

And this could be the last time
You will stand by my side
Well, I can feel my soul, it's bleeding
Will you fly with me this evening?

Sober mind, time now is gone
They carved my body not of stone
A pretty maze of emptiness
I've sailed the hell with all the rest

And this could be the last time
You will stand by my side
Well, I can feel my soul, it's bleeding
Will you fly with me this evening?

And this could be the last time
You will stand by my side
But I can feel my soul, it's bleeding
Will you fly with me tonight?

This could be the last time
You will stand by my side
Well, I can feel my soul, it's bleeding
Will you fly with me this evening?
