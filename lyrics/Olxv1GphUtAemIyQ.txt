You're the chosen one,
But I could use a change
Even golden suns
Find the end of their reign
You might as well be gone,
Yeah, you might as well be gone,
That's my speech
That's my song

On the street tonight
But the bars are all closed
We could meet tonight
But you're only a ghost

You might as well be gone
You might as well be gone
Yeah, you might as well be gone
That's my speech
That's my song

You might as well be gone
You might as well be gone
You might as well be gone
You might as well be gone
That's my speech
That's my song
