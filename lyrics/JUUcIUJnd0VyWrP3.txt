All this time I thought you knew, I thought you were aware
Of how much I would do for you, of just how much I care
All this time you sat here thinking that I wouldn't give
Every bit of life of mine just so that you could live

And now I've got a feel from you it's bitterness and cold
I'm hearing what you say but not believing what I'm told

Please hold me like you did before
We don't know what we're fighting for
I need you won't you stay with me
Cause I don't wanna be your enemy

You built so many walls around me that you couldn't see
That without you there is no us there is not even me
I'm standing here before you with no armour lying bare
Lying stranded and defenseless you could help me if you care

You built so many walls around me that I wouldn't dare
Try to climb them but I'm standing with a white flag in the air

Please hold me like you did before
We don't know what we're fighting for
I need you won't you stay with me
Cause I don't wanna be your enemy

Don't let me be your enemy
Don't let me be your enemy
Don't let me be your enemy
Don't let me be your enemy
Don't let me be your enemy
Don't let me be your enemy
Don't let me be your enemy
Don't let me be your enemy

Please hold me like you did before
We don't know what we're fighting for
I need you won't you stay with me
Cause I don't wanna be your enemy

Please hold me like you did before
We don't know what we're fighting for
I need you won't you stay with me
Cause I don't wanna be your enemy

I don't wanna be your enemy
