Who can find you clear springs of waters, but I can!
Who can tell you the age of the moon, but I can!
Who can call the fish from the depths of the see, yes I can!
Who can change the shapes of the hills and the headlands, I can!

I have been a sword in the hand,
I have been a shield in a fight,
I have been the string of a harp,
I can shift my shape like a god

Farewell, leave the shore to an ocean wide and untamed
Hold your shield high, let the wind bring your enemy your nightmare
By the bane of my blade, a mighty spell is made and
Far beyond the battle blood shall fall like a hard rain
