If you feel alive,
in a darkened room
Do you know the name,
of your solitude
If you ain't got the answer,
if you don't know the truth
If you want the power
then let it flow through

would you let it go,
ooh, would you let it go,
ooh, would you let it go,
ooh, would you let it go,
they cannot end this mourning
of my life

show me
how the gods kill

If you feel alive
If you got no fear
Do you know the name
of the one you seek
if you want the answer
if you want the truth
look inside your empty soul
there you'll find the noose

would you let it go,
ooh, would you let it go,
ooh, would you let it go,
ooh, would you let it go,
they cannot end this mourning
of my life

show me
how the gods kill
