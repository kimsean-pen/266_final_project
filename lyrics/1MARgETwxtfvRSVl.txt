Voices of the world song
Happy, hollow, lazy
Protecting their moral ground
Louder than white clean teeth

I push down all the terrible thoughts inside
Down to my minimum wage routine
Tramp of the portables, temp full-time
All upper management in their teens

I pick all my clothes out
Stay fresh in pre-approved jeans
The bargains get sold out on smiles
Cheap-O you, lucky me

I push down all the terrible thoughts inside
Down to my minimum wage routine
Tramp of the portables, temp full-time
All upper management in their teens

I like the taste of the cola on ice in the employee lounge
Kick back in comfort, fearless
I'd like to say that I feel alive
And that I live my life as if tomorrow never come
I'd like to say when kids are calling me out
That they should follow my footsteps 'stead of foolin' around

I'd like to say when kids are calling me out
That they should follow my footsteps 'stead of foolin' around

I push down all the terrible thoughts inside
Down to my minimum wage routine
Tramp of the portables, temp full-time
All upper management in their teens

All upper management in their teens
All upper management in their teens
All upper management in their teens
