I see my life
Flowing dreams
With your eyes they see
The love in you and me
Peaceful dreams
Live in you
Besides the things we hold
Dear in our hearts
Fear it brings
Faith in unseen
Living in as one
The difference in you and me

In my eyes
Through the sky
You and I yeah
Don't deny
You will find
The time to unwind

Please your mind
It heals my love
Forever together you
Distant times
That bring me down
With your love I rise
Forever together you

In my eyes
Through the sky
You and I yeah
Don't deny
You will find
The time to unwind

Yeah
Yeah
You will find
You will find
The time to unwind
