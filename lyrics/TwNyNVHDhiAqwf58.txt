You know me babe, I love the good living
Give me something I can stickâ€“stick in
You give the girl another hit, honey
You keep me waiting and I'll keep running, now

Can't turn around, just to run out
Is there any light on the way home?
Somewhere along, I played it wrong
Fell into a world so far from home

Girl overboard
I thought I had it but I stumbled
And I thought I'd last forever oh
Girl overboard
I thought I had it but I tumbled
And I thought no doubt about it oh

Girl overboard
I thought I had it but I stumbled
And I thought I'd last forever oh
Girl overboard
I thought I had it but I tumbled
And I thought no doubt about it oh

You know me babe, I used to feel lucky
Until karma came a knock-knocking
One little slip and I hit rock bottom
Life is waiting but I'm not stopping, now

Can't turn around, just to run out
Is there any light on the way home?
Somewhere along, I played it wrong
Fell into a world so far from home

Girl overboard
I thought I had it but I stumbled
And I thought I'd last forever oh
Girl overboard
I thought I had it but I tumbled
And I thought no doubt about it oh
