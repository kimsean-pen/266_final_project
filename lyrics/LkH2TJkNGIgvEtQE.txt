It's hard,
It's so hard

And it's a lonely planet joy
When the song from from the other boys
That's when I'm a lonely planet boy
And I'm tryin, Baby for your love

Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah

Oh, you pick me up
Your outta drivin in your car
When I tell you where I'm goin
You're always tellin me it's to far

But how could you be drivin
Down by my home
When ya know, I aint got one
And I'm, I'm so all alone

Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah

Oh it's a lonely planet joy
When the song from your other boys
That's when I'm a lonely planet boy
And I'm tryin, I'm cryin,
Baby for your love

Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah

Oh, It's so lonely

Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah

Oh can't you hear me callin
I'm a thousand miles away
And I don't wanna stay
I'm thinkin words I gotta say

Cus I wanna be there witcha
And I know what to bring
I remember, from the days
You got over, everything

Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah

Oh it's a lonely planet joy
When the song from your other boys
That's when I'm a lonely planet boy
And I'm tryin, I'm cryin,
Can't ya see I'm diein
Baby, for your love

Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah

Now you are lonely
