When everything isn't yellow
Will we still smile through broken glass
And live in falsetto
Are we too deep for a second chance
They say time is a healer
Well, how do you expect to heal this clock
And every minute I see her
How can you turn when you've got this far?

When everything isn't yellow
When everything isn't yellow
When everything isn't yellow
When everything isn't yellow

When everything isn't yellow
Will we still smile through broken glass
And live in falsetto
Are we too deep for a second chance
They say time is a healer
Well, how do you expect to heal this clock
And every minute I see her
How can you turn when we got this far?

When everything isn't yellow
When everything isn't yellow
When everything isn't yellow
When everything isn't yellow
When everything isn't yellow

When everything turns gray and lights go down and you can't see us together
When I see your true colors, why do you change?
When everything isn't yellow
When everything turns gray and lights go down and you can't see us together
When I see your true colors, why do you change?

When everything isn't yellow
When everything isn't yellow
When everything isn't yellow
When everything isn't yellow
When everything isn't yellow
When everything isn't yellow
When everything isn't yellow
When everything isn't yellow
When everything isn't yellow
