You don't have to be like anybody else (No)
So what's the problem, why can't you be like yourself (Oh)
You're individual, you might as well let it show
(Oh, Oh, Oh)
Because you're beautiful just the way that you (are)
Not everybody has to bling-bling super (star)
Holla back if you're feeling what I'm feeling now

(Oh, Oh, Oh)
You got to do your own thing (Oh)
Don't be just the same (Oh)
Get the party jumping (Oh)
The way you like (Oh)
You got to do your own thing (Oh)
And dance your own way (Oh)

Go a little crazy (Oh)
Cuz you got the right (Oh)
Go home and change your clothes 25 times a day
Tell the haters not to come around, they bother me
Know that it's your world, go ahead live it up
(Oh, Oh, Oh)
Some call me crazy, well I guess they'll never understand

I change my hair, my clothes, my style because I know I can
Now get out on the dance floor, and dance
You got to your own thing (Oh)
Don't be just the same (Oh)
Get the party jumping (Oh)
The way you like (Oh)
You got to do your own thing (Oh)
And dance your own way (Oh)
You got something (Oh)
That makes you rise (Oh)
Up to the top of the world (Oh)
You got to know what you like (Oh)
All my fellas and my girls (Oh)
Show who you are tonight (Oh)
You got to do your own thing (Oh)

You got to rock your own style (Oh)
You got to live for yourself (Oh)
Every once in a while (Oh)
Do your own thing
And live your own way
The world is all yours
Go out and get some more

Do your own thing

And live your own way
The world is waiting
Go out and get what's yours
