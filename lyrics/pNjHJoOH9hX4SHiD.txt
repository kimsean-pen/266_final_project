DEBUT LP

YOUNG AREN'T YOUNG

Slinking in the street
And we take off running
Living in the light
On the darker side
Boys laugh hard
As we round the corner
Time we got home,
It had all been done.

Talking with the girl
But the girl goes sideways
Giving her the line
But he's losing ground
There she goes
On her way shooting off
All around the world

All around the World
All around the World
All around the World
All around the World

Your style is correct so you make an impression
Owning what you do to know what you are.
Got to make your own way to be in it.
We live, we move,
All around the world

We live, we move,
All around the world

Young in the light,
In the light
On the darker side.
Young in the light,
In the light
On the darker side

All around the World

Boy and girl go down
To the place by the water
Creeping into the afternoon
Young aren't so young,
They're getting restless,
Loving to lose it
All around the world

LOVESICK (ONCE AGAIN)

Lovesick once again
I get slapstick when you walk in
I get so nervous I stutter and flail
Troubled sleep,
I don't eat,
I've gone pale.

Tarantulas under the skin
Got King Kong battling within
A blood moon looms in the sky above
I'm the Wolfman,
I'm frantic in Love.

It it it it it it it rips into me
I I I I I I I'm a mess
Violins in my heart
And I start
To shake and I shake and I shake

Romance, flowers, Champaign
We go dancing, we kiss in the rain,
I'm sedated and trying to forget
I'm agitated
I'm covered in sweat

It it it it it it it rips into me
I I I I I I I'm a mess
Violins in my heart
And I start
To shake and I shake and I shake
Shake shake shake

It it it it it it it rips into me
I I I I I I I'm a mess
Violins in my heart
And I start
To shake and I shake and I shake
Shake, shake
To shake and I shake and I shake
And I shake and I shake and I shake
And I shake and I shake and I shake
And I...

KILLING IT

Chances get lost
Romances, always is,
Hidden
Resistances
Was it
Lonely?
No,
It wasn't
Mostly
We were
Killing it
Isn't it all so...

We were
Killing it
Isn't it all so...

Awesome

I swear
I would
For you

Heartbreaks and lies
Eyes lock, paralyzed
I don't know why
I don't why
We were
Killing it
Into it,
Still I keep
Thinking it's...

Me.

I Keep
Falling,
You keep
Calling

Tell me why
Tell me why

You wore
That look of yours
That once took my
breathe away

That all you have to say?

Then, it's not up to you.

Holding, discreetly
Keeping controlled,
Fascinated,
Dispossessed
When we
Kissed I
Flinched I
Tried to
Hide it
Tell me why
Tell me why
Tell no lies
Tell no lies
Tell no lies

Tell me why
Tell me why

PIGEONS

Saturday comes,
Sunday comes, we go...
Saturday comes,
Sunday comes, we go...
We go...

Kicking on the edge of town
Counting all the pigeons down
Walking in the steps of men.
I have the feeling they're not breathing.

She's shaking like a rattle
Sneaking out, the hour's still
Waiting for the room to fall in
Watching the time unwind.

Saturday, Saturday
Saturday comes,
Sunday comes, we go...

Kicking on the edge of town
Counting all the pigeons down
Walking in the steps of men.
I have the feeling they're not bleeding.

Laughing like a right-loon
Slavering at the silvery moon
Waiting for the room to fall in
Waiting for him to come.

Saturday, Saturday
Saturday comes,
Sunday comes, we go...

She is still not still is not still.
He is here and not here at all.

Cold grey morning,
Waking in his room she goes
Crawling out the window,
Climbing up the crooked stairs.
Above the ceiling leaning tracing pigeons
Turning circles in the morning sky.
"I don't know why, you don't just fly away,
Fly away!
Fly away!"

Saturday comes,
Sunday comes, we go...
Saturday comes,
Sunday comes, we go...
Saturday comes,
Sunday comes, we go...
I don't know why, you don't just fly away,
Away, away, away
Saturday comes,
Sunday comes, we go...
I don't know why, you don't just fly away,
Away, away, away
We go...
