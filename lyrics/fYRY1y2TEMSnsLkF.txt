Any infection (imperfection)
Any affliction (imperfection)
Each imperfection (don't you settle)
Spread the addiction (take some action)
Any disorder (imperfection)
Bi or tri polar (imperfection)
For your protection (don't you settle)
Just an injection (take some action)

One bitter pill hard to take
And one more each day just to feel the same
Kill the pain
Kill the pain

Any disroder?
No concentration
Too hard to handle?
No hesitation
For your protection
Just an injection
We'll write you a letter
The younger the better

One for your heart
For your head
One for every monster
Under your bed
Kill the pain

Your body is a battleground
And chemicals are scattered round
Your body is a battleground
But don't think you can do without
Your body is an industry
Your pain nothing but gain to me
Your body is an industry
You can't break free
You can't break free
No

Your body is a battleground
And chemicals are scattered round
Your body is a battleground
But don't think you can do without
Your body is an industry
Your pain nothing but gain to me
Your body is an industry
You can't break free
You can't break free
No

Any disorder
For your protection
Spread the addiction
