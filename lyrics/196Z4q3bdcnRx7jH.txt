I was caught in a place
Far away from the light
What I saw, I couldn't face
So I closed my eyes

Wish I could turn back the page
Re-write my point of view
Save all the time you waste (got to get gone, gone)

Don't let it escalate
Don't fight, it's just no use
There's nothing left to say
Got to get gone, gone, gone

Forever is over
And my heart's not gonna break
Forever is over
And I'm no longer afraid

'Cause if I don't get out now
I may never escape
Your power is fading away

And I'm getting closer to the place
I belong

Forever is over
Over, over, over, over, over

I don't want you to tell me you found someone
'Cause I got no distance left to run

Wish I could turn back the page
Re-write my point of view
Save all the time you waste (got to get gone, gone)

Don't let it escalate
Don't fight, it's just no use
There's nothing left to say
Got to get gone, gone, gone

Forever is over
And my heart's not gonna break
Forever is over
And I'm no longer afraid

'Cause if I don't get out now
I may never escape
Your power is fading away

And I'm getting closer to the place
I belong

Forever is over
Over, over, over, over, over

I'm on the other side
And now I realize
I'm in paradise
'Cause you're out my life

Forever is over
And my heart's not gonna break
Forever is over
And I'm no longer afraid

'Cause if I don't get out now
I may never escape
Your power is fading away

And I'm getting closer to the place
I belong

Forever is over
Over, over, over, over, over

Forever is over
