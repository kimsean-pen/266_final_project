Breathe oh breathe now smother me
So clever me, I'm onto you
My oh my, now testify
I'm guilty by my clouds on you

Where you been?
How far'd you get?
I got this sin I saved for you
I don't need your remedy
I wanna be right
Sick of you

Sweet as torture at least we were alive
Cringe and burn, now mark my words and
Save your breath
Save your breath
Save your breath
Cause it's mine
Save your breath
Save your breath
Save your breath
Cause it's mine

Open wide, my crucify
I wanna ride my lungs on you
Nervously, oh jealousy
It's gonna be their debt to you
Bang bang bang
Ain't no time
Bang bang bang
Ain't no time

Sweet as torture at least we were alive
Cringe and burn, now mark my words and
Save your breath
Save your breath
Save your breath
Cause it's mine
Save your breath
Save your breath
Save your breath
Cause it's mine

Bang bang bang
Ain't no time
Bang bang bang
Ain't no time

Sweet as torture now mark my words and
Save your breath
Save your breath
Save your breath
Cause it's mine
Save your breath
Save your breath
Save your breath
Cause it's mine
Save your breath
Save your breath
Save your breath
Cause it's mine
