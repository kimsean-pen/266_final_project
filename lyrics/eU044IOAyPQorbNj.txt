Reveal the plan you have for me.
Now I'm lost, wandering endlessly.
I hear
I hear their cries to me.
Dragging me backwards eternally.
Are you intent on returning me?
To the life I left so violently.
I am fading.
Forever falling from the shadows
I hear you calling.
Always drifting away
To never see the light of day.
Just a memory gone.
Just a memory lost without a cause.
Just a memory gone.
To be turned to an afterlife alone.
Just a memory gone.
Just a memory lost without a cause.
Just a memory gone.
To be turned to an afterlife alone.
I have seen myself not in reflection.
The broken promises that lead to no ascension.
I regret my choice but what could I do?
I thought I did my best to be there for you, cold.
Just a memory gone.
Just a memory lost without a cause.
Just a memory gone.
To be turned to an afterlife alone.
Just a memory gone.
Just a memory lost without a cause.
Just a memory gone.
To be turned to an afterlife alone.
Just a memory gone.
Just a memory lost without a cause.
Just a memory gone.
To be turned to an afterlife alone.
Just a memory gone.
Just a memory lost without a cause.
Just a memory gone.
To be turned to an afterlife alone.
Just a memory gone (just a memory gone).
Just a memory lost (just a memory lost).
Just a memory gone.
To be turned to an afterlife alone.
