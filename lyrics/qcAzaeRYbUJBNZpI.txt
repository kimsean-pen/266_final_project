I've been lately thinking about my life's time
All the things I've done and how it's been
And I can't help believin' in my own mind
I know I'm gonna hate to see it end
I've seen a lot of sunshine, slept out in the rain
Spent a night or two all on my own
I've known my lady's pleasures
Had myself some friends
And spent a time or two in my own home

I have to say it now it's been a good life all in all
It's really fine to have a chance to hang around
And lie there by the fire and watch the evenin' tire
While all friends and my old lady
Sit and pass a pipe around
And talk of poems and prayers and promises
And things that we believe in
How sweet it is to love someone
How right it is to care
How long it's been since yesterday
What about tomorrow
What about our dreams

And all the memories we share

The days they pass so quickly now
The nights are seldom long
And time around me whispers when it's cold
The changes somehow frighten me, still I have to smile
It turns me on to think of growin' old
For though the life's been good to me
There's still so much to do
So many things my mind has never known

I'd like to raise a family, I'd like to sail away
And dance across the mountains on the moon

And I have to say it now it's been a good life all in all
It's really fine to have a chance to hang around
And lie there by the fire and watch the evenin' tire
Along with friends and my old lady
Sit and pass a pipe around
And talk of poems and prayers and promises
And things that we believe in
How sweet it is to love someone
How right it is to care
How long it's been since yesterday
What about tomorrow
What about our dreams
And all the memories we share
