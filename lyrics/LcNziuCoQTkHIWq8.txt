Lying in my bed
I hear the clock tick
And think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new

You say, go slow
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost
You can look
And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall
I will catch you
I'll be waiting
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time

Sometimes
You picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear
Just what you've said

You say, go slow
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost
You can look
And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall
I will catch you
I'll be waiting
Time after time

After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering
If I'm okay

You say, go slow
I fall behind
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost
You can look
And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall
I will catch you
I'll be waiting
If you're lost
You can look
And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall
I will catch you
I'll be waiting
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
