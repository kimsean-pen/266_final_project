It was a malfunction
Nothing short of a disconnection
I got dizzy right before the rapid detachments
I refuse to accept what's really going on
Just once you think that it's alright
It's all wrong

It was a malfunction, it was a malfunction

It was a malfunction
It was hard to grasp it
The truth of you leaving me behind
You never said goodbye

Resurrect my aching cells
Let's restart my aging health

Breath in, blow out
Simply repeat these steps
Breath in, blow out
Simply repeat these steps

Keep me close
Keep me close, that's what you said
But you moved on

It was a malfunction
The truth of you leaving me behind
You never said goodbye
It was a malfunction
It was hard to grasp it
The truth of you leaving me behind
You never said goodbye

Resurrect my aching cells
Let's restart my aging health

Soon the frost will fill my head
No melting or thawing
Constantly just thickens
It's a message, you went a head in
I guess I lost my spine
I guess I fell behind

The cold's just not my friend
It's a message, it's a message
The frost will fill my head
It's a message, it's a message
It's a message, it's a message
It is a message
