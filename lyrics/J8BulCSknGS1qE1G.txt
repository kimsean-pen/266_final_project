Don't be so scared
We will not lead
You on like you've been doing for weeks
So you're selfish
And I'm sorry
When I'm gone you'll be going nowhere fast
Nowhere fast

Would you believe me if I said I didn't need you
'Cause I wouldn't believe you if you said the same to me and
Near death
Last breath
And barely hanging on
Would you believe me if I said I didn't need you

Don't be so scared to take a second for reflection
To take a leave of absence
See what you're made of
So I'm selfish and you're sorry
When I'm gone you'll be going nowhere fast
So who's selfish
And who's sorry

Would you believe me if I said I didn't need you
'Cause I wouldn't believe you if you said the same to me and
Near death
Last breath
And barely hanging on
Would you believe me if I said I didn't need you

Someone
Somewhere said some things
That may have sparked some sympathy
But don't believe
Don't believe a word you've heard about me

Don't be so scared
It's harder for me
Don't be so scared
Don't be so scared
It's harder for me
Don't be so scared
It's harder for me
Don't be so scared
It's harder for me
Don't be so scared

Would you believe me if I said I didn't need you?
'Cause I wouldn't believe you if you said the same to me, and
Near death
Last breath
And barely hanging on
Would you believe me if I said I didn't need you

Someone
Somewhere said some things
That may have sparked some sympathy
But don't believe
Don't believe a word you've heard

Would you believe me if I said I didn't need you?
'Cause I wouldn't believe you
Wouldn't believe you now
Would you believe me if I said I didn't need you?
'Cause I wouldn't believe you
Wouldn't believe you now
