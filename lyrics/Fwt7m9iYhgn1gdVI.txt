"She looks so pale
Within her misty veil
She scales the sky
From east to west
And takes no rest "

Before the coming
Of the night
The moon shows papery white
Before the dawning
Of the day
She fades away

Take my life
'till the end of our time
Take my hands
'till the sun begins to shine

Before she sleeps
She dances the moonlight waltz
She climbs the sky
From side to side
She embraces the rising tide

Before the coming
Of the night
The moon shows papery white
Before the dawning
Of the day
She fades away
