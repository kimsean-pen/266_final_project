You hiss and groan
and you constantly moan
but you don't ever go away.
That's because all you need is me.

You roll your eyes
up to the skies
mock horrified
but you're still here
cos all you need is me

There's so much destruction
all over the world,
and all you can do is complain about me.

You bang your head against the wall
and say you're sick of it all
yet, you remain here
because all you need is me

and then you offer your
one and only joke
and ask me
"what will I be, when I grow up to be a man"?

NOTHING

There's a soft voice
singing in your head
Who could this be?
I do believe it's me

There's a naked man standing
laughing in your dreams.
You know who it is,
but you don't like what it means.

There's so much destruction
all over the world
and all you can do is complain about me.

I was a small fat child
in a council house
there was only one thing
I ever dreamed about
fate has just handed it to me

AT LAST

You don't like me but you love me;
either way you're wrong.
You're gonna miss me when i'm gone,
you're gonna miss me when i'm gone

You don't like me but you love me;
either way you're wrong.
You're gonna miss me when i'm gone,
you're gonna miss me when i'm gone
