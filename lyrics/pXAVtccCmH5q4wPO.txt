Stranger
Danger

I can tell by the whites of your eyes
Up to no good, and telling white lies
Yeah, you sit in front of me
With your back to the wall
Got nothing to say
I don't know you at all

Stranger
Yeah you're faded and rotten
Danger
Yeah you're something forgotten

Junkies climbing up the wall
Junkies climbing up the wall
Junkies climbing up the wall
Junkies climbing up the wall

Stranger
I can tell by the whites of your eyes
Danger
Up to no good, and telling white lies
Yeah, I don't like this weather, because it's way too cold
Palms are clenched tight with nothing to hold
Stranger
Yeah you're faded and rotten
Danger
Oh god you're something forgotten

Junkies climbing up the wall
Junkies climbing up the wall
Junkies climbing up the wall
Junkies climbing up the wall

Stranger, danger
What do you see
Stranger, danger
Looking at me
(Stranger, danger
What do you see)
God, you're faded and rotten
(Stranger, danger
Looking at me)
Yeah you're faded and rotten
Oh god you're something forgotten
