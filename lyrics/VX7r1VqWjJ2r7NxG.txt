Forged in the black country under blood red skies
We all had our dream to realize
Driving in that transit down to Holy Joe's
Used to lose our head while metal flowed

Nothing held us back or dared to try
Something in our blood won't let us die
We built our world of metal watched it grow
Fueled the fury solid to the bone

Gotta deal with the devil 'cause you know that it's real
Done a deal with the devil from a heart made of steel

Rollin' down the m-way took it to the smoke
Bangin' heads there 'til we all went broke
When we don the leather, and the whips and chains
Nothing matters more we can't be tamed

Fighting through the din and accolades
Turn the phase around with razor blades
Watched the movement grow into one voice
Took on all the world it had no choice

Gotta deal with the devil 'cause you know that it's real
Done a deal with the devil from a heart made of steel

We hit at night you're in our sight
Then we can feel what we've been waiting for
Let me hear you roar
Upon this stage we let it rage
And for a time we leave the world behind
To be with our own kind

Gotta deal with the devil 'cause you know that it's real
Done a deal with the devil from a heart made of steel
Gotta deal with the devil 'cause you know that it's real
Done a deal with the devil from a heart made of steel
Steel

Gotta deal with the devil
