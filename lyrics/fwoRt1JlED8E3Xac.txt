If I fell
Down a big hole
Would you tell
How do you know
It's a deepening well
Like the big o

I know, I know
It's a bad scene to be whole
It's a bad dream I hope
Marie Marie
To feel, to feel
They're following me
Marie Marie

If I painted a tear

It's a bad dream I hope
Marie Marie
To feel, to feel
They're following me
Marie Marie
To feel

Pull back from the front
There's a bigger gap than you thought
A bigger trap in which to be caught

I've got to get away from the bricks
All these straight lines are making me sick
