Mikado Hotel across the street isn't cheap
But he only stayed one night, to be caught
People want a lot
We were loved from afar
Everyone kept in the dark
I rub my eyes and look around
You can hardly tell at all
Estimated what they'd edit out
Maybe nothing there at all

Does anything really change?
Behind words in defense
I rub my eyes and look around
You can hardly tell at all
Estimated what they'd edit out
Maybe nothing there at all
Maybe nothing there at all

I rub my eyes and look around
You can hardly tell at all
Estimated what they'd edit out
Maybe nothing there at all
Maybe nothing there at all
