Standing on the edge of reason
Not quite sure what's right
I am caught between your sense of humour
And your real life

They all say I'm not okay
Such a shame, never felt so good
They all think I'm someone else
Not myself (not myself)
But the feeling's good
The feeling's good
The feeling

I stayed up to hear the breathing
Eyes adjusting to the light
But there's monsters underneath my bed
I can't see them but I still feel scared

They all say I'm not okay
Such a shame, never felt so good
They all think I'm someone else
Not myself (not myself)
But the feeling's good
The feeling's good
The feeling's good
The feeling

But the feeling's good
But the feeling's good
But the feeling's good
But the feeling's
But the feeling's good
But the feeling's good
But the feeling's good
But the feeling's

They all say I'm not okay
Such a shame, never felt so good
They all think I'm someone else
Not myself (not myself)
But the feeling's good
But the feeling's good
The feeling's good
The feeling's
