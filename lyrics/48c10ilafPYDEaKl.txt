You're my number one
You're the one I want
And you've turned down
Every hand that has beckoned me to come

You're my number one
You're the one I want
And I've turned down every hand
That has beckoned me to come

'Cause you're the one I got
You're the one I got
So I'll keep turning down the hands
That beckon me to come

Though I'm a geyser
Feel it bubbling from below
Hear it call, hear it call
Hear it call to me
Constantly

And hear the harmony
Only when it's harming me
It's not real, it's not real
It's not real enough

But I will be the one you need
The way I can't be without you
I will be the one you need
I just can't be without you
