Got to give up life in this netherworld
Got to go up to where the air is stale
And live a life of pleasantries
Mingle in the modern families

Overground--from abnormality
Overboard--for identity
Overground--for normality
Overboard--for identity

This limbo is no place
To be a digit in another space
In another crowd
I'm nameless bound

Overground--from abnormality
Overboard--for identity
Overground--for normality
Overboard--for identity
