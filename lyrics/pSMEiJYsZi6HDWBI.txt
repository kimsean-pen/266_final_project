Waste of our time
Working our ass off
But no one really cares,
Pouring down blood and sweat,
They just stand with endless stares.
No fucking clue, baffled all around
Get the fuck out
If you are annoyed
By so called noise pollution,
We have no clue,
Why are you stuill doing here?
Secluded in a pathetic spot,
Covering your ears,
Unwanted trash,
Why are you still doing here?
Fuckoff, what a waste of time.
