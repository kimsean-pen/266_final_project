I want
Your throat
And your collar
To see it from my eyes
Oh no
I go
I beg to see the light
In your
Superstitions
I wanna tell you now
Oh no
I go
I beg to see you here

I want
Your throat
And your collar
To see it from my eyes
Oh no
I go
I beg to see the light
In your
Complication
I wanna tell you now
Oh no
I go
I beg to see you here
