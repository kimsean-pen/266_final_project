Never thought you be the kind the guy to get a day job
Nine to five
You're gonna take off
Your gonna go against the grain

Never thought you be the kind the guy to take a safe route
By and by
Your gonna break out
The world's gonna know your name

So why you're sitting around
Did you think it'll be easy
I tell you if it was so easy
Then everybody do it too

You say you haven't got the kind of time to take a beach day
Cause your to busy every weekday
To ever get up off your chair

You say you haven't got the kind of time to get a girlfriend
Cause your too busy every weekend
You haven't got a second to spare

So why you're sitting around
Did you think it'll be easy
I tell you if it was so easy
That everybody do it too

You say you gonna leave the hard knock life behind
You're gonna hit your little wagon up to a start
Or would you say your gonna take the road less traveled by
No, well you don't seem to be traveling very far

Never thought you be the kind the guy to get a day job
Nine to five
You're gonna take off
Your gonna go against the grain

So why you're sitting around
Did you think it'll be easy
I tell you if it was easy
Then everybody do it too

You say your chasing a dream
Well, you better get moving
Every second you waste
And what you're trying to chase
Gets away from you
