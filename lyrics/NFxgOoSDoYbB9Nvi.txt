I cannot complain today
Because I belong to you
And I cannot look the other way
Because I love you

And I try to get deep in my cold heart
There's a voice that screams loud
And it's screaming

Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me

Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me

Kiss me again
Kiss me again
Kiss me again
Kiss me again

Kiss me again
Kiss me again
Kiss me again
Kiss me again

Please believe in us
Let me sink in deep
Like a shadow
Let me get a chance

And it's not hard to have dreams
But deep in my stomach
There's a voice that screams loud
And it's screaming

Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me

Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me

Kiss me again
Kiss me again
Kiss me again
Kiss me again

Kiss me again
Kiss me again
Kiss me again
Kiss me again

I never want to go
I wanna stay right here
I wanna, I wanna
I wanna, I wanna

Kiss me again
Kiss me again
Kiss me again
Kiss me again

Kiss me again
Kiss me again
Kiss me again
Kiss me again
