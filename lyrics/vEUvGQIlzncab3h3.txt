I can't forget the faces
I can't forget the sounds
I can't forget, can't get the fever down
I guess imagination
It makes it come around
Whenever lightning strikes
And thunder sounds

We shared nothing
But storm, but wind
One rainswept moment
Stuck within

Day by day
I walk the distance alone
Walk the distance alone
Day by day
I fight the fever alone
Fight the fever alone

I can't forget the shaking
Your hands over my own
Both hot with fever
To our very bones
I do regret the feeling
That we will never know
What might have happened
Had we not let go

Day by day
I walk the distance alone
Walk the distance alone
Day by day
I fight the fever alone
Fight the fever alone

I can't forget the faces
I can't forget the sounds

Day by day
I walk the distance alone
Walk the distance alone
Day by day
I fight the fever alone
Fight the fever alone

Day by day
I walk the distance alone
Walk the distance alone
Day by day
I fight the fever alone
Fight the fever alone
