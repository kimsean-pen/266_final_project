Smoke and mirrors and everything nice
I wasn't married to the weekend, I was banging on the back end
Kamazaki and Miami Vice
She shook a few of my favorite things

Like cloak and daggers, I see very clear
I couldn't keep it all together, I was spookin' in the end zone
Arigato, go-go gadget arms
She only took me for 10,000 yen

It's like a bad dream, something from the back of a magazine
Black and white and cheaply put together like a slasher film
I'm torn in opposite directions
The plot sucks but the killings are gorgeous
god damn these killings are gorgeous

Darkened corners at every bend
I wasn't sucking down the poison, I was working on the QT
Shaky, shaky all over the world
She tried to cartwheel at every turn

The creepy crawlies, a case of revenge
I had the martyrs that I bartered from the barons for the bandoleers
Karaoke, a feminine flaw
I had a feeling this was not the end

It's like a bad dream, something from the back of a magazine
Black and white and cheaply put together like a slasher film
I'm torn in opposite directions
The plot sucks but the killings are gorgeous

A walking nightmare, covering the tracks that had brought you there
Paranoid, frozen in the heathers like a like a slasher film
I'm torn in opposite directions
The plot sucks but the killings are gorgeous

Cave in, cave out, nothing but nervous doubt
Waiting for the big bang to get me
Cave in, cave out, nothing but nervous doubt
Waiting for the big bang to get me, waiting for the big bang

Wrapped in plastic, we all get the ends
She had to take it to the majors, couldn't keep it on the down low
Silly rabbit, good dream tambien
Another stiff at the scene of the crime

It's like a bad dream, something from the back of a magazine
Black and white and cheaply put together like a slasher film
I'm torn in opposite directions
The plot sucks but the killings are gorgeous

A walking nightmare, covering the tracks that had brought you there
Paranoid and frozen in the heathers like a slasher film
I'm torn in opposite directions
The plot sucks but the killings are gorgeous
God damn these killings are gorgeous
