To the gods of the north I pray
And raise my cup for the fallen ones
Then I cry
In Valhalla they'll sing

Rain, red blood keeps pouring down
Come Valkyries, join me on that final ride
Here I lie bleeding
Odin, I await thee
The battle rages on

New lines they're weaving
The future, the past and the present they're one
They will reveal their mask
To show me the way to survive this bitter war

Soon it will be over
He will be the one
We'll weave in
And terror will now rule these lands

When the battle is lost
And the slain ones are chosen
Valkyries will guide us home
When the battle is lost
And the slain ones are chosen
Valkyries will guide us home

Destiny
A spinning wheel, the path of glory round and round
Come join us on your final ride to Asgard
Let's move on fast
All father awaits so let's heed the final call
For now we leave this world behind
It's over
All glory to the brave

Still blood will rain
Through storm and fire
Let war winds reign
It's the feast for the crows

Follow the light, the light
Just follow the light, the light
Or fade away

Soon it will be over
He will be the one
We'll weave in
And terror will now rule these lands

When the battle is lost
And the slain ones are chosen
Valkyries will guide us home
When the battle is lost
And the slain ones are chosen
Valkyries will guide us home

We'll keep on weaving
We're crushing through lines with our battering swords
We're marching on
Assign the brave to survive this bitter war

Soon it will be over
He will be the one
We'll weave in
And terror will now rule these lands

When the battle is lost
And the slain ones are chosen
Valkyries will guide us home
When the battle is lost
And the slain ones are chosen
The Valkyries will guide us home
We'll heed the final call
A call to arms
The Valkyries will guide us home

Then finally I hear them say
Carry on
For Valhalla awaits you
