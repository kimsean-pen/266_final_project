Now that I have captured your attention
I wanna steal ya for a rhythm intervention
Mr. TSA, I'm ready for inspection
Sh-sh-show me how you make a first impression

Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow
Break it down and drop it low, low
‘Cause I just wanna
Party all night in the neon lights ‘til you can't let me go

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long, baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end, hit rewind
All night long, baby, slow down the song
Slow, slow
Yeah, baby, slow down the song
Slow, slow
Yeah, baby, slow down the song

If you want me I'm accepting applications
So long as we can keep this record on rotation
You know I'm good with mouth to mouth resuscitation
Br-br-breathe me in, breathe me out, so amazing

Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow
Break it down and drop it low, low
‘Cause I just wanna
Party all night in the neon lights ‘til you can't let me go

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long, baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end, hit rewind
All night long, baby, slow down the song
Slow, slow
Yeah, baby, slow down the song
Slow, slow
Yeah, baby, slow down the song

Breathe me in, breathe me out
The music's got me goin'
Breathe me in, breathe me out
No stoppin' 'til the morning
Breathe me in, breathe me out
You know I'm ready for it
For it, for it, yeah

Breathe me in, breathe me out
The music's got me goin'
Breathe me in, breathe me out
No stoppin' 'til the morning
Breathe me in, breathe me out
You know I'm ready for it
For it, for it, yeah

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long, baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end, hit rewind
All night long, baby, slow down the song
Slow, slow
Yeah, baby, slow down the song
Slow, slow
Yeah, baby, slow down the song
