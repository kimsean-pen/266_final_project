there's a sign in the rain
every now and again
it is a symbol of hope
in the midst of a catastrophic episode

in the hour of death
there's a spiritual wealth
when we dance through the rain
and form the signs once again
if even for a second

i hear a voice on the air
it has a warning to share
"don't believe what you see"
"you can't perceive what you feel"

but if i do what i'm told
and shun the spirit i hold
i'm not longer a human
and i will not shift whith the sands
the end of era
one starts anew
you know the devil
he live in you
he live in you
he live in you
