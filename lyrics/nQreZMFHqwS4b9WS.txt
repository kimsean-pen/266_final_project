Do you what you're told,
Don't think about it,
Life is dangerous outside these walls,
So tell me how,
We're supposed to make it,
When they make our dreams appear so small.

We could fail, we could fall, we could flatline,
Bet it all, roll the dice, it could backfire.
Hide the key, play it safe, till it's over,
Do or die, fight or flight,
So take the leap!

Cause you never know,
Yeah you never know,
If you never ante up and let it roll,
Ah-oh Ah-oh!
Cause you never know,
Yeah you never know,
If you never take a shot and lose control,
Let's risk it all.

So picture this,
A new beginning,
Where the canvas clears a brand new path,
So make a mess,
And go get in trouble,
And make a toast to those who never left.

We could fail, we could fall, we could flatline,
Bet it all, roll the dice, it could backfire.
Hide the key, play it safe, till it's over,
Do or die...
Don't make me say it again.

Cause you never know,
Yeah you never know,
If you never ante up and let it roll,
Ah-oh Ah-oh!
Cause you never know,
Yeah you never know,
If you never take a shot and lose control,
Let's risk it all.

For the ones who doubted, thanks for nothing,
Gonna show you that we're made of something,
No you can't escape the fight we're bringing,
Cause when you knock us down we're coming for you.

Cause you never know,
Yeah you never know,
If you never ante up and let it roll,
Ah-oh Ah-oh!
Cause you never know,
Yeah you never know,
If you never take a shot and lose control,
Let's risk it all.
