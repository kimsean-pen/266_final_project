All these broken pieces left unglued
Should never find their way
Into the hands of someone like you

I'm in the dark
I'm alone around you
I've never been here before
Nobody here to get me through
Oh I'm in the dark

Every minute shared is never mine
Frozen in this fog and hiding
Every second in time

I'm in the dark
I'm alone around you
I've never been here before
Nobody here to get me through

Oh I'm losing my faith in every way
That points to you
Oh I'm in the dark
I'm alone around you
Oh I'm in the dark

The more bleak the day
The less I behave as if
Everything black can wash away
Or can I just trade a dream for a way
To peel back the shade behind the gray

I'm in the dark
I'm alone around you
I've never been here before
Nobody here to get me through

Oh I'm in the dark
