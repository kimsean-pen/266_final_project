Blood dripping off my braids
Persuade them with the blade
Bitch I call a spade a spade
There ain't no need for throwing shade
You know I keep that contraband
$uicide in high demand
Keep a hand full of them xans and a fully loaded mag
After life pimpin' got them rims on a casket
Bitches on my mattress
Fuck 'em all backwards
Walking corpse stalking courts
Show 'em no remorse
Corner store sippin' fours
Fresh up off a tour
Bitch

Tulip flower petals shower me in slow
motion while I'm blowing on some sour D
Fuck an idol
No one towers over me
Hopefully openly talking bout all of my emotions
Ocean deep
Sink into the bottom
Opening up all my fucking problems
Bitch I promise I'll become forgotten/rotten
Fucking spotted on the concrete
6 times 3
If I was a key on the board I'd probably be delete or escape
Either way you're pressing me ho
