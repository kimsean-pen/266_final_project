There's always something in the way
There's always something getting through
But it's not me
It's You
It's You

Sometimes ignorance rings true
But hope is not in what i know
It's not in me.me
It's in You
It's in You

It's all I know
It's all I know
It's all I know

I find peace when I'm confused
I find hope when I'm let down
Not in me ... me
In You
It's in you

I hope to lose myself for good
I hope to find it in the end
Not in me ... me
In You
In You
In You

It's all I know
It's all I know
It's all I know

In You
In You
It's in You
It's in You

There's always something in the way
There's always something getting through
But it's not me
It's You
It's You
It's You
It's You
It's You
It's You
It's You
It's You
It's You
It's You
