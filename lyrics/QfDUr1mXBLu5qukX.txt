well I'm here
and summer is gone I hear
so pray for me
as I now leave your town
when did I say this
I will never leave
I can't recall this
moment in my life

you would never sleep at night
if you knew what I've been through
and this thought is all I have
to trust upon when light is gone

my problem was
that you kept me here too long
and today is when
we'll regret that I came by
when did I say this
I will never leave
I can't recall this
moment in my life
you would never sleep at night
if you knew what I've been through
and this thought is all I have
to trust upon when light is gone
you would never sleep at night
if you knew what I've been through
and this thought is all I have
to trust upon when light is gone

life is full of darkness
and murderers come my way
someday you will join them
and I will let you in
