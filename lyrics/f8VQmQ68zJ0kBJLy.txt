Though I'm missing you
(Although I'm missing you)
I'll find a way to get through
(I'll find a way to get through)
Living without you
'Cause you were my sister, my strength and my pride
Only God may know why, still I will get by

Who would have known that you had to go
But so suddenly, so fast
And how could it be, all the sweet memories
Would be all, all that we'd have left

Now that you're gone, everyday I go on
(I go on)
But life's just not the same
(Life's just not the same, baby)
I'm so empty inside and my tears I can't hide
But I'll try, I'll try to face the pain

Though I'm missing you
(Although I'm missing you)
I'll find a way to get through
(I'll find a way to get through)
Living without you
'Cause you were my sister, my strength and my pride
Only God may know why, still I will get by

Oh, there were so many things
That we could have shared
(uh-huh)
If time was on our side, ooh yeah
(Time was on our side)
Now that you're gone, I can still feel you near
So I'll smile with every tear I cry

Though I'm missing you
(Although I'm missing you)
I'll find a way to get through
(I'll find a way to get through)
Living without you
'Cause you were my sister, my strength and my pride
Only God may know why, still I will get by

How sweet were the closest of friends
But I'll wait for the day when I'll see you again
I'll see you again

Though I'm missing you
(Although I'm missing you)
I'll find a way to get through
(I'll find a way to get through)
Living without you
'Cause you were my sister, my strength and my pride
Only God may know why, still I will get by

Though I'm missing you
(Although I'm missing you)
I'll find a way to get through
(I'll find a way to get through)
Living without you
'Cause you were my sister, my strength and my pride
Only God may know why, still I will get by

I'm missing you
