This catacomb compels me
Corroding and inert
It waits and tries to pull me
Must I resist or re-assert?

The unchanged and the unchangeable
Doing the zombierama
Singing, "Oh come and be like me
We're all sisters and brothers"

Ejected to this state of being
Don't bury me with this
I'm in a state of catalepsy
Can I really exist?

Clawing from the inside
Drowning in your chant, chant
Thoughts come flooding through me
Despairing unity

The unchanged and the unchangeable
Doing the zombierama
Singing, "Oh come and be like me
We're all sisters and brothers"

Red and white carnations
Can't intoxicate my brain, brain
This blissful suffocation
It is driving me to pain, pain
Oh what a bloody shame, shame

The unchanged and the unchangeable
Doing the zombierama
Singing, "Oh come and be like me
We're all sisters and brothers"

I'm not your sister or your brother
Don't bury me with this, this
I'm not your sister or your brother
Don't bury me with this, this

Join hands, join hands
We're all sisters and brothers
Sisters and brothers
Sisters and brothers
Sisters and brothers

I can't relate to you
You're no relation of mine, mine
