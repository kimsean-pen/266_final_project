I've seen people holding on to nothing
Broken dreams and broken cords
Running on empty, losing sleep, oh
It's true I've earned these cracks upon my feet

Walk away from all that you know
Walk away and hold your own
Walk away and hold your own

And I've seen people holding on to something
Smiling with no place to call home
In you I see something so familiar, uh
My dear friend, so nice to have you home

And this all seems unreal
Just how far we've come
Look into the mirror
Not sure who I was

Walk away from all that you know
Walk away and hold your own
Walk away from all that you know
Walk away and hold your own

When you bow your head and wonder
Tell me now, will it all become real
Fill me in as I sometimes sit and wonder
Wonder how you may ever find your feet

Walk away
I've seen you holding on to nothing
Walk away
I've seen you holding on to something
Walk away from all that you know
I've seen you holding on to nothing
Walk away and hold your own
I've seen you holding on to something
Walk away and hold your own
And I've seen people holding on to something
