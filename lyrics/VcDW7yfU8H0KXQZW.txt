I won't just survive
Oh, you will see me thrive
Can't write my story
I'm beyond the archetype
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
'Cause my roots, they run deep
Oh Oh Oh
Oh ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it
Don't doubt it
Victory is in my veins
I know it
I know it
And I will not negotiate
I'll fight it
I'll fight it
I will transform
I will transform
(When) When the fire's
At my feet again
And the vultures, all start circling, circling
They're whispering, whispering
You're out of time
But still I rise
This is no mistake
No accident
When you think the final
Nail is in
Nail is in
Think again
Think again
Don't be suprised
I will still rise
I must stay conscious
Through the madness and chaos
So I call on my angels
They say...
Oh ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it
Don't doubt it
Victory is in your veins
You know it
You know it
And you will not negotiate
Just fight it
Just fight it
And be transformed
And be transformed
'Cause when, when the fire's
At my feet again
And the vultures all start circling, circling
They're whispering, whispering
You're out of time
But still I rise
This is no mistake
No accident
When you think the final
Nail is in
Nail is in
Think again
Think again
Don't be suprised
I will still rise
Don't doubt it
Don't doubt it
Oh Oh Oh
You know it
You know it
Oh Oh Oh
Just fight it
Just fight it
Oh Oh Oh
Don't be suprised
I will still rise
