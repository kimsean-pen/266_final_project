Your mum thinks you're sad
That you're living alone,
And your friends think if you're sad
You should call them more.
But the truth is
That you never needed someone to comfort you
Oh you've never needed someone to comfort you.

But you're no god, you're no god.
And you will never leave this place,
And you will always feel alone,
And you will never feel quite clean
In this new skin that you have grown
Until your old and broken bones
Are laid into their resting place
Just like the rest of human race.

Til I fall into my place,
Just like the rest of human race,
Til I'm laid into my final resting place,
Just like the rest of human race who've done it,
Without complaining all the way.

But you're no god, you're no god.
As long as you promise
That you will never leave
I need only worry about
You and me.

We will never leave this place,
We need never feel alone,
We will learn to feel quite clean
In this new skin that we have grown
Because our young and healthy bones
Would never lead us astray.

We will learn to feel quite clean, in this new skin that we have
We will learn to feel quite clean, in this new skin that we have
We will learn to feel quite clean, in this new skin that we have grown
Because our young and healthy bones
Would never lead us astray.
