Breathing in all my fears
Integrating my tears
Let me be what I am
I am all, I am None
Alone
In the eye of the storm
Silent rest at the core
Breathing through all my dirt
All my pain and my hurt
Alone
Falling through the mirrors of my mind
That have held me Safe and blind
Falling free, I can't see the end
Just let the air now caress my skin
In the distance dreams dissolve
Every crutch that I hold
Falling through, burning up
I unveil and give Up
Alone
See the pieces of my life
Scattering far and wide
Broken open by my heart
My beliefs torn apart
I rise
I am here to be undone
My illusions, let me go
I am here to be undone
My illusions, let me go
