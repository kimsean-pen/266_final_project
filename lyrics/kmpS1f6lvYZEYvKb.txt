Carry my soul into the night.
May the stars guide my way.
I glory in the sight,
As darkness takes the day.

Ferte in noctem anima meam
Illustre stellae via meam.
Aspectu illo glorior
Dum capit nox diem.

Cantate vitae canticum
Sine dolore actae

Dicite eis quos amabam
Me numquam obliturum

Sing a song, a song of life
Made without regret
Tell the ones, the ones I loved
I never will forget
Never will forget.
