Silence is golden, but damn, how it rings on me
I'm flying low enough, everything's clear to see
It rings and it rings and it sounds like my enemy
I'm tasting the dirt in my mouth that I like to feel

Let me go
Was amazing but it's the last scene of the show
(Let me go, let me go, help me please)

How hard can it be to leave what's killing you
With distance it seems as if everything could be good (oh, no no no)
And it rings, yeah, it rings
Don't forget there is a beast
Keep biting and hating and soon you'll be free

Let me go
Was amazing but it's the last scene of the show
Don't be afraid, it's not that bad
I know that you do want me back
Gotta let me go

Escaping through the light
'Cause this place can't be right
You're wonderful, you don't deserve to cry no more
Don't mind if I break
It's a mess that I've made
You need to move on
Let me go

Let me go (let me go, let me go, hey)
Was amazing but it's the last scene of the show
Don't be afraid, it's not that bad
I know that you do want me back
Gotta let me go

(Let me go, let me go, hey)
(Let me go, let me go, hey)
(Let me go, let me go, hey)
(Let me go, let me go, hey)

No, don't be afraid, it's not that bad (let me go, let me go, hey)
I know that you do want me back (let me go, let me go, hey)
Let me go (let me go, let me go, hey)
(Let me go, let me go, hey)

(Let me go, let me go, hey)
(Let me go, let me go, hey)
(Let me go, let me go, hey)
