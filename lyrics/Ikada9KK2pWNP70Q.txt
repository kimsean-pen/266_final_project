All that I have is all that you've given me
Did you never worry that I'd come to depend on you
I gave you all the love I had in me
Now I find you lied and I can't believe it's true

You better stop (Stop)
Before you tear me apart
You better stop (Stop)
Before you go on and break my heart
You, you better stop

Time after time, I tried to walk away
But it's not that easy, when your soul is torn in two
So I just resigned myself to it everyday, yeah
And now all I can do is to leave it up to you

You better stop (Stop)
Before you tear me apart
You better stop (Stop)
Before you go on and break my heart, yeah

You better stop
If you love me, now the time to be sorry
I won't believe that you'd walk out on me, baby

You'd better stop (Stop)
Before you tear me apart
You better stop (Stop)
Before you go on and break my heart

You'd better stop (You'd better), stop (You'd better)
You'd better stop (You'd better), stop (You'd better)
You'd better stop (You'd better), stop (You'd better)
