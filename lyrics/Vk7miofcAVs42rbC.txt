Today I found the strength
to open my eyes and leave it all behind
So open your mind and realize that your beautiful world
could take my life
I'm sinking under, drowning faster, please just let me breath
The air is leaving and I'm lost in need of you again
You break me down and you make me surrender
We are as Romeo and Juliet.
So many years have passed the day since we fell in love
And promised we would never separate
but it seems the time has come
that you run my life
with no hope to find and no time to hide
I'm sinking under, drowning faster, please just let me breath
The air is leaving and I'm lost in need of you again
You break me down and you make me surrender
we are as Romeo and Juliet
To a code we all swore, to a life we have chosen
we are but soldiers to a common war
we fight and for this
passion of love we may fail and die
I'm slipping further, you're falling faster
your growing stronger as I grow weaker and I know...

I'm sinking under, drowning faster, please just let me breath
The air is leaving and I'm lost in need of you again
You break me down and you make me surrender
we are as Romeo and Juliet
Behind sad eyes, accept goodbyes
Will we fall back again?
And die as Romeo and Juliet
