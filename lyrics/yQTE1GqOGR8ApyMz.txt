Bite my tongue, you wouldn't hear me anyway
Hold my nerve, while I wait for the fires to fade

I'm seeing every single word you don't say
But I feel like I've seen it all

How come every time you ask me to stay
You're halfway gone?

If this is the easy way out, then why am I finding it hard as hell?
I'm wide awake, waiting for sleep to steal my doubts
And everything we had rehearsed, has come back to haunt us but ten times worse

I'm holding on, so tight it hurts
So why are we holding on?

Close my eyes
Am I slowly slipping away?
If I bide my time,
I'll get lost like a tear in the rain

How come every time you ask me to stay, you're halfway gone?

If this is the easy way out, then why am I finding it hard as hell?
I'm wide awake, waiting for sleep to steal my doubts

Everything we had rehearsed, has come back to haunt us but ten times worse
I'm holding on so tight, it hurts

So why are we holding on?
Why are we holding on?
Why are we holding on?
Why are we holding on?
Why are we holding on?

If this is the easy way out, then why am I finding it hard as hell?
I'm wide awake, waiting for sleep to steal my doubts

Everything we had rehearsed, has come back to haunt us but ten times worse
I'm holding on so tight it hurts, but I can't let you go
