Day dreams of summer trees, and your hair in the breeze.
Witness the life in the tall grass, let's do this more often.
The ground shakes, as I awake, under rocks on the sea floor where our house laid.
Where just a few days ago I made you breakfast in bed.
But the house caved into the ground when the ocean swallowed it down to the bottom.
The tank's running out of oxygen.
I have been rendered to shark feed.
No help in sight, but sharp teeth and an appetite.
I see their eyes surround me.
Stayed at home for way too long.
Now I'm destined for the deep blue sea.
No help in sight.
Big appetites.
I'll be fine for one more night.
Wait until the coast is clear, you can float your way to the surface.
Keep a wary eye concentrated on the distance or you'll end your days counting hours in the bottom of the sea.
Wait until the coast is clear, you can float your way to surface where you'll end your days with purpose.
Keep a wary eye concentrated on the distance, you'll be on you're way out.
