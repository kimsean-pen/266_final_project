Chill, chill, chill
Chill, chill, chill
Chill, chill, chill

Traces, many faces
Lost in the maze of time
Blinded by the darkness
That's the start of the seven lives

Chill, chill, chill
Chill, chill, chill
Chill, chill, chill

It's too close, but still too far
Follow your inner guide
Show us who you are, are, are
In these seven lives

Chill, chill, chill
Chill, chill, chill
Chill, chill, chill

Take it easy
Take it easy, take it easy
Follow your inner guide
Show me who you are
In these seven lives

It's too close, but still too far
Show me who you are
In these seven lives
Close but still too far
Show me who you are
In these seven lives
