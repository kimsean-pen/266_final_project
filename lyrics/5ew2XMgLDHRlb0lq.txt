I really don't want to look stupid when I'm sleeping
I never really liked sunny days
The black wings just reach out to me over the distance
I can feel the wind from the wings
I see the clouds and I feel the ocean with my feet
I know I'm home
It requires an ablity to judge distance
The aeroplane flies high
Turns left, looks right

Love is a sentimental heart
Life is a sentimental way
Spy the fragile heart so cursed
As he walks across this earth

I'm disconnected by your smile
Disconnect a million miles
And what you promised me
I hope will set you free
I'm disconnected by your smile

If I knew where I was going I would already be there
Ha-ha-ha I don't know
For sure I'm going to her
Judicial, beautiful, ahh ormentive whatever
I've always been afraid to die but I think I'm more afraid to live

And all I gave to you is lust
And all you took from me is lust
Black wings carry me so high
Up to meet you in the sky

I'm disconnected by your smile
Disconnect a million miles
And what you promised me
I hope will set you free
I'm disconnected by your smile

Wishing you were real to me
Wishing i could make believe
I'll take my secrets to the grave
Safely held beneath the waves
Always knew I couldn't save
Always knew I couldn't save you

And in my heart I know you there
And in my heart I know you care
And in my heart I know you gone
