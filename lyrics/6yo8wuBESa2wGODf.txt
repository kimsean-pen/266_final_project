Black, red, orange, yellow, green, blue
Purple, violet, pink, white, gray, silver

Between her dreams and oxygen
The end is all she ever asked
Engines warm, it's dark outside
A hidden tear behind her mask

Black walls closing in again
Losing sleep and lost in time
She'll close her eyes and unlock mine
She turns water into wine

And she says she's no substitute
And she's always dropping blue
And they say there's no reward for you
But all their lies end on a Monday

Black walls closing in again
Losing sleep and lost in time
She'll close her eyes and unlock mine
She turns water into wine

And she says she's no substitute
And she's always dropping blue
And they say there's no reward for you
But all their lies end on a monday

They'll drink theirs
I'll drink mine
They'll drink theirs
I'll drink mine
They'll drink theirs
I'll drink mine
They'll drink theirs
I'll drink mine
Raining pain from black walls
She fills up the glass again

She turns water into wine
She turns water into wine
She turns water into wine
She turns water into wine
