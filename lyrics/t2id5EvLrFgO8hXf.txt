I was alright
Till they took me off my medication
Started slagging off my generation
And I don't know why

Well, this is a story not long ago
When the world got divided by what we vote
We're not so far from World War 3
I think most the people here might be crazy
So fresh, the Prince of Polluted Air
Do you ever feel like your life just isn't fair?
Well, I am so poor, I can't even pay attention
From the bottom of my heart, can't get no redemption

I was alright
Till they took me off my medication
Started slagging off my generation
And I don't know why
And now all night
Sitting talking 'bout a revolution
C-c-coughing up the p-pollution
And I can't breathe right
And I can't breathe right

Everyday
Standing in the rain with a blank expression
I guess this is a lesson in lessons, I see they're paying attention
Sixteen and you don't know what to be
Spend nights out on the street with friends and just get beat
Well, I guess the rest will be history
Old folks' votes don't cater for you and me
A friend in need is a friend indeed
But a friend selling Zs ain't clever

I was alright
Till they took me off my medication
Started slagging off my generation
And I don't know why
And now all night
Sitting talking 'bout a revolution
C-c-coughing up the p-pollution
And I can't breathe right
And I can't breathe right

Mind is spinning
My mind is spinning
Mind is spinning
M-m-my mind is spinning

I was alright
Till they took me off my medication
Started slagging off my generation
And I don't know why
And now all night
Sitting talking 'bout a revolution
C-c-coughing up the p-pollution
And I can't breathe right

I was alright
Till they took me off my medication
Started slagging off my generation
And I don't know why
And now all night
Sitting talking 'bout a revolution
C-c-coughing up the p-pollution
And I can't breathe right

And I can't breathe right
I can't breathe right
And I can't breathe right
I can't breathe right
And I don't know why
