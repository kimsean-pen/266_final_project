Gimme some money,
Gimme the right
Give me clear superiority
I know it ain't funny,
I know it ain't right
I know it's mediocrity
Now I'm not one to
Piss on your parade
Or take a bow as the
Flames get higher
And I'm not one to be
Part of the charade
And pretend
They ain't pissin'
Pissin' all over the fire

And we're not going tired
Or slowing quiet into the night
And we're not leaving
Something to believe in
When you think there's
Nothing left at all
Believe in the fight
And we do it

In the dark, in the light
One last time, let's get it right
With a heart as cold as ice
I believe in the fight
What do you believe in
In the dark, in the light
One last time, let's get it right
When there's nothing
Left to believe in
Believe in the fight

I need a reason,
I need a slap
I need hard core reality
Change of the season,
All full a crap
All full of virtuosity
Now you're not one
To piss on my parade
To take a laugh as
The bombs exploding
And I'm not one to
Be sharpening the blade
And pretend you ain't pissin'
Pissin' all over the

And we're not going tired
Or slowing quiet into the night
And we're not leaving
Something to believe in
When you think there's
Nothing left at all
Believe in the fight
And we do it

In the dark, in the light
One last time,
Let's get it right
With a heart as cold as ice
I believe in the fight
What do you believe in
In the dark, in the light
One last time,
Let's get it right
When there's
Nothing left to believe in
Believe in the fight

Bring it down

Total devastation
Let's bring the
Conversation into
Born into the fight
Lost in deprivation
Let's bring the allegation into
Born to get it right
Everybody beat to
A different drum
Everybody wanna
Be number one
Everybody walk
Before they run
Everybody bite
Their lip and get it
Born to get it right
Born to die, born
Into the fight

Born to get it right
Everybody beat to
A different drum
Born to die,
Born into the fight
Let's get it right
Born to get it right
Everybody wanna
Be number one
Born to die, born into the fight
Who's left to fight

We're not going tired
Or slowing quiet into the night
And we're not leaving
Something to believe in
When you think there's
Nothing left at all
Believe in the fight
And we do it

In the dark, in the light
One last time, let's get it right
With a heart as cold as ice
I believe in the fight
What do you believe in
In the dark, in the light
One last time, let's get it right
When there's nothing left to believe in
Believe in the fight
