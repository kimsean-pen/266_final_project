They tell me hold on
But pain like this he suffers so long
And truth be told
If we ever did where would you be?
(Where would you be)
It's just the blame that you aim to
Even all the times I sang to just to keep you holding on
I wanna go back to the days in our car
Where we sang the loudest by far
If you want, it could be my fault
I could be your masochistic scapegoat lover
I tore us apart, no way we can take it back
I lose my part for nothing
Lonely summers killing me because
There's still a fire when I think about you
I try to drown it, but I know it's no use
Nobody does it like the way we used to
Oh, whoa oh
It's just the blame that you aim to
Even all the times I sang to just to keep you holding on
And all these moments with you that make me feel like I'm
Brave
(Please stop)
I wanna go back to the days in our car
Where we sang the loudest by far
I got the message; you got the message
(Cold)
Now that we're all alone
(Cold)
I got the message; you got the message
(Cold)
You're never coming home
(Oh whoa, oh)
I wanna go back to the days in our car
Where we sang the loudest by far
I wanna go back to the days in our car
Where we sang
I wanna go back to the days in our car
Where we sang the loudest by far
I wanna go back to the days in our car
Where we sang the loudest
I wanna go back to the days in our car
Where we sang the loudest by far
