You're my lover
undercover
You're my sacred passion & I have no other

You're delicious
So capricious
If I find out you don't want me I'll be vicious

Say you love me
and you'll have me
In your arms forever and I won't forget it

Say you miss me
Come and kiss me
Take me up to heaven and you won't regret it
HEY!
You are the one
You're my number one
The only treasure I'll ever have
You are the one

You're my number one
Anything for you 'cause you're the one I love
You're my lover... HEY!

...
You're a fire
and desire

When I kiss your lips, you know, you take me higher
You're addiction

my conviction

You're my passion, my relief, my crucifixion
Never leave me
And believe me

You will be the sun into my raining season
Never leave me
And believe me

In my empty life you'll be the only reason...
HEY!
You are the one
You're my number one
The only treasure I'll ever have

You are the one
You're my number one
Anything for you 'cause you're the one I love

You're my lover
undercover
You're my sacred passion & I have no other
(guitar solo)
HEY!
You are the one
You're my number one
The only treasure I'll ever have
You are the one
You're my number one
Anything for you 'cause you're the one I love
HEY! HEY! HEY!
HEY! HEY! HEY!
HEY! HEY! HEY!
...
HEY! HEY! HEY!
HEY! HEY! HEY!
HEY! HEY! HEY!
