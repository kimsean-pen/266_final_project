You said you were like a
Ghost in the town
Waiting and lurking in the
Cavern of your home
Gazing at the moon and howling at the night
Shining in the day untill you washed me away
All we could ask for was placed in your hand
But you never really understood the meaning of it
I can't
Never let it go
Oh let it go
I can't
Never let it go
Never let it go
You said you were like a
Ghost in the town
Waiting and lurking in the
Cavern of your home
Gazing at the moon and howling at the night
Shining in the day untill you washed me away
All we could ask for was placed in your hand
But you never really understood the meaning of it
I can't
Never let it go
Oh let it go
I can't
Never let it go
Never let it go
