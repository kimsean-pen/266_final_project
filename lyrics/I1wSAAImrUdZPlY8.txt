I can see a crow
On your judgement day
Seems like a sermon
Please come over
Don't come over
Please come over
Here
Welcome the last day of our lives

I will break the circle
Walls, I'll tear them down
And guilt will break the silence
But there is no return
No return
We shall overcome

We will bring you back
To a moment in time
We will reveal and detect
What you are
Precious truth in a cage
It has been captured but safe
And there we'll bind it and
Blind it with lies

The king will come
World will come undone

He is the center of creation
The prophecy
It's a promise to us all

A crow, a storm
Shadows will be rising soon
A crow, a storm
The Nine sing
Once upon a dream ago
We're the ones you've left alone

Now, as we speak
There's a way
There's a door
Come find us
And join us
Come see it and feel it

Doors in and out
You shall be falling
Your mind's still trapped in twilight
Now, catch a glimpse
Shall I get through
They've walked on
To the other side
But how could I know?
I'm drowning
Drowning
Where do I belong?
Drown in shadows
I am the center of creation
They prophecy
It's a promise to us all

A crow, a storm
Shadows will be rising soon
A crow, a storm
The Nine sing
Once upon a dream ago
We're the ones you've left alone

Don't blame me
Don't blame me
It's my lying toad
The Crow and the Hare
They've moved
Further into the unknown

Mark my words
They will be gone
You'll see them playing games, my dear
They've moved along
Cause one day in the afterlife
We'll meet again
They've frowning
Frowning
On your judgement day
They are shadows
They're in the center of creation
They prophecy
It's a promise to us all

A crow, a storm
Shadows will be rising soon
A crow, a storm
The Nine sing
Once upon a dream ago
We're the ones you've left alone

But don't be afraid
There's war beyond the red door
And please ignore their pleas
Just break the seal
Break the seal, find the red door
There's a red
There's a red
There's a red door
Break the seal, find the red door

The eternal
The infernal
Ther eternal
We shall better get him back
The eternal
The infernal
Ther eternal
Will we ever see the light again
