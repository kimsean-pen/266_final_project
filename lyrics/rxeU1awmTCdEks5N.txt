An ending fitting for the start
You twist and tore our love apart
Your light fingers through the dark
Shattered the lamp, into darkness it cast us all

No, you've got it the wrong way round
You shut me up and blamed it on the brown
Cornered the boy, kicked out at the world
The world kicked back a lot fuckin' harder now

If you wanna try, if you wanna try
There's no worse you could do, oh oh oh
I know you lie, I know you lie
I'm still in love with you, oh oh oh

Can't take me anywhere
I'll take you anywhere
Can't take me anywhere
Well, I can't take you anywhere
I'll take you anywhere you wanna go

You can't stand me now
You can't stand me now
You can't stand me now
You can't stand me now

You can't stand me now
You can't stand me now
You can't stand me now
You can't stand me now

Have we enough to keep it together?
Or do we just keep on pretending and hope our luck is never ending
You tried to pull the wool, I wasn't feeling too clever
And you take all that they're lending
Until you needed mending on you

If you wanna try, if you wanna try
There's no worse you could do, oh oh oh
I know you lie, all you do is make me cry
And that is worse, that ain't true

Can't take me anywhere
I can't take you anywhere
Can't take me anywhere
Well, I won't take you anywhere
I'll take you anywhere you wanna go

You can't stand me now
You can't stand me now
You can't stand me now
You can't stand me now

You can't stand me now
You can't stand me now
You can't stand me now
You can't stand me now

You can't stand me now
You can't stand me now
You can't stand me now
You can't stand me now

You can't stand me now
You can't stand me now
You can't stand me now
You can't stand me now
