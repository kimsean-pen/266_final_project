Meet The Brick Shithouse...

Don't you wish you'd never met her?
Don't you wish you'd never met her?
Don't you wish you'd never met her? Lay him down, lie on
Lay him... down
Now your lover went and put me in the ground
I'll be watching, when he's around
Now your lover went and put me in the ground
I'll be watching

Meet the Brick Shithouse
Kiss the Brick Shithouse
Meet the Brick Shithouse

Lay him down, lie on
Lay him... down
Now your lover went and put me in the ground
I'll be watching, when he's around
Now your lover went and put me in the ground
I'll be watching... when he's around

When you cum you never make a single sound
I'll be watching, when he's around
When he's around, when he's around
He's around

Don't you wish you'd never met her?
Don't you wish you'd never met her?

Now your lover went and put me in the ground
I'll be watching, when he's around
Now your lover went and put me in the ground
I'll be watching... when he's around

When you cum you never make a single sound
I'll be watching, when he's around
When he's around, when he's around
He's around

Don't you wish you'd never met her?
Don't you wish you'd never met her?
Don't you wish you'd never met her?
