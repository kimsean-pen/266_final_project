Slaves of fear
From the moment we're born
Yeah, we want to feel love
Or we want to be numb

Slaves of fear
From the moment we're born
We want to be different
But we don't want to try too hard

Slaves of fear

Slaves of fear
'Till we're dead in the ground
Why do we waste our years?
When there's nothing to fight about

Save your tears
We're here on our own
Why do we waste our years?
'Till it's somebody else's turn?

Save your tears
For the moments to come
We want to give up
When there's nowhere else to run
Slaves of fear

Slaves of fear
'Till we're dead in the ground
Why do we waste our years
When there's nothing to fight about?
Save your tears
We're here on our own
Why do we waste our years
'Till it's somebody else's turn?

No pain has purpose
No one above to judge us
No pain has justice
No one above to love us

Slaves of fear
From the moment we're born

Slaves of fear
'Till we're dead in the ground

Slaves of fear
