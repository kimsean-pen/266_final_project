The perks of company
Not tailored naturally
Of touching nearer things
Of talking in to screens
The curse of timely signs
It's hard work being kind
Flash your dough stream
Purchase neoprene
Flat sole enough white
And the black and yellow slides
Consumer and delight

Into the payzone, touch card
Into the payzone, touch card

Get your back side thrown back in
As you lush out more plastic
And the sentinel goes click
It's your call that's looking sick
In the realm of valued things
Eating berries and dried figs
I try and lay off too much cake
'Cause my core, it takes first place
Two thousand nineteen, death race
Post recover, eat post hate
Post recover, eat post hate
(aarrrgggghhh)

Into the pay zone, touch card,

I don't use flavoured vapes
That blowup dolls for hipsters mate
But I don't mind hipsters mate
We ain't hipster bashin' fakes
Lumps on legs and smacked tans quaint
Against the church and all its hate
Burberry stores and beacon plates
Sour cream on gluten base

Into the payzone, touch card
Into the payzone, touch card, touch card
