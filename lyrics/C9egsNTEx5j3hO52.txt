I was walking through the park
I've seen a total wierdo alone in the dark
He was shouting and screaming, I thought that I was dead
His eyes were telling me he's out of his head

Stay away kid and don't even try
To tell me something, that's a waste of my time
I'm exhausted by the demons of the past
But let me ask…

Can you see it? That's the world of parasites.
Can you see it? That's the world of parasites.
Can you see it? That's the world of parasites.
Can you see it? That's the world of parasites.

I was scared and so confused
He said there's nothing to get and there's nothing to lose
I'm barely sure, but we don't need anyone
‘Cause I can tell you something about the dark side of fun

Go away kid, I don't wanna talk
I wish my head were running down by the truck
That's the world that I don't wanna know
Oh, let me go…

Can you see it? That's the world of parasites.
Can you see it? That's the world of parasites.
Can you see it? That's the world of parasites.
Can you see it? That's the world of parasites.

All the people I've tried to avoid
All the voices I've tried to ignore
All the people I've tried to avoid
All the voices I've tried to ignore

All the people I've tried to avoid
(I see them around)
All the voices I've tried to ignore
(I hear them so loud)
