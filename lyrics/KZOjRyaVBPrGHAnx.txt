Freezin', rests his head on a pillow made of concrete again
Oh, feelin' maybe he'll see a little better set a days, oh yeah
Oh, hand out faces that he sees time again ain't that familiar, ah
Oh, dark grin he can't help when he's happy he looks insane, hey

Evenflow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away, oh
Oh, someday yeah, he'll begin his life again
Life again, life again

Kneelin', lookin' through the paper though he doesn't know to read, oh yeah
Oh, prayin' now to something that has never showed him anything
Oh, feelin' understands the weather of the winters on its way, yeah
Oh, ceilings few and far between all the legal halls of shame, hey

Evenflow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away
Ah, someday, yeah, he'll begin his life again, yeah
Oh, whisperin' hands gently lead him away
Him away, him away

Evenflow, thoughts arrive like butterflies, yeah

Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away, yeah
Ah someday yeah, he'll begin his life again,
yeah
Oh, whisperin' hands gently lead him away
Him away, him away
Yeah
