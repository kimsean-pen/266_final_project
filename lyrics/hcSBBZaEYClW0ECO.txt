My love's imagination is running wild over you
And I feel the desperation of not knowing what to do
Don't know enough about you the words are hard to find
Can't think of life without you it's messing up my mind

Say the word
And I'll be there right by your side
To keep our love alive together we will survive
If you just say the word
No matter where I'll find the time
Of people who don't wanna see the love of you and me

My love's infatuation keeps carrying me away
Do I sense anticipation with every thing that you say
But I wonder should I doubt you
When you make things so unclear
Why can't you say I love you
It's all I wanna hear

Say the word
And I'll be there right by your side
To keep our love alive together we will survive
If you just say the word
And I'll declare time won't divide
Two people who just wanna be in love eternally

I just know it when I hold you in my arms
You show me that you love me when you smile
You love me why do you back away
If it's real let me know it when you hold me in your arms
And I show you that I loved you all the while
Say you love me and I'll never back away

Say the word
And I'll be there right by your side
To keep our love alive together we will survive
If you just say the word
And I'll declare time won't divide
Two people who just wanna be in love eternally

Say the word
And I'll be there right by your side
To keep our love alive together we will survive
If you just say the word
And I'll declare time won't divide
Two people who just wanna be in love eternally
