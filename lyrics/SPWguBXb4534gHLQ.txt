One ring, one ring, yeah

Yo, ey

All this shaggers look me like them
Toa' esa' puta fuera el sostén mas vale el hood, negro, que les den

7 HP is all in my blood
7 HP is all in my fila
Touch my and they touch the trigger
Keo study with they don't relax

Now are fifty dealers and a hundred killers
I got green in my spot, has and lin in my blood
I got mom in the fourth floor
Checking out the sound chours

Keo de vuelta al bloque
Le dije al Popo "No toques"
Semilla de albaricoque
Erecto y firme y parao' como un poste

I made this bitch going down so easy (bitch)
I throw it up she'd comeback like a Frisbee (psh, psh)
Now she miss, me she need me

Smoking this cheesy (yes)
Run around upon Bakel City (skr)
Dont show up, I run Gotham district (skr)
Look the way that a man being speaking
That's a fact that I ain't no civilian (ni-no, ni-no)
All my homies they're trappers (ey)
They stacking money on boxes (whut?)
If you wanna blow call Casper
See a OPR or a copying, we know the process
To' lo que sé es por el money (gang)
Vendiéndole verde al publi en el party (gang)
Nunca- por hobby
You talking dirty (Enry-K Beats, bitch)
Shots on your body like rojo Ferrari

I got money enough to spend (prrr)
You got a hit, boy, I got like ten (hoes)
Dope and killers around this thing (pew, pew)
