In 1985
I placed a bet and lied
Losing all that I had
At least with all my heart intact

In 1985
Orwell was proved right
Torville and Dean's Bolero
Redundant as a sad Welsh chapel

In 1985, in 1985
So God is dead
Like Nietzsche said
Superstition is all we have left

Circle the wagons
We're under attack
We've realised there's no going back
We've realised there's no going back

In 1985
The civil war failed why
Kept hidden like scars of birth
Nature unable to soften the words

In 1985
My words they came alive
Friends were made for life
Morrissey and Mar gave me choice

In 1985, in 1985
So God is dead
Like Nietzsche said
Only 16 years of age he said
See all the tears for the walking dead

We've realised there's no going back
We've realised there's no going back

In 1985
I placed a bet and lied
Losing all that I had
