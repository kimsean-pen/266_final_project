Saturday night, you call me when you're drunk
Don't even try, you'll never touch my soul
She made the cut, shawty is a pro
Never any love, you do it for the show
I'm 'bout to hit the road
The road

I'm 'bout to hit the road
The road
I'm 'bout to hit the road
The road
She do it for the show
I didn't even know
Oo Sunday night

Hit the lights I'm comin', sorry for the wait
I popped a tab and then my life turned to a maze
You just need to feel the pain
Then maybe you'd be amazed
How in a blink it goes away
Then you'll see that I'm not crazy
Maybe you'll see, maybe
Nothing never phased me
I was clean a long, long, long, long time ago
They fall one by one

Like a motherfuckin domino
They tell you what to do like it is Simon says
Get this money chase it

She just wants the diamonds'
Rollies, Rollies, Rollies, Rollies

I do not have time for this
Why do you come for me
I know you don't wanna see
Some things are just hard to believe
'Til you breathe, soak it in, let it drip, smell the trees
Pour it up, don't ever leave, me alone with the piece
I might just pull, I might just cease to exist, like I'm Steez
Rest in peace, can you feel the fucking beat, beat, beat
We ain't looking for the peace, peace, peace
I stick the finger to the dean, dean, dean
I stick the finger to the dean, dean, dean
I stick the finger to the dean, dean, dean
I do not care 'bout what you think, think, think
I wear my money

Sunday night, you call me when you're drunk
Don't even try, you'll never touch my soul
She made the cut, shawty is a pro
Never any love, you do it for the show

I'm 'bout to hit the road
Hit the road
I'm 'bout to hit the road
The road

I'm 'bout to hit the road
The road
Sunday night

With the squad going hard in this bitch
We ain't never gone call it for quits
Stand tall, never fall, never slip, get a grip
Count it up, make it flip, and then ball in this bitch
I just feel like I deserve
Everything that I earn
Even when it's a loss
It's something for me to learn
Story to tell, reason to toast
I've been through hell, swear it's the most
Now I'm just feeling like I'm winning
All in the cameras I be grinning
Young nigga chilling like a villain
Stack it until it hit the ceiling
Then get a crib with bigger rooms
And find another way to fill it
That's just the life
That's just the way that we living
Challenge the way of the system
She tryna balance the taste of the liquor
She know that we'll never be us again
She know I'm focused on me as a man
I'll never change, I'm still the same
And that's just something you can never manage
I know you hate how you ain't do no damage on me, yeah yeah

Don't have no time to have you all up on my mind, yeah
You always looking and I know I'm hard to find, yeah
You know I meant it when I said this shit is mine, yeah
Nothing to lose, I got this all up on the line

Saturday night, you call me when you're drunk
Don't even try, you'll never touch my soul
She made the cut, shawty is a pro
Never any love, you do it for the show
I'm 'bout to hit the road
Hit the road
I'm 'bout to hit the road
The road
I'm 'bout to hit the road
The road
She do it for the show
I didn't even know
Sunday night, you call me when you're drunk
Don't even try, you'll never touch my soul
She made the cut, shawty is a pro
Never any love, you do it for the show
Oo Sunday night
