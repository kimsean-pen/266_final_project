I could be wrong, I could be right
I could be wrong

I could be wrong, I could be right
I could be black, I could be white
I could be right, I could be wrong
I could be white, I could be black

Your time has come your second skin
The cost so high the gain so low
Walk through the valley
The written word is a lie

May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you

Could be wrong, I could be right
Could be wrong, I could be right

I could be wrong, I could be right
I could be black, I could be white
I could be right, I could be wrong
I could be black, I could be white

They put a hot wire to my head
'Cos of the things I did and said
And made these feelings go away
Model citizen in every way

May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you

Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy

May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you

Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy

Could be wrong, I could be right
Could be wrong, I could be right

I could be wrong, I could be right
I could be black, I could be white
I could be right, I could be wrong
I could be black, I could be white

Your time has come your second skin
Cost so high the gain so low
Walk through the valley
The written word is a lie

May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you

Could be wrong, I could be right
Could be wrong

They put a hot wire to my head
'Cos of the things I did and said
And made these feelings go away
Model citizen in every way

Your time has come your second skin
Cost so high the gain so low

May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you

Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
