The changingman

Is happiness real or am I so jaded?
Can't see or feel like a man been tainted
Numbed by the effect, aware of the muse
Too in touch with myself, I light the fuse

I'm the changingman
Woh
Built on shifting sand
Yea
I'm changingman
Woh
Waiting for the bang
(Bang)
As I light a bitter fuse

Our time is on loan, only us to borrow
An' I know
But I can't be today, I can be tomorrow
Yea, all I see, the more I know
The more I know, the less I understand

I'm the changingman
Built on shifting sands
Yea
I'm a changingman
I' m waiting for the bang
To light a bitter fuse

Bigger part ahh, when our instincts act
A shot in the dark, a movement in black, yea
More I see, more I know
The more I know, the less I understand you

(Changingman)
Yea eee aaa
Built on shifting sands
I don't have a plan
I'm changingman
Waiting for the bang
To light a bitter fuse

(Changingman)
Built on shifting sands
Yea eee yea
I'm a changingman
Waiting for the bang
To light a bitter fuse
Yea eee yea
