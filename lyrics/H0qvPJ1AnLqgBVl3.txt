I took a walk down a road
It's the road I was meant to stay
I see the fire in your eyes
But a man's got to make his way
So are you tough enough for my love?
Just close your eyes to the heaven above
I'm coming home
I'm coming home

I took a ride in a world
I'll be spinnin' for the rest of my life
I feel your heart beatin' baby
Oooh sometimes it cuts like a knife
So are you tough enough for my love?
Just close your eyes to the heaven above
I'm coming home

I'm coming home

I'm coming home
Where your love tonight

Can shine on me
I'm coming home

Where your lovin' arms
Can set me free
Ooh, hoo, hoo
(Solo)
I took a walk down a road

It's the road I was meant to stay
I see the fire in your eyes
But a man's got to make his way

So are you tough enough for my love?
Just close your eyes to the heaven above

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Oh yeah

I'm on my way oh yeah
I'm coming home, ooh, ohh
I'm coming home
Here we go ooo yeah, ooo
I'm on my way
Come on baby, come on now
Let your love, shine on me
Sing along, I'm on my way
Come on baby, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Shine on, shine on, shine on me
Come on baby, I'm on my way
Come on baby, let you love shine on me
Oh yeah, shine on me
Oh yeah, shine on, shine on me
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
