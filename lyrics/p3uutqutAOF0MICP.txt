Greasy slicked down body,
groovy leather trim
I like the way you hold the road,
mama, it ain't no sin

Talkin' 'bout love
Talkin' 'bout love
Talkin' 'bout...

Trouble-free transmission,
helps your oil's flow
Mama, let me pump your gas,
mama, let me do it all

Talkin' 'bout love
Talkin' 'bout love
Talkin' 'bout...

Check that heavy metal
underneath your hood
Baby, I could work all night,
believe I've got the perfect tools

Talkin' 'bout love
Talkin' 'bout love
Talkin' 'bout...

Automobile with cover,
really built with style
Special is tradition,
mama, let me feast my eyes

Talkin' 'bout love
Talkin' 'bout love
Talkin' 'bout ...

Factory air-conditioned,
heat begins to rise
Guaranteed to run for hours,
mama it's a perfect size

Talkin' 'bout love
Talkin' 'bout love
Talkin' 'bout ...

Groovin' on the freeway,
gauge is on the red
Gun down on my gasoline,
I believe I'm gonna crack a head.

Talkin' 'bout love
Talkin' 'bout love
Talkin' 'bout ...
I can't stop talkin' about...
I can't stop talkin' about...

Come to me for service every hundred miles
Baby, let me check your points,
fix your overdrive

Talkin' 'bout love
Talkin' 'bout love
Talkin' 'bout ...

Fully automatic, comes in any size
Makes me wonder what I did, before we synchronized

Talkin' 'bout love
Talkin' 'bout love
Talkin' 'bout ...

Feather-light suspension,
coils just couldn't hold
I'm so glad I took a look inside your showroom doors

Talkin' 'bout love
Talkin' 'bout love
Talkin' 'bout ...

Oh, I can't stop talkin' about love.
I can't stop talkin' about love.
Oh, let me go on down, go on down
Go on down, go on down, go on down
Yes

I can't stop talkin' about
I can't stop talkin' about love
I can't stop talkin' about love or my baby
I can't stop talkin' about love, my baby
My baby, my baby yeah

Uh, push, push, push it, push, push, push
