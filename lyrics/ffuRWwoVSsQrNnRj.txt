Well I'm just a fool for you and I think I'm going crazy
I can't control myself or contain my thoughts
It's eating me up inside
Now I see everything a little more clearly
The bad outweighs the good things
Was this ever a good thing for me? oh oh
Was this ever a good thing for me? oh oh

You're just a phone call away
Every day you seem further away (you're just a phone call away)
I do my best to throw my pride aside
And apologize cut myself down a notch
(Every day you seem further away)
And I know I said some things that hurt
It took 97 missed calls to finally get over you

All I, all I really wanted was a good job
A nine to five never seemed to cut it
Was too wrapped up in her to be working like that
Soon you'll see that everything will work out for me
So keep your promises, you promised to me, oh yeah

You're just a phone call away
Every day you seem further away (you're just a phone call away)
I do my best to throw my pride aside
And apologize cut myself down a notch
(Every day you seem further away)
And I know I said some things that hurt
It took 97 missed calls to finally get over you

Your taking me places I've never been
Your feeling me out and I'm filling you in
What's more important, saving yourself or letting me in?
What's more important?
What's more important?
What's more important
Saving yourself or letting me in?

You're just a phone call away
Every day you seem further away (you're just a phone call away)
I do my best to throw my pride aside
And apologize cut myself down a notch
(Every day you seem further away)
And I know I said some things that hurt
It took 97 missed calls to finally get over you

Well I'm just a fool for you and I think I'm going crazy
I'm just a fool for you and I think I'm going crazy
I'm just a fool for you and I think I'm going crazy
I'm just a fool for you and I think I'm going crazy
