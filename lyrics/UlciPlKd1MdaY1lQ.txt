Light switch
Man switch
Film was broken only then
All the night
Fused tomorrow
Dancing with a distant friend

Filming and screening
I picture the scene
Filming and dreaming
Dreaming of me

So we left
Understanding
Cleancut so we're sounding fast
Talked of sad
I talked of war
I laughed and climbed the rising cast

Filming and screening
I picture the scene
Filming and dreaming
Dreaming of me

Quickly I remembered
Fused and saw a face before
Timing reason
Understanding
Like association whore

Filming and screening
I picture the scene
Filming and dreaming
Dreaming of me, yeah

Dreaming of me
Just dreaming of me
It's only me
Just me
