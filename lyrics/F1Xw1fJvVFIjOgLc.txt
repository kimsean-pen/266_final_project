Achilles
Achilles
Achilles come down, won't you
Get up off
Get up off the roof?

You're scaring us
And all of us
Some of us love you
Achilles, it's not much but there's proof

You crazy assed cosmonaut
Remember your virtue
Redemption lies plainly in truth

Just humour us
Achilles
Achilles come down
Won't you get up off
Get up off the roof

Achilles
Achilles
Achilles come down, won't you
Get up off
Get up off the roof?

The self is not so weightless
Nor whole and unbroken
Remember the pact of our youth

Where you go
I'm going
So jump and I'm jumping
Since there is no me without you

Soldier on
Achilles
Achilles come down
Won't you get up off
Get up off the roof?

Loathe the way they light candles in Rome
But love the sweet air of the votives
Hurt and grieve but don't suffer alone
Engage with the pain as a motive

Today of all days
See

How the most dangerous thing is to love
How you will heal and you'll rise above

Achilles
Achilles
Achilles
Jump now
You are absent of cause
Or excuse

So self-indulgent
And self-referential
No audience could ever want you

You crave the applause
Yet hate the attention
Then miss it, your act is a ruse

It is empty, Achilles
So end it all now
It's a pointless resistance
For you

Achilles
Achilles
Just put down the bottle
Don't listen to what you've consumed

It's chaos, confusion
And wholly unworthy
Of feeding and it's wholly untrue

You may feel no purpose
Nor a point for existing
It's all just conjecture and gloom

And there may not be meaning
So find one and seize it
Do not waste your self on this roof

Hear those bells ring deep in the soul
Chiming away for a moment
Feel your breath course frankly below
See life as a worthy opponent

Today of all days
See

How the most dangerous thing is to love
How you will heal and you'll rise above
Crowned by an overture bold and beyond
Ah, it's more courageous to overcome

You want the acclaim
The mother of mothers (it's not worth it Achilles)
More poignant than fame
Or the taste of another (don't listen Achilles)
But be real and just jump
You dense motherfucker (you're worth more, Achilles)
You will not be more
Than a rat in the gutter (so much more than a rat)
You want my opinion (no one asked your opinion)
My opinion you've got
You asked for my counsel (no one asked for your thoughts)
I gave you my thoughts
Be done with this now
And jump off the roof
Can you hear me Achilles?
I'm talking to you

I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you
Achilles come down
Achilles come down

Throw yourself into the unknown
With pace and a fury defiant
Clothe yourself in beauty untold
And see life as a means to a triumph
Today of all days
See

How the most dangerous thing is to love
How you will heal and you'll rise above
Crowned by an overture bold and beyond
Ah, it's more courageous to overcome
