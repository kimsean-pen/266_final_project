Six weeks sober
And I think that I'm finally over
You (oh, no, no)
You (oh, no, no)
I'm not craving
You anymore
I'm not faking
It's called self control
Oh, no, no, no
All I need is one drink and your eyes
All I need is two shots and surprise
Surprise
You got me feeling powerless
Now I need you and nothing less
All you give is one look in my mind
All I need is your smile and I'm gone
Goodbye
Right to Hell and back again
I just want you and nothing less
I've got a bad habit
And I just gotta have it
No good for me (oohh)
It's killing me (oohh)
I've got a bad habit
And I just gotta have it
No good for me (oohh)
It's killing me (oohh)
Instant regret
Not so easy for me to forget
You (oh, no, no)
Oh, no, no, no
There's no prescription
For this addiction
I'm constantly wishing
I could let go
But no, no, no
All I need is one drink and your eyes
All I need is two shots and surprise
Surprise
You got me feeling powerless
Now I need you and nothing less
All you give is one look in my mind
All I need is your smile and I'm gone
Goodbye
Right to Hell and back again
I just want you and nothing less
I've got a bad habit
And I just gotta have it
No good for me (oohh)
It's killing me (oohh)
I've got a bad habit
And I just gotta have it
No good for me (oohh)
It's killing me (oohh)
I can't help myself
Oh, it feels so good
I can't help myself
Oh, I wish I could
I can't help myself
Oh, it feels so good
I can't help myself
Oh, I wish I could
I've got a bad habit
And I just gotta have it
No good for me (oohh)
It's killing me (oohh)
I've got a bad habit
And I just gotta have it
No good for me (oohh)
It's killing me (oohh)
I've got a bad habit
