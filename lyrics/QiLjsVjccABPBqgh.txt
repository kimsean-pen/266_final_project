As the waves crash, the clouds roll.
Sit on the dock waiting for the sun.
Wait for the coward but he never comes.
Pray for revenge on him.
Steam rises as the boats come in, one by one.
You know she is gone and there's no saving her.
Her cheating, her weak will, the addiction, that needle.
When you come home to find her on the floor,
you're reminded of those sleepless nights that will haunt you for the rest of your life.
Blue collar shipyard, any way to keep her alive.
Sun up to sun down, blistered hands and a parched mouth.
