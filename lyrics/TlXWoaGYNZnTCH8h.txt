You're always on my mind
Day and night, baby, all the time (all the time)
You mean so much to me
A love like ours just had to be
You're the wind and the rain
You've got a river that takes away my pain
And the sky that's oh-so-blue
You're everything girl, don't you know I need you (need you)
U R the only thing that keeps me goin'
U R the only thing that keeps my love alive
U R the only thing that I'll ever need
U don't have to worry, you see, my love is forever
Aw, sugar, I don't have to dream
Cuz' you give me what I want
Girl, you know what I need
Forever until my love is through
I... I will love you (love you)
Oh, what does it take to make you see
That you are the only one for me
I'll never, never stop loving you
I'll never, never stop wanting you
I'll never, never get enough of you
Love is forever
U R the only thing that keeps me goin'
U R the only thing that keeps my love alive
U R the only thing that I'll ever need
U don't have to worry, my love is forever
