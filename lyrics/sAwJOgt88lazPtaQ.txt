Sun in my eyes and the gold coast shining
And the girl with the braids in her hair
Steady breeze and oh I was falling
I would follow her anywhere
The sky turned grey in a flash flood warning
She smiled and she took my hand
She kissed my lips and the rain came pouring
Swore I heard a marching band

We move forward
'Cause we can't go back
We move forward
'Cause we can't go back
We move forward
'Cause we can't go back
We move forward
'Cause we can't go back

Hanging out of the third story window
Oh you were a sight to see
The black dress that bends when the wind blows
Roll back the tide for me

Sunset skies, the paint is pealing, the wind blowing sand in her hair
Endless days in the deep blue feeling
I would follow her anywhere...
