Who am I now?
Who was I then?
What am I doing baby?
Who have I been?
What am I worth to you?
Is it even much?
But I said Im sorry, are you giving up?
Please dont give up
Hold me darlin
Hold me please
I am sorry
I am weak
I pray for forgiveness
And to be free
So hold me darlin, hold me please.
Its a good thing baby
We just need some space
But Im getting tired of looking at this empty place
I know youre keeping busy
Is that why were out of touch?
But my instinct tells me that youre giving up
Please dont give up.
Hold me darlin
Hold me please
I am sorry
I am weak
I pray for forgiveness
And to be free
So hold me darlin, hold me.
Though I cant see tomorrow in your eyes
And does the thought of ever leaving cross your mind
But when tomorrow comes will you be by my side.
Hold me darlin
Hold me please
I am sorry
I am weak
I pray for forgiveness
And to be free
So hold me darlin, hold me please.
Hold me darlin
Hold me please
I am sorry
I am weak
Hold me darlin
Hold me please
Hold me darlin
Hold me please
