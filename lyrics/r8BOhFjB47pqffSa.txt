Polarize me, sensitize me
Criticize me, civilize me
Compensate me, animate me
Complicate me, elevate me

Goddess in my garden
Sister in my soul
Angel in my armor
Actress in my role

Daughter of a demon lover
Empress of the hidden face
Priestess of the pagan mother
Ancient queen of inner space

Polarize me, sensitize me
Criticize me, civilize me
Compensate me, animate me
Complicate me, elevate me

Spirit in my psyche
Double in my role
Alter in my image
Struggle for control

Mistress of the dark unconscious
Mermaid of the lunar sea
Daughter of the great enchantress
Sister to the boy inside of me

Polarize me, sensitize me
Criticize me, civilize me
Compensate me, animate me
Complicate me, elevate me

My counterpart, my foolish heart
A man must learn to rule his tender part
A warming trend, a gentle friend
A man must build a fortress to defend

A secret face, a touch of grace
A man must learn to give a little space
A peaceful state, a submissive trait
A man must learn to gently dominate

Polarize me, sensitize me
Criticize me, civilize me
Compensate me, animate me
Complicate me, elevate me
Complicate me, elevate me
