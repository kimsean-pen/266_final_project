Your guard isn't on, your barriers open
Your words have now got, the whole town waiting
My army is down, my company old
And leaving, quiet and burned
those nights we sought all the words
And if I could have one more guardian on the wall

Riding a fleet of beggars and cons
Taking it back, it won't be long

Your name you have kept, the part you've taken
So carefully planned, each word you've spoken
My army is down, my company old
And leaving, quiet and burned
those nights we sought all the words
And if I could have one more guardian on the wall

Riding a fleet of beggars and cons
Taking it back, it won't be long
