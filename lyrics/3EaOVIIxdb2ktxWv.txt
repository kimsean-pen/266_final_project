I don't like getting jealous that much
'cause I know everybody cares, everybody cares
I don't care for attention that much
I just put my life over theirs, my life over theirs

Howl, howl, howl
Howl

I don't care for attention that much
When I do, everybody stares, everybody stares
I don't wanna be another old friend
I just can't overlook again, overlook again

Howl, howl

Howl, howl, howl
Howl

Howl!

I don't like playing victim that much
'Cause my life ain't over yet, my life ain't over yet
I just seek everything and everyone
So I howl

Howl, howl, howl
Howl, howl

Howl!
