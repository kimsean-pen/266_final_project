I lay in my arms dying
As you dance inside my heart
I know I should be trying
But every time I fall apart
I hear your voice in every noise
I see your face in fire
I feel your breath in every storm
And so I can't blow it away

I know it's only love
It's only love
Yeah, but only love could fuck me up this much
I know it's only love
It's only love
It's just the stuff we are made up of

I'm driving like a demon
Crying to our song
I'm drowning in the feeling
Of when we first sang along
I hear your voice above the chorus
Your funny harmonies
It's funny how they're not funny now
Instead, they bring me to my knees

I know it's only love
It's only love
Yeah, but only love could fuck me up this much
Yeah
I know it's only love
It's only love
Yeah
It's just the stuff we are made up of, oh

(I wanna find my heart
I wanna find out
I wanna find
I wanna find life, God
I wanna find my love
I wanna find out)

I lay in my arms dying
As you dance inside my heart

(As you dance inside my heart) (as you dance inside my heart)
I know it's only love, it's only love (as you dance inside my heart)
I know it's only love, it's only love (as you dance inside my heart)
I know it's only love, it's only love (as you dance inside my heart)
I know it's only love, it's only love, yeah
