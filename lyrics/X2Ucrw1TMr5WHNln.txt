Come on over, come on over, come on over, come on over
Come on over, come on over, come on over, come on over
Come on over, come on over, come on over, come on over
Come on over, come on over, come on over, come on over

Come on over cut some shapes
Get it right up in my space, so shake it
Just shake it

Dance a little move some more
Push it back down to the floor and shake it
Just shake it

Looking deep into my eyes
Bend it back and do your best to break it
Break it

Girl you really look the part
Reach right out, you've got my heart, now take it
Just take it, take it

Come on over, cut some shapes
Get it right up in my space and shake it
Just shake it

Dance a little, move some more
Push it back down to the floor and shake it
Just shake it

Looking deep into my eyes
Bend it back and do your best to break it
To break it

Girl you really look the part
Reach right out, you've got my heart, now take it
Just take it, take it

Come on over, come on over, come on over, come on over
Come on over, come on over, come on over, come on over
Come on over, come on over, come on over, come on over
Come on over, come on over, come on over, come on over

Come on over, cut some shapes
Get it right up in my space and shake it
Just shake it

Dance a little, move some more
Push it back down to the floor and shake it
Just shake it

Looking deep into my eyes
Bend it back and do your best to break it
To break it

Girl you really look the part
Reach right out, you've got my heart, now take it
Just take it, take it
