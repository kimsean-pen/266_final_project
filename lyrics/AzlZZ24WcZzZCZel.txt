I'd lie down in darkness with devils
And awaken with strangers that I never knew
I'd follow the hoofbeats of heartache
If I thought they'd lead me to you

There's so little magic in morning
Butterflies in your eyes and a tear drop or two
I'd run through the dawning with danger
If I could be running to you

If I cry down to God in the morning
'Who am I? Where am I? Why am I still alone?'
He'd probably show me a highway
Leading to you and to home

There's so little magic in midnight
Fireflies in your eyes and a sparkle or two
I'd dance through the darkness with danger
If I could be dancing to you

If love gives you life or takes lifetime
I'll give love or take love to you
