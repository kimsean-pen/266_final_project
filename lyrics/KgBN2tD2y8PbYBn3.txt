I say WPLJ, it really tastes good to me
WPLJ won't you take a drink with me
Well, it's a good good wine
It really makes me feel so fine, so fine, so fine, so fine

I went to the store when they open up the door
I said: "Please please please gimme some more"
White port & lemon juice, white port & lemon juice,
White port & lemon juice, ooh what a good to you!

You take the bottle, you take the can, shake it up fine
You get a good good wine.
White port & lemon juice, white port & lemon juice,
White port & lemon juice, ooh what a good to you!

The W is the white, the P is the port
The L is the lemon, the J is the juice
White port & lemon juice, white port & lemon juice,
White port & lemon juice, ooh what a good to you!

Well I feel so good, I feel so fine
I got plenty of lovin', I got plenty of wine
White port & lemon juice, white port & lemon juice,
I said white port & lemon juice, ooh what a good to you!
