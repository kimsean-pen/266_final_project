nurse your wounds, you are no soldier
we are not men of faith.
so that, when we die, the only thing that touches you
will be the worms of earth, turning earth over earth.

i have not forgiven you
i don't think that i will.

will you ever know how hard it was to say,
"you are a lost cause, and i can't save you now."

i have not come to set things right.
i have come to say goodbye.
