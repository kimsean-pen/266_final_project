No Brakes

No brakes this time
I slit the line
But if you want me, it's cool
You can take me for a fool

I could slow down if you want me to
But just for you, just for you, just for you...

Carry me home, put me to bed!
Leave me alone, it's all in my head!
It's out of my hands, over the wheel
My only chance, my only appeal

What if you're here to save me from this?
If I disappear will I be missed?
I never know what I should do
Can I leave it up to you?

No brakes, it's true
No brakes, just you
Something to move me instead
Of this rolodex in my head

I never meant anything I said
When I see red, I see red, I see red...

Carry me home, put me to bed!
Leave me alone, it's all in my head!
It's out of my hands, over the wheel
My only chance, my only appeal

What if you're here to save me from this?
If I disappear will I be missed?
I never know what I should do

Can I leave it up to you?
Can I leave it up to you?
Can I leave it up to you?
Can I leave it up to you?
