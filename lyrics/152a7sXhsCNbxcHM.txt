Ladies and Gentlemen, I've got a little story to tell
About Mona Lisa, and how she suddenly fell (huh)
See everyone knew her, they knew her oh so well
Now I am taking over, to release her from her spell

She's unforgettable, she was a legend though
It's kinda pitiful that she's gone
It's kinda incredible
She's so unpredictable (yeah, yeah)
It's time to let her go (yeah) cuz she's gone, cuz she's gone, cuz she's gone

She was taken under, drowning in her seat (huh)
Running like an angel, she was crying but she could not see (oh no!)
Now see everyone's watching, as she starts to fall
Now don't have a breakdown
You will hit the freakin wall

She's unforgettable, she was a legend though
It's kinda pitiful that she's gone
It's kinda incredible
She's so unpredictable (yeah, yeah)
It's time to let her go (yeah) cuz she's gone, cuz she's gone, cuz she's gone

Now Ladies does that make you cryyyyyyy? (huh)
Now Fellas you have to say goodbyeeeee
Cuz Mona Lisa's got to flyyyyy
Everyone, may we have a moment of silence? Right Here.

...god...
