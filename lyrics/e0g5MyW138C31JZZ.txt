It's hard to let the miles pass me by
Yellow lines that blend together in my eyes
And when the seasons change again then I will too
I just want to be closer to you

I'm staring out at endless rows of green
There are miles of hay like I have never seen
Just when you think you've had enough
And your dreams come true
I just want to be closer to you

My mind wanders through all that I've been hiding from
I tried not to let you down
Now I wonder if I've been doin' something wrong
Help me get my feet back on the ground

Tomorrow I'll be lying under you
With a heart of gold and arms to fall into
I know that there might come a day
Where my life is through
But I just want to be closer to you

My mind wanders through all that I've been hiding from
I tried not to let you down
Now I wonder if I've been doin' something wrong
Help me get my feet back on the ground

Someday we might learn to tell the truth
We might even find the fountains of our youth
We all needed something real we all need proof
I just want to be closer to you
I only want to be closer to you
