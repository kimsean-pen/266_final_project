Waves crashin' over
Our music comfort
Our love and comfort
I've been shaking deep

Whispers are racing
My love is sacred
My love is hoping
These places are broken
I need to grab my phone

Are you walking away?
Are you walking away?
And I can set the dates
You are on your way
Heaven sent you
You are walking

I used to grab my phone

Instrumental

I had a dream of you when you saved my soul
I had a dream of you when you saved my soul
I had a dream of you when you saved my soul
