I can't see a thing; well it's on your face
I'm running down my stairs, and I'm heading to your place
Do you know what you have done to me?
We're spending all our time, it's never felt so right
The sun lights the room, cus we talked all night
I could stay with you till the sun goes out
And I'm walking home, through the empty streets
I gave you a kiss, and you turned to me
I've never cared so much about anything before
It's easy to lose track when you've lost your cares
Forget about my friends, and I know it's unfair
I've been reminded how it feels to be again
I'll do it again, I'll fall right in
I'll do it again, I'll fall right in
I'll do it again, I'll fall right in
I'll do it again, I'll fall right in
I'll do it again, I'll fall right in (Do it again... All again)
I'll do it again, I'll fall right in (I'll fall, Fall right in)
I'll do it again, I'll fall right in
I'll do it again, I'll fall right in (Do it again, All again)
I'll do it again, I'll fall right in (I'll fall, I will fall right in)
I'll do it again, I'll fall right in
