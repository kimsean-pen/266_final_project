That's right, lookin' like you don't give a huff tonight
I'm not shuttin' up tonight la la la la la la come on

I wanna do good but the good's all done
I'm on another kind of mission
Roundin' up, I don't wanna go get some
Get a like for the livin'

Feel it shattering the conscience
Right when I bump into the rising sun
That's higher than I want now
I pull it back down
And keep it goin'

'Cause dance like I started a riot
I've got the fuse already ignited
And it's too late now for the fire
Although I think I might've started a riot
Riot, oh no

I don't make the rules but I break them up
I'm just a love lookin' dangerous
Roll over the cup, turn your counter up
And I'm ready now to get into it

Get down underneath the blackout
One thing, lights and the electrics
It's on oh something so yea let's go
Lose it to the mid flow

'Cause dance like I started a riot
I've got the fuse already ignited
And it's too late now for the fire
Although I think I might've started a riot
Riot, oh no

Oh oh oh no
Oh oh oh no
I think I might've started a riot
Oh oh oh no
I think I might've started a riot
Riot, oh no

That's right, lookin' like you don't give a huff tonight
I'm not shuttin' up tonight la la la la la la come on
Down down, bring it down
Lot of whole up movin' on
Everything now all I want
Hit me with that punch

That's right, lookin' like you don't give a huff tonight
I'm not shuttin' up tonight la la la la la la come on
Down down, bring it down
Lot of whole up movin' on
Everything now all I want
Hit me with that punch

And I dance like I started a riot
I've got the fuse already ignited
And it's too late now for the fire
Although I think I might've started a riot
Riot, oh no

Oh oh oh no
Oh oh oh no
I think I might've started a riot
Oh oh oh no
I think I might've started a riot
Riot, oh no
