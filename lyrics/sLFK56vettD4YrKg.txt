I just thought I'd tell you
All the demons have been slain
There's no need for hesitation
Honey I been rearranged
Now they've got me wonderin' what to do
Over blood red sentimental blues

I heard it in the alleyway
You're strumming your guitar
Though I could hardly see your face
You'd got a mouth all full of stars
You better spit em out now

I just thought I'd tell you
All the demons have been slain
For you'll only be as big as what you do
Over blood red sentimental blues

I heard it in the garbage can
In every piece of trash
You'd better color up my heart again
I'm afraid it's turning black
I could hear it in the alleyway
You're strumming your guitar
Though I could hardly see your face
You'd got a mouth all full of stars

There's no need for hesitation
There's no need for hesitation
I heard it in the toilet bowl
You're calling out my name
