Lady luck, she is lovely
Lady luck, she is free
But I wish sometimes that lady luck
She would find some time to spend with me

Why do I worry?
Why do I fear?
It's just the beginning
But I feel the end is near

I look around
And I don't feel like myself
Tell me please, tell me please
Is it my mind or is it my health?

Lady luck, she is lovely
Lady luck, she is free
But I wish sometimes that lady luck
She would find some time to spend with me

No need to worry
There is no need to fear
It's just the beginning
Though the end is near

Now sing it to me

Lady luck, she is lovely
Lady luck, she is free
But I wish sometimes that lady luck
She would find some time to spend with me
