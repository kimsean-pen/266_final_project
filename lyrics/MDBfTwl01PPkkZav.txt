I am through with hanging around
All the boys in town
Now I want a man around
Get me out of here

Now I am a just red brassiere
To all the boys in town
Put this bus in top gear
And get me out of here

I must have been desperate
I must have been pretty low
I must have been desperate
I must have been pretty low

I was always driving home
All the boys in town
But they never telephoned
Get me out of here

I think they're pretty phoney
You're not like the rest
You've heard of matrimony
They've all flunked the test

I must have been desperate
I must have been pretty low
I must have been desperate
I must have been pretty slow

Ooh I'm tired
Ooh I'm wired
Ooh I'm tired
Ooh I'm wired

Too much too young
Too much too young
Too much too young
Too much too young

Get me out of here
Too much too young
Get me out of here
Too much too young
Get me out of here
Too much too young
Get me out of here
Too much too young

Get me out of here
Too much too young
Get me out of here
Too much too young
Get me out of here
Too much too young
Get me out of here
