When I'm in the Mercy Seat
I smile and lay my weapons down
All I ask is for release no matter what the cost
There's only one way to bring a new day
Apply the heat that gently turns
My sickness into health

*But you can taste the fire for yourself
Yeah you can taste the fire for yourself
And when that blood begins to flow
There's nowhere else to go
I feel complete in the Mercy Seat
So complete, in the Mercy Seat

So bind me to the Mercy Seat and heal me
I promise not to flinch
And ring that bell as loud as you please
It can only make me well
There's only one way to bring a new day
Help me to recall I'm just a man
And that's all I am

Repeat *

So complete, in the Mercy Seat
So complete, in the Mercy Seat
