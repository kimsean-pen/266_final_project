You and me, we were destined to fall apart
Can you believe it's been three years since the start?
You couldn't be any cooler if you tried
Said you wouldn't see nobody but you lied
And I'm not gonna fight
No, I'm not gonna fight

You and me, we were destined to be the ones
But we couldn't see we were flying close to the sun
And it didn't take too much time for our wings to melt
Guess it's true what they say, that some things are felt

If I could kiss you one more time
Would it make everything alright?
Or would it just make me a liar?
I didn't wanna end, tonight, the dream

I didn't wanna end the dream

I didn't wanna end the dream

Never thought I would kiss you without a blush

Always thought you would miss me too much to rush
Didn't took it too long to forget all about us
Should I have let you be any more than a stupid crush?
Well, now I know I'm right
Yeah, now I know I'm right

If I could kiss you one more time
Would it make everything alright?
Or would it just make me a liar?
I didn't wanna end tonight

If I could kiss you one more time
Would it make everything alright?
Or would it just make me a liar?
I didn't wanna end tonight

If I could kiss you one more time
Would it make everything alright?
Or would it just make me a liar?
I didn't wanna end, tonight, the dream

I didn't wanna end the dream

I didn't wanna end the dream
