I like where we are
When we drive in your car
I like where we are
Here
'Cause our lips can touch
And our cheeks can brush
Our lips can touch
Here
Well you are the one
The one that lies close to me
Whispers hello, I miss you quite terribly
I fell in love
In love with you suddenly
Now there's no place else I could be
But here in your arms

I like where you sleep
When you sleep next to me
I like where you sleep
Here
Our lips can touch
And our cheeks can brush
Our lips can touch
Here
Well you are the one
The one that lies close to me
Whispers hello, I miss you quite terribly
I fell in love
In love with you suddenly
Now there's no place else I could be
But here in your arms
Our lips can touch
Our lips can touch
Here
Well you are the one
The one that lies close to me
Whispers hello, I miss you quite terribly
I fell in love
In love with you suddenly
Now there's no place else I could be
But here in your arms
Well you are the one
The one that lies close to me
Whispers hello, I miss you quite terribly
I fell in love
In love with you suddenly
Now there's no place else I could be
But here in your arms
Here in your arms
Here in your arms
