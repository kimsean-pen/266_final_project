So
I do believe
None of this is physical
At least not to me
So
I do believe
That anywhere it goes
It's always with me
It's not the dream
That makes you weak
It's not the night
That makes you sleep
But it's a voice
And it's a choice
To call you out
Or stay at home
So I do believe
None of this is physical
At least not to me
So I do believe
That anywhere it goes
It's always with me
It's not the beast
It's not the sheets
So soft and warm
All over me
But it's the touch
You need so much
To move around
On this green earth
Ahh
Take your money and your drugs
Take your money and your drugs
To anyone who wondered
What ol' Jebus meant to me
Take him out to go divin'
In Red Patoka Sea
The brain melts in the twilight
With the boar and movin' trees
Your skin looks good in moonlight
And goddamn those shaky knees
The fact that my heart's beating
Is all the proof you need, ahh
Believe, I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe (ahh)
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe (aah)
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe (give it away)
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe (ahh)
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe (oh, ahh)
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe (ahh oh)
I believe (ahh)
