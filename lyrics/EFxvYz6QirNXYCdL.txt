You're weak, broken in a motel
You blink, tears are falling down, down, down
And you're free, free inside your own hell
You speak, someone let me out, out, out
And I can't stop this pain, it only grows
Tell me why I always feel alone
And I can't fight this feeling anymore Show me what I'm really living for

I wanna love, wanna live, wanna breath, wanna give
But it's hard and it's dark and we're doomed from the start
I wanna love, wanna live, wanna breathe, wanna give
But it's hard and it's dark and I'm falling apart

Your dreams slowly turn against you
Your feet sink into the ground, ground, ground
And you bleed, naked in a black room
You scream, someone let me out, out, out
And I can't stop this pain, it only grows
Tell me why I always feel alone
And I can't fight this feeling anymore Show me what I'm really living for

I wanna love, wanna live, wanna breath, wanna give
But it's hard and it's dark and we're doomed from the start
I wanna love, wanna live, wanna breathe, wanna give
But it's hard and it's dark and I'm falling apart

(How come that, uh, most of your songs are sad songs?)
(Well, uh, you know, I don't think they're all that sad.)
(Some, I have a few that are just, that aren't sad, they're hopeless.)
(Totally hopeless situation.)
(And the rest aren't sad, they're just the way it comes kinda.)
(You know, you don't think life's sad?)
(But from recognizing the sadness, you can put it aside and be happy and enjoy the happy side of life.)
I wanna love, wanna live, wanna breath, wanna give
But it's hard and it's dark and we're doomed from the start
I wanna love, wanna live, wanna breathe, wanna give
But it's hard and it's dark and I'm falling apart
