You know you're gold
you don't gotta worry now honey
oasis child
born and so wild

Don't i know you better than the rest
all deception, all deception from you

your love is stag
in the white sand
Wilderness for miles
eyes so mild and wise

Don't i know you better than the rest
all deception, all deception from you

Ã¬Anyway you run, you run with poise
black and white horse
arching among us

You love is stag
in the white sand
oasis child
born into a mare
don't i know you better than the rest
all deception, all deception from you

Wilderness for miles
eyes so mild and wise
oasis child
born and so wild

Don't i know you better than the rest
all deception, all deception from you

Anyway you run, you run with poise
black and white horse
