You had the best
But you gave her up
'Cause dependency might interrupt
Idealistic will so hard to please
Put your indecisive mind at ease
You broke the set
Now there's only singles
There's no looking back
This time I mean it

Are you happy now?
How is it now?
Are you happy now?
Are you happy?

The uncertainty you had of me
Brought cloudy shady company
The tenderness habitual
A seldom-fading ritual
You killed the pair
Now only one is breathing

There's no looking back
This time I mean it

No more leaning on your shoulder
I won't be there, no more bother
If you feel you just might want me
That's too bad, I'm not the easy
The contemplator all those years
Now you must adhere
To your new career of liberation
You've been cast all by yourself
You're free at last You broke the set
Now there's only singles

There's no looking back
This time I mean it

You're by yourself
All by yourself
You have no one else
You're by yourself
