You know what I'm sayin', we go by YNW
And I don't think the world really ready for this right now
But we really from another fuckin' Earth, another planet
We like to say Venus, you know
'Cause these freaky lil' bitches like
Swallowin' our penis and then, other nasty things

I'm like hold up, wait a minute (Minute)
Uh, they let me in it (In it)

With the laser beam and we on that
