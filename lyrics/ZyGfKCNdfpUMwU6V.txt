I accidentally touched my head
and noticed that it had been bleeding
for how long i did not know.
What was this, I thought, that struck me?

What kind of weapons have they got?
the softest bullet ever shot...

I stood up and I said yeah!
I stood up and i said yeah
I stood up and i said Hey, Yeah!

From this moment on
blaring like a trumpet
comin from above us
and somewhere below

the confidence of knowing

decsending to relieve us
of the struggle to believe its so

I stood up and i said yeah
I spoke up and i said Hey
I stood up and i said hey yeah

And it seemed to cause a chain reaction
It had momentum it was gaining traction
it was all the rage it was all the fashion
the outreached hands had resigned themselves to

holding on to something that they never had

and thats too bad
'cause in reality there was no reaction

i accidentally touched my head
and saw that it was bleeding
for how long i did not know.
