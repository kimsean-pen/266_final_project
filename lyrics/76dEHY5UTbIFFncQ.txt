It broke my heart when you left me
I was so shattered I could hardly see
That you replied and you took my friend
How was I to know?
You said you cared but you lied to my face
You played the game making lots of mistakes
I gave my heart then you took control
How was I to know?
I was on my own

The end, the end
The end, when will it begin?

And now you think you're a rockstar
Glasses at night hiding who you are
You fooled around thinking you're a king
How was I to know?
I was all alone

The end, the end
The end, when will it begin?

The end, the end
The end, when will it begin?
The end, the end
The end, when will it begin?

God what would I not given to
Consider and death is delicate
Arms focused, so many its
Crimes of passion, hysteria
We stroke, squeeze out the bad part
And then look what you got the small doses
I pray that you're good to my skin
