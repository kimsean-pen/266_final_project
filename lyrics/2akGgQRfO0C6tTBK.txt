I folded all your shirts
Those dusty curtains
Now they're fresh and new
Your dance shoes and socks
In costume boxes
Piled up to the roof
Put fresh new double A batteries
In that old jam box you use
Just in case I get to see your face

Well our rent was paid
A few months late
And they say we got to move
Found this pretty house
A few miles out
But we didn't get approved
So we got this little apartment
With a cute extra spare room
Cause one day you might
Need to stay the night


Make sure you're drinking plenty water
I hope you're getting plenty rest
Been following online, we're fine
Just trying to do our best
But you're looking just like your father
Oh, I wish that he could see
God must have thought the world of you
To give you to little old me

Please give Shay a call, he's scared
And Tod, go to all his football games
Got a picture framed of you on stage
At your very first ballet
And I know that you won't answer
But I'll call you twice a day
Just in case today might be the day
I get to see your face
