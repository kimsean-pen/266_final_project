It's so cold, baby, it's dark outside
Winter coats creeping into the night
And it's so hard when I just wanna hold you tight
Breaks my heart, but nothing can break this ice
Hold on, hold on, baby, just be strong

And I'll be honest and let you go
This is the reason and you should know
Through all that you promise, I can't see
Not in your dreams ever have time for me?
So this is the reason I let you go
And I will be honest and you should know
Through all that you promise, I can't see

Not in your dreams ever have time for me?

And it's so quiet, baby, it's hard to breathe
Black as ink, the silence is deafening
And it's so hard to look into distant lights

And feel your heart solitary way from mine
So long, so long, baby, you're long gone

And I'll be honest and let you go
This is the reason and you should know
Through all that you promise, I can't see
Not in your dreams ever have time for me?
So this is the reason I let you go

I will be honest and you should know
Through all that you promise, I can't see
Not in your dreams ever have time for me?
