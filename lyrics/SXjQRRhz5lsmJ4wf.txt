Chewed the bone down too low
Got fed on tea and sympathy.
Blew the sail like the wind
I wish you were my enemy.

I was humble for you.
What a fool I've been to have
Laid so low (so low)
For so long (so long)
So low (so low).

Into that void of silence
Where we cry without sound

Where tears roll down
Where tears roll down

And when your mother's violence
Sent your soul underground

Where tears roll down
Where tears roll down

Drew the blade way, too slow
Was shackled by your honesty.
Made a mess, I guess I
Should have known
The life was lust and liberty.

Not a chance mutation
Or the last temptation
Ever laid so low (so low)
For so long (so long)
So low (so low).

Into that void of silence
Where we cry without sound.
Where tears roll down
Where tears roll down.

And when your mother's violence
Sent your soul underground.
Where tears roll down
Where tears roll down.
