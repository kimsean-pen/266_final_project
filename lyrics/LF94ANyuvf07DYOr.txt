Give me your heart, give me your song
Sing it with all your might
Come to the fountain
And you can be satisfied
There is a peace, there is a love
You can get lost inside
Come to the fountain
And let me hear you testify

Into the wild
Canyons of youth
Oh, there's a water to fall into
Weighless we'll dance
Like kids on the moon
Oh I will give myself to you
As soon as you start to let go

Give me your heart, give me your song
Sing it with all your might
Come to the fountain
And you can be satisfied
There is a peace, there is a love
You can get lost inside
Come to the fountain
And let me hear you testify

Wave after wave as we close too deep
Oh I reveal my mistery
As soon as you start to let go

Give me your heart, give me your song
Sing it with all your might
Come to the fountain
And you can be satisfied
There is a peace, there is a love
You can get lost inside
Come to the fountain
And let me hear you testify

There is a peace, there is a love
You can get lost inside
Come to the fountain
And let me hear you testify

This stone the mountain
Rising from the ground
There's no denying beauty makes a sound
We can't escape it
There's no way to doubt
This stone the mountain
Rising all around

Give me your heart, give me your song
Sing it with all your might
Come to the fountain
And you can be satisfied
There is a peace, there is a love
You can get lost inside
Come to the fountain
And let me hear you testify

There's a peace, there is a love
You can get lost inside
Come to the fountain
And let me hear you testify

You can get lost inside
(You can get lost inside)
You can get lost inside
Let me hear you testify

You can get lost
You can get lost inside
Let me hear you testify

You can get lost
You can get lost inside
Let me hear you testify
