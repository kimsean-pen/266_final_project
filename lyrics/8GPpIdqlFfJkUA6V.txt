Wings of light and luck,
And our bodies to the ground.
We couldn't take off,
But we sleep in our golden nights!
nights... nights... nights.
We sleep in our golden nights.
Against the laws...
Of gravity,
We almost reached...
Eternity...
We fight the rules
We fight the crown
We fight whatever...
Brings us down,
But we sleep in our golden nights,
But we sleep in our golden nights...
nights... nights... nights
But we sleep in our golden nights
But we sleep in our golden nights...
nights... nights... nights
With wings of light and luck,
And our bodies to the ground...
We couldn't take off
At least our thoughts were unbound.
With wings of light and luck,
And our bodies to the ground...
We couldn't take off,
But we sleep in our golden...
Sleep in our golden...
Sleep... Sleep... Sleep... Sleep.
Sleep... Sleep... Sleep... Sleep.
Against the laws...
Of gravity,
We almost reached...
Eternity...
We fight the rules
We fight the crown
Sleep in our golden Nigths...
