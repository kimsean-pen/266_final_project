Please let me help you bury your dead
They've made the incision and driven their industry's waste in your head

The pyres in the distance glow beyond the haze
The hypocrites bear witness to the end of days
This is your final warning, a war on freewill is coming

This disillusion, this ignorant display
Defies solution and emasculates disdain

The sheep march to the fire and wait to host the flies
Their greedy little maggots clean the wounds with pride
This is your final warning, a war on freewill is coming

They feast on the meat in bittersweet denial
And swallow the blood of poisoned truths
They pick at the meat, a bittersweet feast for all the liars

In idle servitude the worker pig so sad
The lizards in wither have risen to censor the thoughts in your head

The sheep are stoned and quiet choking on the lies
The lizards feed the fire without compromise
This is your final warning, a war on freewill is coming

They feast on the meat in bittersweet denial
And swallow the blood of poisoned truths
They pick at the meat, their bittersweet feast

Begging forgiveness in denial, your misery shows it's face
You drown in your weakness, the plasphemous river washes away your mistakes

Please let me help you bury your dead
They've made the incision and driven their industry's waste in your head

This is your final warning, the holocaust of thought is dawning

They feast on the meat in bittersweet denial
And swallow the blood of poisoned truths
They pick at the meat, their bittersweet feast
A bittersweet feast for all the liars
