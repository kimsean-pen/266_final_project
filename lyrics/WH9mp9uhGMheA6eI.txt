twelve and high on a Sunday
Feeling like we're grown
And we're nothing short of invincible
Invincible, invincible

It starts again
Can you feel it?
It takes your breath away
Stop saying that we're invincible

Around and round
You're uninviting, unrewarding
And I'm misinforming you
Misinforming you

We all want to be, want to be somebody
Right now we're just looking for the exit

This is the way I would have done things
Up against the wall
Up against the wall
You got me up against your wall

This is the way I would have done things
Up against the wall
Up against the wall
You've got me up against your wall

It's you and me on a Monday
The lies that we told
This is where we both go numb now

You broke my heart again this time
You're fading now you crossed the line
You've crossed the line

We all want to be, want to be somebody
Right now we're just looking for the exit

This is the way I would have done this
Up against the wall
Up against the wall
You got me up against your wall

This is the way I would have done this
Up against the wall
Up against the wall
You've got me up against your wall

Reaching out for a hand
It's not there
But you're not there
You're not there

This is the way I would have done this
Up against a wall
Up against your wall
This is the way we should have done
When we're up against a wall
Up against the wall
This is the way I would have done this
Up against the wall
Up against the wall
You got me up against your wall
This is the way I would have done this
Up against the wall
Up against the wall
You've got me up against your wall
