Nothing we can do or say is gonna make it go away
It's another time now, another time now
Even if you had my name, we'd be feeling just the same
I don't wanna be a-, wanna be ar-
I don't wanna be a
Be around, can't be around
I can't be around when were going down

Don't wanna sing that song
Don't wanna play along
Tell me what's going on
We're getting wrapped around the axle
Don't know what we have done
Don't know what's right or wrong
Tell me what's going on
We're getting wrapped around the axle

Everything we ever planned, everywhere we used to hang
It's another time now, another time now
I know something's on your mind, it keeps nagging all the time
You don't wanna be a-, wanna be a-
You don't wanna be a
Be around, can't be around
You can't be around when were going down

Don't wanna sing that song
Don't wanna play along
Tell me what's going on
We're getting wrapped around the axle
Don't know what we have done
Don't know what's right or wrong
Tell me what's going on
We're getting wrapped around the axle
Getting wrapped around the axle

Don't wanna sing that song
Don't wanna play along
Tell me what's going on
We're getting wrapped around the axle
Don't know what we have done
Don't know what's right or wrong
Tell me what's going on
We're getting wrapped around the axle

Getting wrapped around the axle
Getting wrapped around the axle
Getting wrapped around the axle
Getting wrapped around the axle
