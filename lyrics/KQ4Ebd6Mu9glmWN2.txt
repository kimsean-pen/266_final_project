We don't need any religion
We are strong and we are legion
We don't need any army
This whole world is our country

Anywhere these boots lead me
I know I will find somebody
Light and force have a name
Like a member of my family

Light and force have a name

Ostracized are welcome
No borders, no judgement
Be yourself, be strong and overcome
Tags are irrelevant

Secret society
Billion-headed hydra
We're one but we're many
Our lives aren't simulacra
We're One

We're strong and we're legion
We don't need any army
This whole world is our country

We don't need any religion
We're strong and we're legion
Not the problem but the solution
The stronger bridge between nations

Anywhere these boots lead me
I know I'll find somebody
Who can understand me
Who can understand
