and it's strange
how we're wasting our lives
novocane
when the pain helps us rise
here we stay
though it's only a clever game
running from our lives
and we linger on...
but if we try to lift up our eyes
replacing the lies
we own this moment
everything and everyone and in the end we all are one
the truth will not be denied
everything and everyone and in the end we all are one
the truth will not be denied

and it's strange
how we're selling our time and we wait
we are lost in a clever game
running from our lives
and they lead us on
but if we try to lift up our eyes
replacing the lies
we own this moment
everything and everyone and in the end we all are one
the truth will not be denied
everything and everyone and in the end we all are one
the truth will not be denied

everything and everyone and in the end we all are one
the truth will not be denied
everything and everyone and in the end we all are one
the truth will not be denied
