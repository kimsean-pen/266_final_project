Things were falling apart
say sure, I knew from the start
well I know, good things come to an end
please don't go

I wanted to get close to you
you said you wanted it too
heart's full, this rain, I cannot budge
stay cool, I'd hold your hand if you understood

I know, these truths I'll have to let
you go, he says relax be cool
these waves are seeping into me
my golden love will fall and you'll never see
forest floors covers what you used to mean
it'll never, never, never be the same
