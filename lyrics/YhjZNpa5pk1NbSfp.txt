I bet you're looking for a sorry
well I'm looking for one too
what goes on inside your heart
what makes you do the things you do
do you really talk to God
man I wonder what he tells you
maybe he has given up the way that I gave up too
well I hope that you're happy
without me
cause I wouldn't be
so you're burning all your bridges
are you moving on again
do you think you'll get to heaven
just by simply sneaking in
do you think that you're justified
in all your lies
well I think you're in for a surprise
