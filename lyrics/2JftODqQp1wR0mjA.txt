You were the one, I would say
We are the one and the same
But now it's in you, it's in you always
And on the hill of the days
When all the words were said
But now it's in you, it's in you always

And on the face of it, it's never forgetting
I follow it down, the cracks are indebted

Long way down
They don't need to let you know that
Long way down
It's a Long way down
They don't need to let you know that
Long way down

Far from the cracks in the bed
Downtown, the worries all may(?)
But now it's in you, it's in you always
Find all your reason to stay
Halftime, it's close to equate
But now it's in you, it's in you always

And on the face of it, it's never forgetting
I follow it down, the cracks are indebted

Long way down
They don't need to let you know that
Long way down
It's a Long way down
They don't need to let you know that
Long way down

They don't need to
(They don't need to let you know)
They don't need to
(They don't need to let you know)
They don't need to
(They don't need to let you know)
They don't need to
(They don't need to let you know)

Long way down
They don't need to let you know that
Long way down
It's a Long way down
They don't need to let you know that
Long way down
