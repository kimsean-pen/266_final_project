Wave back at me
Back is turned (back is turned)
If I failed once
The circuit burns

Saw you in the lampglow
You fade
Nothingness incarnate

Until I get there
Hidden I will be
Until I get there
Hidden I will be

Consternation
Eternal source
Overthrown
Stray from course

Saw you in the lampglow
You fade
Nothingness incarnate

Until I get there
Hidden I will be
Until I get there
Hidden I will be

Saw you in the lampglow
You fade
Nothingness incarnate

Until I get there
Hidden I will be
Until I get there
Hidden I will be
