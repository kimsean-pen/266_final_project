Bestial invasion

Early morning, mankind sleeps
There's a roaring in the air, impenetrable fog

Thunder rolls, lightning strikes
Hell storms rush over the Earth, but no rain

Hell storms
Rush over the Earth
Bestial invasion

Fog cleared up, people scream
They won't believe that the evil takes control

Hell storms
Rush over the Earth

Bestial invasion

Time is out, obsession spreads
Death rules, Satan's law is in command

Hell storms
Rush over the Earth
Bestial invasion

Jesus Christ exists no longer
Better pray to the new lord, he's almighty

Obey him
Obey!
