Aye-aye-aye-aye
Aye-aye-aye-aye

You wanna call me baby
You wanna earn my love
You wanna give me everything
That I've been dreaming of
You're dancing all up on me
Expecting something more
But shouldn't I know who you are
If I'm gonna be yours?

Hey boy tell me
Will you be there when I need you?
Hey boy tell me
Oh, why should I just believe you?
Don't get me wrong, I'm into you
But I'm just not that girl
So don't just tell me
Baby show me what you're made of

Aiaiai, aaai
If you wanna be with me
Aiaiai aaai
Show me what you got
Aiaiai, aaai
Go ahead and let me see
Aiaiai, aaai
Show me what you got

You're trying to get it popping
You're trying to change my mind
You're trying to take me home tonight
But you should take your time
And aybe I'm old fashioned
Or maybe you're too fresh
'Cause you could be a billionaire
But that won't get you this

Hey boy tell me
Will you be there when I need you?
Hey boy tell me
Oh, why should I just believe you?
Don't get me wrong, I'm into you
But I'm just not that girl
So don't just tell me
Baby show me what you're made of

Aiaiai, aaai
If you wanna be with me
Aiaiai, aaai
Show me what you got
Aiaiai, aaai
Go ahead and let me see
Aiaiai, aaai
Show me what you got

In case you didn't notice
I think you're really fly
But, baby, show me what you got
What you got inside

Hey, boy, tell me
Will you be there when I need you?
Hey, boy, tell me
Oh, why should I just believe you?
Don't get me wrong, I'm into you
But I'm just not that girl
So don't just tell me,
Baby show me what you're made of

Aiaiai, aaai
If you wanna be with me
Aiaiai, aaai
Show me what you got
Aiaiai, aaai
Go ahead and let me see
Aiaiai, aaai
Show me what you got

Aiaiai, aaai
If you wanna be with me
Aiaiai, aaai
Show me what you got
Aiaiai, aaai
Go ahead and let me see
Aiaiai, aaai
Show me what you got
