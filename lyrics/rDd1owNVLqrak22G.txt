I've seen people losing all of their faith
Before they knew what they were looking for
I swore I'd never ever do it again till this day
Words are all I have to give to you

You never seem to see it my way
Standing in the shadows I hear, people say
I got confessions to make, listen up
No one sleeps when I'm awake

The dreams, I dream the song, I sing for you
They're coming from my heart
Is my message getting through?

You know it hurt so bad just like I knew that it would
But I'd do it again, do it again if I could
Do it again if I could

I don't think you know what it's like
You should be careful what you're wishing for
And try to set your ego aside, you will find
A false peace of mind

You fall behind and everybody's getting tired of you
Standing in the shadows I hear, people say
I got confessions to make, listen up
No one sleeps when I'm awake

The dreams, I dream the song, I sing for you
They're coming from my heart
Is my message getting through?

You know it hurt so bad just like I knew that it would
But I'd do it again, do it again if I could
Hey, hey, hey, I want you to know, know, know, know
Hey, hey, hey, hey

'Cause the dreams that I dream and the songs that I sing
When I lost myself it had a different meaning
Shut down and closed imagine all of those
Hundreds of dreams, taking place around you

It hurt so bad just like I knew that it would
But I'd do it again, do it again if I could
But I'd do it again, do it again if I could
I'd do it again, I'd do it again, I'd do it again
I'd do it again if I could
