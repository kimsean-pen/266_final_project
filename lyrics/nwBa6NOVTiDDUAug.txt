Catered to undo
Mistakes you have made with you
The lessons catch up with you
As I lay awake in bed at night
The thoughts of life
Pass left and right
They appear on my sensory screen
Mistakes in route are quite expected
My existing plan is well protected
I light the bulb that soothes my brain
For not to learn is not to gain
Tarnished, are the thoughts
That have been told
Wise men, give me nothing real to hold
The writings of the past
Are paper thin
If I seek the truth
I'll look within
Boundaries never hold
They just cater to feelings of self control
In time you'll break through
An abundance of knowledge
Is there for you
The rise and the fall,
Protruding action
The thrill of it all
My fortress when I pass
My retribution, my afterclass
Sunlight, Moonlight,
Can you feel the warmth
Of past lives
Naked stars that come out at night
To make an effervescent dent in my time
Realize, conceptualize,
Prepare yourself for life's Retribution
