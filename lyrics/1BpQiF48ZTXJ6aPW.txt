We cross a country
In an airplane with the wings on fire
Hanging from the seatbelt sign
That's the one thing
There's no safety in desire
Preserving life is as good as dying

And these could be the best or darkest days
The lines we walk are paper thin
And we could pull this off or push away
Cause you and me have always been

So close
So close to giving up
So close to going all the way
So close
So close to taking off
So close to going nowhere
So close
So close to giving up
So close to going all the way
So close
So close to taking off
So close to going nowhere, nowhere

I heard you whisper over the hum of an electric chair
To live like this could take its toll
But you're no stranger
To the high of almost getting there
Are we losing touch or taking hold?

And these could be the best or darkest days
The lines we walk are paper thin
And we could pull this off or push away
But you and me have always been

So close
So close to giving up
So close to going all the way
So close
So close to taking off
So close to going nowhere
So close
So close to giving up
So close to going all the way
So close
So close to taking off
So close to going nowhere, nowhere

I wanna go there
I wanna go there
I wanna go there
With you

So close
So close to giving up
So close to going all the way
We're so close
So close taking off
So close to going nowhere
So close
So close to giving up
So close to going all the way
So close
So close to taking off
So close to going nowhere
