I have dreamt about
What it's like to die
And I saw myself
Becoming shadows again
Just like I did
When I was a kid
I saw my bones crack open
And all the things I've been hiding from you spill out
All the secrets that I never thought I'd tell anyone about
I am warm and I am bored
And I am drifting through this place
It's no better or worse than anything else
That's ever happened to me
But I wish that I'd never met
A lot of the people that I've met
Not because I don't like them
But because I only let them down
And when you disappoint everyone all the time
It's hard not to want to die
Constantly I feel this weird and shameful feeling
Like I'm being watched
By a thousand glowing, vengeful eyes
Behind one way mirrors in public bathrooms and in metro cars
And everywhere I go I know I'm not welcome
