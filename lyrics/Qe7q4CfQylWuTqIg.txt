Grab a barrel, a body odor
And a mouthful of clean teeth
Pluck a couple of boney shoulders
Wipe them clean
Cook 'em up on a hot hot heat

I'll never grow old
And ill never become
The man that i hoped i'd be
When i was young
I'll never be famous
I'll never be loved
'Cause soon we'll all be dust
Never be rich But ill never run out
I'll never get up and i'll never get down
Never be new but i'll never be rust
'Cause soon we'll all be dust

And if you laughed at something tender
You can try and turn your cheek
But in the end we'll all be powder anyway
'Cause
We're cooking on a hot hot heat
Ohhh

I'll never grow old and i'll never become
The man that i hoped i'd be when i was young
I'll never be famous
I'll never be loved
'Cause soon we'll all be dust
Never be rich but i'll never run out
I'll never get up and i'll never get down
Never be new but i'll never be rust
Soon we'll all be dust
Soon we'll all be dust, ohhh
Soon we'll all be dust
Soon we'll all be dust
Here we go

Cooking up a hurricane
So hurry get the table laid
I hope you like it homemade
You ready for your strangled eggs
You ready for your skewered heads
I hope you like it hot
This dinner's gonna need a special grace

Soon we'll all be dust
Soon we'll all be dust, oh
Soon we'll all be dust
Soon we'll all be dust
Here we go

Grace
Grace
Amen
Grace
Grace
Amen
