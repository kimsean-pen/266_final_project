Woke up this morning, it's a brighter day
I looked in the mirror, saw a new face
Cause I got myself together, steppin' in time
Everything's better, this day is mine

How do I look? you look good!
How do I feel? you feel good!
How do I look? you look good!
You're looking good and feeling gorgeous

Well, she walks real steady
In her high heel steppers
She got lots of style
She got lots of class

Yes I'm confident and self-assured
No holdin' back, not like before
Cause I know what I want, can't settle for less
Not tryin' to flaunt it, I just want the best
