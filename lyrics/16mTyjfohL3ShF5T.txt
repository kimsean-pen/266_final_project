Announcing your intentions
Easier said than done
Announcing your intentions
It's easier said than done

But it's better to say nothing
Than say something wrong
When you only want someone
When that someone is gone

Announcing your intentions
It's easier said than done

Hey you can ... me
Don't let that be a reason not to stay
Hey you can ... me
Don't let that be a reason to run away

Announcing your intentions
It's easier said than done
