I can see myself tucked in and fast asleep
Looking all peaceful but in my dreams I weep
From far up I'm looking down upon myself
And I wonder who it is that's lying there

I feel like in a world all beside myself
Afraid I won't wake up with no one there to care

I know someone used to watch me in my sleep
But some things seem just impossible to keep
I fight hard to bring it back into my mind
But to no use, it all seems to be a blank

I wonder what it was that had me defined
But one thing I know, I have myself to thank

I feel like I have amnesia
But I know it's myself I've lost
I wonder what's happened so far
And what might have been the cost

I'm not sure I want to know
Any of the things I've done
I don't know yet where to go
But I'll accept my past is gone

I feel like I have amnesia
And I've missed the heavenly host
I'm surprised I've come this far
Living without what I need most

I don't think I can go back
To the things that were before
Though I'm now always wearing black
I don't bemoan my life of yore

I wake up and feel like I should be at home
But I do not know this, it's not where I belong
My head is dazed and my mind is all confused
And I'm not quite sure that I'm really there

But the mirror shows me looking out, bemused
Into a blank place that could be anywhere

I feel like I have been left out in the cold
And it hurts to know that this is all my fault
I leave this place to find familiar ground
But the whole world seems to have been rearranged

Now my former self is nowhere to be found
And I know that it's myself that's changed

I feel like I have amnesia
But I know it's myself I've lost
I wonder what's happened so far
And what might have been the cost

I'm not sure I want to know
Any of the things I've done
I don't know yet where to go
But I'll accept my past is gone

I feel like I have amnesia
And I've missed the heavenly host
I'm surprised I've come this far
Living without what I need most

I don't think I can go back
To the things that were before
Though I'm now always wearing black
I don't bemoan my life of yore

I feel like I have amnesia
I feel like I have amnesia
