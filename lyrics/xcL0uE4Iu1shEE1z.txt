We'll sing love songs about heartbreak and grief
Sing it's not just music but the pains not brief
We sing, how your love is like a knife to the back
Well I was stabbed and bleeding
but still begging for attack

But I was looking through slow, slow glass
looking through slow
slow glass

Well I heard you been singing
Well I was, what I am
Well I never tried to change you, honey I'm your biggest fan
and I loved you back then
but I don't recognize you now

Yeah in fact we're almost strangers and I don't know how,
but I've been looking through slow, slow glass
Yeah I've been looking though slow, slow glass
