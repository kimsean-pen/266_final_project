Re-make,
Reform the consciousness.
Let the light bleed out of your eyes and mouth.
Seek the answers to the questions that constrain your mind this futile dimension.
We are the severed minds disconnected from the masses,
A world of free thinkers.
We are longing for an understanding of the universe around us when we barely understand the universe within our minds.
Free you mind!
Who will answer the call when it comes from within?
I stand before you bearing a flood of change;
I stand before you to undo,
and rearrange.
Remove the blindfold,
Realise the lies told,
See the world with new eyes.
Abra su mente a la realidad.
We are the severed minds disconnected from the masses,
A world of free thinkers.
So take this life and hold it for it's about to change.
Bleed out the coursing veins.
Who will answer the call when it comes from within?
