Do you remember once upon a time
When you were mine
The stars above were bright and new
I pulled them down for you
Just when I fell in love again
You said that all good things must end

Baby
That's just the way it is, baby
Whoah whoah
Baby
That's just the way it is, baby

I've never had a hand for solitaire
It's so unfair
That I should have my chance and lose
I feel like I've been used
To help you through another night
You spelled it out in black and white

Baby
That's just the way it is, baby
Whoah whoah
Baby
That's just the way it is, baby

The tides that once had carried you away
They bring you back today
The time has washed away my pain
I find that things have changed
And disappeared without a trace
You can't get back what you've erased

And I say
Baby
That's just the way it is, baby
That's just the way it is
Baby
That's just the way it is, baby
Oh, that's just the way it is
Baby
That's just the way it is, baby
Baby
That's just the way it is, baby
Baby
That's just the way it is, baby
Baby
That's just the way it is, baby, baby
Baby
That's just the way it is, baby
Baby
That's just the way it is, baby
Baby, baby
That's just the way it is, baby
