Campsides she would stalk
In the fog and the red lights, the fog and the red lights
Harsh moans drifted out with my voice
from the radio, my voice from the radio
I know you said it's killing june
You swore that you will be home soon
Soft ground, claiming moon
She loomed through the lost towns
Her hair up and window down
I roamed through the night and found her hiding in a dark home
It's halls burnt, windows broke
I know you said I shouldn't hide
Your teeth were sharp, my eyes were wide
I know you once, I swear i tried
Your jaw unlocked, my vocals cried:
"I will run from you
