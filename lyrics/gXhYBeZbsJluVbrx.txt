Creeping, throbbing
saunter from corner to wall
trying to part the whispers from shouting and calls
this will is itching
this want is making me soar
what is expected, to seem a happy whore

come on let's kills this
demands and notions
all this commotion is not worth it
come one just give this
a second coming
an age is dawning with all smiles and laughter

one foot forward will you be catching my fall
once i give i know you'll be claiming more
you've had me scratching
you have been talking me soar
what is expected, to carry you in my arms
