Divided by Wrath,
Of feeble God,
The One who took,
The Light away from... Man.

Rising from the Lake,
Of Eternity and Flames,
Forged of Black Fire,
The Angel of seventh... Heaven.

Angel of Light,
With Spear and Shield,
The Crown on his Head,
Of Formless Black... Fire.

Spark of the Flame,
The Light of Darkness,
Baptism of Wisdom,
Enlightening... of the Mind.

Take... the Symbol of Light,
This... Luciferian Crown,
Thus... know the Truth,
The... Light of the Abyss.

Lead us on the Path.
To Your Eternal Light,
The Sea of Knowledge,
The very truth of... all.

Divided by Wrath,
Of feeble God,
The One who took,
The Light away from... Man.
