A sign
that I've been praying for
a solemn augur, pure and true
to tell me what to do
A true
god that I can settle for
and spin my body in a long, slow arc
like how our problems are
Because I've been waiting on everyone
that I've been waiting on
because I've been waiting on everyone
to show up and throw me out
because I don't belong,
I'm not even sure I know those words.
(Because I've been waiting on everyone,
I've been waiting on)
A song
that I can sing along
I'll just wait and track the soot-tracks home
where I can be alone
Because I've been waiting on everyone
that I've been waiting on
Because I've been waiting on everyone,
to show up and throw me out of here.
Because I've been waiting on everyone
that I've been waiting on
Because I've been waiting on everyone
that I've been waiting on
to show up and throw me out of here.
