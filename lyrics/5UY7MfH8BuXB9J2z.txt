So here we are waking
Savages shaking
The road that we're taking
We've walked before

And if these times
Should seal our fate
You won't see me
At Heavens gate

Danger is lurking
Evil is working
Yet here we are hiding
Behind our doors

Come out come out
It's time to grow
Enjoy the ride
One more time before you go

According to Hoyle
All cards on the table
What else can you do
When life is unstable

The night's growing colder
The enemy bolder
But as you grow older
You cease to care

But if we run
Or try to hide
And turn our faces
We'll have no hopes
To keep alive

According to Hoyle
All cards on the table
Reactions cool
The world is unstable
According to Hoyle
All cards on the table
What can you do
When life is unstable

So here we are waking
Savages shaking
Here we are hiding
Danger is lurking
