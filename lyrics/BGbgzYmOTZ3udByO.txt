Where were you when I was lonesome?
Locked away with freezing cold.
Someone flying, only stolen,
I can't tell, this night's so old.

I don't wanna swim the ocean,
I don't wanna fight the tide,
I don't wanna swim forever,
When it's cold I'd like to die.

What was that, my sweet, sweet nothing?
I can't hear you through the fog,
If I holler let me go,
If I falter let me know.

I don't wanna swim the ocean,
I don't wanna fight the tide,
I don't wanna swim forever,
When it's cold I'd like to die.

I don't wanna swim forever,
I don't wanna fight the tide,
I don't wanna swim the ocean,
When it's cold I'd like to die.
