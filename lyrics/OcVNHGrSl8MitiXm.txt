Horns upon my head
Crimson eyes so dread
Beast of evil god

I'm invincible
Indestructible
Hell's eternal wrath embodied

You will face your demise
Heed the warning of Zodd the Immortal
Bound to fight
Kill and die
Nothing can stop this tide
The ultimate sacrifice

I erase my foes
Pulverize their bones
Tear them limb from limb

Let my name be feared
Let my blade be smeared
With the blood of kings and warhearts

You will face your demise
Heed the warning of Zodd the Immortal
Bound to fight
Kill and die
Nothing can stop this tide
The ultimate sacrifice

Terror swells
Inside your heart
Death calls to your flesh and blood

You will face your demise
Heed the warning of Zodd the Immortal
Bound to fight
Kill and die
Nothing can stop this tide
The ultimate sacrifice

You will face your demise
Heed the warning of Zodd the Immortal
Bound to fight
Kill and die
Nothing can stop this tide
The ultimate sacrifice
