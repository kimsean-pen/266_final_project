I'll keep swingin' for the fences
It's like this heart is defenseless
Against the passion that's pumpin' through my veins
Blood, sweat, tears
It's a callin'
And if I can't walk, then I'm crawlin'
It might flicker but they can't kill the flame
I can't stop
I can't quit
It's in my heart
It's on my lips
I can't stop, no
I can't quit
It's in my heart, yeah
I'm all in
Til the wheels fall off
Til the spotlight fades
I will lift your banner high
I will lift your banner high
And til the walls crash in
For the rest of my days
I'll lay it all on the line
Til the day I die
Til the day I die
Til the end of the line
Til the day I die
It's your name I'll glorify
It's runnin' deeper than the ocean
This ain't religion, it's devotion
365
Every minute, every day
So in the middle of the madness
They can stretch me out like canvas
But I ain't never gonna fit in their frame
I can't stop
I can't quit
It's in my heart
It's on my lips
I can't stop, no
I can't quit
It's in my heart, yeah
I'm all in
Til the wheels fall off
Til the spotlight fades
I will lift your banner high
Lord, I'll lift your banner high
And til the walls crash in
For the rest of my days
I'll lay it all on the line
Til the day I die
Til the day I die
Til the end of the line
Til the day I die
It's your name I'll glorify
Til I die
And they put me in the coffin
Don't matter if I'm on the road
Or I'm recordin'
Tell me what you think about me
That really ain't important
You know Imma represent um,
I ain't playin'
Can't afford to
I only got one life
And I get it though
And this is not an act
Not a movie
Not a TV show
I don't know what quittin' means
I don't ever take it slow
You know I'm on the grind
Me and Toby in the studio
Do it for the king
What you know about that?
Say you goin' harder
Mmmmmmmm I doubt that
You say you doin' work
But you're asking where the couch at
How you doin' work
When you're asking where the couch at?
God is not a crutch
You can use Him when you wanna
You only look to heaven
When you goin' through some drama
And when they goin' through some problems
And that's the only time they call Him
I guess I don't understand that life
Wonder why
Cause I'm all in
Til the day I die
Til the wheels fall off
Til the spotlight fades
I will lift your banner high
Lord, I'll lift your banner high
And til the walls crash in
For the rest of my days
I'll lay it all on the line
Til the day I
Til the day I
Til the day I die
Til the day, til the day I die
Til the day I die
Til the day I
Til the day I die
Til the end, til the end of the line
Til the end of the line
Til the day I
Til the day I die
Til the day, til the day I fall
Til the day I
Til the day I die
Til the end, til the end of the line
