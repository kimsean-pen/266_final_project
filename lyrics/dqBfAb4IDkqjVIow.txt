Keep my heart cuz I don't want it back.
And keep my hand cuz I was born for that.
It's been a long 12 months and I've been living around just fine.
But if you'd hear me out tonight.
Just give it a try.
Maybe it's been too long and I should let go.
Just say my good byes.
But if you'd forget that winter I'd give you my life.
You know I've never been the type.
Afraid to die.
It'd be for nothing if I couldn't say I tried.
I'd regret everything if you thought you left my life.
I've been alone a while.
Still want you back by my side.
I'll understand if you would rather leave me behind.
