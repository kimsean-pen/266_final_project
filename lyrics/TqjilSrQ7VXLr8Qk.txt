Swing, swing
Swing by a thread
Why do the things that I love,
Always leave me for dead.

Everytime I get knocked down, face to the floor
From rolling my dice,
Playing tug of war.

Don't let me fall
(Don't let me, don't let me)
No, don't let me fall by the wayside.

Creep, creep through the dead of the night,
The hardest of times bring the strangest delight.
You got to burn baby burn when the grass is dry,
If I go down in flames call it the fourth of July.

Don't let me fall
(Don't let me, don't let me)
No, don't let me fall by the wayside.

Ring, ring, it rings in my head,
That one little voice, I'd pay to forget.
Oh yeah it moves like venom running cold in my veins.
I rather sleep by myself and die from the pain.

Don't let me fall
(Don't let me, don't let me)
No, don't let me fall by the wayside.
