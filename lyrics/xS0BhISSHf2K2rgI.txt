Cremate the human race
The population has been reduced
A world condemned to horrid death
And the blood of others heeds their savior
An artificial homocide
The strong and feeble, all will die
Nothing left to say
Warmongers have to pay

Re-cremation!

Bodies rise up from the ground
Twice as twisted as before
Turning the life that we know how
To the one with knowledge but no laws
Legal butchery will destroy this so called structure
We want the ones with life
Let's begin the mass cremation

Genetic bonds are broken
Flesh ripped and torn
Look what's become of you
Will you ever meet your maker?
No, you'll suffer wil demise
To the ones with knowledge
Primitive actions will suffice
Tied down to the altar, we begin the sacrifice

Rancid death completes self-immolation
Your organs re-designed
Your brain's been under siege since you died
False life has taken over
