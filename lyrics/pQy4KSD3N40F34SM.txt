5 a.m.
Feels like moving underwater
Irresponsible
I think I got it from my father

I don't know
Why ya always seem to run out of love
But I'm pretty sure that I'll keep
On ending up in situations
That I didn't ask for

'Cause it's true, mistakes
Are part of everything I do
When I'm in a place where
You don't wanna find me
Ain't no love, so don't wait up for me
When I'm in a place where
You don't wanna find me
I can't stop, so don't wait up for me
When I'm in a place where
You don't wanna find me

I hold my head right now
But I'm stuck in treading water
It might take a while
But I'm fixing up my problems

I don't know
Why ya always seem to run out of love
But I'm pretty sure that I'll keep
On ending up in situations
That I didn't ask for

'Cause it's true, mistakes
Are part of everything I do
When I'm in a place where
You don't wanna find me
Ain't no love, so don't wait up for me
When I'm in a place where
You don't wanna find me
I can't stop, so don't wait up for me
When I'm in a place where
You don't wanna find me

'Cause it's true, mistakes
Are part of everything I do
When I'm in a place where
You don't wanna find me
Ain't no love, so don't wait up for me
When I'm in a place where
You don't wanna find me
I can't stop, so don't wait up for me
When I'm in a place where
You don't wanna find me

You don't wanna find me
You don't wanna find me
When I'm in a place where
You don't wanna find me
