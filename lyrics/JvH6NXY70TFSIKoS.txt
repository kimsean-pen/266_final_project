If you can't see through it all
If you can't see that I'm here
Did the moment pass you by
Are the words there out to try

You were what I thought you thought I knew
You moved, I followed you so fast
Made me run and then
I learned that taking time will make us last

Tell me if you love someone

She tells you how to live your life
But you're looking for something more
Don't wanna be nobody else
And you let them know that
It's not you, you're not afraid
Lines around your eyes will disappear

If you don't know where you go
If you won't leave til it's done
Tell me if there can't be one
We don't know where we should run

Watch and hear the noise
It makes you smile but it will make you burned
We're all rushing in around
Let's make it work and see what we have learned

Tell me if you love someone

She told you how to live your life
But you're looking for something more
Don't wanna be nobody else
And you let them know that
It's not you, you're not afraid
Lines around your eyes will disappear

All of this falls down
All of this falls down

Words that will fall out
Faster than your running, oh
And I heard that
Did you let them go to waste
They will fall out
Faster than your running, oh
And I heard that
Did you let them?

Tell me if you love someone
Do you love them all?

She tells you how to live your life
But you're looking for something more
Don't wanna be nobody else
And you let them know that
It's not you, you're not afraid
Lines around your eyes will disappear
