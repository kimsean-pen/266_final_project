Why do we cry when you know how the story ends?
How can you laugh when you know that it hurts your friends?
We've all been there once but you never left,
This is me coming back to get you out,
To say goodbye, to make amends.
I'm not leaving this place
Unless I'm leaving with you.
You're the only person with a half decent heart here,
And I know you will put it to use.
Until it's gone, gone, gone.
Gone, gone, gone.
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, yeah.

And you close your eyes for the big sleep
I hope you think of me.

And if you go, I'll be gone,
And you'll be left alone to live your life, as you please,
But someday you'll agree that I was always meant for you,
You were always meant for me and you will see: that you're impossible.
You're impossible.
You're impossible.
You're impossible.

Me and Mr. Dylan on the ride home,
We had a heart to heart about life.
But neither him or me could decide for ourselves
If we wanted to outlive that night.
Like two children on the playground of the unconfessed souls,
Abandoned by our mothers and our lovers and our foes.
If only we were brave enough to live the lives we stole,
What a wonderful world this could be!

And you close your eyes for the big sleep
I hope you think of me.

And if you go, I'll be gone,
And you'll be left alone to live your life, as you please,
But someday you'll agree that I was always meant for you,
You were always meant for me and you will see: that you're impossible.
You're impossible.
You're impossible.
You're impossible.

So how many more examples until we break?
How many sacrifices must we make?
Because we've all been there once before,
And it looks like we've returned once more.
Is this the beginning or the end?

The last two soldiers on the battlefield,
Survivors of the war.
They aim at one another while their mothers beg the lord.
"If you're listening, I'm missing him,
So somehow bring him home.
How did it come to this?"
So the soldiers lift their rifles,
And they're aiming at the head,
They think of their first love before they take their final breaths.
And somewhere in the distance they hear something someone said:
"How did it come to this?"

And as you close your eyes for the big sleep
I hope you think of me.

And as you close your eyes for the big sleep
I hope you think of me.
