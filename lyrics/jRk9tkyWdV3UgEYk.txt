Here I go again
Cold and lonely nights
And where's your body next to mine
Just imagine you're here holding me
The thought of you just burning me inside

People say you'll end up hurting me
If only they could see what I see
They'd know

Your love
One thing in life that I'm sure of
Light of my life baby, shine on
Make me believe you're the right one for me
Soon you'll be, forever be
Light of my life

Move me with your words and your tenderness
Reach the part of me I never knew was there
I just wanna thank the moon and the stars up above
Someone out there must have heard my prayer
I don't know why we waited so long
I only know we belong in each others' arms

Your love, one thing in life that I'm sure of
Light of my life baby, shine on
Make me believe you're the right one for me
Soon you'll be, forever be
Light of my life

I might be a million miles away
But I never lose my faith
Never let me down
When all others failed me
You were there, yes you were
Light of my life
Light of my life

Your love
One thing in life that I'm sure of
(Oh baby)
Shine on, make me believe you're the right one
The right one for me
(Light of my life)
Soon you'll be, forever be
(Light of my life)
Got me through the good times
Gave me something to believe

Light of my life
