Beneath the murky soil
The draw of the ancient spell
Swallowing everything in the ground
And then there was no sound

Twisting the roots of life
Distorting the obscure shapes
The day was creeping into night
And then there was no light

The mist was rolling from the mountains
Creatures were crawling under the ground
The darkness fell from the sky
And then there was no life

The spell was too strong
Too weak to resist its pull
The wind was frozen still as I took my last breath
But then there was no death

The days turned into years
The years turned into eternity
The natural order was twisted into dark harmony
Dark harmony

I created my own fears
The mist of sorrow encircled my thoughts
The demons came forth from the shadows
Bringing dark disease
Dark dark disease

With a sudden roar the ground trembled and cried
As the fire burned a hole in the sky
The light was swallowed into the ground
And the colors were broken in the night
And all the stars' creations were left to die

Now!
Let the dark disease wipe out all the living
Oh!
And let all the lands be filled with silence
In the night's cold embrace you left me astray
And the hope of new life fades away

Now!
Let all the lands be covered in black snow
Will the morning sun ever rise again
And let all the creatures of the forest turn into stone
The slow demise has begun
Will this be forever

From the realms below we ride
And in terror they run and hide
From the shadows of old we rise
Awaken from the dark
(From the dark slumber)

Over the ancient ruins we fly
Where the old kings go to die
And new kingdoms rising high
Awaken from the dark dark slumber

Awaken from the dark
(From the dark slumber)
Awaken from the dark dark slumber

Rise!

Creatures of the dawn
Crawling from the depths of the frozen earth
As the shadows were twisting and turning beneath the sun

The sound of the moaning beasts
Blaring through the forest
As they're roaming wild beneath the morning sun

Ride!
Ride with us again!
Fight!
And live as free men!
Die!
And be born again!

Ride! Ride!
Ride with us again!
Fight! Fight!
And live as free men!
Die! Die!
And be born again!

Die and be born again!

Centuries in darkness
Bound to ruthless ice and snow
As the dawn of the new world rises
We shall be free

By the fire we live and die
And the light of the sun fills our eyes
From the fire beyond the ancient stars we are born

From the realms below we ride
And in terror they run and hide
From the shadows of old we rise
Awaken from the dark

Over the ancient ruins we fly
Where the old kings go to die
And new kingdoms rising high
Awaken from the dark dark slumber

Awaken from the dark
(From the dark slumber)

As the old worlds fall behind
Our spirit reaches wide
With no fear breathing new life
Awaken from the dark dark slumber

Ride!
Ride with us again!
Fight!
And live as free men!
Die!
And be born again!

Ride! Ride!
Ride with us again!
Fight! Fight!
And live as free men!
Die! Die!
And be born again!

Die and be born again!
