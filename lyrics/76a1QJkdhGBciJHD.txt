You're uninvited, you're kicking at my door
Feeling restless, keep coming back for more
A heavy burden pulls me to the floor
Taking over, make no mistake I'm sure

Body, don't give up on me
Who are you to judge me, pulling at my arms and legs?
Body, don't give up on me
Everyone is powerless, unable to help anyway

What you're going through, I can't imagine
How you barely blink, like nothing has happened to you
I could plant a rose garden
For you to lay your head down on
And I could plant a rose garden
For you

Taking a toll, but I hold my head up high
I stay unfazed, but there's water in my eyes
Now

Body, don't give up on me
Who are you to judge me, pulling at my arms and legs?
Body, don't give up on me
Everyone is powerless, unable to help anyway

What you're going through, I can't imagine
How you barely blink, like nothing has happened to you
And I could plant a rose garden
For you to lay your head down on
And I could plant a rose garden
For you

Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

And I could plant a rose garden
For you to lay your head down on
And I could plant a rose garden
For you
And I could plant a rose garden
For you to lay your head down on
And I could plant a rose garden
For you
