Just another night no sleep
Staring at the wall again
Always know that I am in deep
When I start ignoring all my friends

I don't even know the problems
So how am I supposed to solve them
Still I'm drinking it stops them
I feel too much and nothing at all

Lately, I feel a little crazy
I wish someone could save me now
I can't take these emotions, damn these emotions

Lately, no I don't even know myself
Keep wishing I was someone else
I can't take these emotions, damn these emotions

Damn these emotions

Lately, I feel a little crazy
I wish someone could save me now
I can't take these emotions, damn these emotions

Lately, no I don't even know myself
Keep wishing I was someone else
I can't take these emotions, damn these emotions

Damn these emotions
