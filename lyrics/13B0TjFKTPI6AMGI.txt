Every day I wake and
Everything is broken
Turning off my phone just to get out of bed
Get home every evening
And history's repeating
Turning off my phone cuz it's hurting my chest

And heaven knows I'm not helpless, yeah
But what can I do?
I can't see the use in me crying
If I'm not even trying to
Make the change I wanna see

I can't sit and hope, I
Can't just sit and pray, that
I can find a love, when
All I see is pain

Falling to my knees
And though I do believe
I can't just preach, baby, preach
(Woah oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
I can't just preach, baby, preach

All I hear is voices
Everybody's talking
Nothing real is happening,
'Cause nothing is new
Now when all is tragic
And I just feel sedated
Why do I feel numb?
Is that all I can do?
Yeah

And heaven knows
I'm not helpless, yeah
But I'm only human
I can't see the use in me crying
If I'm not even trying to
Make the change I wanna see

I can't sit and hope, I
Can't just sit and pray, that
I can find a love, when
All I see is pain

I'm falling to my knees
And though I do believe
I can't just preach, baby, preach
(Woah oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
I can't just preach, baby, preach

And heaven knows I'm not helpless
But what can I do?
Can't see the use in me crying
If I'm not even trying to
Make the change I wanna see

I can't sit and hope, I
Can't just sit and pray, that
I can find a love, when
All I see is pain

I try to do the things, I
Say that I believe
I can't just preach, baby, preach
(Woah oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
I can't just preach, baby, preach
(Woah oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
I can't just preach, baby, preach

Falling to my knees
And though I do believe
I can't just preach, baby, preach
