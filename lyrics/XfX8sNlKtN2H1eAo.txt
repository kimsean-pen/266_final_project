Tell me how will this go?
Coz you already know
I can feel the time pass
And the feelings, they last

Do you spare me a thought-
One i've quietly caught?
When your guard's not around
Tell me, are you let down?

I'm sure there is not much
You might have missed out on
When your day is done
Do you feel unwelcome?

I can keep on waiting
By the window aching
Coz when i don't hear your sound
I don't feel that let down
