Bound for the black country
as the light recedes behind
Upon the white odonatar
Witch's vision as their guide

Be wary and keep watch tonight
Make sure your weapon's at hand
Here in the land where shines no light
death can strike you where you stand

There in the ruins
borne of darkness
Approaching the altar
as the arrows begin to fly

Beware the tribes of night
They take no one alive

So star wary and keep watch tonight
Make sure your weapon's at hand
Here in the land where shines no light
death can strike you where you stand
