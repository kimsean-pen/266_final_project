My heart is wasted
And cut up like a drug
And your tears they taste like
Vinegar and blood

And these conversations
Choke us 'til we're numb
No matter what we say
It never seems enough
So take me to the start,
and take me to that kiss
'cause I gotta know, baby,
what I'll forget
Sorry that I lost our love

without a reason why
Sorry that I lost our love
it really hurts sometimes
And I'm sorry, sorry

What do you want
what do you want me to say?
Sorry that I lost our love
Until the end of time
My voice is twisted
guilty goes the tongue
Your eyes are faded
that used to turn me on
And our skin is dangerous

villains when we touch
No matter what we feel
it never feels enough
So take me to the start
Take me to that kiss
'Cause I gotta know, baby
what I'll forget
Sorry that I lost our love
without a reason why
Sorry that I lost our love
it really hurts sometimes
And I'm sorry, sorry
What do you want
what do you want me to say
Sorry that I lost our love
Until the end of time
Sorry that I lost our love
without a reason why
Sorry that I lost our love
it really hurts sometimes
And I'm sorry, sorry
What do you want
what do you want from me?
So, sorry, sorry
What do you want
what do you want me to say?
Sorry that I lost our love
without a reason why
Sorry that I lost our love
it really hurts sometimes
And I'm sorry, sorry
What do you want
what do you want me to say?
Sorry that I lost our love
Until the end of time
