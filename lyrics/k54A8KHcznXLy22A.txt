2AM or something
And the past won't leave the present alone
Won't leave me alone
Underground's not for everyone
The things you learn lurking the graveyard
The graveyard

And although I'd never listen
Your voice is loud in my mind
In my god damn head boy
All the other animals are laughing at me and you
Yeah its just me and you

Can't escape this perspective
Or the mark that was left on me
Damaged goods for the world to see
They walk straight passed and away from me

Well I know what those hands can do
Wish you'd use them on me
Like I was an instrument
Feels good doesn't it

Yeah I know I'm lucky
This makes me feel better
This makes me feel better
This makes me feel better
This makes me feel better
This makes me feel better
This makes me feel better
This makes me feel better
I know I'm lucky
This makes me feel
Animal and real

2AM came around
Drove his car into the ground
Smother the pain with sound
Or it just bringing you down
Let's talk about saving face
Let's talk about putting me in my place
Come out and then walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
As long as you came
