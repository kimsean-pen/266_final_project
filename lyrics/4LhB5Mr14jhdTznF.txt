Tonight, it feels like a good day to die
Tonight, it feels like a good day to rise
Tonight, we live

Tonight, it feels like a good day to fly
Tonight, it feels like the gods are alive
Tonight, we turn, we ascend
We believe our divinity

I will not bow down
I'll rise through the sun
I'm transcending
I am claiming my throne
We are immortal
We rise from the wraith
We are eternal
You are my blood legion
My faith

I will not bow down
I'll rise through the sun
I'm transcending
I am claiming my throne
We are immortal
We rise from the wraith
We are eternal
You are my blood legion
My faith

We are immortal
We will rise up from the wraith
We are eternal
You are my blood legion
My faith
