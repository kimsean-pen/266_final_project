Does she wake up, put on make-up in the bathroom
And go to work, and stay real late and texts you she'll be back soon?
But her boss runs his fingers 'round her pretty blonde platinum 'do
I bet you never thought about that, did you?

And it's none of my business
And I don't wanna get involved
If you're thinking that she's good
I think you should be told

She's got you on your knees like a little boy
Everybody sees that you're just a little toy
She's got a boxful that her daddy likely bought
She asks you if you love her, and you nod and say "uh huh"

She wears short skirts so you don't ask her if you can check her phone
Talk about the guys at work so you feel ego-central
Like fancy cars and football teams and she like continental
With a European accent does she speak, oh so gentle

And it's none of my business
And I don't wanna get involved
If you're thinking that she's good
God no, God no

She's got you on your knees like a little boy
Everybody sees that you're just a little toy
She's got a boxful that her daddy likely bought
She asks you if you love her, and you nod and say "uh huh"

She tell you where it hurts but you don't seem to see
That when she's outta work, she's doing what you did to me
She tell you where it hurts but you don't seem to see
That when she's outta work, she's doing what you did to me

She's got you on your knees like a little boy
Everybody sees that you're just a little toy
She's got a boxful that her daddy likely bought
She asks you if you love her, and you nod and say "uh huh"
She asks you if you love her, and you nod and say "uh huh"
She asks you if you love her, and you nod and say "uh huh"
