I traced my family line
It ends up where the
Window-passing grainy days
Forgetting she's away

Here's the straight and narrow
Brought my wheelbarrow
And it's filled with the lies
And the dirt and the hurt

But I won't need someone
To let me be
I won't need someone
To let me be

Up, up the counting thrones
And the voice could soothe your
Captivate the senses
Like a ginger able rain

Those who've got the mirror
Curse the tainted pharaohs
Take off, respect fun
You might learn how it runs

But I won't need someone
To let me be
No, I won't need someone
To let me be

No, I won't need someone
To let me be
No, I won't need someone
To let me go, let me breathe
