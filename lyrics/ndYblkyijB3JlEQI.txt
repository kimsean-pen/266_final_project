a terrible signal
too weak to even recognize
a gentle collapsing
the removal of the insides

i'm touched by your pleas
i value these moments
we're older than we realize
...in someone's eyes

a frequent returning
and leaving unnoticed
a condition of mercy
a change in the weather

a view to remember
the center is missing
they question how the future lies
...in someone's eyes
the gentle collapsing
of every surface
we travel on the quiet road
...the overload
