How did you sleep
How did you feel
When you attacked? me
I cant believe
You didnt see
How cruel you could be
Those sleepless nights
Inside my head
No one there to save me
But you're so weak
To call on me
And now i can see clearly
I'm stronger than before
I'm not afraid
To face the enemies
A warrior
I'm braver than before
I'm not afraid
To face the world alone
A warrior
You raised a fist to me
Spat right at me
So everyone can see
I've felt so worthless
Time passes by
I realise
You're just a bully
What have i done
So damn wrong
Who'll miss you when you're gone
I'm stronger than before
I'm not afraid
To face the enemies
A warrior
I'm braver than before
I'm not afraid
To face the world alone
A warrior
I hold my head up high
Shout the name
A warrior
I wont look back
It's over now
You're starting a war
You've been defeated
You're starting a war
I am a warrior
You're starting a war
Warrior
You're starting a war
