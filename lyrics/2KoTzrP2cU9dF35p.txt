10.000 needles of light
Pin the drugs of last night
Kill the cigarette now sleep
Let the wolves upon the sheep

The wings of the world move slow in this hall
And the hunger of hope it starts to starve

God of Chertograd
Lick the sounds that bleed from his mouth
God of Chertograd
Rip the heavens with the horns of the south

How strong the weakness is
Exhale you fail to resist
Shut the blinds, and rewind
Let the ghost into your mind

The wings of the world move slow in this hall
And the hunger of hope it starts to starve
