When the toil of the hours is
Like a field filled with flowers
You're far away
Cause you only want to be needed
At the sink with a soft shine
And your mind is a headline
You're far away
And you dream the day without eating

Patience is a virtue, too much pacing
Only hurts you
You're tucked away
When you need to set out and meet it

And the fright of the friction
And the soul's indecision
Keeps you at bay
Cause you only want to be needed

Sixteen and what have you found out
Sweetly and a little bit stoned out
Why do you give and not receive?

I am a little bit freaked out
Why give but never go seek out?
Why do you hide behind the scenes?
Fortune and a little less promise
Ripped jeans and a little red sundress
What sings when you're too weak to speak?
Falsely but a little bit sweetly
My teeth are falling out freely
My head is not where I will sleep

Why do you hide behind the scenes?
Why do you give and not receive?
When the feel of a flower
Keeps you home for an hour
Throw it away
There's a garden there to be deep in
And when you stand
At attention
Feeling strong, without tension
It's far away
But it's never there when you need it
And the fright at the friction
And the soul's indecision
Keeps you at bay
Cause you want someone to come free it
