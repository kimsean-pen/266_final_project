Tell me who doesn't love
What can never come back?
You can never forget how it used to feel

The illusion is deep
It's as deep as the night
I can tell by your tears you remember it all, oh

I am paralyzed by the blood of Christ
Though it clouds my eyes
I can never stop, never stop

How it feels to be dry
Walking bare in the sun
Every mirage I see is a mirage of you
As I cool in the twilight
Taste the salt on my skin
I recall all the tears, all the broken words

I am paralyzed by the blood of Christ
Though it clouds my eyes
I can never stop, never stop

When the sunset's glow drifts away from you
You'll no longer know
If any of this was really true at all, oh

I am paralyzed by the blood of Christ
Though it clouds my eyes
I can never stop, never stop

Tell me who doesn't love
What can never come back?
You can never forget how it used to feel

I am paralyzed by the blood of Christ
Though it clouds my eyes
I can never stop, never stop
I am paralyzed by the blood of Christ
Though it clouds my eyes
I can never stop, never stop
