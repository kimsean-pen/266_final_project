To move through searing peace
Background- i found a way to put aside
The innocence I breathe
Background- to be in touch with your desire
Forsaking all you've seen
Background- with traces of an open mind
The eminence to feel
Background- Enter the event horizon
In our embrace I believe, I believe
In our embrace I believe, I believe
*Unknown*
Sensual humanity
Enchanting thoughts that bring
Background- A mystic sensuality
An open heart that beats
Background- A rhythm of reality
Adventures we can be
Background- A hunger one can never tame
Open and receive
Background- A facefull elaborate
In our embrace I believe, I believe
In our embrace I believe, I believe
