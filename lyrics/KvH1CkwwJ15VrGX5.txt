In your dreams, hearts shake
Nerves scream, minds break
Heavens turn, grounds crack
Prayers burn, burn black

And it? s all there inside of you
Blitzkrieg It? s deadly, dark, cold!
Can you feel the explosion?
Now lean back and enjoy the show!

Blitzkrieg!
(Blitzkrieg!)
Blitzkrieg
BOOM!

Blitzkrieg!
(Blitzkrieg!)
Blitzkrieg
BOOM!

Hope fails, death shines
Long nails, hell? s vines
Terrors speak, walls fall
Addictions seek, seek it all

And it? s all there inside of you
It? s deadly, dark, cold!
Can you feel the explosion?
Now lean back and enjoy the show!

Blitzkrieg!
(Blitzkrieg!)
F Blitzkrieg

BOOM!
Blitzkrieg!
(Blitzkrieg!)
F Blitzkrieg

BOOM!
This is the end
Still your need is driven on, driven on
As we trigger one last bomb

Wounds bleed, tears ride
Demons feed, angels hide
Fathers sigh, mothers weep
Children cry, crying deep

And it? s all there inside of you

Blitzkrieg It? s deadly, dark, cold!
Can you feel the explosion?
Now lean back and enjoy the show!

Blitzkrieg!
(Blitzkrieg!)
F Blitzkrieg

BOOM!
Blitzkrieg!
(Blitzkrieg!)
F Blitzkrieg
BOOM!
F the world with a gun and a broken blade!
This is the end
Still your need is driven on, driven on
As we trigger one last bomb
This is the end
Still your need is driven on, driven on
As we trigger one last bomb
This is the end
Still your need is driven on, driven on
As we trigger one last bomb
