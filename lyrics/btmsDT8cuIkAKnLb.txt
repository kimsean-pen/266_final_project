Baby, baby
I'm just trying to find my way in
Face it, our hearts are racing
I don't think that we need oxygen where we're going
You've gotta take a chance sometime
Jump in the water with me now
I don't think that we need oxygen
Cause our love's deeper than the ocean
Give me your devotion
I'll always be open
Girl I love you
I can't hide it from the world no
Promise you it's for sure
Just in case you don't know
That I love you

Save me, Oh you saved me
I was trying to find my way in
Face it, our hearts are racing
I just think its worth acknowledging, where we're going
You've gotta take a chance sometime
Jump in the water with me now
I don't think that we need oxygen
Cause our love's deeper than the ocean
Give me your devotion
I'll always be open
Girl I love you
I can't hide it from the world no
Promise you it's for sure
Just in case you don't know
That I love you
