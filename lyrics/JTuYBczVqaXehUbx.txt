Tearing down the hallowed walls
Casting out the sacred priests
Subjugation by cynical eyes
The rules of war to violate

Mental disease
Pious deceit
Ritual decapitation
Conflagration

Embracing the evil
The holy war to rage within
Spitting death revealed
Erased reality
Kill them if they move
Their inner fear released
Save them if they convert
Conflagration sealed

The taste of blood on forked tongue
Sarin to numb your flinching nerves
They are slaves of confidence
Perished on the crimson dirt

Mental disease
Pious deceit
Ritual decapitation
Conflagration

Embracing the evil
The holy war to rage within
Spitting death revealed
Erased reality
Kill them if they move
Their inner fear released
Save them if they convert
Conflagration sealed

Death prevails at dark horizons
To fulfill the empty dreams
Spitting sparks to set the fire
Concrete graves preserve the sins

Mental disease
Pious deceit
Ritual decapitation
Conflagration
Mental disease

Embracing the evil
The holy war to rage within
The spitting death revealed
Erased reality
Kill them if they move
Their inner fear released
Save them if they convert
Conflagration sealed
