Where's the truth we knew and once believed
It disappeared when we were young
Where's the world we used to know back here
When we were so young
Comes a time
There comes a time
We fade away, we fade away
There comes a time
Comes a time
We fade away, we fade
Doesn't come around here no more
Like when we were young, so young
Where are the promises we once made
They fade away, they fade
Comes a time
There comes a time
We fade away, we fade away
There comes a time
Comes a time
We fade away, we're fading away
Fade away
Where's the truth we knew, and once held dear
It disappeared when we were young
Where are the promises we once made
They fade away, they fade
Fade away
This song is not a love song
