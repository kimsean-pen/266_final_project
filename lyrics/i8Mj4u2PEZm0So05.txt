I need a ride
I need a ride out of here
I need to think
I need to stop and think of what

It grabs my thoughts
It brings me down
Not that anyone cares

And everything
I ever try to do
It takes it's time
With days and nights, too

I didn't know
I cried and cried
But it wasn't the same
But someone loves you

I find lives like this
No fun, no fun
No rays of light this time
No hand-me-downs

You shouldn't think of it all that much
A whole world of things to touch
I don't really know and I've seen everything
But someone loves you
But someone loves you
