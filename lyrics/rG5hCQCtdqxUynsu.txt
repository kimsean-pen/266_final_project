I believe in roses, but only from the heart
And if it's not sincere, baby then I don't want no part
I believe in one love, baby, true monogamy
What I don't know can't hurt me, well, that's not the way I see

If you believed in me you won't mess around
It's not like I don't know you've been with every girl in town
You got a lot of nerve to think I just close my eyes
While you walk around so full of it I give you my surprise

I don't need your kinda love, I don't need your kinda trust
I don't want you anymore
I don't need your kinda kisses, I don't want to be your Mrs
I don't want you anymore, no

I don't need your kinda love, I don't need your kinda trust
I don't want you anymore
I don't need your kinda kisses, I don't want to be your Mrs
I don't want you anymore

I believe that angels watch everything we do
And all the wrong you're doing just might come back on you
I believe in phone calls when you're not by my side
Especially when it's lonely in the middle of the night

If you believe that true love is only made in bed
Lord, have mercy on you, chivalry is dead
You got a lot of nerve to think, to think that I'm still down
While you've taken me for granted, boy, I'm through, I'm outta town

I don't need your kinda love, I don't need your kinda trust
I don't want you anymore, no
I don't need your kinda kisses, I don't want to be your Mrs
I don't want you anymore

I don't need your kinda love, I don't need your kinda trust
I don't want you anymore, no more
I don't need your kinda kisses, I don't want to be your Mrs
I don't want you anymore, no baby

So baby, you can kiss this girl goodbye
I'm through with you, moving on with my life
No more pain, no more fears
I'm moving on, I'm keeping on, I'm through with all the tears

Your kinda love, your kinda trust
I don't want you
Don't want you, don't need you
Can't have you

Your kinda kisses, to be your Mrs.
I don't want you

I don't need your kinda love, I don't need your kinda trust
I don't want you anymore, no
I don't need your kinda kisses, I don't want to be your Mrs
I don't want you anymore

I don't need your kinda love, I don't need your kinda trust
I don't want you anymore, no
I don't need your kinda kisses, I don't want to be your Mrs
I don't want you anymore

I don't need, don't want you
Don't need, don't want
Don't need that kind of love
Don't want your kind of love

I don't need, don't want you
Don't need, don't want
Don't need that kind of love
Don't want your kind of love

Don't need it
Don't want it
Don't need it
Don't want it

Don't need it
Don't need it
Don't want you, don't need you
Don't want you
