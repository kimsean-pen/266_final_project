Go!

Blink of an eye
It can describe
How long we've stood tall faced defeat
And all because
We can recall
There is no value in deceit
Intent destroyed
And left devoid
When one embraces their conceit
But lifting up with power to fill your complete

We're better than we used to be
But we still have so far to go

Won't be broken we won't live in the past
No we won't be broken we have come too far for that
No we won't be broken we'll live what's in our hearts
No we won't be broken we're free

Now time will tell
If in this hell
We can believe in what we see
So take away the power from the elite

We're better than we used to be
But we still have so far to go

Won't be broken we won't live in the past
No we won't be broken we have come too far for that
No we won't be broken we'll live what's in our hearts
No we won't be broken we're free

Bring it down
Make their failure complete
Make their failure complete

Won't be broken we won't live in the past
No we won't be broken we have come too far for that
No we won't be broken we'll live what's in our hearts
No we won't be broken we're free

We're free
We're free
Won't be broken we won't live in the past
We're free...
