I spent too much time in my room
I keep too many secrets from you
I like to be alone but it's bad for me
Because I spend too much time in my room

I spend too much time on my phone
I know I've said I liked being alone
But I care way too much about what they think
So I spend too much time on my phone

My mama don't like my tattoos
So I had to act like I do
The only thing that I learned in school
Is life treats you well if you're cool

I spend too much time in my head
Wish I could say what needs to be said
But no one seems to care about honesty
So I spend too much time in my head

My friends, they all smoke cigarettes
By Wednesday I'll be smoking one too
My brother said he said he don't know me anymore
What the hell am I supposed to do?

Sometimes I still think about you
I don't tell you all the things I used to
Don't like to admit that it's bad for me
But I spend too much time in my room
