Are you in
Or are you out?
The words are stones in my mouth
Hush little baby
Don't you cry
Truth comes down
Strikes me in the eye

Turning seasons within
Brand new nails across my skin
Who am I to imply?
That I was found
That I found you in the white

To overcome this I become one with
The quiet cold of late November
If you don't see I'll remain unseen
Untill there's time to be rememebered

So I had a green light
I was lost in city lights
Not far from a try
This is not our last goodbye

So I found you
Found a way all through
The quiet cold of inner darkness
And now that you're here
It becomes so clear
I have waited for you always
