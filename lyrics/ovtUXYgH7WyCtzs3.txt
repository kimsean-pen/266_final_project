Out on the tar plains.
The glides are moving.
All looking for a new place to drive.
You sit beside me.
So newly charming.
Sweating dew drops glisten fresh in your side.

And the sun drips down bedding heavy behind.
The front of your dress all shadowy lined.
And the droning engine throbs in time with your beating heart.

Way down the lane away.
Living for another day.
The aphids swarm up in the drifting haze.
Swim seagull in the sky.
Towards that hollow western Isle.
My envied lady holds you fast in her gaze.

And the sun drips down bedding heavy behind.
The front of your dress all shadowy lined.
And the droning engine throbs in time with your beating heart.

And the sun drips down bedding heavy behind.
The front of your dress all shadowy lined.
And the droning engine throbs in time with your beating heart.

Sing, Blue Silver.

And watching lovers part.
I feel you smiling.
What glass splinters lie so deep in your mind.
To tear out from your eyes.
With a thought to stiffen brooding lies.
And I'll only watch you leave me further behind.

And the sun drips down bedding heavy behind.
The front of your dress all shadowy lined.
And the droning engine throbs in time with your beating heart.

And the sun drips down bedding heavy behind.
The front of your dress all shadowy lined.
And the droning engine throbs in time with your beating heart.

Sing, Blue Silver.

Sing, Sing Blue Silver
