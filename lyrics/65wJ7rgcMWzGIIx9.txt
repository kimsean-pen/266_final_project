Patience is overdue.
My mouth has caught up with you.
Your tone hides regret.Yet you won't say it.
Do you even know yourself like I do?

A normal view for me and you is upside down. Oh it's true. So confused.
Plain and dull. Dark and grey. No words to say. Oh it's true. I don't see you

How could I be so blind to love? Can you even live with yourself?
You're such a selfish soul. You're wretched and your heart is cold.
You'll never find my love again.
Your life is meaningless. Yet you don't know this.
Do you even love yourself like I do?

A normal view for me and you is upside down. Oh it's true. So confused.
Plain and dull. Dark and grey. No words to say. Oh it's true. I don't see you
