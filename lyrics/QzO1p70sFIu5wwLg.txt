If the froggy come up-a with his
Satchel in his hand,
Then he reachs in the front and
Dump a mile of sand
Across the rug, along the hall
Up to the umbrella stand
That you've been watchin' all the time
Watchin' all the time

And if a forest grows up
From the dirt on the floor,
Then the frog with the satchel had just
Dumped beside the door.
You just startin' to get worried,
You ain't going out no more
And it's confusin' to your mind ----
Just consider this:
You can be scared when it gets too real
You can be scared when it gets too real
But you should be diggin' it
While it's happening. (Yes!)
But you should be diggin' it
While it's happening
'cause iy just might be
A one-shot deal

You can be lost
And you can wanna be found.
But keep an eye on that frog
Whenever he jump around
Just keep a-watchin' him
You oughta be watchin' him
Just keep a-watchin' him
You wanna be watchin' him
And see if he has brought along
A little bag for you, rant!
