First you took, lift me up
Twist my heart, venture out
I can bark and realise
Waiting for a call can get you out of my mind
Waiting for a call can get you out of my mind
Simply gone is where you are
You're out of place and lost in time
You visualise inside your brain
What is it good staying out of my mind?
Thoughts inside the head, out of my mind
Conversations to take, move from you
Baby, 'cause you're of my mind
Waiting for a call can get
Can get you out
Out of my mind, out of my mind
Waiting for a call can get you out of my mind
Out of my mind, out of my mind
Waiting for a call can get you out of my mind
Out of my mind, out of my mind
Waiting for a call I can get you
