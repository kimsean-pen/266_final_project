You
Are all I can remember
After all that we've been through

Forever in my heart
Now I'm through
And June feels like november
So can't believe it's true

Too long we've been apart
One more night I wanna be with you
Where I wanna hold you tight

It feels so right
Tonight
So leave it up to you

And i think the time is right
To stop the fight
One more night I wanna be with you

Where I wanna hold you tight
It feels so right
Tonight

So leave it up to you
And i think the time is right
To stop the fight

Stop the fight.
Stop the fight.
Why can't true love be forever

Why did my dream explode
The day you went away
Cause i will keep the spell together

I wish you well of hope
A girl from yesterday
One more night I wanna be with you

Where I wanna hold you tight
It feels so right
Tonight

So leave it up to you
And i think the time is right
To stop the fight
One more night I wanna be with you
Where I wanna hold you tight
It feels so right
Tonight
So leave it up to you
And i think the time is right
To stop the fight
Hey check it out now
