Treading
The glacier head
Looking hard for
Moments of shine
From twilight
To twilight
Ahhhhh...
(Hopelandic)
Ahhhhh...

Aurora
Goddess sparkle
Shoot me
Beyond this suffer
The need
Is great
Aurora
Ahhhh...
(Hopelandic)
Ahhhh...

Aurora
Goddess sparkle
A mountain shade
Suggests your shape
I tumbled down
On my knees
Fill the mouth
With snow
The way it melts
I wish
To melt
Into you
Aurora
Ahhh...
(Hopelandic)
Ahhh...

Spark the sun off
Spark the sun off
Spark the sun off
Spark the sun off of me
