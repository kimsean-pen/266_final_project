We ride this heartless road
I curse our song on the radio
We fly, we flick and float
Turning upside down in the afterglow

She said, oh
She don't know
Where I'll go
Where will I go

But I know
Know she knows
Every time
I tell her so

Oh, I have a coat to hold
Her head light and ready to go
Tonight, I'm awake, I know
We're calling out like we're never alone

She said, oh
She don't know
Where I'll go
Where will I go

But I know
Know she knows
Every time
I tell her so

I'll go
Where she goes
Every time
She tell me so
