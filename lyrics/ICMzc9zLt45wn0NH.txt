The conflict must start right now
Cuz we're only wasting time
There's only one way to go from here
Step straight across the line

I am the triumph of the will
I am the blood bound to spill
And every time I close my eyes
The monster come alive
I am the thrill
I am the kill
The triumph of the will

The storm isn't over yet
And the war has just begun
There's only one way to go from here
And you will need a gun

I am the triumph of the will
I am the blood bound to spill
And every time I close my eyes
The monster come alive
I am the thrill
I am the kill
The triumph of the will

The sacred and divine
7.62 X 39
5.56 and 45
I am the X, I am the Y

I am the triumph of the will
I am the blood bound to spill
And every time I close my eyes
The monster come alive
I am the thrill
I am the kill
The triumph of the will
