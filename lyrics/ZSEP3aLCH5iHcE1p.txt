This ain't nothin' but a summer jam
Bronzed skin and cinnamon tans, whoa!
This ain't nothing' but a summer jam
We're gonna party as much as we can

Hey, ooh, hey
Summer jam alright
Hey, ooh, hey

Tonight hotties wearing "Prada"-skirts
Real tight temperature is rising
Feelin' real hot in the heat of the night
Midnight the party won't stop
until the morn' light
I'm skopin' out the hotties with the light eyes
Be with me tonight
Can't get you outta my mind
I can't lie
Cause a girl like you is so hard to find
I'm waiting for the day to make you mine
Cause I can't take it
This ain't nothin' but a summer jam
Bronzed skin and cinnamon tans, whoa
This ain't nothin' but a summer jam
We're gonna party as much as we can

Hey, ooh, hey
Summer jam alright
Hey, ooh, hey

Moonlight cruisin' down the boulevard
Strobe lights watching you your body's tight
Alright looking kinda freaky to me
Can't get you out of my mind
I can't lie
Cause a girl like you is so hard to find
I'm waiting for the day to make you mine
Cause I can't take it

This ain't nothin' but a summer jam
Bronzed skin and cinnamon tans, whoa
This ain't nothin' but a summer jam
We're gonna party as much as we can

Hey ooh hey
Summer jam alright
Hey ooh hey

This ain't nothin' but a summer jam
Bronzed skin and cinnamon tans, whoa
This ain't nothin' but a summer jam
We're gonna party as much as we can
This ain't nothin' but a summer jam
Bronzed skin and cinnamon tans, whoa
This ain't nothin' but a summer jam
We're gonna party as much as we can

Hey ooh hey
Summer jam alright
Hey ooh hey
Summer jam alright
