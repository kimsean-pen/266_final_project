The damage is done, it doesn't feel right.
I hope that you can sleep without me by your side.
The damage is done, there's nothing to prove.
How could I ever put my faith in you?

We're lost in time, there's no way to fight for myself anymore.
You can stay or leave, there's no inbetween.
This cannot be ignored.
The difference between you and me, speaking with sincerity, your flaws have just begun.
No, what's done is done.
Can't rewind, we've all moved on
I need you like water in my lungs!

The damage is done, it doesn't feel right.
I hope that you can sleep without me by your side.
The damage is done, there's nothing to prove.
How could I ever put my faith in you?

Back against the wall, unpredictable.
How your mind can change.
If you could practice what you preach,
then maybe I could still believe in what you say.
Where will you stand when I'm gone?

The damage is done, it doesn't feel right.
I hope that you can sleep without me by your side.
The damage is done, there's nothing to prove.
How could I ever put my faith in you?

I can feel my skin crawl.
Skin crawling on the outside.
Eyes rolled back, like I'm staring through the inside.
A lost cause, you're never going to realize.

How could I ever put my faith in you?

The damage is done, it doesn't feel right.
I hope that you can sleep without me by your side.
The damage is done, there's nothing to prove.
How could I ever put my faith in you?

The damage is done!
