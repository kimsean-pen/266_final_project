All across the scenes the statues crumble
We cherished the seconds, counted the days
And people move with lines across their faces
Embracing each other with a smile

For sanity's sake, sanity's sake, sanity's sake
For sanity's sake, sanity's sake, sanity's sake

We'll remember distant times and places
We'll remember summer sun that yields
Shed our bodies heart and soul for love's sake
Civilizations wax and wane.

Inocence will fade away like Autumn
Likewise the dream of youth, the task
And we shall be at peace upon our parting
With the thoughts of loved ones in our hearts

For sanity's sake, sanity's sake, sanity's sake
For sanity's sake, sanity's sake, sanity's sake

So let the sunrise light up the distnat shores
And we'll remember last days of Rome again.
