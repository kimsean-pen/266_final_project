Black light is crawling
Hidden as the womb
Your flesh will be so soft
When there is terror
In your blood

Forced...
Into possession
From legion
There is no escape

Drink with the wicked
The urine from the pool
Entering the one who
Possessed knows more
Than all

Forced...
Into possession
From legion
There is no escape

No escape
