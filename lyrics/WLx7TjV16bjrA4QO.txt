We wave bye bye to the city
Its rarity and energy
From the east is how we'll come
Just like the sun as it breaks the canopy

The weaponry, ideas, flames and reverie
For when the waste gets through the car, with no one
Just a sense of something

All the way
We're okay
Safe and sound
Far from home

The south is where we'll be
Unfamiliar and free
In the west is where we'll rise
Just like the smoke as it starts to hurt our eyes

The weaponry, their wings dear of third degree
Can't forget what they don't know, so far below
They think we got harder

World away
We're okay
Safe and sound
Far from home

All the way
We're okay
Safe and sound
Far from home
