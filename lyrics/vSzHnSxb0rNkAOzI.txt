TRAILS AND PASSES

Drips of blood fell down my chin
I Feel so hollow deep within
I hope Ill ever cross your path again

Cause you made me feel it
And I always believe it

Im strapped and tied on island shores
Without no comfort, cut of cure
You really had to fool me in the end

Cause you made me feel it
and I and always believed it

Mind your walk
I will follow your steps
Your Trails and passes,
Can you scent my breath

I made vows towards myself
Ill catch you falling in the bend
No sudden turns will benefit your run

Cause you made me feel it
But Ill never believe it

Stand steady for the final call
You'll hear it echo more and more
A sudden distant comfort for you now

Cause you made me feel it
but Ill never believe it

Mind your walk
I will follow your steps
Your trails and passes,
Can you scent my breath

Mind your walk
I will follow your steps
Your trails and passes,
Can you scent my breath
