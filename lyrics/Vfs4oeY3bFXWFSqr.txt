If we were ghosts
You could see inside of me, right into my soul
To see what makes me up but focus on the holes
I'd be the world around myself
Hopelessly spinning 'round you yeah
Turning every leaf and stone
But that's not the way it goes

I have to wait till I get to the other side
Just to see you, just to see you
I have to wait till I get to the other side
Cause I never, never got to say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

If we were ghosts
Floating high above the world
Little would they know
That to end is to begin
Least that's what I hope
That for a moment I could be
Something a bit more complete yeah
But we never keep what makes us whole
But that's just the way it goes

I have to wait till I get to the other side
Just to see you, just to see you
I have to wait till I get to the other side
Cause I never, never got to say goodbye

I will miss with every breath I take
That shadows sadness flows through everything
That shadows sadness flows through everything

I have to wait till I get to the other side
Just to see you, just to see you
I have to wait till I get to the other side
Cause I never, never got to say goodbye

Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
