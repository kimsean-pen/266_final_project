I probably shouldn't say this but at times I get so scared

When I think about the previous relationship we shared
It was awesome but we lost it it's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standing in the rain but nothing's ever gonna change until you hear my dear
The 7 things I hate about you

The 7 things I hate about you oh you
You're vain your games you're insecure you love me you like her

You make me laugh you make me cry I don't know which side to buy
Your friends they're jerks when you act like them just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know

And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you
It's awkward and silent as I wait for you to say

What I need to hear now your sincere apology
When you mean it I'll believe it if you text it I'll delete it let's be clear
Oh, I'm not coming back
You're taking 7 steps here

The 7 things I hate about you
You're vain your games you're insecure you love me you like her
You make me laugh you make me cry I don't know which side to buy

Your friends they're jerks when you act like them just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do

You make me love you
And compared to all the great things that would take too long to write
I probably should mention the 7 that I like
The 7 things I like about you
Your hair your eyes your old Levi's when we kiss I'm hypnotized
You make me laugh you make me cry but I guess that's both I'll have to buy
Your hands in mine when we're intertwined everything's alright
I wanna be with the one I know
And the 7th thing I like the most that you do
You make me love you
You do
