She's been making plans to go (you know)
Hit the bright lights, hit the road
To the city lights this time
Just don't worry I'll be fine

And she eats the food she bought
Cause it's colored with a thought
But the thought could never know
Its lonely and empty too

She's been making plans to go (you know)
Hit the bright lights, hit the road
To the city lights this time
Just don't worry I'll be fine

And is it all because of you?
Everytime I look at you
If I look back nevermind
Just don't worry, I'll be fine
Never look back, nevermind
Just don't worry I'll be fine
Never look back, nevermind
Just don't worry I'll be fine
