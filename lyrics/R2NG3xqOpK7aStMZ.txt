Ohh
Doo doo doo
I'll be there

Oh drivin' me backwards
Kids like me, gotta be crazy
Movin' me forwards
You must think that I'm lazy

Meet my relations
All of them grinnin' like face packs
Such sweet inspirations
Curl me up, a flag in an icecap

Now I've found a sweetheart
Treats me good, just like an armchair

I try to think about nothing
Difficult, I'm most temperamental
I gave up my good living
Typical, I'm almost sentimental

Ah, Luana's black reptiles
Sliding around, make chemical choices
And she responds as expected
To the only sound, hysterical voices

And you're, you're drivin' me backwards
Kids like me have gotta be crazy

Doo doo doo
Doo doo doo
I'll be there

Doo doo doo
I'll be there
Doo doo doo
