Inside this fantasy
It seems so real to me
Synthetic ecstasy, when her legs are open
True life behind the wall
Where men and angels fall
A fading memory, when my mind is frozen

(Let's go)
(Let's go)
I can see a frozen point in time
Where her figure still awaits

Tongue of fire tracing lips outline
Where frozen breath originates
With one motion of her wanting eyes
She strips everything away

This one moment is intensified
And the colors all fade to grey
I am in the only place that I want to be

Though we know that it ends eventually
But it's all right 'cause right now, we're frozen

"I want to forget mistakes they've helped me make
It's better to be broken than to break"
Inside this fantasy
It seems so real to me
Synthetic ecstasy, when her legs are open
True life behind the wall

Where men and angels fall
A fading memory, when my mind is frozen

(Let's go)
(Let's go)
I can see a frozen point in time
That is easy to retrace

Light and darkness are both intertwined
The elements are in their place
With one motion of her wanting mind
The real world begins to fade

And all the hateful things I have become
Temporarily go away
Inside this fantasy
It seems so real to me
Synthetic ecstasy, when her legs are open
True life behind the wall
Where men and angels fall

A fading memory, when my mind is frozen
Frozen
When my mind's frozen
I'll take you anywhere you want to go
Far from anything that feels like home

(let's go)
You are anyone I want to be
(It's here and now, and now it's only you and me)
It's never enough
(mm, that's true)

I want to stay here
(yeah and I do too)
Breakin' it down (takin' it down)
With smell (smell), touch (touch)
Taste (taste), sight (sight) and sound (sound)
How long will I be here without you near

Because I'm so cold
Break them first or I'll get broken
Is not what I was told, now I'm so cold
I'm so cold
So cold

It seems so real to me

Inside this fantasy
It seems so real to me
Synthetic ecstasy, when her legs are open

A fading memory, when my mind is frozen
Frozen
Frozen (I'm so cold)
Frozen
(Let's go)
I'm so cold
