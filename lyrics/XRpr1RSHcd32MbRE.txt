How did it come to this?
A bitter taste is all I'm left with
I'm losing all of my patience
How did it come to this?
If I'm so wrong
Will you just let me know?
So I can move on and go
I just can't bring myself
To care about you
You're somebody else now
I'll make it through to live another day
Don't tell me I'm wrong
You don't know what you have 'til it's gone
I don't give a fuck
About the way you're feeling
Your mind is dead and empty
There's nothing I can do
Who will you be when the world gives up on you?
Who will you be when the world gives up on you?
And when there's no one else to turn to
Don't say I didn't warn you
How did it come to this?
A bitter taste is all I'm left with
I'm losing all of my patience
How did it come to this?

To care about you
You're somebody else now
I'll make it through to live another day
Don't tell me I'm wrong
You don't know what you have 'til it's gone
You don't know what you have 'til it's gone
I don't give a fuck

Your mind is dead and empty
There's nothing I can do
Who will you be when the world gives up on you?
I don't give a fuck
