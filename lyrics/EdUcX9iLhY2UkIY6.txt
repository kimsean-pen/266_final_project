Since I remember, every eye's burnt with wrath
Since I remember, every hand's been stained with crime
Since I remember, every word's dripped with lies
Since I remember, every step's been a risk
We've been the hate's alchemists
The great violent search for shimmering release
Death, fear and anger are the perfect recipe!

I've fallen and crawled through the ages in nowhere land
Blind, suffocated by submissive life
Prolonged lethargy grows like a claw
Then breeds anger, cuts the bonds
The human swarm full of spikes, sting without mercy every time

I slotted into the order of this severe world
I bred my anger, my dormant arm
Sculpted in the lurid forge of my fears
Hounded mind reached into the darkness sphere
The inside fury gained with every wound, the latent fuse, the bomb inside
I slowly enter the fragile Ground
Sanity stands against the wrath
I'm getting closer to the anger line

Closer than ever to slake the urge
Curiously staring at what is beyond the line
Too many years, too many scars...
Pointless awaiting just whets appetite
Sinners, the cursed ones, temptingly calling my fucking name
Just a few steps forward to feel released
Just a couple moves to awake the beast!
Closer than ever, closer to hell
I walk into shadow, the valley of the damned
