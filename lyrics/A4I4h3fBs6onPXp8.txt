You're gonna win these odd days
You never stood to fight for your name
And I will be there unspoken, curious

You never were the one for us
You never were the one for us
And then I'd just lay here open

On the floor, on the ground
On the stairs, on the way
On the floor, on the ground
On the stairs, on the way

It's a dark, dark day
And it's dangerous to go
And listen what they say
It's a dark, dark day
And it's dangerous to go
And listen what they say

In the way, the way you hold yourself straight
You never were innocent
And then I just lay here frozen, curious

You never were the one for us
You never were the one for us
And then I'd just lay here open

On the floor, on the ground
On the stairs, on my way
On the floor, on the ground
On the stairs, on the way

It's a dark, dark day
And it's dangerous to go
And listen what they say
It's a dark, dark day
And it's dangerous to go
And listen what they say

It's dangerous
It's dangerous to know when it comes
Are you gonna throw your body
Into the drain

No word's right for your name
Lose all that gold, it's all the same
It's dangerous
It's dangerous

It's a dark, dark day
And it's dangerous to go
And listen what they say
It's a dark, dark day
And it's dangerous to go
And listen what they say

It's dangerous
It's dangerous
