Don't go down Highland Street
all that much anymore
but I had to get my glasses fixed
Right there in front
of the old coffee shop was Walter
just sitting where he'd always sit

& he was staring in the window
& maybe at you
or maybe at whomever's walking him
to fetch your muffins & your Sunday papers
the way we used to

I don't drink coffee
all that much anymore
When I do I fix it at home
Don't do the crosswords Sundays
I can feel dumb other ways
I could never finish them alone

Sundays I ride down to the dog park
on the other side of town
just to sit down in the shade
& watch those puppies running round

I don't miss feeling bad & dreading every call
The constant screaming dialogue
I swear that there were some days
it felt like I was only
coming around for your dog

All those sunny days with Walter
chasing squirrels around the park
& the way he'd flip
when he would see me coming
like the way he did this morning
with his big old Walter bark

Bark bark
Bark bark
Bark bark
Hey there Walter
Bark bark
