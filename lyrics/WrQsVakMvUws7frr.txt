You know the line
Slivers of heaven
Hanging in the breeze like a guillotine
Starved for attention
Nothing would materialize
No spell, no solstice
Either behind bars or you're tending to the blast furnace
I would never relieve the pressure even if I could
Keeps the senses razor sharp
And does the-
Does the body good

"You'll be living off candlelight"
Said the main circuit
And the labored pangs of the acid rain
Kept me stirring
I would never relieve the pressure even if I tried
Lost dogs, leap years, all idling by

I was staring through a dull lens
Looking for the edge of the frame
I can't see it following a disillusion
Right up to the end of the page
Takes the drive right out of me
Always tying up a loose end
Waiting for the trumpets to call
I can't hear 'em
I was dreaming about cold fusion
Listening to the conditioned air
Picking up what's barely there
I was staring through a dull lens
Looking for the edge of the frame
I can't see it following a disillusion
Right up to the end of the page...
