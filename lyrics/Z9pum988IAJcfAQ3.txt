Situation's all critical
You've got to look first before you go
If you wasn't too sure then now you know
The situation is all critical

Wait OK you've got to look before you go
Wait OK you've got to look before you go

Deep into the darkness where I hide
The monsters are burried down deep inside
You never know when they're satisfied
Buried down deep where the sun don't shine
The monsters are buried down deep inside but

Wait OK you've got to look before you go
You're wasting away
OK you've got to look before you go

Deep into the darkness where I hide
Deep into the darkness where I hide

Wait OK you've got to look before you go
Wait OK you've got to look before you go
You're wasting away
OK you've got to look before you go

Deep into the darkness where I hide
Deep into the darkness where I hide
Deep into the darkness
