When the sun goes down, down, down, down
Boy you're afraid of the dark, dark
And when the lights go out, out, out, out
Tell me do you know where to start, start

And when the bass gets loud, loud, loud
That is when I feel apart, apart
And when the world sleeps sound, sound, sound, sound
Well the sound is the key of my heart, heart

We run, yes we run the night, the night
We run, yes we run the night, night, night, night, night
We run, yes we run the night, we, we, we run, we, we, we run

We run, yes we run the night, the night, night, night, night

Run 'em like run 'em, run 'em

Run 'em like run 'em, run 'em

Feeling like a rush, rush, rush
Pushing passed me, all over my skin, skin
I can't get enough 'nough 'nough 'nough
'Cause the beat keeps pulling me in, in
Taking me so high up, up, up

A place that I've never been, ahhhh
Party, party all night, night, night, sleep all day then do it again, -gain

We run, yes we run the night, the night
We run, yes we run the night, night, night, night, night
We run, yes we run the night, we, we, we run, we, we, we run
We run, yes we run the night, the night, night, night, night

Run 'em like run 'em, run 'em

Run 'em like run 'em, run 'em
Eh, eh, eh
Eh, eh, eh
Turn the lights down

Turn the lights down
Eh, eh, eh
Eh, eh, eh
Turn the lights down, down
Turn the lights down

We run, yes we run the night, the night
We run, yes we run the night, night, night, night, night
We run, yes we run the night, we, we, we run, we, we, we run
We run, yes we run the night, the night, night, night, night
