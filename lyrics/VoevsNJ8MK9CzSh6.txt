What's life
I'm a hollow shell
That cannot talk to you at night
Wish that I had you on tape
I don't remember what it's like
Hard times baby I need help
I don't think my stars align
In bad times I don't think I'll make it out
When you raise your voice you're tearing out my spine
I've got a heart half full but I still I spill
The same way I spill my red wine

But if in a moment you slip
And put your lip upon my lip
I won't sue you

I don't speak aloud I only text
Your friend said that would be alright
I wade through phases I cannot express
You hear me talk in complicated rhyme
And so I just stay here planning my next step
I wait home and pace rooms
This is every night

Is it the way you react
I place my hand upon your back
I'll be real with you

This is a crisis
You choose not to see it
I went away because away's what I needed
This is not treason but sometimes it feels it
Sometimes you lie and you lie for no reason
I'd say you'd stay but can't honestly mean it
I am in pain and I keep it a secret
Hard times baby I need help...

It's not the words that I lack
It's how your eyes look like a cat's
I can't get through to you
