Riding the night, riding the night
Ain't it cool?
Rolling it high, rolling it high
Ain't it cool?

She's looking hot, she's looking hot
In the breeze
Flashing those eyes, strutting her stuff
Givenchy
(Baby wants to ride tonight)

Well, you sure got the look
That the good times come for free
Baby, I'm not expensive
But tonight you're taking me
You sure got the look
When you're riding next to me
(Dynamite, dynamite)

You sure got the look
Got to keep you on my hook
Pussycat eyes, I'm digging you
Girl, you got the look
Riding the night
You know that she's dynamite, come on
(Dynamite, dynamite)

Don't stop caressing me
'Cos it's ecstasy
And I wanna be

Riding the night, riding the night
Ain't it cool?
Riding the night, riding the night
She's no fool
(Turn the lights off)

Rolling it high, rolling it high
That's her thing
Riding the night, she's cold as ice
Watch the sting

Well, you sure got the look
That the good times come for free
Baby, I'm not expensive
But tonight you're taking me
You sure got the look
When you're riding next to me
(Dynamite, dynamite)

You sure got the look
Got to keep you on my hook
Pussycat eyes, I'm digging you
Girl, you got the look
Riding the night
You know that she's dynamite, come on
(Dynamite, dynamite)

You know, baby
You've got that dynamite, baby
I want your dynamite, baby
You've got that dynamite, baby
I want your dynamite

Well, you sure got the look
That the good times come for free
Baby, I'm not expensive
But tonight you're taking me
You sure got the look
When you're riding next to me
(Dynamite)
Baby, you're dynamite

You sure got the look
Got to keep you on my hook
Pussycat eyes, I'm digging you
Girl, you got the look
Riding the night
You know that she's dynamite, come on
(Dynamite, dynamite)

All this dynamite love, dynamite love
Under the moon as we slip through the city streets
Dynamite love, this dynamite love
You and me can believe in this happiness

Dynamite love, this dynamite love
Under the moon as we slip through the city streets
Dynamite love, this dynamite love
You're holding me as we slip through the city streets

Dynamite
Dynamite
Dynamite
