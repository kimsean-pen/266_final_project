Touch me in the morning and last thing at night
Keep my body warm baby, you know it feels right
Take it a little higher, I'm faking it too
Tell me not to be there, I'll feel it with you

We can only understand what we are shown
How was I supposed to know I'm the control?
We can only understand what we are shown
How was I supposed to know I'm the control?

Move a little closer and show how we get up
Feel it with your lover, I need you so much
I need you so much, I need you so much
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ah

We can only understand what we are shown
How was I supposed to know I'm the control?
We can only understand what we are shown
How was I supposed to know I'm the control?

Touch me in the morning and at me at night
Keep my body warm baby, you know it feels right
Take it a little higher, I'm faking it too
Tell me not to be there, I'll feel it with you, feel it with you

Ha, yeah, ooh, touch me in the morning
Ooh, and touch me at night
I need you so much, tell me not to be there
What you're feeling, I'll feel it with you

Ha ha ha ha ha ha, ooh, ha ha, yeah, ha ha

We can only understand what we are shown
How was I supposed to know I'm the control?

You touch my heart, I touch you baby
My heart is reaching for you
I'll taste your love and take your chances
I'm craving for you

Touch me in the morning

Move a little closer, move a little closer
Move a little closer, closer, ooh, move a little closer
I'm perfect with you, I'm perfect with you
I need you baby, I need you so much

You touch my body's special places
My heart reaches for you
