What's the worth of
All the work of my hands,
And the worst off
On Lake Michigan?

Get in solid walls with the know-it-alls.
Get in trouble with Saul Bellow.
Get in solid walls with the know-it-alls.
Get in trouble with Saul Bellow.

And my good friends
With their eyes on what it takes.
I could kiss them,
But the bravest make mistakes.

Get in solid walls with the know-it-alls.
Get in trouble with Saul Bellow.
Get in solid walls with the know-it-alls.
Get in trouble with Saul Bellow.
Get in solid walls and with what it caused.
Get in trouble with Saul Bellow.
Get in solid walls with the know-it-alls.
Get in trouble with Saul Bellow.
