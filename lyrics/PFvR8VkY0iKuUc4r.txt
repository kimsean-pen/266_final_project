I feel the cold again
I feel alone again
I feel the cold again
I feel alone again

I feel the cold again
I feel alone again
I feel the cold again
I feel alone again

My heart is so cold, I feel so alone
Stayed up all night girl, I wish you were home
I'll take a hold of you
I want to grow old with you
Where did you go? Oh, where did you go?
You got me feeling like I'm six feet below the ground
Don't tell me its over now
I won't live this way, I can't live this life without you
'Cause all I fucking do is think about you
All night and day
Baby girl, believe the words that I say

Addicted to love and you're my supplier
But you and I, we burn like a fire
And your words, they cut like barbed wire
But that's how it feels when you love a liar

Addicted to love and you're my supplier
But you and I, we burn like a fire
And your words, they cut like barbed wire
But that's how it feels when you love a liar

I feel the cold again
I feel alone again
I feel the cold again
I feel alone again

I feel the cold again
I feel alone again
I feel the cold again
I feel alone again

So pour the salt in my wounds, babe
I just wanna feel something
Remove the blood from my veins
So this heart will stop pumping
On the edge and I'm jumping
Give me something that's numbing
'Cause if I don't have your love
Then this life means nothing

So pour the salt in my wounds, babe
I just wanna feel something
Remove the blood from my veins
So this heart will stop pumping
On the edge and I'm jumping
Give me something that's numbing
'Cause if I don't have your love
Then this life means nothing

I feel the cold again (I feel the cold)
I feel alone again (I feel alone)
I feel the cold again (I feel the cold)
I feel alone again (I feel alone)

I feel the cold again (I feel the cold)
I feel alone again (I feel alone)
I feel the cold again (I feel the cold)
I feel alone again (I feel alone)
