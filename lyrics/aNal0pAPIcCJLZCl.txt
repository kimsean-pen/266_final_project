How come twenty four hours, baby sometimes seem to slip into days?
Oh twenty four hours, baby sometimes seem to slip into days
When a minute seems like a lifetime, oh baby when I feel this way
Sittin, lookin at the clock, time moves so slow
I've been watchin for the hands to move, until I just can't look no more
How come twenty four hours, baby sometimes seem to slip into days?
A minute seems like a lifetime, baby when I feel this way
To sing a song for you, I recall you used to say

"Oh baby this one's for we two", which in the end is you anyway
How come twenty four hours, baby sometimes seem to slip into days?

A minute seems like a lifetime, baby when I feel this way
There was a time that I stood tall, in the eyes of other men

But by my own choice I left you woman, and now I can't get back again
How come twenty four hours, sometimes seem to slip into days?
A minute seems like a lifetime, baby when I feel this way
A minute seems like a lifetime, oh baby when I feel this way...
...I feel this way
