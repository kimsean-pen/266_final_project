I'm losing my mind
Searching for you
And, even if I found you
What would I do?
I would run from you

What do I do?
I would run from you

I'm not strong enough
Kind enough
I don't have the will
To believe enough

Help me be strong enough
Make my heart kind enough
It's not that I want for love
It's that I need to love

I'm losing my mind
Searching for you
And, even if I found you
What would I do?
I would run from you

I'm not strong enough
Kind enough
I don't have the will
To believe enough

Help me be strong enough
Make my heart kind enough
It's not that I want for love
It's that I need to love

Help me be
Make my heart
It's not that I
It's that I
Help me be
Make my heart
It's not that I
It's that I
