I still remember all the things you said
Laying in my bed
Eye to eye
I'll carry thoughts you put inside my head
'Til the day I'm dead
Why oh why?

Do you ever think of me?
After everything
Give me something to hold on to
I need just a little piece
I'll take anything
Give me something to hold on to

I guess it's not the way things tend to go
Not that I would know
Goodbyes are slow
I saw your picture on the silver screen
Guess you don't miss me
That's the way it seems

Do you ever think of me?
After everything
Give me something to hold on to
I need just a little piece
I'll take anything
Give me something to hold on to

Something good, something real
Something bad, something I can really, really, really feel
Leave me black, leave me blue
Just give me something
I'll take anything from you

Do you ever think of me?
After everything
Give me something to hold on to
I need just a little piece
I'll take anything
Give me something to hold on to

Something to hold on to
Something to hold on to
Something to hold on to
