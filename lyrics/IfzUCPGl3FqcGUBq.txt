An offering of reasons
We put them all and play
A covering of treasons
That one by one we let slip away

A solitary dancer so lost upon her stage

I have seen you on the edge of dawn
Felt you there before you were born
Balanced your dreams upon the edge of thorns
But I don't think about you anymore

A study made of winter of summers long ago
And dreams that use to glitter
Safely now hidden under snow

And so we end the chapter and let the stage lights fade

I have seen you on the edge of dawn
Felt you there before you were born
Balanced your dreams upon the edge of thorns
But I don't think about you anymore

I have seen you on the edge of dawn
Felt you there before you were born
Balanced your dreams upon the edge of thorns
But I don't think about you anymore, anymore
I don't think about you anymore, anymore
I don't think about you, I don't think about you
I don't think about you, I don't think about you anymore
Anymore, anymore, yeah
