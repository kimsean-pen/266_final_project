So lost, searching for something
So far, you've found nothing
Don't know what to tell you
I found you, I found you, I found you in my heart
You don't know what you want
You don't know who you are
I've been searching for you
I found you, I found you, I found you in my heart
I found you, I found you, I found you in my heart
