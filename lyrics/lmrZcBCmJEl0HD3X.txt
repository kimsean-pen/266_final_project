Oh Penelope
Are you filled with air
Swallowed oxygen
That makes you float up?
Is it Dropsy?
Will your lungs swell?
It's depressing me
To see you struggle

Oh Penelope
Are you filled with air
Swallowed oxygen
That makes you float up?
Is it Dropsy?
Will your lungs swell?

It's depressing me
To see you struggle
I'm treading water with my oars
Glass galleons anchored, ocean floors
I'm diving down with all my gear
In search of treasure, para me corazon

Take you to the forest
Let you feel the raindrops falling down
Seeping through your redscales
Eliminate the faucet
Eliminate the need for water
Replace it with a safe shell

Don't wanna see you floating upside down
On the top of the bowl when I
Come around to visit you
Don't wanna see you floating upside down

No girl
Need you there, Need you there, Need you there
Ooh Release that air
(I'm treading water with my oars
Glass galeons anchored, ocean floors
I'm diving down with all my gear
In search of treasure, para me corazon)

Take you to the forest
Let you feel the raindrops falling down
Seeping through your redscales
Eliminate the faucet
Eliminate the need for water
Replace it with a safe shell
If they summon the rains now,
Are you gonna rise?

If they summon the rains now,
Are you gonna rise?
