Stranded alone on a barren island
No food to be found
Point of desperation
Shocking decision on how to survive
Now it's time to break out the knife
First incision the cut is complete
First source of food is one of your feet
Incredible pain as you cauterize the wound
Preparing yourself for a horrible doom

Amputation for your rations
Legs are gone, start new gashes

Half of your fingers are now cut away
To live through another agonizing day
Feasting on the rest of your arm
Next the slice goes across your throat
