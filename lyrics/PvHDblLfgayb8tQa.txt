Wires drilled into my head
Tubes inserted in my neck
Toxins pumped into my veins
This treatments inhumane

Strapped to a table head and foot
Eyes blindfolded, I can't look
My life is all I've left to choose
As your scalpel makes its move

What have I done to deserve this?
Give up your cruel practices
When this nightmare runs it's course
You throw away my useless corpse
