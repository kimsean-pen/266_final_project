Silent grieve
Suffocates the rumor
Feel my breathing
Speed up at the thought of you
My inner voice
Seems to want me dead
Only choice
Manage down the trail I've lead

Never far away away i always see you
When it all goes dark you light my way through

Never fade
I know you think you're someone i forgot
Never fade
I'm everything you really think I'm not
Never fade
I know you think you're someone I forgot
Never fade

Growing cold
Try to numb my feeling
Lose control
All my friends are leaving
Paid the price
For all the lies I used to live
Sacrifice
For all the love I tried to give

Never far away i always see you
When it all goes dark you light my way through

Never fade
I know you think you're someone I forgot
Never fade
I'm everything you really think I'm not
Never fade
I know you think you're someone I forgot
Never fade

Never fade
I know you think you're someone I forgot
Never fade
I'm everything you really think I'm not
Never fade
I know you think you're someone I forgot
Never fade
I'm everything you really think I'm not

Never fade

Never fade

Never fade
