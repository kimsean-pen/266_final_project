Oh, oh, oh thinking out loud I see no solution
Oh, oh, oh screaming out loud for a revolution

Stop provoking me
Controlling what I want and what I need
Destroying what I say and what I mean
You try to test me
I'll make sure you bleed

Sick of expecting, sick of reasoning

Say what you wanna say
Do what you wanna do
You can call it love but you're killing me
Say what you wanna say
Do what you wanna do
Give me so closure, my patience is over

Oh, oh, oh thinking out loud I see no solution
Oh, oh, oh screaming out loud for a revolution

Holding on to a lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
You'll be making up your damn mind
That I'm something made by design

Holding on to a lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
You'll be making up your damn mind
That I'm something made by design

Stop provoking me
Controlling what I want and what I need
Destroying who I am, who I fight to be

Say what you wanna say
Do what you wanna do
You can call it love but you're killing me
Say what you wanna say
Do what you wanna do
Give me so closure, my patience is over

Oh, oh, oh thinking out loud I see no solution
Oh, oh, oh screaming out loud for a revolution

I'm sick of being sick of still holding on
The poison's eating through my soul holding on
If only I could let this go, I'd let go
I'd let this go
I'd let this go

Oh, oh, oh thinking out loud I see no solution
Oh, oh, oh screaming out loud for a revolution
Oh, oh, oh thinking out loud I see no solution
Oh, oh, oh screaming out loud

Say what you wanna say
Do what you wanna do
You can call it love but you're killing me
Say what you wanna say
Do what you wanna do
Give me so closure, my patience is over

Oh, oh,oh thinking out loud I see no solution
Oh, oh, oh screaming out loud for a revolution
