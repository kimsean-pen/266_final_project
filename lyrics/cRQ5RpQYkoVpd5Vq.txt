It's a fine, fine line
Between whiskey and water into wine
It's a long way home
When you're down and out and out here on your own
But it don't matter who you are when it's time to lock and load

Everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em
Chrome piece hiding in their blacked out denim
Heartbeat beating to a rock 'n' roll rhythm, yeah
Everybody got a couple scarred up knuckles
Blood on their boots and their back up buckle
Diamond back rattle with a quick strike venom
Everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em

When they knock you to the ground
You ain't gonna let nobody keep you down
When your back's against the wall
That's when you gotta learn to stand up tall
Yeah, that rebel fights inside of you
Has been there all along

Everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em
Chrome piece hiding in their blacked out denim
Heartbeat beating to a rock 'n' roll rhythm, yeah
Everybody got a couple scarred up knuckles
Blood on their boots and their back up buckle
Diamond back rattle with a quick strike venom
Everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em, oh, ooh

Everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em
Chrome piece hiding in their blacked out denim
Heartbeat beating to a rock 'n' roll rhythm, yeah
Huh, everybody's got little front man swagger
Stone cold rolling like a young Mick Jagger
A new tattoo that you can't keep hidden
Everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em, yeah, oh, ooh

I said, everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em, aw
