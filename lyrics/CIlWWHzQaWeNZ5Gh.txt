Let's take this walk it's long overdue
And let this loathe crawl over you finally.

Let's take this walk it's overdue.

Let's sit and talk and slow things down.
Just be our old selves again finally.

Let's take this walk
Let's take a walk to somewhere pretty.

This ladder is ours
This ladder is ours
We can be anybody else
Hold on to the fringe
Jump through from the past.

This ladder is ours
This ladder is ours
This is where everybody turns
out right in the end.
Can you play a part?

See us walking through the sunshine
Ask me "Where I've been?"
Back to Ire?
Back to desire
This is where it all begins!

This ladder is ours
This ladder is ours
We can be anybody else
Hold on to the fringe
Jump through from the past.

This ladder is ours
This ladder is ours
This is where everybody turns
out right in the end.
Can you play that part?

This ladder is ours
This ladder is ours
This ladder is ours
This ladder is ours

This ladder is ours
This ladder is ours
This ladder is ours
This ladder is ours
