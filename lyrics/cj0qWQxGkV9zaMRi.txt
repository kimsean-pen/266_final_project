Mindful of the house
Coloring the cookbooks
We made love
Shimmy in your tree
Looking for my morning breakfast
Emptying the lock
Piling all the debris on your lip
Mining in your shoes
Waiting for the morning cowlick

Well I might be somewhere in the house
Somewhere in the house
I might be, might be
Sighing in your tomb
Sighing in your tomb
Find me

[:-(?] in the gourd
Fearful of the handprints on the glass
Sticking like a bulb
Swollen in the sand dunes of my mouth
Fixing up a suit
Glossing all your dirty furniture
Dining on a lamp
In the corner of your counsel building

Well I might be somewhere in the house
Somewhere in the house
I might be, might be
Sighing in your tomb
Sighing in your tomb
Find me
Find me
Find me

Well I might be somewhere in the house
Somewhere in the house
I might be, might be
Sighing in your tomb
Sighing in your tomb
Find me
Find me
Find me
