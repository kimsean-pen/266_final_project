Who's in a bad mood
Who's in a taxi
Turning the clock back
Avoiding a fight with a man he is meeting
Stands in the lobby
Counting his questions in the neon light
Sinking under the river
Sewer line touches the edge of the suburbs
Back to the beach where the family is waiting
On rumours of summer, lay out a blanket
Bring something to feed the birds

With all the luck you've had
Why are your songs so sad
Sing from a book you're reading in bed
And took to heart
All of your lives on lend
Reading in bed
