Bad dreams never effect me
I'm not afraid of the concrete
Bad dreams never effect me
I'm not afraid of the concrete

I'm not doing this all anymore
The truths gotta go
I'm not doing this all anymore
But you swear to God
Baby you got soul
Change and lead, to change and lead
To change and lead, to change and lead

Bad things never protect me
I'm just a scene in a movie
Bad parts never arrest me
I'm just a flesh in the left ring

I'm not doing this all anymore
The truths gotta go
I'm not doing this all anymore
But you swear to God
Baby you got soul
Change and lead, to change and lead
To change and lead, to change and lead
