You and me got a street thing going on, on

Now that we have come to know each other
I'll never go away, love will always stay here forever
'Cause this thing we've got is very rare, yea
So don't ever go nowhere, no

Because you and me got a street kinda thing goin' on
And I'm so happy that I found you
Our love ain't goin' nowhere, it's gonna stay right here
Right here forever

You'll never have to ask a second time
I'm the one for you, you're the one for me
So there's no doubt in my mind, no
Boy this love we have is oh so real, oh yes it is
That's why I'm never goin' nowhere, no

Because you and me got a street kinda thing goin' on
And I'm so happy that I found you
Our love ain't goin' nowhere, it's gonna stay right here
Right here forever

Yo Aliyah, why don't you take it to the bridge
And let 'em know how you really feel?

You can climb the highest mountain
You can swim the deepest sea
But boy I gotta let you know
My love will always be

You can climb the highest mountain
You can swim the deepest sea
But boy I gotta let you know
My love will always be

You can climb the highest mountain
You can swim the deepest sea
But boy I gotta let you know
My love will always be

You can climb the highest mountain
You can swim the deepest sea
But boy I gotta let you know
My love will always be

You can climb the highest mountain
You can swim the deepest sea
But boy I gotta let you know
My love will always be

You can climb the highest mountain
You can swim the deepest sea
But boy I gotta let you know
My love will always be

You can climb the highest mountain
You can swim the deepest sea
But boy I gotta let you know
My love will always be

You can climb the highest mountain
You can swim the deepest sea
But boy I gotta let you know
My love will always be
