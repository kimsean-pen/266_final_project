there are paint smears on everything i own
the vapor rub is lying on a table of filth
christmas cards to which i never reply
my eyeballs absorb only blue filtered light tv casualty,
tv casualty we're all right tv casualty, tv casualty
i wish they'd put prince namor on the tube hold on,
i think i have to puke there's a spot in the corner where i always go
i like to feed the flies that i know
but please don't feed my television screen
please don't feed my television screen
please don't feed my television screen
please don't feed my television screen tv casualty,
tv casualty we're all right tv casualty,
tv casualty babies in prison, they call it a womb
nine month sentence, no parole slivers of steal stuck in your lungs
breathe deep, we need a donor for blood
jaguars at the cemetary cadillacs grazing at your grave
zeniths grazing at your grave sonys grazing at your grave
tv casualty, tv casualty we're all right tv casualty,
tv casualty we're all right tv casualty, tv casualty
