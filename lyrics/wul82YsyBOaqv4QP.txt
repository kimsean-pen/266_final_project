Lay around the market park
Don't tell me it was wasted time
Don't tell me it was waste of life

Wake up to the noise of the fire alarm (fire alarm)
And I run, run, run out to face my fears
Long red flare round my favourite star
And all I see is you lying in the smoke

And I hear you cry sometimes
No, I don't mind
To hear you cry sometimes
And I wish you didn't go, go, go, go, go
And I wish you didn't go, go, go, go, go

Years from nineteen to thirty-one
Did nine-til-five spark your life?
And now I can't, can't, can't, can't see you
But now I can't, can't see you
And I wish you didn't go, go, go, go, go
And I wish you didn't go
