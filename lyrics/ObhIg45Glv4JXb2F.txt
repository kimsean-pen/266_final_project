You broke up with me and for the life of me
I couldn't figure out what I did wrong
I'm so sorry
I'm usually the first one to admit that I did wrong
Get over yourself, it's no big deal
If I run a little faster than you on the playground
Get over yourself, what's your problem
What's your problem?
Well, if you don't like girls that are stronger than you
And if you don't like girls that are faster than you
And if you don't like girls that are smarter than you
Well, then you might not like me
You might not like me
We had chemistry and you're one that got away
And I'll never forget you
You were beautiful
You were perfect as you were
And I didn't want to fix you
Get over yourself, it's no big deal
If I swim a little faster than you in the neighbor's pool
Get over yourself, what's your problem
What's your problem?
Well, if you don't like girls that are stronger than you
And if you don't like girls that are faster than you
And if you don't like girls that are smarter than you
Well, then you might not like me
You might not like me
Well, if you don't like girls tougher than you
And if you don't like girls more darin' than you
And if you don't like girls braver than you
Well, then you might not like me
You might not like me
You might not like me
You might not like me and that's fine by me
You might not like me
You might not like me
Boy, lay down your pride
Wipe that tear from your eye
I'll take you back, I'll take you back, boy
Lay down your pride
Wipe that tear from your eye
I'll take you back, I'll take you back, boy
Well, if you don't like girls that are stronger than you
And if you don't like girls that are faster than you
And if you don't like girls that are smarter than you
Well, then you might not like me, you might not like me
And if you don't like girls tougher than you
And if you don't like girls more darin' than you
And if you don't like girls braver than you
Well, then you might not like me
You might not like me
You might not like me
You might not like me and that's fine by me
You might not like me
