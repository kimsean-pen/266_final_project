Sometimes it's soft as a misty rain
That gently touches my soul
It cools the fire that burns in me
And I simply lose control
So just

Rain down on me
Let your love just fall like raindrops
Rain on me
Just rain down on me
Let your love just shower me
Just rain on me

Full as a dam at capacity
Passions about to explode, yeah
I can't escape its surrounding me
I'm caught in a storm
That I don't need no shelter from

Rain down on me
Let your love just fall like raindrops
Rain on me
Just, rain down on me
Let your love just shower me
Just rain on me

Shower
Sprinkle me
Fall down on me
(Your love just falling)
Fall down, fall down on me
Let it
Fall down, fall on me

Just
Rain down on me
Chill me with your loving touch
Rain on me
I wanna feel your love is real so just
Rain down on me
Me

Rain on me
Oh, baby just
Rain down on me
Let your love just fall like raindrops
Rain on me, every little drip drop
Just rain down, on me
Let your love just shower me
Just rain on me

Sometimes it's soft as a misty rain
