How can I justify
Before it fades
When all I want is more more more
Like a wrecking ball each step I take
Cause everty time you're screaming my name
I can't take it any longer

Cross your fingers, Save aa prayer
There's no way out I'm leaving you there
Face this mess your days are numbered
Will I live to survive

I will light the sky
I will make you whole like a fireball
I will make it rain
Like a waterfall I am your fireball

Holding my breath I'm about to explode
Counting down again like three, two, one boom
Would you be satisfied
To stand out in the rain
With no sympathy
Like dogs you fetch a hand granade

I can't take this any longer
One step back
Review the past A lesson learned
Where Bridges still burn
Face this mess now you're outnumbered

But I am making you rise

I will light the sky
I will make you whole like a fireball
I will make it rain
Like a waterfall I am your fireball

Break - Down
10 to 1 my hunting ground
Our chemistry blend all and all
This fight is mine I never bow
Count - Down
10 to 1 my playground
You will never ever get me but I'll
Break you down

I will light the sky
I will make you whole like a fireball
I will make it rain
Like a waterfall I am your fireball
I will light the sky
I will make you whole like a fireball
I will make it rain
Like a waterfall I am your fireball
