Papa is sick, laying in bed,
Mama is sad in her old blue suit
Sister cried and ran away
Asked me to take care of her little stray
I wanna live with no fighting
In a little house with light strings shining
So when the night falls grey as a cloud
Me and the mutt cat have a warm hideout

Baby, I'm sure you can free my heart,
Baby, you came to cure my heart

Todo o dia a gente tem um ao outro,
Manhã cedo agora é bom de levantar.
Toda a dor que me aparece eu te conto,
Você me cura sem sequer notar.

Baby, I'm sure you can free my heart,
Baby, you came to cure my heart

Baby, I'm sure you can free my heart,
Baby, you came to cure my heart
