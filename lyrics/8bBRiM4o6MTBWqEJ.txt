Lord only knows
Why I love, why I love you so
You're a heartless man, I don't understand
Why you gotta be? Why you need to be so cold? So cold?

So cold how can you be?
So cold, so cruel to me
Ice cold don't even feel
Your kiss is like fire but deep down inside
You're so cold

You play games with my mind
Cheat and lie time after time
And I know you'll never change
But I just can't break away no

I don't know why I let you
Treat me the way you do
You're just no good for me
I wish I never fell for you, you are

So cold how can you be?
So cold, so cruel to me
Ice cold don't even feel
Your kiss is like fire but deep down inside
You're so cold, so cold

So many times
You keep me waiting around endlessly
You just laugh as I drown in despair
Never a worry, never a care

I don't know why I let you hurt me
The way you do
You've got a spell on me
I'm hopelessly in love with you

So cold how can you be?
So cold, so cruel to me
Ice cold don't even feel
Your kiss is like fire but deep down inside
You're so cold

So cold how can you be?
So cold, so cruel to me
Ice cold don't even feel
Your kiss is like fire but deep down inside
You're so cold

Made of stone
Oh you're wicked to the bone
I give you my heart you tear me apart
You're like a devil in disguise

Oh so cold

So cold how can you be?
So cold, so cruel to me
Ice cold don't even feel
I can wait another day
I can wait to break away

So cold how can you be?
So cold, so cruel to me
Ice cold don't even feel
Your kiss is like fire but deep down inside
You're so cold

So cold
So cold
Ice cold
Your kiss is like fire but deep down inside
You're so cold
