It's been 37 hours, seven minutes, 30 seconds
And you still haven't responded
Got me on the ledge of crazy but I'm not one for complaining
I just wonder where the hell you could be
Tell me who you think you are, don't be playing with my heart
Say what, what's it gonna be

'Cause I'm in love with you now
Are you in or you out?
'Cause I really need you here
If you want me around, then don't come around
And cloud up the atmosphere
Fuck outta here

It's been 47 hours, seven minutes, 30 seconds
And now you're just responding to me
Boy, you must be suicidal
Is that bitch right there beside you?
'Cause I know hell it couldn't be me
Tell me who you think you are, how the motherfuck it start?
Say what, what's it gonna be

'Cause I'm in love with you now
Are you in or you out?
'Cause I really need you here
If you want me around, then don't come around
And cloud up my atmosphere
Fuck outta here

If you ain't feeling this, just let me know
I promise on everything I'll let you go

'Cause I'm in love with you now
Are you in or you out?
'Cause I really need you here
If you want me around, then don't come around
And cloud up my atmosphere
Fuck outta here

Fuck outta here
