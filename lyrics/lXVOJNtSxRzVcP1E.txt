Sometimes I feel alone in a million crowd
An outsider, wandering alone without
Any words to say, they can't explain
This power to overcome the pain
Feel the breath that's always getting away
Am I dreaming it all? I will never be afraid

I'll survive in this nothing, leading nowhere
I'll survive, feeling stronger, for how much longer?
I'll survive in this nothing, leading nowhere
I'll survive, survive

A voice inside of me that keeps on teasing
As sweet as like a whisper from the lips of pain
And so many steps that I can't make
I can't take the chance, release the break
And the breath just keeps on getting away
Am I dreaming it all? I will never be afraid

I'll survive in this nothing, leading nowhere
I'll survive, feeling stronger, for how much longer?
I'll survive in this nothing, leading nowhere
I'll survive, survive

I'll survive in this nothing, leading nowhere
I'll survive, feeling stronger, for how much longer?
I'll survive in this nothing, leading nowhere
I'll survive, feeling stronger, for how much longer?

I'll survive in this nothing, leading nowhere
I'll survive, survive
