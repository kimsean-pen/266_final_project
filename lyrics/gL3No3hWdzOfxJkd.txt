Toy boy, toy boy

Everybody's talkin'
When they see me walkin'
With this little boy of mine
He's my play thing and I love him
I dress him up lookin' fine

He ain't got money
People think it's funny
He gives me everything I need
He's my play boy, and my love toy
And I want everyone to know

He's my toy boy, toy boy
I'm out with my toy boy, toy boy
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Friday, Saturday, Sunday night

When I want a lover
I don't need any other
I know he'll come runnin' to me
He's my gigolo and my Romeo
And I want everyone to know

He's my toy boy, toy boy
I'm out with my toy boy, toy boy
And when I get to take him home
I know he's gonna love me right

He's my toy boy, toy boy
I'm out with my toy boy, toy boy
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Friday, Saturday, Sunday night

Toy boy

And I want everyone to know

He's my toy boy, toy boy
I'm out with my toy boy, toy boy
And when I get to take him home
I know he's gonna love me right

He's my toy boy, toy boy
I'm out with my toy boy, toy boy
