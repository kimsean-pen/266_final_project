Somebody make a move

Somebody

Test my reality
Check if there's a weak spot
Clingin' to insanity
Hopes the world will ease up

Try to make it look like it's all somehow getting better
'Cause I know how to play it pretty good against the measure
Everyone started out a little insane

But we learn pretty quick how to fake it for the game
But some of you never learned to drop the act
So under that skin of yours: a heart attack

'Cause everybody's so scared
We don't wanna go there
We don't wanna make a move
We got got all our lives to lose

Screaming in the dark while we just play our part
I'll play right along
Like I don't know what's going on

Somebody make a move
Somebody make a move
Please somebody make a move
We all know
We all know what's going on

And if I had the answers I'd have written them out
So I could tell you what to do and what this thing is about
But all I've ever learned comes second-hand
And I dare not preach what I don't understand

You and I; we share the same disease
Cover up; compromise what we grieve
I've let more than my share of revivals die
This isn't pretty but it's who I am tonight

'Cause everybody's so scared
We don't wanna go there
We don't wanna make a move
We got got all our lives to lose

Screaming in the dark while we just play our part
I'll play right along
Like I don't know what's going on

Somebody make a move
Somebody make a move
Please somebody make a move
We all know
We all know what's going on

Pointing my fingers the problems still linger
They keep getting bigger and I hold the trigger
Playing with fire I live like a liar
Please somebody make a move

Somebody make a move (I'm pointing my fingers)
Somebody make a move (The problems still linger)
Somebody make a move (I'm pointing my fingers)
Somebody
Somebody make a move

'Cause everybody's so scared
We don't wanna go there
We don't wanna make a move
Screaming in the dark while we just play our part
I'll play right along

'Cause everybody's so scared
We don't wanna go there
We don't wanna make a move
We got got all our lives to lose

Screaming in the dark while we just play our part
I'll play right along
Like I don't know what's going on

Somebody make a move
Somebody make a move
Please somebody make a move
We all know

We all know what's going on
Somebody make a move
Somebody make a move

Please somebody make a move
We all know
We all know what's going on.
