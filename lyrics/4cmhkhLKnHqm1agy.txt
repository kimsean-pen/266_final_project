Why Don't You Stop
And Look Me Over
Am I The Same Girl You Used To Know?
Why Don't You Stop
And Think It Over
Am I The Same Girl Who Knew Your Soul?
I'm The One You Want
And I'm The One You Need
I'm The One You Love
I'm The One You Used To Meet
Around The Corner
Everyday
We Would Meet
And Slip Away
But We Were Much Too Young
To Love Each Other This Way
Am I The Same Girl?
(Yes I Am Yes I Am)
Am I The Same Girl?
(Yes I Am Yes I Am)
Why Don't You Stop
And Look Me Over
Am I The Same Girl You Used To Know?
Why Don't You Stop
And Think It Over
Am I The Same Girl Who Knew Your Soul?
I'm The One You Hurt
And I'm The One You Need
I'm The One Who Cried
I'm The One You Used To Meet
But You Are Pretending You Don't Care
But The Fire Is Still There
Now We Are No Longer Too Young
To Love Each Other This Way
Am I The Same Girl?
(Yes I Am Yes I Am)
Am I The Same Girl?
(Yes I Am Yes I Am)
Am I The Same Girl?
(Yes I Am Yes I Am)
Am I The Same Girl?
(Yes I Am Yes I Am)
Have You Ever Felt The Need For Something More
With Every Week Comes Scratching At Your Door
Have You Ever Stopped And Wonder What It Is
You're Searching For
Push Your Luck Too Far With Me
But If You Push It Any Further
You Won't Have Any
Am I The Same Girl?
Am I The Same Girl?
(Yes I Am Yes I Am)
