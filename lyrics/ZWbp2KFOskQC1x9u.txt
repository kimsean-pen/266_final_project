Well, I've been searching for something true
And my heart says it must be you
I'd love to fall and see it through
But, only if you told me to

Well, I'd run through the desert, I'd walk through rain
Get you into trouble and take all the blame
I'd paint you a picture, write you a song
And I'd do it all over if I did all wrong
I don't wanna steal you away
Or make you change the things that you believe

I just wanna drink from the words you say
And be everything you need
Yeah, I could be so good at loving you
But, only if you told me to
I've seen a lot of good love go to waste
And I don't wanna look back on these days

Knowing all the thing you'd never know
If I never said a word and let you go
I don't wanna steal you away
Or make you change the things that you believe

I just wanna drink from the words you say
And be everything you need
Yeah, I could be so good at loving you
But, only if you told me to
(Yeah...)
I don't wanna steal you away

Or make you change the things that you believe
I just wanna drink from the words you say
And be everything you need
Yeah, I could be so good at loving you
But, only if you told me to
Maybe, this is something I'll never be
But, I'll be right here until you tell me
