Kallipolis is born
The ideal state envisioned
A just city
In the name of utopia

Built in the image of man's soul
A mirror of the truth within
With the structure and the form
They are together woven from

Here passion succumbs to corruption
This beast of man is alive in dreams
While the other half sleeps

In dreams one sees
Utopia's freedoms (multiply)
Until the soul wanes
No longer capable

All of us would wear the Ring of Gyges

Too much freedom seems to change
Into nothing but too much slavery
The blinded citizens turn against the true philosophers
All are corrupted by thoughts creeping through the air
