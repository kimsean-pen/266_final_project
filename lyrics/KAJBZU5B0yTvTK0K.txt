I can see the water from my house
I'll put you up, Lindsey
I'll put you up, for free

I could win your bread, if you let me
You let me win
You let me in, Lindsey

I will have you longing for heirs
I will have you longing for heirs
I will have you longing
In a home and garden

Can't you see the bridal suites?
The water, the water
Don't you dream of you and me
A daughter, a son

Lindsey, Lindsey, be mine
Lindsey, Lindsey, be mine
Lindsey, Lindsey, be mine
Lindsey, Lindsey, be mine
Lindsey, Lindsey

I will make a chain, a precious link
I'll have you yet, Lindsey
You'll be my pet, Lindsey
