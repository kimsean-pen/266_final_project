I've got another confession to make
So complicated
Let me try to explain
Don't want this feeling to go away
So it stays, it stays, it stays, it stays
Is it the way that you talk that's causing me to freak?
Is it the way that you laugh that's making my heart beat?
Is it the way that you kiss?
It's gotta be the way you taste
You taste, you taste, you taste
You're such a gorgeous nightmare
Old habits never seem to go away
You make me feel brand new yeah
We ressurect it's like I've come back to life
I feel so alive, I feel so alive!
First impressions are hard to erase
Etched in my mind and it just won't go away
Maybe I'm playing my cards way too safe
I've gotta change, change, change, change
Is it the way that you feel against my body?
Is it the way that you act so damn naughty?
Is it the way that you shake?
When your hips move to the bass, the bass, the bass, the bass?
You're such a gorgeous nightmare
Old habits never seem to go away
You make me feel brand new yeah
We ressurect it's like I've come back to life
I feel so alive, I feel so alive
I feel so alive
You're such a gorgeous nightmare
Old habits never seem to go away
You make me feel brand new yeah
We ressurect it's like I've come back to life
You're such a gorgeous nightmare
Old habits
Don't go away
You make me feel brand new yeah
We ressurect it's like I've come back to life
I feel so alive, I feel so alive, I feel so alive...
