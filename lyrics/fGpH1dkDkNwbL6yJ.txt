I don't wanna leave it to chance
When everything is changing
I don't wanna live in the past
Where everything is fading

It's hard to be in here on my own
Though we talk on the phone
I think we're better together, so what'd you think about it?
I've thought about it

Home before was where I laid my head
Now my heart resides with you instead
I'll care with you every step you take
Be there with you every move you make
I'll care with you every step you take
Be there with you every move you make

Every second moving so fast
But I can't imagine
There will come a day
When this will end

It's hard to be in here on my own
Though we talk on the phone
I think we're better together, so what'd you think about it?
I've thought about it

Home before was where I laid my head
Now my heart resides with you instead
I'll care with you every step you take
Be there with you every move you make

I'll care
Be there
(I'll care) This can't just be my emotion
(Be there) You deserve my whole devotion

(I'll care) This can't be just my emotion
(Be there) You deserve my whole devotion

I'll care with you every step you take
Be there with you every move you make
I'll care
Be there
