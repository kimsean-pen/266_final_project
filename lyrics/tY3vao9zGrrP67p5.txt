Hey!

My best is pointless, outrun but I'll never win
This state of conflict makes sense, don't think about it
I ran away when I was 15, I was dead by 17
I know the world owes me everything
I'm gonna take it, I'm gonna make it

Walking on the warmer stones
Going nowhere, now I'm here
Not a name for what I am
I guess I'm just another demon of mercy

All talk, no action, completely incomplete
Why I wish me well when I know exactly what you think?
I came alive when I was 18, you forget: I'm everything
I know the world owes me nothing
So I'll take it, if I can make it

Walking on the warmer stones
Going nowhere, now I'm here
Not a name for what I am
Your god's a weapon, he blessed every bullet

Walking on the warmer stones
Going nowhere, now I'm here
Not a name for what I am
I guess I'm just another demon of mercy

Yeah!

Tell Me Anything
Tell Me Anything
Overrated and Under-appreciated
Anything, tell Me Anything
Before you know it, you'll be

Walking on the warmer stones
Going nowhere, now I'm here
Not a name for what I am
Your god's a weapon, he blessed every bullet

Walking on the warmer stones
Going nowhere, now I'm here
Not a name for what I am
I guess I'm just another demon of mercy
