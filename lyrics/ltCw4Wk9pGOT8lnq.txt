Carry me under
Leave me abandoned
Show me what's left
Show me what's left
Beautiful anger
Breaking the pattern
Show me what's left
Show me what's left

Take the color from your eyes
I bleed for you
I bleed for you
Bring the broken back to life
We'll make it through
We'll make it through

Empty and perfect
Shattered and worthless
Show me what's left
Show me what's left
Dragging me further
Forget to remember
Show me what's left
Show me what's left

Take the color from your eyes
I bleed for you
I bleed for you
Bring the broken back to life
We'll make it through
We'll make it through

Never again
Never again
Time will not take the life from me
Never again
Never again
Time will not take the life from me

And after this world is out of reach
Sober and silent, faded and violent
Hopeless I fight to fall between
Never surrender out of the embers
Save a space inside for me

Take the color from your eyes
I bleed for you
I bleed for you
Bring the broken back to life
We'll make it through
We'll make it through
Never again
Never again
Time will not take the life from me
Never again
Never again
Time will not take the life from me
