You always come to the parties
Too bad the feathers are for the birds
On your knees
I will not let you grieve

I want your picture but not your words
You know the wanting, but there's no verse
On your own
But you can not' call it your home

We always run our heads too much
We know the reasons, but such and such
On your own,
You will not let your arm go

We run our fingers together,
you know it's easy the devil's plan
On your own,
You can not call me your heart

Jack of all trades
Master of none
Cry all the time
Cause i'm not having fun

You always want to be forgiven
The devil loves what you ask of him
All your needs
But you can not; you will not agree
