Bury all the marigold
Underneath the bedroom
As you stole two kisses from her lips
Tears were shed
And morals bled
And petals were plucked
Something in the heart beat like a drum

Is this love?
I don't know but tonight I'm gonna find out
Is this love?
I don't know but tonight I'm gonna find out

We kissed without hesitation
No reservations
We dangle our feet from the highest places
In the crowd of the sad
In the crowd of the mad
We are the only smiling faces

Every day and all night
Even when you're alright
I don't want to let you go
And every day and all night
'Til the morning's always bright
I don't want to see you go

The morning light was blocked by dusty, dirty blinds
And I could hear your vodka kisses shouting
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

Is this love?
I don't know but tonight I'm gonna find out
IS this love?
I don't know but tonight I'm gonna find out
