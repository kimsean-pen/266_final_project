Whatchu got on top?
I'll take two of that
I'm chasing a story I heard

When I was here last
At the back of the class
You pretended you never got lost

Yeah, in the back of the class
in the back of the bus
Sittin out at the dance
Always saying no thanks
And they see you around, looking down at the ground
But when they walk away
You wish they'd stay

Never never mind bleedin heart bleedin heart
Never never mind your bleeding heart
Never never mind bleedin heart bleedin heart
Never never mind your bleeding heart

You can't help but stare at everyone there
It's you versus everyone else
Your outfit's a crime, you feel their cold minds
Placing you under arrest

And you savor your time
Drinkin all night long
Starin at the walls
Of your jail-like home
Listening to that song 'cause it hurts just right
Till everything is gone
Tonight

Never never mind bleedin heart bleedin heart
Never never mind your bleeding heart
Never never mind bleedin heart bleedin heart
Never never mind your bleeding heart

Never never mind bleedin heart bleedin heart
Never never mind your bleeding heart
Never never mind bleedin heart bleedin heart
Never never mind your bleeding heart

Someday you'll grow up
And then you'll forget
All of the pain you endured
Until you walk by a sad pair of eyes
And up will come back all the hurt

And you'll see their pain as they look away
And you want to help
But there's just no way
'Cause you won the war so it's not your turn
But everything inside still burns

Never never mind bleedin heart bleedin heart
Never never mind your bleeding heart
Never never mind bleedin heart bleedin heart
Never never mind your bleeding heart

Never never mind bleedin heart bleedin heart
Never never mind your bleeding heart
Never never mind bleedin heart bleedin heart
Never never mind your bleeding heart

Never never never mind mind mind
Nevermind your bleedin heart
Never never never mind mind mind
Nevermind your bleedin heart
Never never never mind mind mind

How long must I wait
Till you learn
That's it's not too late?
How long must I cry
Till you know
That you really tried?
How long must I try
Till you learn
that dreamin's heard?
How long must I dream
Till you heal
Your bleedin heart?

Never mind your bleeding heart
