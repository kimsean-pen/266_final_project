I wish I could drink you babe
You would be a bad habit I can't lose
It would be my escape
Can we just levitate
We could just coast swish smoke in the air
Cruise down this palisade yeah

Let's get lost up in the moment and live richer than we can
Make all the mistakes in life and still not give a damn

Let's get dressed
And love in the sunsets
Let's get dressed
Wear our dreams like converse
Oh let's get dressed
And love in the sunset
Where our dreams are timeless

Lets do things on purpose
Live flagrant
Make people nervous uh yeah
I think we should be reckless baby
Don't care if they notice
Live life on the surface yeah

Let's get lost up in the moment and live richer than we can
Make all the mistakes in life and still not give a damn

Let's get dressed
And love in the sunsets
Let's get dressed
Wear our dreams like converse
Oh let's get dressed
And love in the sunset
Where our dreams are timeless

Say now baby do you wanna do wanna get lost with me
We can be magic and care free
We could be living it up
Same time never giving it giving it up
Say now baby do you wanna do wanna get lost with me
We can be magic and care free
We could be living it up
Same time never giving it giving it up
Say now baby do you wanna do wanna get lost with me
We can be magic and care free
We could be living it up
Same time never giving it giving it up

Let's get dressed
And love in the sunsets
Let's get dressed
Wear our dreams like converse
Let's get dressed
And love in the sunset
Where our dreams are timeless
