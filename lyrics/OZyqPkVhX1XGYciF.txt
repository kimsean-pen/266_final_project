Lets overload

I can hear your heels clicking on the sidewalk
Beating to the rhythm of my heart
Caught up in you
You're the only one I want
I follow You home every night
Just to make sure that You get there alright
Baby it's true
Can't think of anything but You

And what I need baby
It a little bit of sympathy

You got me on me knees
I burn throughuot the night
And you know I can't leave without your love
Won't You help me cure this overload
Won't You help me cure this overload

Oh You got to know
You see me everywhere that you go
Doesn't that say something
Obsession's taken hold of me
All because of You
You've got to see me throught
Can't take another night alone without You
Honey it's true
I am so hung up on You
What I really need baby
Is a little of your company

You got me on me knees
I burn throughuot the night
And you know I can't leave without your love
Won't You help me cure this overload
Won't You help me cure this overload

And what I need baby
Is a little of your sympathy

You got me on me knees
I burn throughuot the night
And you know I can't leave without your love
Won't You help me cure this overload
Won't You help me cure this overload
