Goodbye
Should be saying that to you by now, shouldn't I?
Laying down a law that I live by
Well, maybe next time

I've got a thick tongue
Brimming with the words that go unsung
I simmer then I burn for a someone
The wrong one

And I tell myself to let the story end
That my heart will rest in someone else's hand
But my 'Why not me?' philosophy began
And I said

Ooh, how am I gonna get over you?
I'll be alright
Just not tonight
But someday

Oh, I wish you'd want me to stay
I'll be alright
Just not tonight
But someday

Maybe
It's a vicious little word that can slay me
Keep me where I'm hurting, you make me
Hang from your hands

But no more
I won't beg to buy a shot at your back door
If I'm aching at the thought of you, what for?
That's not me anymore

And I'm not the girl that I intend to be
But I dare you, darlin', just you wait and see
But this time not for you, but just for me
I said

Ooh, how am I gonna get over you?
I'll be alright
Just not tonight
But someday

Oh, I wish you'd want me to stay
I'll be alright
Just not tonight
But someday

Say it's coming soon
Someday without you
All I can do
Is get me past the ghost of you

Wave goodbye to me
I won't say I'm sorry
I'll be alright
Once I find the other side of someday
Ooh, how am I gonna get over you?
I'll be alright
Just not tonight
But someday
Oh, I wish you'd want me to stay
I'll be alright
Just not tonight
But someday
