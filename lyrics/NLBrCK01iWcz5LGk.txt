You're the colour
You're the movement and the spin

Never
Could it stay with me the whole day long

Fail with consequence
Lose with eloquence and smile

I'm not in this movie
I'm not in this song

Never
Leave me paralyzed, love
Leave me hypnotized, love

You're the colour
You're the movement and the spin

Never
Could it stay with me the whole day long

Fail with consequence
Lose with eloquence and smile

You're not in this movie
You're not in this song

Never
Leave me paralyzed, love
Leave me hypnotized, love
