And I walk the long way home again
I was afraid that you would see my face
and ask me where I've been
And I wait for something to begin
but I'm getting older and
my days are wearing oh, so thin.

To the creek where we fell in again
but I fell in again
and I pulled you in as well.
but I don't think I could've learned to swim
without you there to keep my head up
long enough to breath the air that you breathed too.

To the church where I cast out my sins
they said I could wash my feet,
but never walk again.
And we sit in the same seat every Sunday
but I couldn't hear a single word they said
while your hand is barely, barely touching mine.

Mmmmmmm

And I woke up in your room alone
I must have drifted off just staring at your clothes
Is he yours or is it someone else's now?
No matter the days away
I'll keep it ready
waiting for the day that you come home.
Mmm
