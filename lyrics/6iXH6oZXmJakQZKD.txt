You got your way with me now didn't ya
And I don't know why
Things you do are things we've done before
Don't you be looking at me darling with your sneaky eyes
Now what can you be looking at me for?

Sometimes when I'm lonely I close my eyes
Some nights when I can't sleep I fantasize
Hard to believe that you're right here tonight
I'm going out of my mind
Oh

I think this could be the one night
I give in to this fight
Boy I just might
Cause you rule my head
I can't stop the motion
Hold me, be the way you told me
Whisper something so sweet
This could be the night
Wrong feels so right

This could be the night
Wrong feels so right

Breaking my heart to see you lover
And I don't know why
Things you say are things you've said before
'Stead of the truth I swear you'd stick a needle in your eye
Now what can you be looking at me for?

Sometimes when I'm lonely I close my eyes
Some nights when I can't sleep I fantasize
Hard to believe that you're right here tonight
I'm going out of my mind
Oh

I think this could be the one night
I give in to this fight
Boy I just might
Cause you rule my head
I can't stop the motion
Hold me, be the way you told me
Whisper something so sweet
This could be the night
Wrong feels so right

Tell me what was I supposed to do
With that type of attention
I gave all that I had to you
You forgot to mention
When you say that your heart is true
It's just an invention
But not your intention no, no

Tell me what was I supposed to do
With that type of attention
I gave all that I had to you
You forgot to mention
When you say that your heart is true
It's just an invention
But not your intention no, no

I think this could be the one night
I give in to this fight
Boy I just might
Cause you rule on my head
I can't stop the motion
I can't stop the motion...
Wrong feels so right

This could be the night
Wrong feels so right

This could be the night
Wrong feels so right
