When the sun has died
When the angels are blind
When the pig lies thick
Over the palace of god

When the full moon lights the earth
When the wolves gather in the open
When blood rains from heaven high
And from the pearly gates

When Jehovah's hordes are slaughtered
When disciples twelve are dead
When beheth of easter lands
And raped and raped again

When the whore of Babylon rides
When fury turns to hate
When all sons of Satan
Sodomize the lambs of Christ

When the gates have all been opened
When the funerals never end
When Satan's ports paint out hearts
And sadness our souls

When witches burn the priests
When the ancient ones return
When the demons ride the numb
With their hares of dark desires
