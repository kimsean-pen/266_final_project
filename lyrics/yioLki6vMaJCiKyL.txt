well and every night I put on my leather shoes
cause every night I wanna dance with you
but when we got close I should've alredy known
her name is barbarella and when you see her you gotta get out

Barabarella, don't call me again
Just for you I've got my 'auf wiedersehen'
You're so dirty on the bar counter
But out of the bedroom you're my worst nightmare

and 21 days later I had to hit the brakes
now in my phone she comes up as a 'y mistake'
I think she bought her brains at the duty free
cause from all tommys songs she knows only "creep"

she was so hot like a girl from a vogue magazine
like a GQ man's dream o well you know what I mean
but after 21 nights there was not any doubt
her name is barbarella and when you see her you gotta get out

Barabarella, don't call me again
Just for you I've got my 'auf wiedersehen'
You're so dirty on the bar counter
But out of the bedroom you're my worst nightmare
