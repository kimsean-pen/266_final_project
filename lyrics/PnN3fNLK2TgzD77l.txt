I made a desert
Called it peace, broken with a topaz fist
Do you know you're a lovely old soul?
Fruit of my dawn, a mist settled in my marrow
Through my heart like an arrow
I feel bruises between hemispheres
Left by spent all my time getting high
Feeling so worried out of my mind
But in my darkest throes, you could have been my open door
Now I keep falling out of myself
Out of space and time where I'm never going to leave you
Where you're mine, I'll never stray
I ask you to stay, but still I fade

I made a desert
Shadow on the vector with a shade of chrome
Underneath blue skies
I stepped around my own encryption code
With you in my marrow, through my heart like an arrow
Covet you and I'll creep by the note you left
In a bountiful dwelling
Where I spend all my time getting high
Feeling so worried out of my mind
In my darkest throes, yeah you could be my open door
But I keep falling out of myself
Out of space and time where I'm never going to leave you
Where you're mine, I'll never stray
I ask you to stay, but still I fade

So I'll attach my ghost unto your sweetness
Through the white noise, so that you may visit me in the night
The night shows you are sleek, I am tinder
Ember that I harbor, in you I grow so tired

Do you know you're a lovely old soul?
Fruit of my dawn a mist settled within my marrow
Oh but you don't know, no you don't know
You're the hymn on the pulpit, the arch up above
The marigold thunder I hear in that distant storm
Oh I still feel it's reign in my bones
It's the sinew of my merit that is swelling with your love
As swift as it is tender, it echoes through my soul
Without it I'm left in this moment
With all I wanted to say and I keep falling out myself
Out of space and time where I'm never going to leave you
Where you're mine, I'll never stray
I ask you to stay, but still I fade
