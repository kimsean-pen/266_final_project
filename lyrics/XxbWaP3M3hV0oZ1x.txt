You whisper in my ear, dreams don't come true
Poison in my mind, like a tattoo
It's inked in my head, but I can't forget
What I had to prove

Oh, don't you believe anything is possible?
Oh, don't you believe in me and ghosts?
Oh, hope isn't dead, get out of my head

I'll build my castle in the sky
I'm floating on good light
Where dreams will never die
Nobody can overthrow me, I'm the king
My castle in the sky
My castle in the sky
Nobody can overthrow me, I'm the king

Wait for the light at the end of the tunnel
Don't cave, searching through the dark, I tell myself, "Have faith"
Hope isn't dead, it's here in my head, never forget

Watch me move mountains, I told you I'd never forget
Watch me sit on the throne, as I break every rule that you said

I'll build my castle in the sky
I'm floating on good light
Where dreams will never die
Nobody can overthrow me, I'm the king
My castle in the sky
My castle in the sky
Nobody can overthrow me, I'm the king

I'm up in the clouds
Taking in my new view of the ground
Oh, it feels good to be king
From my new throne I can see everything
Spread my wings and fly to my castle in the sky

I'll build my castle in the sky
I'm floating on good light
Where dreams will never die
Nobody can overthrow me, I'm the king
My castle in the sky
My castle in the sky
Nobody can overthrow me, I'm the king
