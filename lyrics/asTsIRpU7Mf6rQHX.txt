If I could
I would dare
Feed your dreams and starve your fears
If I could
Light the world
We could sit and watch it burn
We could fall asleep inside the glow

So tell me what I gotta do to win you over
You'll never have to wonder if you need another
You'll never have to wonder if I understand
And every time you reach for me you'll find a hand out
Ohhhhhh

If I could
Take you in
Feelin' you deep beneath my skin
Then I could
Slip away

With you as the poison in my veins
But I don't wanna fall asleep alone
And wake up knowin' that I died without the one

So tell me what I gotta do to win you over
You'll never have to wonder if you need another
You'll never have to wonder if I understand
And every time you reach for me you'll find a hand out
Ohhhhhhh

So tell me what I gotta do to win you over
You'll never have to wonder if you need another
You'll never have to wonder if I understand
And every time you reach for me you'll find a hand out
Ohhhhh

If I could
I would dare
Feed your dreams and starve your fears
