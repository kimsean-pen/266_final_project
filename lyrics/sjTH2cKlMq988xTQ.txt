Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay

Tell me it's okay (to be happy now)
Tell me it's okay (because I'm happy now)
Tell me it's okay

Hey
I think I might move on to something new
But only if you say that's cool with you
'Cause I love all the little things you do
(I mean I did 'cause)

I begged you to show up and I asked you to stay
You told me to grow up, so I pushed you away
I tell you, "you know what?" And we fought once again, then
We got back together, who's kidding who? It's a trend because

I like being alone, but I don't like being lonely
I like being home, but I don't like being homies
You know, I'm so sorry for making you feel you lost me
We're two unstable enablers, please, try not to be salty, because

All this time and all these tries leave questions open ended and
I would rather die, than try to live with this resentment so
We could try just one more time to make sure that we meant it or
We could cut our losses before we blow up and dead it so

Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay

Tell me it's okay (to be happy now)
Tell me it's okay (because I'm happy now)
Tell me it's okay

Hey
It's okay to say you're not okay
It's not okay to turn and walk away
We've got problems that we need to face

If you love me, then say it
If you trust me, then show it
If you don't mean it, save it
If you do mean it, own it
You gotta be happy alone, to be happy together
You gotta lose something you know, to learn how to get better
I've been working, you've been hurting
I've been curving, you've been swerving
I've been sleeping, you've been creeping
Now you got me creeped, I'm leaving

I think about you, I dream about you
I smile about you, I cry about you
I lie about you, I'm fine without you
I lied, that's not true, I'd die without you

Our love is a war, we use words as our weapons
So either you're real or I'm gone in a second
These thoughts that we have and these feelings we kept in
Make resent and regret, upset and a severance

You don't fuck with ultimatums, have to face it
Love's contagious, also dangerous
Leaves you damaged, make it painless
Now, don't make sense, tried to saved it, please, please, please

Tell me it's okay, please, please, please
Tell me it's okay, please, please, please
Tell me it's okay

Tell me it's okay (to be happy now)
Tell me it's okay (because I'm happy now)
Tell me it's okay

Tell me it's okay (to be happy now)
Tell me it's okay (because I'm happy now)
Tell me it's okay

Tell me it's okay
To be happy now
Because I'm happy now
Tell me it's okay
