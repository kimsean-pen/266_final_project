I'm gonna give you all I've got
You gotta get me higher
You gotta do the best you can
Unchaining my desire

You're the best in town the number one
Why don't you prove it
Show me all your love, shake it baby
Shake it move it

I'm gonna give you all my love
I'm gonna get you higher
Come on get up and boogie now,
Come on light up my fire

And I'll keep going on and on and on
All night and till the morning light
And I won't stop I'll go ahead
Until you 're really satisfied

Get up get up get up and boogie
Get up get up and move your body
Get up get up and boogie woogie
Boogie boogie, woogie woogie

Get up get up get up and boogie
Get up get up and move your body
Get up get up and boogie woogie
Boogie boogie, woogie woogie

You gotta get me higher
Ire ire ire
Bingo lingo dingo rango
I'm gonna dance a tango
Helston, ucci gucci
I'm gonna get fiorucci
Yo oh, yo oh, yo oh
I'm going to Idaho
We gotta live together
Let's sing this song forever
You gotta shake it baby
There is not time for maybe
Paris, New York Miami.
Ibiza, Barcellona,
Get up and move your body
You're dancing with Corona.

Get up get up get up and boogie
Get up get up and move your body
Get up get up and boogie woogie
Boogie boogie, woogie woogie

Get up get up get up and boogie
Get up get up and move your body
Get up get up and boogie woogie
Boogie boogie, woogie woogie
