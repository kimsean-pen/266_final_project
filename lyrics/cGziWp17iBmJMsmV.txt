She packed all her bags and went on her way
Back to where they laid
The cat's been crying out
Wandering all alone around the house
I really hope you're happy where you are now

Just get it all out
Put it in a song
Just get it all out
Write another song
Anna, Anna

Bed bound doesn't feel the same without you
You are the other half
The missing parts
The sleepless muse
And you said I've got a lot of problems
And one of them is always you
But I'm fine with that
Let's just work on it
I mean you've got yours too

Just get it all out
Put it in a song
Just get it all out
Write another song
Anna, Anna, Anna

Don't get used to the isolation
You're gonna want it when your gone
When there's no one with any patience
And you think
"Are they my friends, or do I just want something from them"
The endless record spinning inside my head

Just get it all out
Put it in a song
Just get it all out
Write another song
Anna come on, tell 'em what went wrong
Just get it all out
Write another song
Anna

She packed all her bags and went on her way
