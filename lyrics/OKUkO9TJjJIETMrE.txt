I could lose you or lose my mind, my mind
Damn, I just give into those eyes, those eyes

When you can't sleep and you text me
You know what you do
Pull up late night, blur the same lines by the time we're through

I'm only human
I'm only human
I'm only human
I'm only human
I give into it
I'm only human

What are you doing?
I'm only human
I'm only human
I try but it's useless
I'm only human, babe
I'm only human, babe

It's just what it looks like to me, to me
Yeah, you got way too much pride to see that you should just sleep

When you can't sleep and you text me
You know what you do
Pull up late night, blur the same lines by the time we're through

I'm only human
I'm only human
I'm only human
I'm only human
I give into it
I'm only human
What are you doing?

I'm only human
I'm only human
I try but it's useless
I'm only human, babe
I'm only human, babe
I'm only human
What are you doing to me?
I'm only human

I'm only human
I'm only human
I'm only human
I'm only human
I give into it
I'm only human
What are you doing?

I'm only human
I'm only human
I try but it's useless
I'm only human, babe
I'm only human, babe
I'm only human
What are you doing to me?
I'm only human
