Lay me down
The California dreams on my mind
Quiet and calm
The benefits of finer red wine

Heal
All the pains of growing up
I feel it inside
I feel it coming up

If you feed me now
I'll be on my way out the door
But if you tease me now
I'll come just come back hungry for more
'Cause the taste of your honey's sweet

Back to back
The days they go and make love with the night
Moving fast
You overlook the joys in plain sight

Heal
All the pains of growing up
I feel it inside
I feel it coming up

If you feed me now
I'll be on my way out the door
But if you tease me now
I'll come just come back hungry for more
'Cause the taste of your honey's sweet
And I'm one who loves to eat

Do you feel?
Do you feel it? Do you feel?
Do you feel it? Do you feel?
I do, I do

Do you feel it? Do you feel?
I do, I do
I feel, I love it

Do you feel?
I do, I do
Do you feel it? Do you feel?
I do, I do
I feel, I love it

Do you feel?
I do, I do
Do you feel it? Do you feel?
I do, I do
I feel, I love it

The pains of growing
I feel inside
I feel it coming up

If you feed me now
I'll be on my way out the door
But if you tease me now
I'll come just come back hungry for more
'Cause the taste of your honey's sweet
And I'm one who loves to eat
