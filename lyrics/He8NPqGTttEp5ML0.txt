let's find something that can last
like cigarette ash, the world is collapsing around me
let's try to do the best we can
i think i need more than the flowers and letters, man

it's not that i don't try, it's that you won't again
and it hurts too much to laugh about it
yes, it hurts too much to laugh about it

hey, please think about it, friend
i know you're lonely, i'm here writing in the dark
trying to get the balls
but it hurts too much to ask

do i need someone who's lost
tell me how not to stop all these tears and fears
so nothing else will drop
so all this pain will stop
but if it hurts too much ask
if it hurts too much to ask

it's not that i don't cry
it's that i have to hide
yeah, it's that i have to hide
so i won't be there to ask
so i won't be there to ask
so i won't be there to ask
no, i won't be there to ask
and it hurts too much to laugh about it
yes, it hurts too much to laugh about it
yes, it hurts too much to laugh about it, man
