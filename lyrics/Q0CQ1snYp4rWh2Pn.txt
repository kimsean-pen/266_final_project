I promise that I'll hold you when it's cold out
When we lose our winter coats in the Spring
'Cause lately I was thinking I never told you
That everytime I see you my heart sings
'Cause we lived at the carnival in summer
Scared ourselves to death on a ghost train
Just like every ferris wheel stops turning
Oh I guess we had an expiration date
So I won't say I love you it's too late
'Cause everytime I saw you I got nervous
Shivering and shaking at the knees
Just like every song I haven't heard yet
I didn't know the words in front of me
In front of me oohhhh
But I dont wanna know
Who'll take you home?
Who'll take you home?
Who'll take you home?
If I let you go...
Now that you're on someone else's shoulders
The winter winds are colder on my own
Maybe we will meet when we get older
Maybe we won't
So I won't say I love you if you don't
No you don't
So I won't say I love you if you don't
