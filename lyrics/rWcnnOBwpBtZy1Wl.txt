The world is a circus
Oh, look what they can do
To that horse, to that lion
To that tiger and that bear

The world is an arena
And the cage waits in the back
For that eagle, for that monkey,
for that ape and all of you

they applaud, they applaud
to the parody of nature
it's a fraud, it's a fraud
it's a consume stimulator

what a show, what a show
they present us what they've trained
with that man, with that woman,
with that child and all of us

we consume, we consume
we got to work and then we sleep
we buy and then we eat
when we oppose they shut us up

make it stop, make it stop
before the clowns will eat themselves
we gotta leave the circus
cause we want to see the world

the circus of tears
plays the requiem of life
here we go – here we go
it's an animal show – to go
