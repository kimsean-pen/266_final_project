Ay, pull up puffing on the E-ndo
Chevy sitting up on the renzos
Old head hit me with the head nod
I understood a nigga like 10-4
10-4, 10-4, 10-4
10-4, 10-4, 10-4
Old head hit me with the head nod
I understood a nigga like

Deep conversations about language, which one you speak?
Lotta niggas claim bilingual, lie through they teeth
Shout out to the money, it's on the tip of they tongue
You know the feeling when the words just outside your reach, yuh

Take a few steps, seeing you outside your territory
Make them lean back like Terror Squad when telling stories
Or even like you got the Aquia
So many different vernacular perspective and points
Went from selecting electives to collecting the coins
To rejecting investments to connecting with legends
And stressing acceptance to,
fuck it I'll write with my left
while finessing this joint with my right
To bring the light, like a key on a kite

The rolling thunder make 'em pee on theyself
I see the fire, I've been drinking freon
I'm on the corner, feel like Dion with these cowboys
Don't speak snake with these Malfoys though
No sweat on my towel boy flow
Brought the funk like a outhouse, that bumps like a bouncehouse
And spit like the beatbox that he rock
That he rock.

Ay, pull up puffing on the E-ndo

Old head hit me with the head nod
I understood a nigga like 10-4
10-4, 10-4, 10-4
10-4, 10-4, 10-4
Old head hit me with the head nod
I understood a nigga like

Yeah, we say a lot to say a little
Sometimes we say the most when we ain't really saying shit at all
Cotton mouth I swear I spit it all
I spit it all on the paper
I'm twisting all of this paper
I'm spending all of this paper, for retail therapy
Brim low, they still can tell it's me
They say they want the kid at Tel Aviv
What that tell the world
I know you smelling me

My fingers recently wrestled the evergreen
Been 100 proof, the message is everclear
Speaking for the crew, I'm playing Miss Everdeen, peculiar
Yeah, I study Miss Peregrine, my pedigree
Duke Nukem yo you can Uber or just let it be
Falling outta harmony, be singing different melodies
Really ain't spoke the same language in a long time
Both like to claim it's only 'cause the different latitude
Long lines at shows got me distant with my attitude
I'm at a door, I know you mad at me
I ain't even mad at you, Not good with math.

Ay, pull up puffing on the E-ndo

10-4, 10-4, 10-4
