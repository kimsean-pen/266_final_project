My heart is bursting
My head is on overload
My lines are twisting
And I want more
You ask me if I could try to take it back
I will cause oh I've got the appetite
I like that you must be doing something right
I never knew it could
Be sweet
Over and over again
Over and over again
My mind is acing
I'm going for overdose
My body is shaking
And I want more
You ask me if I could try to take it back
I will cause oh I've got the appetite
I like that you must be doing something right
I never knew
It could be sweet
Over and over again
Over and over again
Be sweet
Over and over again
Over and over again
