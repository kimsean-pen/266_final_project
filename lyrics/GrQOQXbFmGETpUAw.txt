About to bloom like it's April
Hold me down like a capo
In the middle of the room I saw you
In the middle of the room
The way we move, so stable
No, I never felt like this before
In the middle of the floor on a table
In the middle of the floor

We stay up 'til the stars fade (fade)
You fall me in like a switchblade (blade)
At the foot of the bed you've held me (held me)
At the foot of the bed (bed)
You're like a drug, let me medicate (medicate)
No, I never felt like this before
At the foot of the bed I gave in
At the foot of the bed

Bed, floor, blade, pound, floor, bed, bed, floor
Pound, pound at the foot of the bed
Bed, floor, blade, pound, floor, bed, bed, floor
Pound, pound at the foot of the bed

We stay up 'til the stars fade (fade)
You fall me in like a switchblade (blade)
At the foot of the bed you've held me (held me)
At the foot of the bed (bed)
You're like a drug, let me medicate (medicate)
No, I never felt like this before
At the foot of the bed I gave in
At the foot of the bed

About to bloom like it's April
Hold me down like a capo
In the middle of the room I saw you
In the middle of the room
The way we move, so stable
No, I never felt like this before
In the middle of the floor on a table
In the middle of the floor
In the middle of the floor

Bed, floor, blade, pound, floor, bed, bed, floor
Pound, pound, floor, floor
