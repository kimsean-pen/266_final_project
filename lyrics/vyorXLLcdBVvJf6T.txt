We put them in the park and we told them to hold on tight
Let go of them, let go of them, let go of them

'Cause you are their night
The ones that holy eyes will chase
And just the right height
Struggling as always

And we were just across the road
Now that you're colder, now that you're colder

So sick to death of the sight of you now
Safe to say never wanted you more
And you asked for one more go

So sick to death of the sight of you now
Safe to say never wanted you more
And you asked for one more go

'Cause you are their night
The ones that holy eyes will chase
And just the right height
Struggling as always

And I was just across the road
We put them in the park and we told them to hold on tight
And I was just across the road
And now that you're colder, and now that you're colder

So sick to death of the sight of you now
Safe to say never wanted you more
And you asked for one more go

And she had the answer
She had the answer
'Cause she's lying on the road
And now she's lying on the road

So sick to death of the sight of you now
Safe to say never wanted you more
And you asked for one more go

And she had the answer
She had the answer
'Cause she's lying on the road
And now she's lying on the road

And I was hoping on a good day that you'd be fine
And I was hoping on a good day that you would be fine
I was hoping on a good day that you would be mine
And we were hoping on a good day that they would be fine
