Cause man are like Jaykae, where have you been?
Everyone's asking me that, you know
So let me tell them

Yo
Cause I was the best man when D2 got married
The pallbearer when Depz got carried
I lost count of times I got ballied
And risked my freedom for pricks
Yeah I was inside, me & Remtrex got padded
Told him strap bars, don't stay strallied
All of the hype on road's invalid
Don't risk your freedom for this
Now you're back inside looking at a big ride
So holla me fam if you need anything
I know how it goes cause I've been on the wing
I was with Hecki and Keem on the wing
Had it on lock before I got locked
Nearly at the top, yeah, I've been near the brink
These bitches want to go to the club
Tell 'em go back home
Go clean up your sink
If you think Jaykae ain't saying anything
Walk in the yard, go straight to the fridge
Built that shit, now I'm breaking the bridge
Wanna come Small Heath? Do a straight to the bridge
So leap in, man are taking the piss
Cut all the bullshit, straight to the biz
I was the guy that stood up and took charge when Vades had a brain hemorrhage
I was the guy who jumped out the car, and ran down the guy that was stabbing up Sox
I was the guy at Sidewinder who got stabbed up and everybody watched
Now, everybody watch
Everybody get down
Everybody drop
I've seen MCs get friendly with the cops
Yo, when will it stop?
Nah, fuck that, I'll put an end to the lot

If you want me, you better pay me dough
This Jaykae's not Jay Z's flow
Used to shot work cause it made me dough
That's a little man ting like a baby-grow
Phoned up the boys in jail in the background, I can hear me on the radio
I was the guy who told Soulja that you got to let KD go
Now, KD's gone (R.I.P)
Ay yo I feel that shit for his Nan and his Mum
My man wanted to be like us, so he put on his shoes and we brang him along
I was in jail when my Grandma died
Ain't gonna lie blood, man rah cried
Brumtown's mine I've been doing this time
For the last 10 years, been around our sides

It's real shit, and that's realer shit
I want a M4 straight from the dealership
I wanna rep for my city like Leshurr did
I best watch those guys that I'm meeting with
Just baked a cake, they want a piece of it
But my problems are the least of it
Yo, what's a leader without leadership?
Had to break-fast like Weetabix, mad

Invading alone yeah, you can hold that
I can get my own back off my own back
You can phone me but I won't phone back
You don't owe me, and I don't owe jack
And it's cold out 'ere, best mind you don't lack
No picture when you get a throw back
Ask man who got a problem with that? It's as simple as that

I used to wake up and not know what I'll do for the day
'Till I had a yout' on the way
I need a mansion now, when are you going to pay?
No better get down, lettin' loose when I spray
I'm a boss with lyrics, a boss with digits
I'm the big boss and I'll squash these midgets
No filters, family, this ain't gimmicks
I might bring the six, but this ain't Quidditch
I'm quite quick to flip it, rib cage with it
We got problems, it ain't finished
Now, I make bread on a Hovis ting
I'm best of both worlds, I'm mixed race init
Back then, I never had a pot to piss in
Karma's a bitch, watch what you're wishin'
Inspiration became competition
I keep it real, so you've got to listen to me
