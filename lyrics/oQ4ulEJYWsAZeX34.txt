All I want is to be with you
All I want is to be with you
Show your cards, show me what you got
We'll break these poker faces, like it or not

Everyone's in my head
But I want you in my bed
I never wanna go a day without you
I could never go a day

Come closer to me baby
I've got everything you need
To feed your hunger pains for tonight

Warm me up beneath the sheets babe
I've heard all about how you can save
I don't wanna go a day with out you
Warm me up beneath the sheets babe
I've heard all about how you can save
I don't wanna go a day without you

Innocence meet jealousy
Isn't she stunning?
She'll make you smile so hard inside
Make you wish you could bring back those nights

Take a walk with me through my head
I'll show you where I rest
All those nights when I'm without you
Draw a new breath; I swear I'll show you

Come closer to me baby
I've got everything you need
To feed your hunger pains for tonight

Warm me up beneath the sheets babe
I've heard all about how you can save
I don't wanna go a day with out you
Warm me up beneath the sheets babe
I've heard all about how you can save
I don't wanna go a day without you

Come closer to me baby
I've got everything you need
To feed your hunger pains for tonight

This can all be a reality
If you just say you'll stay with me
I'll make sure everything is done right

(Chorus)
