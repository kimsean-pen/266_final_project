Weaving through the past
I'll respond to that
I can't make it up
Thought I'd had enough

Hey now, it's me
Hey now, it's me
Try hard to be
Try hard with me

I deserved a lot
But it's all you got
Build the strength within
I believed it then

Try hard you'll see
Try now it's me
Nothing explained
I try the same

I been trying
Now my time is lonely

I hurt when you go
Wish I'd never know

Hey now it's me
My lips believed
Their too extreme
Now try it's me

Dream the life I'm flying
Always left still trying
To see you
I'm trying
Can I steal you?
Been trying
Can I feel it's right, to stay?

I heard where you went
Now I can't forget
Drawing in on me
Dropping where I'll be

Hey now it's me
My lips believe
They're licking me
Down where I'll be

Hey now it's me
Hey now it's me
Their lips believe
Hey now it's me
