When the night has come
And land is dark
And the moon is the only light we see
No I won't be afraid
Oh, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

So darling, darling
Stand by me, oh stand by me
Oh stand,
Stand by me

If the sky we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry
No, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

So darling, darling
Stand by me, oh stand by me
Oh stand by me,
...stand by me...
