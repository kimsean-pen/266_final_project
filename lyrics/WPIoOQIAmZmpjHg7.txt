What's the addiction here?
You taste for the insincere
Disposable high and you keep on wanting more
The world's at your fingertips but you can't get enough of it
Disposable high you just can't ignore

And I'm thinking that you're always gonna chase
And that you're never gonna change
And it leaves me wondering

Who's gonna be the one, one
Breath the air in your lungs, lungs?
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Looks like you fell in love, love
'Til the next one shows up, up
You gotta be the easiest to please
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?

They're all replaceable in your head you chase the whole illusion
That they give you all that you need

But you're never satisfied, lost and empty inside
You'll come to find it's all temporary
And I'm think that you're always gonna chase
And that you're never gonna change

And it leaves me wondering...
Who's gonna be the one, one
Breathe the air in your lungs, lungs
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Looks like you fell in love, love
Til the next one show up, up
You gotta be the easiest to please
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Savior...
Savior...
Savior...
Who's gonna be the one, one
Breath the air in your lungs, lungs
Who's gona be the savior of the week?
Looks like you fell in love, love
Til the next one shows up, up
You gotta be the easiest to please
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Who's gonna be, who's gonna be, who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Savior of the week
Who's gonna be, who's gonna be, who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Savior
Who's gonna be, who's gonna be, who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Savior
Who's gonna be the one, one
Breath the air in your lungs?
