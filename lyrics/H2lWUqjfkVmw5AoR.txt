You drove me to the edge,
You told me that we'd see each other again
No way
You asked me for my life,
You asked me as the tears welled in your eyes
You cried
You wanted me alone,
You said that no one knows where we will go
I know
You offered your goodbyes,
You held me and recited all your lies
I cried

Drive off the edge into the sun,
Don't look before you leap
Drive off the edge with me my love,
I'll hold you while you sleep.

The road will end but we'll go on,
Who knows where we will meet?
Drive off the edge into the sun,
Don't look until you leap.
