Suffering alone
Crying in the dark
It's what he's done
And you want him to die

Don't be afraid
Don't feel dirty
You have the power
Just scream out louder

Kill the silence!
Kill the silence!
Kill, kill, kill
Kill the silence!

No revenge
But punishment

Violating your honor
Bringing loathe and shame
Mental disorder
You are not to blame

Don't lose your hope
Don't lose your strength
You are not alone
Just break this dome

Kill the silence!
Kill the silence!
Kill, kill, kill
Kill the silence!

No ruth
Speak the truth

You're not alone
You're not alone
You're not alone
Kill the silence!
