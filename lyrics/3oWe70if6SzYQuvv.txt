You're stuck in the same rut
Your world is turning grey
You worked so hard to get this far
When they pull you away
Hard work pays off they say
But never will they see
They're blinded by the media
What they see on TV
What they see on TV

We're washed up
So washed up
Misunderstood
Just follow
Or swallow your pride
We're washed up
So washed up
Misunderstood
Just follow
Or swallow your pride
Swallow your pride

Her inspiration has run dry
'Cause they're all empty inside, inside
Manipulated, mass produced robots
We are not machines
You're the ones to blame for this
Get up and have your own head, own head
Dare we have an opinion
Dare we think out loud

We're washed up
So washed up
Misunderstood
Just follow
Or swallow your pride
We're washed up
So washed up
Misunderstood
Just follow
Or swallow your pride
Swallow your pride

(Or swallow your pride)

Dare to speak your own mind
Dare to be you, you
Dare to speak your own mind
Dare to be you, dare to be you
Dare to speak your own mind
Dare to like the unknown
Dare to be dangerous
Dare to be dangerous

We're washed up
So washed up
Misunderstood
Just follow
Or swallow your pride
We're washed up
So washed up
Misunderstood
Just follow
Or swallow your pride

Her inspiration has run dry
'Cause they're all empty inside, inside
Manipulated, mass produced robots
We are not machines
