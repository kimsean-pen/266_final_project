by the time you're natural
by the time you die
I'll take my head and spin it for you
I'll just look around
and I call you liar
and I call you dead
you come and poisoned all the things that I once set up on
everybody's hungry
everybody's high
we'll sit around and ask ourself if it was all a lie
and I already told you
and I already say
but you have got to know yourself and so I let it slide
can you get together
can you hold my hand
it takes forever for the sound to get around
and I already love you
and I already want
but will we all just sore
