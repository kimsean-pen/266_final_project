You can't touch it with your two hands
You can't find it with the third eye
And I've been thirsting in the mud lands
For a well you can't run dry
Passed down to me through the wind
And in the silence of the white sound
It's always hidden in the dark night
And dug up from the cold ground
But it goes over the heart, over the head
Over and above all the words they said
Be still my heart, be still my head
I got a gold mine, it's all mine
Nobody can touch this gold of mine
I got a gold mine, it's all mine
Nobody can touch this gold of mine
I got a gold mine, it's all mine
Nobody can touch this gold of mine
It's been through the brimstone, been through the fire
Nobody can touch this gold of mine
And it's burning in the furnace
And refined in the third eye
No you won't find it on the surface
It rises out of the war cry
But this goes over the heart, over the head
Go on get past all the words they said
Be still in your heart, still in your head
I got a gold mine, it's all mine
Nobody can touch this gold of mine
I got a gold mine, it's all mine
Nobody can touch this gold of mine
I got a gold mine, it's all mine
Nobody can touch this gold of mine
It's been through the brimstone, been through the fire
Nobody can touch this gold of mine
They all running to the gold rush
They all running to the river
Don't speak loud, keep it hush
Cos we're about to be delivered
I got a gold mine, it's all mine
Nobody can touch this gold of mine
I got a gold mine, it's all mine
Nobody can touch this gold of mine
I got a gold mine, it's all mine
Nobody can touch this gold of mine
It's been through the brimstone, been through the fire
Nobody can touch this gold of mine
