Everyone's a critic looking back up the river
Every boat is leaking in this town
Everybody is thinking they can all be delivered
Sitting in a box like lost and found

But I found my place
And it's all right
We're all searching for a better way
Get this off my plate
It's all right
I got my own way to believe

Find a lighthouse in the dark stormy weather
We all could use a sedative right now
Holy rollers sitting with their backs to the middle
All alone and sinking is the bow

And if you want to have to pray
It's all right
We all be thinking with our different brains
Get this off my plate
It's all right
I got my own way to believe

It's okay
Sometimes you find yourself having to put all your faith
In no faith
Mine is mine and yours won't take its place
Now, make your getaway
Science says we're making love like the lizards
Try and say that fossils ain't profound
Silence says that we're not allowed to consider
Silence says stand up, sit down, you're out
But I found my place
And it's all right

I'm bearing witness to some better things
Get this off my plate
It's all right
I've got my own way to believe
It's okay
Sometimes you find yourself being told to change your ways
There's no way
Mine is mine and yours won't take its place
Now make your getaway
Hey hey, it's okay
Sometimes you find yourself having to put all your faith
In no faith
Mine is mine and yours won't take its place

Now make your getaway
It's okay
Sometimes you find yourself being told to change your ways
For God's sake
Mine is mine and yours won't take its place
Now, make your getaway
