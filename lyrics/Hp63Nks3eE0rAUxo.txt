In a
In a deep sleep
awaken by the dragons
kept you hidden here with me
whats not prepared
for a dead end

take me take me downtown
tonight
I want to forget
I want lights too
Blind me
I want
want to disappear

Dj, ease my mind will you
play that song again
cause we were in love
before, before the rain began
and if I cry out, cover my ears

a foreign hand and runaway horses
restless doubt heart
in a vision
I did not see
see it coming
now it's in my blood
now it's in my blood

Oh Oh Dj ease my mind will you
play that song again
cause we were in love
before, before the rain began
and if I cry out, cover my ears.
Oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh Oh Dj Ease my mind will you
Play that song again
cause we were in love
before, before the rain began
and if I cry out, cover my ears.
Dj Ease my mind will you
Play that song again
cause we were in love
When we Heard it the first time
and if I cry out, cover my ears.
Oh
