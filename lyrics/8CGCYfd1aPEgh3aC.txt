You move me... I'm burning
Such passion I'm yearning
One thought keeps returning
Could it be... I'm in love?

You touch a place in me that feels so divine
I can't recall the pain that once was mine
Since we kissed I am not the same
I've blossomed in desire
Could it be... I'm in love?

Falling. I'm flying
I'm laughing now I'm crying
I'm born but it's like dying
Could it be... I'm in love?

I tremble... it's thrilling
It scares me but I'm willing
It drains me but it's filling
Could it be... I'm in love?

It's madness... I know it
I love it do I show it
It's too late now I glow it
Could it be... I'm in love?
