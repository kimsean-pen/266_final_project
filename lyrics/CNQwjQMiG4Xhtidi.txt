Mr. Sound's just like a fountain
Only goes where the rhythm takes him
Only goes where the sun don't shine
On his own, to a paradise
Mr. Sound flows like a mountain
Like a volcano erupting
On a boat, on the molten lava

Standing up like a wild impala
Standing down like a weekend martyr
Living life at the speed of light

Mr. Sound's just like a fountain
Only goes where the rhythm takes him
Only goes where the sun don't shine
On his own, to a paradise
Mr. Sound flows like a mountain
Like a volcano erupting
On a boat, on the molten lava

Standing up like a wild impala
Standing down like a weekend martyr
Living life at the speed of light

Oh, the saviour, the saviour, the saviour
Foul behaviour, behaviour, behaviour

When the shadow sleep isn't slept
We appear that we have a little left
In tune

Mystic man stands like a countess
Like a king dressed in a corset
On a carpet that's red all over
He becomes just a little less sober
Here's a plan for the distant future:
You're alive, not like a computer, in the future
Take a sip from the detox, dandy

Have a taste in the open pantry
Remember when you were small, free the entry
Living life at the speed of light

Oh, the saviour, the saviour, the saviour
Foul behaviour, behaviour, behaviour

When the shadow sleep isn't slept
We appear that we have a little left
In tune

Everyone's got everything wrong
Every man wants every woman
In a patch with a pent up story
We reflect and remind what words mean
In the night we open our ears
To the visual sound of the fear
Mr. Sound in the open diary

Take a look with your eyes closed open
Standing down like a weekend spokesman
Living life at the speed of light

Oh, the saviour, the saviour, the saviour
Foul behaviour, behaviour, behaviour

Oh, the saviour, the saviour, the saviour
Foul behaviour, behaviour, behaviour
