I felt it
The wire touched my neck and
Then someone pulled it tighter
I never saw it coming
I started to black out and
Then someone said good morning
I took it as a warning
I should have seen it coming
So now I'll take a chance on
This thing we may have started
Intentional or not I
Don't think we saw it coming
It's all adding up to something
That asks for some involvement
That asks for a commitment
I think I see it coming
If we step out on that limb

My heartbeat beats me senselessly
Why's everything gotta be so intense with me
I'm trying to handle all this unpredictability
In all probability

It's a long shot but I say why not
If I say forget it I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat these odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take there's no chance
But you're the best I've got
So take the long shot

I realize that there is all this starting
That we're both scared about but
We'll never see them coming
Throw caution to the wind and
We'll see which way it's blowing
And to this pulling on
Well never see it coming
Until it's much too close to stop

My heartbeat beats me senselessly
Why's everything gotta be so intense with me
I'm trying to handle all this unpredictability
In all probability

It's a long shot but I say why not
If I say forget it I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat these odds
The chance is we won't make it but I know if I don't take it
there's no chance
Cause I'm the best you've got
So take the long shot

Oh I waited for fact to come of fiction
And you fit my description
I never saw you coming
But we'll make it

It's a long shot but I say why not
If I say forget it
I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat these odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it there's no chance
Cause you're the best I've got

It's a long shot but I say why not
If I say forget it
I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat these odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it there's no chance
Cause you're the best I've got
So take the long shot
(You didn't expect this)
It's a long shot but I say why not
If I say forget it
(Oh you never saw me coming)
I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat this odds
(You didn't expect this)
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it there's no chance
(Oh you never saw this coming)
Cause you're the best I've got
So take the long shot
