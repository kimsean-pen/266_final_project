I know I wasn't good
Maybe I was even bad
But I was way too young
To know just what I had
And if I let you down
Now I let you go
But I was so young
And now it's all gone

I'm the one to blame
I'm the one to blame

You must never think
I wish that you had stayed
Look at where we are
I'm glad you got away
But who's your daddy now
And where's your home
You're living somewhere new
D'you think he'd take me too

I'm the one to blame
I'm the one to blame

Now you forgot the words
Please don't forget your name
And who gave that to you
Well that was me again
Who let you down and loved you
That was me again
And who's the one to blame
That was me again

I'm the one to blame
Who let you down and loved you
I'm the one to blame
I'm the one to blame
