Can you hear the thunder?
Can you feel the rain, it pours,
Nail down all your windows
And barricade the doors
Mother nature's fury takes you by the hand
Showing all but mercy
Wreaking death upon the land

Go!

Caught in the eye of the storm
Did the heaven just open and fall?
We are caught in the eye of the storm
All that's left are just bodies to mourn

Can you see the lightning?
Can you feel the wind, it soars
Pack up your belongings, let chaos take control
(Take control!)
Mother nature's fury takes you by the hand
Rip this world to pieces
Bid farewell to all you know

Go!

Caught in the eye of the storm
Did the heavens just open and fall?
We are caught in the eye of the storm
All that's left are just bodies to mourn

Yeah!

Caught in the eye of the storm
Caught in the eye of the storm
Caught in the eye of the storm

Can you hear the thunder?
Can you feel the rain, it pours
Melt down all your windows
That barricade the doors
Mother nature's fury takes you by the hand
Showing all but mercy
Wreaking death upon the land

Go!

Caught in the eye of the storm
Did the heaven just open and fall?
We are caught in the eye of the storm
All that's left are just bodies to mourn

To mourn!
