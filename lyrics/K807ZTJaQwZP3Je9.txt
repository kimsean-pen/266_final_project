Innocence
For my over-confidence
I'll show my cards again
Though the tables changed
I'm still Innocent

Fight for me
Through these
Waters deep

I'm indifferent
Can't be different
It's still just me

Don't let the words of the weak grind you down to the bone
Your falling in fear, feet never far the ground
Don't let the words of the weak grind you down to the bone

That feeling's back again
I've told my closest friends
I've told my enemies
Staring back at me
They cannot laugh at me

Don't let the words of the weak grind you down to the bone
Your falling in fear, feet never far the ground
Don't let the words of the weak grind you down
Down
Down

Voices on the wind
Can you hear them calling?

Softer than a bird to my ever mournful song

Voices in the head can you hear them calling
Echos in the dark, to my ever mournful song

Voices on the wind
Can you hear them warning?

Softer than a bird to my ever mournful song
Its song

Voices in the head can you hear them calling
Echos in the dark, to my ever mournful song

Gravity
