And into the sea
Goes pretty England and me
Around the Bay of Biscay
And back for tea

Hit traffic on the Dogger bank
Up the Thames to find a taxi rank
Sail on by with the tide and go to sleep
And the radio says

This is a low
But it won't hurt you
When you are alone
It will be there with you

Finding ways to stay solo
On the Tyne forth and Cramity
There's a low in the high forties
And Saturday's locked away on the pier
Not fast enough dear

On the Malin head
Blackpool looks blue and red
And the queen, she's gone round the bend
Jumped off land's end
Radio says

This is a low
But it won't hurt you
When you are alone
It will be there with you

Finding ways to stay solo

This is a low
But it won't hurt you
When you are alone
It will be there with you

This is a low
But it won't hurt you
When you are alone
It will be there with you

Finding ways to stay solo
