Oh, Mama, well
Look what's been done
You can only see the stars
After the setting Sun
You
Run for the money
You don't even know about
Wild mountain honey

Come on, Mama
Heal this lonesome land
Grow the tree of holiness
In this desert land
Come on, children now
Learn how to run
By having the stars
The Moon, and the Sun

Come on, Papa
Your end is the means
Don't treat your lovin' goodness
For the golden machine
You
Run for the money
You don't even know about
Wild mountain honey
