You heard that we were great
But now you think we're lame
Since you saw the show last night
You hoped that we would rock
Knock it up a notch
Rockin' was nowhere in sight

And it's never good when it goes bad
No one likes to feel like they've been had
And it may be ok
But you won't wear our t-shirts now anymore

First the band looked wired
Then the band looked tired
Sluggish and a little slow
He's walkin' through the set
As drunk as he could get
And what the hell was wrong with joe?

You could tell the crowd was fading fast
Every song we played looser than the last
And it may be ok
But you won't wear our t-shirts now

All the kids they hold a grudge
Their minds are logged on to the net and
All the kids they hold a grudge
You fail them and they won't forget it
All the kids, they're tired and turn away

They saw what you did
You're all wrong and all the kids are right

You heard that we were great
Now you know we're lame
Since you saw the show last night
You hoped that we would rock
But wished that we'd just stop
And finally we said 'good night'

When we returned for an encore

You and half the room headed for the door
No one wanted more

All the kids they hold a grudge
Their minds are logged on to the net and
All the kids they hold a grudge
You fail them and they won't forget it
All the kids, they're tired and turn away

All the kids they hold a grudge
Their minds are logged on to the net and
All the kids they hold a grudge
You fail them and they won't forget it
All your cred won't save you from the kids

They saw what you did
You're all wrong and all the kids are right
Next!
