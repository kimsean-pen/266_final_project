I had no master plan
I had no grand design
I got little out of hand
I got a little out of line
That ain't me no more
I'm leaving that life behind

I'm yours
Now I really get what love is for
It hit me at the stroke(?) of midnight
You give me a reason
I didn't know I was looking for
I'm yours

Never going back
Not now, I can be the man
I couldn't be therefore

I'm yours
Now I really get what love is for
It hit me at the stroke(?) of midnight
You give me a reason
I didn't know I was looking for
Now I'm yours

Nowhere I was going
When I looked in your eyes
Right when I least expected
You set the room alight
Now I'm yours
I'm yours

You give me a reason
I didn't know I was looking for
I'm yours
Now I really get what love is for
Hit me at the stroke(?) of midnight
You give me a reason
I didn't know I was looking for
Now I'm yours
I'm yours
