I met you at the barricade
It's fever pitch where the crowd has gathered
You said the bow is breaking
You want to get some coffee or something and

Float by the crowd that scatters
I found my people and nothing else matters
Bullhorns and feed back in stormy skies
No one listens but it's so hot when you try

'cause you've got a taste for danger
It turns you on
Just take a look in your face
I know what's going on
(What's going on)
You like the taste of danger

Tiptoe through the riots
Vandals laced and braced for action
No sense, no consequence
You're a green stick fracture
Bounce back at you

You've got a taste for danger
So bring it on
Just take a look in your face
I know what's going on
(What's going on)
You like the taste of danger

Beggars stare at the brand new sneakers on the
Anarchists and celebrity speakers
These are improbable days my friends
Tomorrow's mundane
All good things must end
And the cops told the crowd they must disperse
Your pretty eyes fall as the tear gas burst
Here come the horses and we move along
Promise I'll see you but the moment is gone

You're shocked when the spray can splatters
Deliver us from the chumps and suckers
You and me killing time in the present tense
Bound together by someone to fight against

You got a taste for danger
And now it's gone
Just take a look in your eyes
I know that something's wrong
(What's going on)
You got a taste for danger

I used to be a dissident citizen
I used to be a dissident citizen
I used to be a dissident citizen
You got a taste for danger
And now it's gone

(I used to be a dissident citizen)
You got a taste for danger
And now it's gone
(I used to be a dissident citizen)
You got a taste for danger
So bring it on
What's going on
(I used to be a dissident citizen)
You got a taste for danger
