I sang your praises daily
And we let ourselves get swept away
It's true baby
We held heaven in our hands for days, yeah

You wait a long time for something wild to take you somewhere
And all I needed was to fly
It's a long way from paradise to ordinary
Picture us just smiling there, we didn't have a care

And I remember how it all came true
It was oh, so tender
And I was lost with you
By the sweet Sorrento moon

Stars don't burn that brightly
Every season surely slips away
But you baby
You're the reason why I chose to stay, hey

You wait a long time to find your dream and hold on to it
And all I needed was to fly
It's a long way from innocence to understanding
A picture of a child at play is how I feel today

And I remember how it all came true
La luna de Sorrento, la luna de Sorrento
It was oh, so tender and I was lost with you
La luna de Sorrento
By the sweet Sorrento moon

You were never far away

And I remember how it all came true
La luna de Sorrento, la luna de Sorrento
It was oh, so tender and I was lost with you
La luna de Sorrento
By the sweet Sorrento moon

And I remember how it all came true
La luna de Sorrento, la luna de Sorrento
It was oh, so tender and I was lost with you
La luna de Sorrento
By the sweet Sorrento moon

I remember, la luna de Sorrento
Sweet Sorrento moon
I remember, la luna de Sorrento
Sorrento moon
I remember, la luna de Sorrento
I remember you

I remember, la luna de Sorrento
Sorrento moon
I remember, la luna de Sorrento
Hey I remember you
I remember, la luna de Sorrento
Oh Sorrento moon
