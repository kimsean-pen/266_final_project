When I tell you I'm a little bit afraid
You tell me I should act my age
Well I guess I am
I guess I am

You say I mean the world to you
But you can't really see this through
Well I guess I can
I guess I can

I can
I can
I can
I can

Do I amuse you?
Do I confuse you?
Do I amuse you?
Do I confuse you?
Do I amuse you?
Do I confuse you?
Do I amuse you?
Do I confuse you?
