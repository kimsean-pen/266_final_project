Ethnic cleansing with no defending
These acts of genocide
A fatal ending with no surrendering
To cover up the crimes and lie

Smart bombs, precision guided armament
A more sophisticated way to end up dead
Still we search and invent such intelligent weapons
That kill each other like the Gears of War

Gears of War
Gears of War, hoorah

Gears of War
Gears of War

When you ride with thieves
Then you die with thieves
Cross my heart and hope that you die
When the smoke has cleared
The Devil's in the mirror
And you see his warheads paint the sky, now you die

Smart bombs, precision guided armament
A more sophisticated way to end up dead
Still we search and invent such intelligent weapons
That kill each other like the Gears of War
