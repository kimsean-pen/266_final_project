Tough girl in the fast lane
No time for love
No time for hate
No drama
No time for games
Tough girl whose soul
Act like poem, on my own, took my phone
Nothing more, I build thee
You order in pay TV
It's agony

I may cry ruining my make up
Wash away all the things you've taken
And I don't care if I don't look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girl cry when their heart is breaking

Tough girl
I'm in pain
Don't let the dark
Block out, and air pains
I still pour you a glass of champagne
Tough girl Whose so Act like poem, on my own, took my phone
Nothing more, I build thee
You order in pay TV
It's agony

I may cry ruining my make up
wash away all the things you've taken
And I don't care if I don't look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking

I wake up I wake up I wake up I wake up
I wake up I wake up I wake up I wake up
I wake up I wake up I wake up I wake up
I wake up I wake up I wake up I wake up

I may cry ruining my make up
Wash away all the things you've taken
And I don't care if I don't look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girl cry when their heart is breaking
