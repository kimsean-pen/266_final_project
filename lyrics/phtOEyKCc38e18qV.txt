Reaction!

You're acting like
You don't sympathize
With anything at all
Or anyone
For any reason
You're desperate to fill the space

And that makes me a weight,
Pulling you away.
I just made a decision.
This condition is only what you made.
It's calling out your name.
I just want a reaction,
Reaction,
Reaction from you.
Reaction from you.

Negatives and positives will drift,
Contained on whispered avenues so run,
Get out while you can. break a lot of glass.
Leave the place in shambles.

Be careful of what you leave behind.
Be careful of what you leave behind.

You will walk across companies of friends
And accumulate all the pieces that you lost.
You have to know, I sympathize with you.

And that makes me a weight,
Pulling you away.
I just made a decision.
This condition is only what you made.
It's calling out your name.
I just want a reaction,
Reaction
Reaction from you.

Breathing down your neck
I just made a decision.
This condition is only what you made.
It's calling out your name.
I just want a reaction,
Reaction,
Reaction from you.

Reaction from you.
