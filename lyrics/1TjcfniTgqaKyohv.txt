Just one of those things when everything goes incredible
And all is beautiful
Ca-ca-can't get my head around it, I need to think about it
Can't get my head around it, I-I need to think about it

And one of those things that used to get you down now have no effect at all,
'Cause life is beautiful
Ca-ca-can't get my head around it, I need to think about it
Can't get my head around it, I-I need to think about it

Remembering the very first time
You caught that someone's specials eye
And all of your care dropped
And all of the world just stopped (I hope)
I want to go back to then,
Got to figure out how, got to remember when
I felt it,
It thrilled me,
I want it
To fill me

Just one of those things when everything goes incredible
And all is beautiful
Ca-ca-can't get my head around it, I need to think about it
Can't get my head around it, I-I need to think about it

And one of those things that used to get you down now have no effect at all,
'Cause life is beautiful
Ca-ca-can't get my head around it, I need to think about it
Can't get my head around it, I-I need to think about it

You don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And everything in life just goes wrong
Feels like nobody's listening
And something is missing (I hope)
I want to go back to then,
Got to figure out how, got to remember when
I felt it,
It thrilled me,
I want it
To fill me

Just one of those things when everything goes incredible
And all is beautiful
Ca-ca-can't get my head around it, I need to think about it
Can't get my head around it, I-I need to think about it

And one of those things that used to get you down now have no effect at all,
'Cause life is beautiful
Ca-ca-can't get my head around it, I need to think about it
Can't get my head around it, I-I need to think about it

I remember when
you were the one,
you were my friend
You gave me life,
you were the sun,
you taught me things
I didn't run
I fell to my knees,
I didn't know why
I started to breathe,
I wanted to cry
I need a reminder,
So I can relate
I need to go back there
before it's too late

It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body grovin'
It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body grovin'

It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body grovin'
It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body grovin'

Just one of those things when everything goes incredible
And all is beautiful
Ca-ca-can't get my head around it, I need to think about it
Can't get my head around it, I-I need to think about it

And one of those things that used to get you down now have no effect at all,
'Cause life is beautiful
Ca-ca-can't get my head around it, I need to think about it
Can't get my head around it, I-I need to think about it
