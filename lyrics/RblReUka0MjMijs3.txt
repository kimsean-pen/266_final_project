I used to know ths girl Marie
And so the story goes, she never really talked to me
Her house was seven blocks away
On my way to school, I went to see if she's okay

Tell me, where have you gone?
Where have you gone, Marie?
Why did you leave?
Come back to me, cherie
I know you went away
You went away, Marie
You could not stay
You could not stay, cherie

Please stay with me, Marie, cherie

Oh no, he did not treat you right
Your innocence is lost
You never had the chance to fly
She looked so pretty like a dream
Her skin's like velvet cream
She never made her sweet sixteen

Nobody came around to see her
It was as if she wasn't there
A lone butterfly that's caught in amber
Always your daddy's little girl

Tell me, where have you gone?
Where have you gone, Marie?
Why did you leave?
Come back to me, cherie
I know you went away
You went away, Marie
You could not stay
You could not stay, cherie

Please stay with me, Marie, cherie
