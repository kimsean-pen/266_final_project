I've tried so many times
To tell you how I feel
But you're far too disbelieving
Are you trying to get even with me
Maybe once or twice
I wasn't fair I wasn't nice
But now I've got myself together
When I promise to be better
You say

(Whoa) I'll believe you when
(Whoa) I'll believe you when
(Whoa) When everything you say don't turn out wrong

(Whoa) I'll believe you when
(Whoa) I'll believe you when
(Whoa) When everything you say don't turn out wrong

I could call you everyday
Give presents by the score
And I could send you pretty flowers
Have them waiting at your door

I could write up in the sky
Forgive me I apologize
Still if I went through every measure
With my promise to be better
You'd say

(Whoa) I'll believe you when
(Whoa) I'll believe you when
(Whoa) When everything you say don't turn out wrong

(Whoa) I'll believe you when
(Whoa) I'll believe you when
(Whoa) When everything you say don't turn out wrong

There's nothing you can say
That I haven't tried
Nothing I can do will ever change your mind
Yeah, maybe I'd do better
If I told somebody else

(Whoa) I'll believe you when
(Whoa) I'll believe you when
(Whoa) When everything you say don't turn out wrong

(Whoa) I'll believe you when
(Whoa) I'll believe you when
(Whoa) When everything you say don't turn out wrong

(Whoa) I'll believe you when
(Whoa) I'll believe you when
(Whoa) I'll believe you when everything you tell isn't wrong

(Whoa) I'll believe you when
(Whoa) I'll believe you when
(Whoa) I'll believe you when everything you say don't turn out wrong
