If I only could I would
Change everything

Today is the day, the moment of reckoning
For too long I've been hiding this truth within my chest
Today is the day when I will come clean
Answer for my deeds and stand up for my faint-heartedness

If I only could I would change everything
Let the suffering be mine and only mine for this time

In your time of need I betrayed you
When I should have watched over you I walked away
Now there are two straying souls weak in faith

In your time of need I left you
When I should have been strong I turned my back on you
Now there are two straying souls about to break

When there now are two of us alone
There's not anymore anyone alone

Today is the day when I will face you at length
You my child have wept enough far too long swallowed your hate
Today is the day when I will promise to myself
Take care from you I've been running away and with for so many years

If I only could I would change everything
Let the suffering be mine and only mine for this time
