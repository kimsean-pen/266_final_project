So the time is right
So tell me if you wanna
You should change it if you're gonna
But I don't really know how
I've already tried
Involve

I don't want to save my soul now
I don't want to lose control
And even if it takes a lifetime to learn
I'll learn

Don't fall in line
If you're thinking that you're gonna
You should maybe think about a
Reason in your own mind
You've already gone
Evolve

I don't want to save my soul now
I just want to lose control
And even if it takes a lifetime to learn
I'll learn
We learn

Hear us, old friends,
Hear our defence,
Hero's time gone by

Here's our dissent,
Hero's defence,
Heroes left you to die
You left me to die
I don't want to save my soul now
I don't want to lose control
And even if it takes our lifetime to learn
I'll learn
We learn
