Ate a couple jiggas with that Glock on my side
Riding, hanging out the window, screaming "Who wanna die?"
Savage lil addict with 100 bad habits
Say "I need prayer," all I need is my ratchet
Pull up, swang with the blade
Then I pray over dead prey
Banging grey till my grave
Milli rock, sa passe
What that mean? I don't know, took about four Xans today
Sipping lean, dying slow, drugs make me feel okay
Jackal from the flames, make a stang of a bitch like you
Fuck the 12, fuck the cops, we ain't forgot about you
Kill mo', kill mo'
Gleesh walk on a sack
Burn a half a mil in cash
Fuck that paper, turn it ash
Walk away and start to laugh
"Ha-ha-ha-ha ha-ha"
No more, I got cash, cash, cash, and cars and broads
Hit that seven figure mark without an A&R
$carecrow walking in the fog
Life got worse than it was before, ho

Prolly cop a script of roxy
(Wait we got what)
Prolly cop a...
(Fuck let's do this shit)
Prolly, prolly cop a, prolly cop a...
Prolly, prolly
Prolly cop a script of roxys, Oddy kinda sloppy
Got me dodging all these bodies, body bag 'em in the lobby
Dropping Adderall in alcohol and then I pop a fucking oxy
I'm a zombie, I'm a motherfucking dead man walking
Speak on Oddy name, it's just another dead man talking
Got these dead men stalking, copy silhouette chalky
Typing out your problems, just another red handed hawking
Cherry flavored dick, Ruby got these chicken heads squawking
Do it how I does it, yeah, fuck the way they say they taught me
Please just fucking off me
Plague is pleading for diseases so y'all get the fuck up off me
Only saying cheese when I ask how much they brought me
Fuck a frame freeze, command delete on these fucking paparazzi offspring
