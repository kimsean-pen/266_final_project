Last night I dreamed I was on the Nile
(shimmy shimmy shimmy shy-yi-meece-e-deece)
Dancin with you Egyptian style
(shimmy shimmy shimmy shy-yi-meece-e-deece)
Way down in Egyptland, the mummys took our hand

(Oh! Uh! Oh! Uh!)
Egyptian Shumba!
(Oh! Uh! Oh! Uh!)
Egyptian Shumba!
(Oh! Uh! Oh! Uh!)
Egyptian Shumba!
(Oh! Uh! Oh! Uh!)
Egyptian Shumba!

I'm gonna make that dream come real
(shimmy shimmy shimmy shy-yi-meece-e-deece)
I'm gonna dance the way I feel
(shimmy shimmy shimmy shy-yi-meece-e-deece)
Way down in Egyptland, the mummys took our hand

(Oh! Uh! Oh! Uh!)
Egyptian Shumba!
(Oh! Uh! Oh! Uh!)
Egyptian Shumba!
(Oh! Uh! Oh! Uh!)
Egyptian Shumba!

I heard the drumbeats in my sleep (oh!)
And my heart started to beat (oh!)
I heard the drumbeats in my sleep (oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I wanna dance! I wanna dance! I wanna dance! I wanna dance!

Dance dance dance dance dance dance dance!

(Oh! Uh! Oh! Uh!)
Egyptian Shumba!
(Oh! Uh! Oh! Uh!)
Egyptian Shumba!
