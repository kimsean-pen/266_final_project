[Jim:] "You're from the valley?"
[Billy:] "No, Jim you schmuck, the Valleys, Wales; Male voice choirs"
[Jim:] "Wales! Now is this sperm or blue-tip?"
[Billy:] "Ha, ha, ha, ha. Very funny Jim."
[Jim:] "Sorry."
[Billy:] "Me and Benny went out."
[Jim:] "Who's Benny?"

Me and Benny went out last night
Looking for fun
Supping ale in the moonlight
Waiting for the dawn to come

Benny pointed at a HiFi shop
He said, "Hey man,
Look at all the stuff they've got."
How'd you make a have out of a have not

Who needs information
When you're working underground?
Just give me confirmation
We could win a million pounds

Benny climbed up on a footbridge
And he teetered on the parapet
He said, "Can you see the whites of their headlights?
Are they coming yet?"

Who needs information
This high off the ground?
Just give me confirmation
We could win a million pounds

Who needs information
When you're living in constant fear?
Just give me confirmation
There's some way out of here

Some way (out of here)
Some way (out of here)
Some way (out of here)
Some way (out of here)
Some way (out of here)
(Some way out)

Benny hefted a breeze block
And tried to let go
Got hung up on a tear drop
So me and Benny went home

Who needs information
When you're living in constant fear?
Just give me confirmation, yeah
There's some way out of here

(Some way) out of here
(Some way) out of here
(Some way) out of here
Some way (out of here)
Some way (out of here)
(Some way out)

Who needs information, yeah
When you're living on borrowed time?
Just give me confirmation
There will be a winner this time

Who needs information
When you're working underground
Just give me confirmation
We could win a million pounds

Who needs

Who needs information
This high off the ground
Just give me confirmation
We could win a million pounds

[Jim:] "Um. (lights a cigarette)
So your brother's in jail?"
