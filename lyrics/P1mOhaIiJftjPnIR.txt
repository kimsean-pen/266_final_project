You love me like a bull in a china shop
Why do I stay if one day you'll break my heart
Ooh its easy, hard as it looks

Ask me how I never get with other guys
Other guys with nicer rides and better style
Ooh easy, hard as it looks

I could be a-doin' all of this on my own
And thinkin' for myself, I'd be the only one
It's easy, hard as it looks

Why'm I waiting up for you late at night
Comin' in from someplace when it's almost light
'Cause its easy, hard as it looks

And I'mma stick it out until it's time to go
Am I getting sick of this? Oh no no
No it's never hard as it looks

Yeah I could be a-doin' all of this on my own
Thinkin' for myself, I'd be the only one
And its easy, hard as it looks.

Yeah I could find someone who'd never make me blue
'Cause nobody could ever tear me up like you
And its easy, hard as it looks

But you could break it
If you let time we're a waiting(?)
So dont mistake it
For something that you're free to play with
