You're so good
You're so bad
That everybody wants to be your man
You're so good
You're so bad
That everybody wants to be in your hair
And under your skin
And in those clothes
And on those lips

But me

Kiss and tell
Everybody else
After all you're at your best
When I'm making baby steps
You make the rules up as you go

So I've gotta some of my own
You make the rules up as you go
So I'm gonna send your love home
What did you expect from me?

I said there's so much more you won't see
What did you expect from me?
I said I'm smarter than him you see
Kiss and tell
Everybody else

After all you're at your best
When I'm making baby steps
And I'm sick and tired of being the good guy
And I've done my time
You should hit the back of the line
I know you don't need to tell me
I know you don't need to tell me
I know you don't need to tell me
I know you don't need to tell me
I know you don't need to tell me

I know you don't need to tell me

I know you don't need to tell me

I know you don't need to tell me
I know you don't need to tell me
I know you don't need to tell me
I know you don't need to tell me
I know you don't need to tell me
I know you don't
I know you don't
Need to tell me
Tell me
I know you don't
I know you don't
Need to tell me
Tell me
Kiss and tell
Everybody else
After all you're at your best
When I'm making baby steps
And I'm sick and tired of being the good guy
And I've done my time
You should hit the back of the line
