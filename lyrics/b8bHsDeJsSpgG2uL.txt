Well of course I miss you baby
I've been thinking lately you don't need me anymore
You'd be better with Fred Astaire
He could take you anywhere
If you ask him to

And God knows
It's a common misconception
That I'm the only one for you
And I could take you out to breakfast
But he can take you round the world
Fred Astaire's the man for you

Well he could buy you a diamond ring
he could get you anything
if you ask him to
He probably knows how to dance
and he could fly you to France
and you could do it all night long

And God knows
It's a common misconception
That I'm the only one for you
And I could take you out to breakfast
But he can take you round the world
Fred Astaire's the man for you

And God knows
It's a common misconception
That I'm the only one for you
And I could take you out to breakfast
But he can take you round the world
Fred Astaire's the man for you
