Boom! Shake the Room
Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince

Chorus

so tell my mother that I never wrote a whack jam
but some times I get n-nervous and start to stutter
and I f-fumble every word for word I utter
so I just try to ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-chill
but it gets worse-a but worse-a but-but-but worse still
I need the c-c-c-crowd to k-k-k-kick into it
they help me calm down and I can get through it
so higher higher
get ya hands to the ceiling
let it go yall don't fight the feeling
mic in a strangle hold sweat pourin'
and like Jordan yo I'm scoring
yeah that's right yall and I am in the flow
so pump up the volume along with the tempo
many have died tryin' to stop my show
I came here tonight to here the crowd go

Chorus
