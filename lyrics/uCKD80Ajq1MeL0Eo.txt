In the brain
In the engine room
The game is a route
I've got fires to put out

In the rain
On the eastbound train
Rushing towards some kind of future

Where you found me
In a lonely wooden tower
Nothing's more real than what it is

And I'm trying to show you

And I never expect
You to deliver me
No, I never wanted
Anything easily
Everything's changing
We will stay for real

And the way that we speak
Is coming out differently
Nothing we wish for
Ever comes easily

Everything is changing
We will stay for real

Don't be vain
Don't swallow the bloom
Keep it plain and devout
As the fires burn out

In my brain
In an unlit lane
Marking the road that leads to nowhere

Where you found me
In a lonely wooden tower
Nothing's more real than what it is
That's what I'm trying to show you

And I never expect
You to deliver me
No, I never wanted
Anything easily

Everything's changing
We will stay for real

And the way that we speak
Is coming out differently
Nothing we wished for
Ever comes easily

Everything's changing
We will stay for real
