Who do you want to be?
Who do you want to be today?
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?

Oh, boredom is so terrible
It's like a dread disease
Nothing could be worse than
When there's nothing on TV

I'd rather be a cowboy
Than to stare blank at the walls
I've been reborn so many times
I can't remember them all, and I say

Who do you want to be today?
Who do you want to be?
Who do you want to be today?
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?
Huh, do ya? Just like somebody on TV

I think I'll be a teddy boy
I think I'll be a hunk
I think I'll be a tough guy
And I think I'll be a punk

I might just be a fashion star
All dressed in frilly rags
Or perhaps I'll cross the other side
And walk around in drag

Who do you want to be today?
Who do you want to be?
Who do you want to be today?
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?
Huh, do ya? Just like somebody on TV

Do you like to be just like a rock
In the middle of the sea?
Would you rather suffer by yourself
In a pool of blissful misery?

Do you feel like a saint in artists' clothes
With a rosary in your hand?
Would you rather be crazy like Van Gogh
Like a stranger in a strange, strange land?

Would you rather push the buttons
And be feared by all humanity?
Or perhaps you'd like to be a bum
Do you wanna be stupid, just like me?

Who do you want to be today?

Who do you want to be today?
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?
Huh, do ya? Just like somebody on TV
