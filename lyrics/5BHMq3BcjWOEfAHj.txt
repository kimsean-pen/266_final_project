(Oh)
Did you like when I put my lips there?
(Oh)
'Cause I like when you're kissin' me everywhere
(Oh)
Do you mind if we go back in (Go back in)

You give me that fever I ain't tryna break
Been a little while but I don't mind the wait
I'm gon' need a ride home now, sooner than late
Must I reiterate? Can we pick up the pace?

And once we lit this towering inferno (Yeah, yeah)
The flame keeps burning higher, hotter we go
(Yeah, yeah)
And the temperature is rising, crack a window
Let's be the opposite of lonely
Come and give me what you owe me, yeah, yeah

(Oh)

Ain't no use in bein' stingy with it
If you think you're gettin' off, forget it
And if you think it ain't all for you, you're wrong
Baby, it's all for you
Addicted to you, come support my habit
Third person, yeah she gotta have it
If you think I'm on call for you, you're right
Baby, I'm onto you

And once we lit this towering inferno (Yeah, yeah)
The flame keeps burning higher, hotter we go (Yeah, yeah)
And the temperature is rising, crack a window
Let's be the opposite of lonely (Na-na-na-na-na)
Come and give me what you owe me, yeah, yeah

Do you mind if we go back in (Go back in)
