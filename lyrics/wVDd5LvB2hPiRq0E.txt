I'm just a prisoner of your love
You got me lip locked, fire the gun, oh-oh-oh
If I escaped you I would be lost
So don't bail me out babe I'll pay the cost, oh-oh-oh

Aw see it ain't that sunny
Spent my money
Sweet as a felony
Ain't you hunny
I can hear the gripes
But I'm wearing stripes
Look up at the stars
And I gotta think twice

Oh-oh-oh
All of the fighting
Oh-oh-oh
Keeps it exciting

I'm doin' time but I don't mind
I'll be just fine
Sometimes I just hate to love you
I'm doin' time but I don't mind
I'll be just fine
Sometimes I just hate to love you

Oh oh uh oh
Oh oh uh oh
Oh oh uh oh
Oh

I'm doin' time
It's a real fight
But it's alright
Sometimes I just hate to love you

You cuffed me up and treated me cold
I threw the key out a long time ago, oh-oh-oh
If you released me I wouldn't leave, no
So don't feed me poison I gotta eat, oh-oh-oh

Yo, be my cell mate
Plan our escape
Tell me when you're ready
And we can storm the front gate
Through the jail keeper
Real deep sleeper
No big deal just misdemeanor

Oh-oh-oh
All of the fighting
Oh-oh-oh
Keeps it exciting

I'm doin' time but I don't mind
I'll be just fine
Sometimes I just hate to love you
I'm doin' time but I don't mind
I'll be just fine
Sometimes I just hate to love you

Oh oh uh oh
Oh oh uh oh
Oh oh uh oh
Oh

I'm doin' time
It's a real fight
But it's alright
Sometimes I just hate to love you

See I don't need the bars to lock me in
You can let your guard down 'til the end
Forever doesn't happen overnight
And that's why

I'm doin' time but I don't mind
I'll be just fine
I'm doin' time but I don't mind
I'll be just fine
Sometimes I just hate to love you

I'm doin' time but I don't mind
I'll be just fine
Sometimes I just hate to love you
I'm doin' time but I don't mind
I'll be just fine
Sometimes I just hate to love you

Oh oh uh oh
Oh oh uh oh
Oh oh uh oh
Oh

I'm doin' time
It's a real fight
But it's alright
Sometimes I just hate to love you
