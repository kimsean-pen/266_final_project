Well I had a dream last night
And in my dream I took a knife to you
I slit your throat from ear to ear
The wound was gasping for the air
Your scream so clear

But every dream could never come true
Only in my sick mind can I do these things to you

With every passing moment
It just keeps getting worse
The walls are getting smaller
And I am six feet beneath the earth
And I will be, oh I will be, just lost

I had a dream last night
And in my dream I robbed a country club
A 5 year old tried to stop me
But I shot him through the head
And now he's dead

But every dream could never come true
Only in my sick mind can I do these things to you

With every passing moment
It just keeps getting worse
The walls are getting smaller
And I am six feet beneath the earth
And I will be, oh I will be, just lost

With every passing moment
It just keeps getting worse
The walls are getting smaller
And I am six feet beneath the earth
And I will be, oh I will be, just lost

Your heart
Your heart
Your heart
Your heart

Oh it's better to rush upon this blade
Then give into the fear in your heart

(Your heart)
These dreams never cease
(Your heart)
These dreams never cease
(Your heart)
These dreams never cease
Your heart

With every passing moment
It just keeps getting worse
The walls are getting smaller
And I am six feet beneath the earth
And I will be, oh I will be, just lost

With every passing moment
It just keeps getting worse
The walls are getting smaller
And I am six feet beneath the earth
And I will be, oh I will be, just lost

With every passing moment
It just keeps getting worse
The walls are getting smaller
And I am six feet beneath the earth
And I will be, oh I will be, just lost
Just lost
