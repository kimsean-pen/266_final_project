Feel your lovin' for the first time,
Lovin' for the first time,
Lovin' for the first time, baby.
Feel your glowin' for the first time.

I try to make your body understand,
Move my hands like the analog.
Make you forget 'bout any other man,
Tell you stories with my body love.

Livin' life on the peak,
But I make this a dream,
And I make you believe in something so high.
Will you do the same for me?

I feel your glowin' for the first time,
I know it ain't the first time,
I hope it ain't the last time, baby.
Feel your glowin' for the first time,
I know it ain't the first time,
I hope it ain't the last time, baby.

I feel your glowin' for the first time,
I know it ain't the first time,
I hope it ain't the last time, baby.
Feel your glowin' for the first time,
I know it ain't the first time,
I hope it ain't the last time, baby.

You, you, you can be the body high.
You, you, you need the body high.
You you you.
Give me that body high, oh oh.

Livin' life on the peak,
But I make this a dream,
Lemme make you believe in something so high.
Will you do the same for me?

I feel your glowin' for the first time,
I know it ain't the first time,
I hope it ain't the last time, baby.
Feel your glowin' for the first time,
I know it ain't the first time,
I hope it ain't the last time, baby.

I feel your glowin' for the first time,
I know it ain't the first time,
I hope it ain't the last time, baby.
Feel your glowin' for the first time,
I know it ain't the first time,
I hope it ain't the last time, baby.

Ha-ha-ha,
Give me that body high.
Ha-ha-ha,
Give me that body high.
Ha-ha-ha,
Give me that body high.
