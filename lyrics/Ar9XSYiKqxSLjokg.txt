I'm gonna hold on
'Cause what I believe in is so strong
No matter how long, no one
Can tell me I'm wrong, I ain't goin' down

I had a baby at fifteen
Daddy never did forgive me
I never heard from the guy again
I had to drop outta high school
Everybody treated me so cruel
But I didn't give in and give her away

I'm gonna hold on

'Cause what I believe in is so strong
No matter how long, no one
Can tell me I'm wrong,I ain't goin' down
Her smile got me through the day
And every night I'd pray
I could give her enough

At night I'd lie awake and cry
Hopin' we'd get by
'Cause you can't live on love
I worked night and day to keep us goin'
Through the sweat and tears
Without her knowin'
It was worth it just to watch her grow

Oh, oh, at least I was able to hold her

Whenever she needed my shoulder
I'm so glad I never let her go
I'm gonna hold on
'Cause what I believe in is so strong
No matter how long, no one
Can tell me I'm wrong, I ain't goin' down
Her smile got me through the years

Dried away the tears

And filled me with hope
At night I'd lie awake and cry
Prayed we would get by

And for the courage to cope

Oh, oh, oh

Her smile got me through the day
And every night I'd pray
I could give her enough
I'm gonna hold on
'Cause what I believe in is so strong
No matter how long, no one
Can tell me I'm wrong, I ain't goin' down

I'm gonna hold on
'Cause what I believe in is so strong
No matter how long, no one
Can tell me I'm wrong, I ain't goin' down
No one
Can tell me I'm wrong, I ain't goin' down
