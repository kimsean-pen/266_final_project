We are blind to the
worlds within us
waiting to be born

I cast aside my chains
Fall from reality
Purgatory unleashed
Now burn the face of the earth
Purgatory unleashed
Now burn the face of the earth

The face of all your fears
All your fears unleashed
The face of all your fears

Born of the demon sky
Twisting reality
Sweet nauseating pain
Is death the only release?
Nauseating pain
Is death the only release?

The face of all your fears
All your fears unleashed
The face of all your fears
The face of all your fears

I cast aside my chains
Fall from reality
Suicidal diseases
The face of all your fears
Now covered with scars
Humanity exiled
Purgatory unleashed
Now burn the face of the earth
Purgatory unleashed
Now burn the face of the earth
The face of all your fears
All your fears unleashed
The face of all your fears
