Dumb surfer is giving me his cash
Won a bet for fifty and now I need a slash
Man this band that's playing
Is playing fucking trash
Skunk and onion gravy
As my brain's potato mash

He came across the back of a bureaucratic stash
Shot the lot for credit and never got it back
He's mashed, I'm mashed,
We're mashed
That cat got slashed in half like that
As venus completes orbit
I'm feeling slightly mashed

The stir fry didn't absorb it, I need another slash
She spoke in English, it was low lit where we sat
Remembering her face
But that's the end of that
I'm a step from madness as I puke on pavement slabs
Got a bit embarrassed, need to get back to the lab

In the depths of traffic
I was feeling like we crashed
With a girl from Slovak in a European cab
From a set of habits
I can see momentums mashed
If we were commuting
This train would fucking crash

Now my brain's diluting with blame
And guilt and hash
Getting lashed
Getting lashed by all of the gods
By all of the gods
By all of the gods

As my brain's diluting, I suffer from whiplash

This girl's now screaming
I think we've gone and crashed
The driver's speaking and the car is still intact
It was only minor
Well that's the end of that
Girl, that's the end of that as I know
Girl, some things you don't know

Dumb surfer, don't suffer
Dumb surfer, don't suffer
Dumb surfer, don't suffer
Dumb surfer, don't suffer

Ay, some things won't change for a while
Keep me, keep me as the villain
But my prayer, you don't own
He's giving me his cash
