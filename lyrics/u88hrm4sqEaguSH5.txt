I'm so hard for a rich girl
My heels are high, my eyes cast low
And I don't know how to love
I get too tired after midday, lately

I take it out on my good friends
But the worst stays in
Oh, where would I begin

My office glows, all night long
It's a nuclear show and the stars are gone
Elevator, elevator, take me home

I'm so hard for the rich girl
Her heels so high and my hopes so low
'Cause I don't know how to love

I'll take her home after midnight
And if she likes I'll tell her lies
How we'll be in love by the morning
I don't think she'll know that I'm saying goodbye

My office glows, all night long
It's a nuclear show and the stars are gone
Elevator, elevator, take me home

My office glows, all night long
It's a nuclear show and the stars are gone
Elevator, elevator, take me home

Don't go, say you'll stay
Spend a lazy Sunday
In my arms, I won't take
Anything away

Don't go, say you'll stay
Spend a lazy Sunday
In my arms, don't take
Anything away

Hey-ay,
Hey-ay,
Hey-ay,
Hey-ay,
Hey-ay.
