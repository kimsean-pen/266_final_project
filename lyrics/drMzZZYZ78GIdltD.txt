You, who like the moon at night
Haunted my mortal heart...
You who made these ancient walls
Shine like divine marble
The unwanted breath - through creedence
A derelict shell in the desert
- Mesmerized -
As love inflamed the night
Burning tongues brought the rain
The sand remained - purified
Murmur at the meager's spear
Battered Cartagian pride
The beloved cry - wasted dismay
Invasion of baseness and shade
You, loved by your father
Innocent as a vestal - dove
Buried in a deep blue sea
As we all lose - ever
