I haven't slept a while now
Tired of always feeling down
Thinking of nothing but your face
Close my eyes to sleep

Breath in and breathin out
Find a reason to reach out
Watch a film it's not the same
Close my eyes to sleep

I can't sleep without you

Up all Alone it seems tonight
Strange it such a cruel sight
You voice is all I want to hear
Close my eyes to Sleep
I've got to shut you out tonight
I've got to leave it all behind
Someone take this night away
Close my eyes to sleep

I can't Sleep without you

Don't know if I can sleep without you
