When I was growing up not long ago though it seems like it's so far away
We played under the sun we didn't plug ourselves in were made to pray at the end of the day
Now everything changing these people aren't real and our children are dying
Cuz they're hard and don't feel and its lie and its cheat and its steal and its kill
And its mothers go bury your sons

All I smell is smoke when I step outside
And the mountains keep crying cuz were burning alive
And the people fight the people like they forgot we were equal

Remember when cowboys were cowboys and only children played pretend
Remember when a man was a man not a product or a title or a brand
Now everything's changing these people aren't real and we have no heroes
They're pink in the middle
They don't say what they mean they don't do what they say they won't stand here and die for it

All I smell is smoke when I step outside
And the mountains keep crying cuz were burning alive
And the people fight the people like they forgot we were equal
And the shadows from the buildings just kill the trees
And the only thing we're good at is spreading disease
And the people kill the people like they forgot we were equal

Remember when we hadn't a worry and things just moved slower now
We weren't in such a hurry
And we weren't dying so we didn't have to bury our brothers and sisters in the dirt
Now everything changing these people aren't real
And our children are dying cuz they're hard and can't feel
And its lie and its cheat and its steal and its kill
And its I die if I don't shoot first...

And you can't kill something that doesn't care if it lives
And I'm sinking with my city like a captain and ship
And the people kill the people like they forgot we were equal
