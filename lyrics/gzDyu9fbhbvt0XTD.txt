Shadows grow so long before my eyes
And they're moving across the page
Suddenly the day turns into night
Far away from the city
But don't hesitate
'Cuz your love won't wait
Ooh baby, I love your way, everyday

I wanna tell you I love your way, everyday
I wanna be with you night and day, yeeeaahh
Moon appears to shine and light the sky

With the help of some fire flies
Wonder how they have the power to shine, shine, shine
I can see them under the pine
But don't hesitate
'Cuz your love won't wait, yeeeaahh
Ooh baby, I love your way, everyday
I wanna tell you I love your way
I wanna be with you night and day
Oooh yeah

But don't hesitate
'Cuz your love won't wait
I can see the sunset in your eyes

Brown and gray and blue besides
Clouds are stalking islands in the sun

Wish I could buy one out of season
But don't hesitate
'Cuz your love won't wait yeahhh
Ooh baby, I love your way, everyday
I wanna tell you I love your way oooh
I wanna be with you night and day
Ooh baby, I love your way everyday
I wanna tell you I love your way ooooh
I wanna be with you night and day, yeah
