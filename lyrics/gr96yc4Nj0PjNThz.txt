I did not become someone different
That I did not want to be
But I'm new here
Will you show me around

No matter how far wrong you've gone
You can always turn around
Met a woman in a bar
Told her I was hard to get to know
And near impossible to forget
She said i had an ego on me
The size of Texas

Well I'm new here and I forget
Does that mean big or small

No matter how far wrong you've gone You can always tournaround

And I'm shedding plates like a snake
And it may be crazy but I'm
the closest thing I have
To a voice of reason

Turnaround turnaround turnaround
And you may come full circle
and be new here again
