Yeah
Da-da-da one time, uh-huh
Woah, yeah listen

And lately I've been a mess
I really think that I'm depressed
You try to tell me not to worry
When you knowing I be stressed
I looked on the bright side
Just to see you love me less
When I was down and had nobody
You was the only one I'd text, I know
It's hard living life on your own
I'm on the road and I just gotta go
I'm really stuck in my zone
Working hard, barely keeping control
Through this life, see it's highs and it's lows
You didn't want me to grow

Everybody act like something I owe
That's why I'm gone and I don't want you to know
My location, I be chilling by myself
I be stuck all alone
Tryna figure out where I went wrong
But I ain't do nothin' wrong
I put my feelings and my pain in these songs
When I die, I hope they all sing along
I ain't do it for the fame
I just did it 'cause I had to be strong
Nobody was helping me or my mom
I had to blow like a bomb
I ain't really wanna go get a job
I had a plan that I could beat all the odds
I wasn't playin' my part
Too many people tried to fuck with my heart
That's why the rose still came up through the dark
You call me crazy, I'm smart
Bet some time I'm still up on the charts
How my music motivation
I look back at the start
How the whole situation really got me this far
Are we gon' shine forever?
Will we go out stars?
That's the greatest, in the latest
This a drop top foreign, yeah a Mercedes
She said that she like my eyes, wanna have my baby
But shorty I can't have ties with you, my lady
I'm seein' things different,
The vision gettin' clearer
I'm tired of havin' battles with the man in the mirror
I'm prayin' every night,
Tryna stay in good spirit
I'm only being me, I'm not tryna be different
Set a good example for the world and the children
They didn't let us in
Now we running the whole building
Haters see me win
Now they mad and in their feelings
Age of 19 when I touched my first million
I can't explain to you how it feels
And they talk down on me and all my skills
They gon' throw shade on you when you real
Well, I mean

And lately I've been a mess
I really think that I'm depressed
You try to tell me not to worry
When you knowing I be stressed
I looked on the bright side
Just to see you love me less
When I was down and had nobody
You was the only one I'd text, I know
It's hard living life on your own
I'm on the road and I just gotta go
I'm really stuck in my zone
Working hard, barely keeping control
Through this life, see it's highs and it's lows
You didn't want me to grow

So I just let you go
Damn
You didn't want me to grow, no
