I was so young, I was so dumb when I gave you my heart
Think you're so mean, think you're so clean in your old classic car
But honestly looks can be deceiving you look good from afar
But when you're up close you're a loser and you lowered the bar

Ooooh, finally got back everything I gave to you
Every part of me that I left in your room
Now I really don't care what you do, or you who you do it with
I really don't care. I think I just quit

I was bad now I'm better
I was sad now I'm better
Looking back I knew you were no good (no good)
I'm by myself and that's better
For my health you know know you put me hell
But whatever, I'm good (I'm good)

I'm good, I'm good
I'm good, I'm good

You fooled me once and you fooled me twice,
Don't try me again
You're coming around, tryna wear me down
But I won't be your friend
And I don't wanna say it out loud but I still miss you now and then
I'll cover my tracks and I'll never go back 'cause you're a dead-end

Ooooh, finally got back everything I gave to you
Every part of me that I left in your room
Now I really don't care what you do, or you who you do it with
I really don't care. I think I just quit

I was bad now I'm better
I was sad now I'm better
Looking back I knew you were no good (no good)
I'm by myself and that's better
For my health you know know you put me hell
But whatever, I'm good (I'm Good)

I'm good, I'm good
(Oh baby I'm good, oh baby I'm good, without you I'm good)
I'm good, I'm good
(Oh baby I'm good, oh baby I'm good, without you I'm good)

I'm good, I'm good
(Oh baby I'm good, oh baby I'm good, without you I'm good)
I'm good, I'm good
(Oh baby I'm good, oh baby I'm good, without you I'm good)

I'm doing better without you
I'm good
I'm doing better without you
I'm good
This song ain't even about you
I'm good
'Cause I'm doing better without you
I'm good

I was bad now I'm better
I was sad now I'm better
Looking back I knew you were no good (no good)
I'm by myself and that's better
For my health you know know you put me hell
But whatever, I'm good (I'm Good)

I'm good, I'm good
(Oh baby I'm good, oh baby I'm good, without you I'm good)
I'm good, I'm good
(Oh baby I'm good, oh baby I'm good, without you I'm good)

I'm good, I'm good
(Oh baby I'm good, oh baby I'm good, without you I'm good)
I'm good, I'm good
(Oh baby I'm good, oh baby I'm good, without you I'm good)

Oh baby I'm good, oh baby I'm good, without you I'm good
