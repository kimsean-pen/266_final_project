I don't think you'll ever get it,
There's no way to teach you how we're s'posed to feel,
If I had the words I'd say it,
A thousand times together,
That won't make it real,

Cause if you needed me,
The way I needed you,
Then you could know this pain,
Like I do,

I wish we could trade hearts,
Cause baby so far,
It's lonely when I'm the only one who's been suffering this hard,
I wish we could trade hearts,
Mine's falling apart,
And you'd feel the way I felt without you,
Let me in,
It was these scars,
Trade hearts,
Trade, trade hearts,
I wish we could trade hearts,
Trade, trade hearts,

Cause if we did then I could move on,
When I wish you had forget us,
Just like you,
Cause I've got this all that's running through my chest,
Yeah,
And yours has barely got a scratch on it,

I wish we could trade hearts,
Cause baby so far,
It's lonely when I'm the only one who's been suffering this hard,
I wish we could trade hearts,
Mine's falling apart,
And you'd feel the way I felt without you,
Let me in,
It was these scars,
Trade hearts,
Trade, trade hearts,
I wish we could trade hearts,
Trade, trade hearts,

Cause if you needed me,
The way I needed you,
Then you could know this pain,
Like I do,

I wish we could trade hearts,
Cause baby so far,
It's lonely when I'm the only one who's been suffering this hard,
I wish we could trade hearts,
Mine's falling apart,
And you'd feel the way I felt without you,
Let me in,
It was these scars,
Trade hearts,
Trade, trade hearts,
I wish we could trade hearts,
Trade, trade hearts,

Cause if you needed me,
The way I needed you,
Then you could know this pain,
Like I do,

I wish we could trade hearts,
The way I felt without you,
Let me in,
It was these scars,
Trade hearts.
