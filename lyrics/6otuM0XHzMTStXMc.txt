I built a house for your bones
I built a house, I built a home
I built a house for your bones
I built a house, I built a home

I wrote a song, go on and listen
That's all you'll hear when I go missing
I wrote a song, go on and listen
That's all you'll hear when I go missing

Always get
Always get the things I want

I make a nest for your hair
I lay you down, I lay you there
I built a ship, I sink or sail
Every tooth and every nail

Always get the things I want
Always get the things I want
Always get the things I want
Always get the things I want

I put your heart in a vault
That's how I get the things I want
I put your heart in a vault
That's how I get the things I want

I lay a road for your mind
So your mind can go, go, go, go
I lay a road for your mind
So your mind can go, go, go, go

Always get the things I want
Always get the things I want
Always get the things I want
Always get the things I want

I built a house, I built a home
I built a house for your bones
I built a house for your bones
I built a house, I built a home
