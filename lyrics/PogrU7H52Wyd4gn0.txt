Look all around, can't you open your eyes?
Voices are calling.
Killing rain falling down from the sky,
Crying with nightmare tears.

Out on the street you'll see blood on the ground,
Cities are burning.
Feeling the pain cutting right to your soul.
Goodbye now – caught in his spell.

Your freedom is gone,
He's taken everything you ever had,
But if you're strong you'll survive.
You got to hold on, open your eyes!

Behind the lies you will see
The master of insanity.
Under the mask there will be
The master of insanity, yeah.

Innocent minds, they're the victims of shame,
Staring in sorrow.
Promises lying there broken and crushed.
Confusion – just disappear.

What can you give to be left all alone
When there's nothing at all?

Your freedom is gone,
He's taken everything you ever had,
But if you're strong you'll survive.
You got to hold on, open your eyes!

Behind the lies you will see
The master of insanity.
Under the mask there will be
The master of insanity.

Behind the lies you will find
He's trying to get inside you.
Just open your eyes, and you will see
The master of insanity.

Behind the lies you will see
The master of insanity.
Under the mask there will be
The master of insanity.

Between the lies you will find
That he's trying to get inside you.
Out of the night, into your mind.
Oh, he's always right beside you.

Yeah, between the lies you will see
The master of insanity.
Open your eyes, or you will be
The master of insanity
