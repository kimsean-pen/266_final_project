Check out the deal, Mr. statesman
Nobody up in arms, no, we ain't shaken
Go call the cops (go) call the paper
You know you better run, no tellin' our behavior
Check how they pillage on the tele
Nobody love the poor, I want to yell it
I'm in the beast, in the belly, oh
You better run, 'cuz I'm about to kill (get) it
So give me that bow, give me that stone, give me that rake
I'm gonna take, I'm gonna take my place
So give me that bow, give me that stone, give me that rake
I'm gonna take, I'm gonna take my place
I'm sorry
I'm crashing your party
I'm sorry
I'm crashing your party

Here come the Joes in formation
Somehow they got them living in sedation
They quit waiting on a savior
Don't dream of nothing big, just dream of a vacation
Here come the momma with her babies
(If) you look right in her eyes, know she courageous

Call in the hazmat, it's contagious, oh
She can see right through you, the future's hers, she'll take it
So give me that bow, give me that stone, give me that rake
I'm gonna take, I'm gonna take my place
So give me that bow, give me that stone, give me that rake
I'm gonna take, I'm gonna take my place
I'm sorry
I'm crashing your party
I'm sorry
I'm crashing your party
