Radio cranked, traffic jams
That stupid song again
Meditation isn't enough
To get me through it
lt's the same old story everyday
Twitter feeds a play by play
Stalk you on your tinder page
My ex is an asshole
He thinks that l don't know
Tryin' not to let it show
Trapped at the workplace
Put on a happy face
Day after day after day after
l just wanna run naked in the rain
l just wanna break through the window pane
Strip myself of everything
Learn how to live again
Start right now
l just wanna run naked in the rain
Friday night alone again
A crowded room with all my friends
They don't know just who l am
Reality is on the screen
All you ever hope to be
But nothing in this world's free
My life is a prison cell
Bought from the lies you sell
Who do l call for help?
Don't want another shrink
Tellin' me what to think
Your pills are just like another drink
l just wanna run naked in the rain
l just wanna break through the window pane
Strip myself of everyhing
Learn how to live again
Start right now
l just wanna run naked in the rain
Eyes open wide l'm alive
Flying free l'm weightless
Feel the rain on my skin
Finally l'm awakening
l'm awakening
l just wanna run naked in the rain
l just wanna break through the window pane
Strip myself of everything
Learn how to live again
Start right now
l just wanna run naked in the rain
