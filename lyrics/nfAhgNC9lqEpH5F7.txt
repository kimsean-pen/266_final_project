Go Ahead, you know you want it
You'll have no other way
You just want to take us down
Go ahead, I'll be the one hit
If I can take you, boy, it just might throw this town
Oh, you want to get it

You make us bleed, it'll prove there's life somewhere
And oh, no, I want to yell it
But do we speak or are we just nodding our heads
No way, not me, what you got

It's not for me, but you'll find a way
No way not me, what you got
It's not for me
Don't reach too far
You will fall over

Don't be surprised what you discover

Don't fear your call
Can't pull us under
You better watch out, run for cover
Don't reach too far
You will fall over
Don't be surprised what you discover

Don't fear your call
Can't pull us under
You better watch out, run for cover
(We see right through it

You get what you give, you get what you give)
Go ahead I'll be your junkie
I'll be deplete you can heap all rubbish here
Go ahead, now dump it on me
If I go quiet will the itch go down with me

Oh, you got to get it

Nevermind that it was never there nowhere
But oh, no, not for a minute
For now you'll make your bed
And it will wait, I swear
No way, not me, what you got
It's not for me, but you'll find a way

No way not me, what you got
It's not for me
Don't reach too far
You will fall over
Don't be surprised what you discover
Don't fear your call
Can't pull us under
You better watch out, run for cover
Don't reach too far
You will fall over
Don't be surprised what you discover
Don't fear your call
Can't pull us under
You better watch out, run for cover
(We see right through it
You get what you give, you get what you give)
Tell them that they'll get what they wanted
Tell them
Tell them that they'll get what they wanted
Tell them
Tell them that they'll get what they wanted
Tell them
Tell them that they'll get what they wanted.
'Til then...
