Leaning on the edge this time
Pacing back and forth I find that I can't get it right
Steady on my troubled mind
Bitter tasting words like
Why did I never write home
You think I am so worried and careful
I know you're right, it's true
I'm a weeping willow
And I know places that make the rainy days seem so bright
I've been to all of them a few times
Oh, what I sight
You say the world doesn't really want you to fade
Because it is passing
So hold on to all the little things that you love
Cause I am crashing

Just want to fade
Watch it all drift away
As I make my big escape

Spill my guts to the wall I find
Wasted all my precious time
That I never got right
Leaning on my wounded pride
Not the way I was designed
But I see no lie
I've lost every nerve on you
Plucking each one one at a time
It always eats away at you
Steady on your troubled mind
I'm scared of ever finding out
All I lived for was a lie
All the worries and the doubt
You don't even think straight sometimes
Fading quickly, hear it coming
I thought I saw it pass me by
Love me with an empty heart tonight

Just want to fade
Watch it all drift away
As I make my big escape
Just want to fade
Watch it all drift away
As I make my big escape
