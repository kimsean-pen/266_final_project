ooh, ooh...
somewhere over the rainbow
way up high
there's a land that i dreamed of
Once in a lullaby
high, oh
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue

And the dreams that you dare
To dream, really do come true ooh ooooh
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me ee ee eeh
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops thats where you'll find me oh

Somewhere over the rainbow bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow why, then, oh why can't I?
