Imagine if the life that you though you shared wasn't really there
It was made up in your mind, could be anyone, anywhere
Cause you'd be living in a world of your own design, undermined
In another place, other space and time!

As the dust clears and it all starts to disappear
It may get harder, cause you just restarted!

And wherever you are, land on another star
It may get harder, cause you just restarted!

You better get real, real, realize that the situation is going nowhere!
Because you act so tough, I totally lost control!
So please, try to understand that if I could, I'd call and I would be there
And if I didn't hurt so much, you know I'd give it to you all!
You know I'd give it to you all!

Imagine if the friend that you thought you knew wasn't really true
It just existed in your head, the reflection used wasn't you!

Completely all the way, could be anywhere, anytime
Cause there was a shift in the paradigm!

As the dust clears and it all starts to disappear
It may get harder, cause you just restarted!
And wherever you are, land on another star
It may get harder, cause you just restarted!

You better get real, real, realize that the situation is going nowhere!
Because you act so tough, I totally lost control!
So please, try to understand that if I could, I'd call and I would be there
And if I didn't hurt so much, you know I'd give it to you all!
