One, two

On the field I remember you were incredible
Hey, shut up, hey, shut up, yeah
On the field I remember you were incredible
Hey, shut up, hey, shut up, yeah

On the match with the boys you think you're alone
With the pain that you drained from love
In a car with a girl
Promise me she's not your world

'Cause Andy, you're a star

Get down

Leave your number on the locker and I'll give you a call
Hey, shut up, hey, shut up, yeah
Leave your legacy in gold on the plaques that line the hall
Hey, shut up, hey, shut up, yeah

On the streets such a sweet face jump in town
In the staffroom the verdict is in
In a car with a girl
Promise me she's not your world

'Cause Andy, you're a star
In nobody's eyes but mine
Andy, you're a star
In nobody's eyes but mine
Andy, you're a star
In nobody's eyes
In nobody's eyes but mine
