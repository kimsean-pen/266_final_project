Well my momma met my daddy down in Alabama They tied the knot so here I am.
Born on the bayou on the Texas Line Loved Louisanana and raised on Jabalaya.
Now before I could walk I had a guitar in my hand by the time I could talk I had my own band,
went on the road when I was eight years old when I turned fifteen I was stealing the show.
Money to burn and the girls were pretty it didn't take me long to learn that I was born to boogie.

When I was eighteen I went to Hollywood I met Elvis, Marilyn and Johnny B. Goode,
Got my guitar painted in the California sun a red caddilac having to much fun.
Now we were playing them halls and jammin' then until they moved me on over to M.G.M.
They said this is the boy we've been telling you about, he lit a cigar and stuck his hand out.

He said son have we got a deal for you gonna make you a star give you fifty thousand too.
I told him my Momma didn't raise no fool.
I'll take your money, I'll make you a movie But I can tell ya' right now I am born to boogie.

Well my name is Bocephus I drink whiskey by the gallon and I never back down and I love a good challenge
what I do now is what I did then I like to get down with all my rowdy friends.
Now I can be sweet and I can be mean I still got my hat and I still wear my jeans
My shades are chromo my guitar is steal if you think I won't then believe me I will
Get down on you baby because I ain't no rookie I was put here to party and I was born to boogie
