I like the journal that you keep and in the car when you sing to me
I like that fruit passion tea that you sent me and that list of your hopes and dream and everything
that you wanted to do with me
when I make across the country

I just wanna live between the creases of you skin
Where my anxiety doesn't set in
And I am comfortable again

Tonight, I hope to meet you in my dreams
We can curl up and watch it's always sunny
Mixed between your mattress and sheets

Don't
Forget
About
Me

There is a certain reassurance in your mouth
I never want your heart to feel a single drop of doubt
