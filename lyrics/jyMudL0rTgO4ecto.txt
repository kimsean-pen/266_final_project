Miles of fire
I'm losing ground
And in the flashing
My world comes crashing down
I'm left in nowhere
No place to hide
Out in the open
Like ashes in the sky
I quit the illusion

I'm moving on
I'm moving on

I let the flame light up the future
Make an empire of sorrow
And she will choose to come after
You break the bridges to build the cities

I let the flame light up the future
Make an empire of sorrow
And she will choose to come after
You break the bridges to build the cities

I let the flame light up the future
Make an empire of sorrow
And she will choose to come after
You break the bridges to build the cities
(Drop)

I let the flame light up the future
Make an empire of sorrow
And she will choose to come after
You break the bridges to build the cities
You break the bridges to build the cities
(Drop)
