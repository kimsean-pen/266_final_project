Heartbreak
The living is hard when you're feeling down
Heartache
You're making it worse when you follow me round
Ooh I, ooh ooh ooh I
Remember all the sunny days
Oooh I, ooh ooh ooh I
I'm never gonna be the same
Never gonna be the same

You know your lover when they make you proud
And your heart beats over
This is another time, another place
I can turn your world into...

Cradle in a wonderland
Like a baby wondering how it all began
Holed up in this wonderland
Like that heart shake feeling
From your favourite band

No more
Playing it rough when you're broken in half
Ooh, wake up
The feeling is worse when you're pushing it down
Ooh I, ooh ooh ooh I
I'm fire in a hurricane
Oooh I, ooh ooh ooh I
I'm never gonna be the same
Never gonna be the same

You know your lover when they make you proud
And your heart beats over
This is another time, another place
I can turn your world into...

Cradle in a wonderland
Like a baby wondering how it all began
Holed up in this wonderland
Like that heart shake feeling
From your favourite band

Cradle in a wonderland
Like a baby wondering how it all began
Holed up in this wonderland
Like that heart shake feeling
From your favourite band
