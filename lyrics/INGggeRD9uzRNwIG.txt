I know the veil is thin
And I might find you there
You have 62 moons
And you pull them to you

It's cold but I don't mind
I'm accustomed to ice

The asphalt in between
Crumbling in my hands
Lit by a neon moon
A sorry substitute

It's cold but I don't mind
I'm accustomed to ice

Do you hold a candle
Even briefly in your mind?
What made it all worthwhile?
Do you still hold a candle for me?
Bound by chains to the past
Heavy as we fade to black

Fade to black
Fade to black
Fade to black
Fade to black
