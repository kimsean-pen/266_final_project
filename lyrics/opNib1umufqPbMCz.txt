Change in every little desire
we were counting on forces we could not control
oh and all those things you realized
were nothing more than a memory displaced through
So the story's told beyond our grasp
we were climbing on forever an infinite task
shoulders straining with the endless toil
we're nothing more than a feather moving in the wind
I want to change everything
i want to change everything
i want to blame everything on
Oh and all these seeds will grow anyway
even though the outcome we cannot say
so you'll always have your time to shine
even in the winter of your darkest hour
I want to change everything
i want to change everything
i want to blame everything on
La la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la
In the depths of my gloom
i crawl out for you
from the peaks of my joy
i crawl back into...
Lay me down every time you smile
every shining time you arrive
you arrive
you arrive
Two promiseslong days caught in his room
trapped in the gloom of the dying light
his heart pleads through the wounds that he bleeds
the wounds he never can close
wrong way mind in a haze
never know what he could do
he thinks i gave her my heart she tasted my soul
now she's gone again
he thinks i gave her my heart she tasted my blood
now she's gone again
Long days alone with his shame
fanning the flames of desire
his heart breaks as his memory plays
images of her betrayal
wrong way his mind in a rage
never know what he could do
he thinks i gave her my heart she tasted my soul
now she's gone again
he thinks i gave her my heart she tasted my blood
now she's gone again
Why did you leave me here?
how could you lead me down here?
He can't decide where to go then
two promises one imperfect
walls he's building keep on crumbling down
walls are falling try to keep them sound
Long days he thinks the time will be soon
pacing his room with his dark thoughts
his heart breaks at the road he must take
the road that will lead to the end
wrong way he thinks it's right for release
he'll never know peace in his lifetime
he thinks i gave her my heart she tasted my soul
now she's gone again
he thinks i gave her my heart she tasted my blood
now she's gone again
He can't decide where to go then
two promises are imperfect
walls he's building keep on crumbling down
walls have fallen now there is no sound
