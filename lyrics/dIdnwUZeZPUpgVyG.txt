It tried if ourselves
Don't what nobody else knows
So called, don't play games, don't want much at all
This is sunshine, shakin' their bodies
Make sure they heard that, you say so and got it

Yo los no que
Avec I te a los si se
Avec ti ai a los si se
Avec ti ai a vos no que
A poco te yo los no que
A ver ti te a los si se
A ver ti te a los si se
A ver ti ai a vos no que...
