Early one morning
with time to kill
i borrowed jebb's rifle
and sat on a hill
i saw a lone rider
crossing the plain
i drew a bead on him
to practice my aim
My brother's rifle
went off in my hand
a shot rang out
across the land
the horse, he kept running
the rider was dead
i hung my head
i hung my head
I set off running
to wake from the dream
my brother's rifle
went into the sheen
i kept on running
into the south lands
that's where they found me
my head in my hands
The sheriff he asked me
why had i run
and then it come to me
just what i had done
and all for no reason
just one piece of lead
i hung my head
i hung my head
Here in the court house
the whole town was there
i see the judge
high up in the chair
explain to the court room
what went on in your mind
and we'll ask the jury
what verdict they find
I felt the power
of death and life
i orphaned his children
i widowed his wife
i begged their forgiveness
i wish i was dead
i hung my head
i hung my head
I hung my head
i hung my head
Early one morning
with time to kill
i see the gallows
up on a hill
and out in the distance
a trick of the brain
i see a lone rider
crossing the plain
And he'd come to fetch me
to see what they'd done
and we'd ride together
to kingdom come
i prayed for god's mercy
for soon i'd be dead
i hung my head
i hung my head
I hung my head
i hung my head
