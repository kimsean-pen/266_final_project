I hear the voices coming closer
I hear the voices coming close to me
I hear the voices over water
I hear them whisper, [?] ancient [?]

Even now, we never knew
We're ghosts and I'm [?]
Even now, we never will dawn

I hear the voices coming closer
I hear the voices coming close to me
I hear the voices over water
I hear the whisper of cavalry

Even now, we never knew
We're ghosts and I'm [?]
Even now, we never will dawn
Even now, we never knew
We're ghosts and I'm [?]
Even now, we never will dawn

We moved the earth to harness
That high and darkened mess
And the void did light up in us
We woke like Gods, all-seeing
The tethered cord of your love

I hear the voices coming closer
I hear the voices coming close to me
I hear the voices over water
I hear them whisper, [?] ancient [?]
I hear the voices coming closer
I hear the voices coming close to me
I hear the voices over water
I hear the whisper of cavalry
