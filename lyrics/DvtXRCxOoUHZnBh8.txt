Insignificant is the source of light
In the infinity of the abyss
The entity of chaos continues
In the flesh of new creation

Concentrated cosmic darkness
Comes by catastrophes
From the depths of chaos
Time is indifferent to Hell

Silt of Samael manifests
By His venomous essence
Active satanic resistance
In holocaust of inevitability

Negative radiation
Reflection of evil
Directed against the divine
By darkness to eradicate

For his blood runs in many rivers
Piercing the universe
His wounds belch poison clouds
He is the one who subdued time

In whom the darkness is incarnate
In whose roots evil grows
In whose foundation is the universe
And man has come from His flesh
