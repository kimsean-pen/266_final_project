Over and over, you keep singing the same old song
I used to be strong, the silence is no longer
Now I'm the bitter one
I've made mistakes, and I'll take it all back

I feel, I feel so typical
Just another ghost from so so long ago
Another faint reminder
I still need you, do you need me
Can you see right through me now
Or should I just let go
I'm just another ghost

Again and again, I keep having the same nightmare
I used to be younger, I'm losing the hunger
I'm not having any fun
I've made mistakes and I'll take it all back

I feel, I feel so typical
Just another ghost from so so long ago
Another faint reminder
I still need you, do you need me
Can you see right through me now
Or should I just let go
I'm just another ghost

All of these fractures are killing the passion
Weighed down by anchors of negativity

Just another ghost, just another ghost
I still need you, do you need me
Can you see right through me now
Just another ghost, just another ghost
I still need you, do you need me
Can you see right through me now
I still need you, I still need you, I still need you
Just another ghost

I feel, I feel so typical
Just another ghost from so so long ago
Another faint reminder
I still need you, do you need me
Can you see right through me now
Or should I just let go
I'm just another ghost
