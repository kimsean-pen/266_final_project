23 year ov long journey
among the living dead
on nonsense nourish'd I
my naked soul and where am i?
in the palace ov underworld
without enemy nor friend
pay I for fathers legacy
half-man, half-beast
DEMIGOD

and my hunger was never fed
my desires never fulfilled
but my wish to become
the one with universe
has always entangled me
and forsaken I shall not be
though my flesh is torn apart
though my heart seems dead and cold
my will transgress
the spirit lives on!
