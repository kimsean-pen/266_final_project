Why is everything so grey
Is everything so strange
Is everything so thrown together by mistake?
Why is everything contrite
Is everything a plight
Is everything so insincere and out of sight?
Why does everything seem wrong
Does everything look drawn
Does everything seem blasted like it don't belong?

I, I wanna make it a way
I wanna make it a waste
I wanna make it a gross misadventure
I wanna make you all
I wanna make you all
I wanna make you
Lie to me
Lie to me

When did everything go bad
Did everything fall flat
Did everything decay and lose itself so fast?
When did everything succumb
Did everything go numb
Did everything lobotomize what it's become?
When does everything come back
Does everything relapse
Does everything save face and find itself at last?

I, I wanna show you the way
I wanna show you the waste
I wanna show you the worst misadventure
I wanna show you all
I wanna show you all
I wanna show you how to
Die for me
Die for me

Oh, I, I wanna give it a way
I wanna give it the waste
I wanna give it the worst misadventure
I wanna give it all
I'm gonna give it all
I'll never give up
Lie to me
Die for me

Now, everything's a lie
Everything's your lie
Everything's a face inside another lie
Now, everything's a side
Everything's one side
Everything depends on just which side you're on
