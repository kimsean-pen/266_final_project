Let me breath you in
And break the words in your mouth
Inside your shivering, the silence shouts so loud
I just want to, I just want to stay around
When my heart beats I promise I won't let you down.
If I somewhere else it doesn't mean that I don't see
that you don't trust yourself, that's why you don't trust me

it makes me crazy, when you're crazy you don't speak
you think you know me but what you know is just skin deep...
If you keep building these walls
Brick by brick towers so tall
Soon I won't see you at all
Till the concrete angel falls

I know who you are from the start

But now I don't know who you are
Soon there will be nothing at all
Till the concrete angel falls.

If you keep building these walls
Brick by brick towers so tall
Soon I won't see you at all
Till the concrete angel falls.
