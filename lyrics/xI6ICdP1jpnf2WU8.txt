I'm... close by
I let you in my life
A silly game I stupidly played
I should've known from the start, I was bound to lose
But guess instead I kept running, running back to you
I let you win, now nobody wins

I'm sorry that I let you
I just should've walked away
I'm sorry that I let you
In my life and made you stay
I should've never loved you
You just showed me who you are
If none of this affects you
You're sorrier than me by far
You're so sorry

I... did plead
When you said to me
You wouldn't do it again
Ooh, but you did
And now I see they were right, I was oh so wrong
And now I'm home alone singing sad love songs
I let you win, ooh, stupid again

And I'm sorry that I let you
I just should've walked away
I'm sorry that I let you
In my life and made you stay
I should've never loved you
You weren't who you said you are
If none of this affects you
You're sorrier than me by far
I'm sorry that I let you, oh
I just should've walked away
I'm sorry that I let you
(So sorry, sorry, baby)
In my life and made you stay
How could I ever love you
You showed me who you really are
(You showed me who, you showed me who you are)
If none of this affects you (Uh-oh, uh-oh)
You're sorrier than me by far
You're so sorry
