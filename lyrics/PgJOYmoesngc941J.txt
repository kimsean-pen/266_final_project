I've lived in darkness
Stood in the light
Crawled through the shadows
Between wrong and right

One thing I know for sure
This is a fight I must win

With wings of tin and feet of stone
I crash against the ground below
It's not the first time
Won't be the last time
Got to pick myself up, get on with the show

One thing I know for sure
This is a fight I must win
I can feel the coming storm
There's a demon I have to control
One more fight I must win
Fight the demon dwelling within

I'm not like I was before
I'm something less, I'm something more
This life has been bitter sweet
Blackened heart stays on the beat

One thing I know for sure
This is a fight I must win
I can feel the coming storm
There's a demon I have to control
One more fight I must win
Fight the demon dwelling within

Alone in my cloak of lead
Choking on words of advice
Heard all the answers, most of them lies

I can feel the coming storm
There's a demon I have to control
One last fight I must win
There's a demon dwelling within

This is a fight I must win (win, win)
A fight I must win (win, win)
This is a fight I must win (win, win)
A fight I must win (win, win)
This is a fight I must win (win, win)
A fight I must win (win, win)
This is a fight I must win (win, win)
A fight I must win (win, win)
