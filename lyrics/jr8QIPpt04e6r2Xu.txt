Hands in the air
Nobody needs to get hurt
She is my lady in gold
And we'll go all the way, all the way
Close up the safe

It's time that we disappear
We'll tell your friends we got lost
Let's make our getaway, getaway
Now
Let's make our getaway, getaway
Now
Let's make our getaway, getaway
Hand on my heart
I led a full life of crime
But I would give it all back
For you I'd find a way, find a way
Leaving behind
Tonight we're Bonnie and Clyde
We'll take our chance on the run
Let's make our getaway, getaway
Now
I know a safe house where we can stay
We need to leave before it's too late
Getaway, getaway
Now
Yeah let's go all the way, all the way
Now
Let's make our getaway, getaway
Now
Yeah let's go all the way, all the way
Now
Let's make our getaway, getaway
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's make our getaway, getaway
Getaway, getaway
Getaway, getaway
Now
Getaway, getaway
Let's make our getaway, getaway
