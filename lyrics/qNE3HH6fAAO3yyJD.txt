Oh, you can leave me
On the corner
Where you found me
I'm not for sale anymore
You can leave me
On the corner
Where you found me
I'm not for sale anymore
Oh, you can leave me
On the corner
Where you found me
I'm not for sale anymore
You can leave me
On the corner
Where you found me
I'm not for sale anymore
