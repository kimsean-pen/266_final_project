The troops are quiet tonight,
But it's not alright, because we know they're planning something.
Don't you know things have settled down, down, down
But silence is a dangerous sound,
We must, we must, we must keep our eyes open,
See what we see, what once was promised now will be.
Still uncertain?
Get off that hang, don't wait
The tools, they will be swinging.
The tools, they will be swinging.
We will not be beaten down.
