Recently I've been
Hopelessly reachin
Out for this girl
Who's out of this world
Believe me

She's got a boyfriend
He drives her round the bend
Cause he's 23
He's in the marines
He'd kill me

For so many nights now
I find myself thinkin about her now ohhh

Cause obviously she's out of my league
But how can I win
She keeps draggin me in
And I know I
Never will be good enough for her
No no
I never will be good enough for her

Gotta escape now
Get on a plane now
Yeah
Off to LA
And that's where i'll stay
For two years

Put her behind me
(Put her behind me)
And go to a place where she can't find me ohhh

Cause obviously she's out of my league
I'm wastin my time
Cause she'll never be mine
And I know I
never will be good enough for her
No no
I never will be good enough for her

She's out of my hands
And I never know where I stand
Cause I'm not good enough for her
Good enough for her x6

Cause obviously she's out of my league
I'm wastin my time
Cause she'll never be mine
And I know I
never will be good enough for her

Cause obviously she's out of my league
But how can I win
She keeps draggin me in
And I know I
never will be good enough for her

Cause obviously she's out of my league
I'm wastin my time
Cause she'll ne-ver be mine
And I know I
never will be good enough for her
No no
I never will be good enough for her
