Oh, bring back the storm
While I perform - love me better
I wanna get in the swarm
Bring back the storm
My blood's so warm - for the better
I wanna get in the storm

All along
The way back home
Here my song
And keep me on
Ohh, we both know
The miles we go
Who comes first
I need your thirst

No matter where you from
And I don't wanna know
Take on so
I love this dorm
And every night we want
A little bit or more
Take on so
I love this dorm

Oh, bring back the storm
While I perform - love me better
I wanna get in the swarm
Bring back the storm
My blood's so warm - for the better
I wanna get in the storm

Bring back the storm
While I perform - love me better
I wanna get in the swarm
Bring back the storm
My blood's so warm - for the better
I wanna get in ...

Dare to be mine
And cross the line
Cause you'll be fine
For a while
Don't get on time
I take high
Get piece of mind
And turn my sid–µ

No matter where you from
And I don't wanna know
Take on so
I love this dorm
And every night we want
A little bit or more
Take on so
I love this dorm

Oh, bring back the storm
While I perform - love me better
I wanna get in the swarm
Bring back the storm
My blood's so warm - for the better
I wanna get in the storm

Bring back the storm
While I perform - love me better
I wanna get in the swarm
Bring back the storm
My blood's so warm - for the better
I wanna get in the storm

I wanna get in the storm

I wanna get in the storm

I wanna get in the storm

I wanna get in the storm

Bring back the storm
While I perform - love me better
I wanna get in the swarm
Bring back the storm
My blood's so warm - for the better
I wanna get in the storm

Bring back the storm

Oh, Bring back the storm
While I perform - love me better
I wanna get in the swarm
Bring back the storm
