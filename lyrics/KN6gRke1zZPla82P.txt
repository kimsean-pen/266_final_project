Every little thing that I felt that day
Never will forget there was love in the air
I wasn't lookin' for love to come my way
Oh, baby, baby, but then I saw you there

The summer day that I recall
You came into my life
And you gave me hope and love
I just wanna be what you want me to

The summer day that changed it all
You came into my life
And you let me fall in love
My baby, I just wanna be with you

I just wanna let it shine
I just wanna let it shine
I just wanna let it shine
For you

Did you ever think you knew everything?
Did you ever think you had it all figured out?
Oh, baby, baby, you know things can change
When someone loves you with no doubt

The summer day that I recall
You came into my life
And you gave me hope and love
I just wanna be what you want me to

The summer day that changed it all
You came into my life
And you let me fall in love
My baby, I just wanna be with you

Can you hear me, baby, yeah
When I sing out for you?
I knew we could make it
The moment you came into my life
Don't you know that you keep me shinin'? Yeah

That summer day that I recall
You came into my life
And you gave me hope and love
I just wanna be what you want me to

The summer day you changed it all
You came into my life
And you let me fall in love
My baby, I just wanna be with you

I just wanna let it shine
I just wanna tell you I love you, baby

And I'm gonna let it shine
And I'm gonna let it shine
Yes, I'm gonna let it shine for you
I just wanna let it shine

I just wanna let it shine
I just wanna let it shine
