Oh it's coming on
Yeah the snow-melt will quickly fill this riverbed
I feel it now it's strong
Yeah the new life will help me to clear my head

To sit at the base of an evergreen
And let it's cover keep the rains from falling on me
It sounds like a dream
But happily it's my reality

Ooh
Whoa I'm holdin' on
Ooh
To where I'm from and where I've gone

Barefoot I'm on high
As I'm runnin' through the forrest to the waterline
Atop a driftwood seat
On a pebble beach, the water's washing over me

The mountains they surround
With their snowy peaks oh peek, peekin' down.
And it sounds like a dream
But happily it's my reality

Ooh
I'm holdin' on
Ooh
To where I'm from and where I've gone

Ooh
Oh I'm holdin' on
Ooh
Yeah to where I'm from and where I've gone

Yeah where I've gone
