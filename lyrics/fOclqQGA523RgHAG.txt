Collision, my mission,
When the dawn breaks
With a handshake
Relaxed and feelin' great

Screeching head on, head on, head on
Im needing a head on, head on, head on
Screeching, head on, head on, head on
Im needing a head on, head on, head on

All the days plans
All the shaken hands
Beepers and suntans

Screeching, head on, head on, head on
Im needing a head on, head on, head on
Screeching, head on, head on, head on
Im needing a head on, head on, head on

Collision, my mission

Head on, head on, head on, head on

When the dawn breaks
With a handshake
Relaxed and feelin great

Collision, my mission
Head on, head on, head on,
Head on, head on, head on,

Head on,
Head on,
Head on
