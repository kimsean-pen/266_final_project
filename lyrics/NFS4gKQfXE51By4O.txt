O maiden pale Ophelia
Your skin is white like diamonds in the snow
But they know
Madness and hysteria turned your flowers into stone

Fleurs-de-lis
Sweets to sweet

I can hear them mourning at my grave
Ophelia

Can you feel this madbess in my veins
Inside my veins
Love and pain

This sighing fate
She fades away
I fade away into black waters

Confident black river strams tangle in your hair
White veils merge to snowbells like deadly poetry
All around you fleurs-de-lis on a white mortal bed

Maiden thou shalt not sin
Virgin suppress your will
Forces seduce your lind
Haunting a damsel's sleep
