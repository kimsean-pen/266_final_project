I'm hiding from the city lights
Craving for some sins on my red way
I'm hunting in a sleepless night
Acting like a maniac
That's what they say
Debauchery is ruling all around
Then meet you
In the corner of a bar
Poison in my bitter mouth, I'm hunting
I grab you with my guilty hands
Emily
Listen to the voice inside your head
You whore, don't say a single word
Come with me into the deepest dark
Chastity really is not my home
So feel our libido that strongly sparks
Drunk with ht misdeeds
We fuck like beasts
Blinded by the rut
Opposite breaths, minuetto of lust
The sound of the decadence
You and me
Emily
Listen to the voices inside you head
Run away from were
Living ameng the grim
Delights for a libertine
If I'm the hunter or the prey
I am probably both and I've been aways
