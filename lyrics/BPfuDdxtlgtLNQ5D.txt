Look at me
Look at me

I am changing, trying every way I can
I am changing, I'll be better than I am
I'm trying to find a way to understand
But I need you, I need you
I need a hand

I am changing, seeing everything so clear
I am changing, I am going to start right now, right here
I am hoping to work it out, and I know that I can
But I need you, I need a hand

All of my life, I've been a fool
Who said I could do it all alone
How many good friends have I already lost
How many dark nights have I known

Walking down that wrong road
There was nothing I could find
All those years of darkness
Could make a person blind
But now I can see

I am changing, trying every way I can
I am changing, I'll be better than I am
But I need a friend, to help me start all over again
Oh, that would be just fine
I know it's gonna work out this time
'Cause this time I am yeah
This time I am
I am changing
I get my life together now
I am changing, yes, I know how
I'm gonna start again, I'm gonna leave my past behind
I'll change my life, I'll make a vow
And nothing's gonna stop me now
