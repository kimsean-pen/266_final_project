All this choosing-wrongs losing ground
Often feeling lost, has brought it out.

But I'm looking for a love, not a heartache
Yes I'm gonna take my time
Even though I know from the handshake
If I wanna make you mine

I am walking blind
Maybe that's a good thing,
Maybe that's a good thing...

...that I can't see what's coming
And I don't much care
Life will become one big stupid "Truth or Dare"
Maybe it's a good thing

Temper me with dignity today
Ever shoot your silver through my veins

Looking for a change in my make-up
Break apart and start again
I will ask a question
You will win my heart and then...

...I will send you a sign
Maybe that's a rare thing,
Maybe that's a rare thing.

When a light comes blinding
And it stops me dead
I'll always remember the time you sat next to me and you said,
"Maybe it's a good thing."

When a light comes blinding
And it stops me dead
I'll always remember the time you sat next to me and you said,
"Maybe it's a good thing.
Maybe it's a good thing."
