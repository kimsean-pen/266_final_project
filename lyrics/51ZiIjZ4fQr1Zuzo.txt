Strictly business, nothing more
As I held the door
(Held the door)
When a saint walked in
As two hearts died in dancing
The new story begins

Oh, my poor soul
Starts flying like a canonball
What goes up must come down
Take my advice and run while you still
(Can)

Off to the races, got my love jumpstarted
The only one I want is you
(Say it again)
I hear the bells and the ring and already
Four kids and the big ol' wedding
Singing, You
(Say it again)
And how was I to make a long walk home
You got me feeling like I'm overdosed,
Singing, You

Hey, don't act surprised
Gold fish wouldn't love you twice
And your vanity, my deep levity
Won't take my advice
I never run while I still
(Can)

Off to the races got my love jumpstarted
The only one I want is you
I hear the bells and the ring and already
Four kids and the big ol' wedding
Singing, You
(Say it again)
And how was I to make a long walk home
You got me feeling like I'm overdosed,
Singing, You

The Mars starts attacking and the other is clapping
Dropping all the bits and poison
In the morning I was sure that she was sleeping with me
God damn, maybe

What goes up must come down
Take my advice and run while you still

Off to the races, got my love jumpstarted
The only one I want is you
(Say it again)
I hear the bells and the ring and already
Four kids and the big ol' wedding
Singing, You
(Say it again)
And how was I to make long walk home
You got me feeling like I'm overdosed
Singing, You

Maybe I just gotta pay the price
Maybe I just gotta pay the price
Maybe I just gotta pay the price
Maybe I just gotta pay the price
Maybe I just gotta pay the price
I feel broken
But maybe I just gotta pay the price
I keep hoping
But maybe I just gotta pay the price
Maybe I just gotta pay the price
(What goes on must come down)
Maybe I just gotta pay the price
Maybe I just gotta pay the price
Take my advice and run while you still
