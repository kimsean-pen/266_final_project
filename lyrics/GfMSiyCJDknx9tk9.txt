What was that sound
Ringing around your brain?
Today was just a blur
You gotta head like a ghost train

What was that sound
Ringing around your brain?
You're here on your own
Who you gonna find to blame?

You're the outcast
You're the underclass
But you don't care
Because you're living fast

You're the uninvited guest
Who stays 'till the end
I know you've got a problem
That the devil sends

You think they're talking 'bout you
But you don't know who
I'll be scraping your life
From the sole of my shoe tonight

Bring it on down, bring it down for me
Your head's in a fish tank
Your body and your mind can't breath
Bring it on down, bring it down for me
Your head's in a fish tank
Your body and your mind can't breath
You're the outcast
You're the underclass
But you don't care
Because you're living fast
You're the uninvited guest
Who stays 'till the end
I know you've got a problem
That the devil sends
You think they're talking 'bout you
But you don't know who
I'll be scraping your life
From the sole of my shoe tonight
