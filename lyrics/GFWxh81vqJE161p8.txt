Everybody, everybody, yeah
Everybody, everybody, yeah
Everybody, everybody, yeah
Everybody, everybody!
Everybody, yeah
Everybody, yeah
Everybody, yeah
Everybody, haha
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Where's the truth?
Where does it lie?
All this smoke is burning my eyes
Fear on the left, fear on the right
Money is power and power decides
Some are more equal than others
Everybody, everybody lies
Everybody, everybody buys it
Everybody, everybody
We all divide, divide, divide
So let 'em burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, woah
Let 'em burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
So let 'em burn
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Call in my drugs
Make me alright
And legalize whatever gets me high
They preach the blood, in fear we trust
Embellish it, it sells itself
And I bought in for the last time
Everybody, everybody lies
Everybody, everybody buys it
Everybody, everybody
We all divide, divide, divide
So let 'em burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, woah
Let 'em burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
They repeat a lie 'til it become a fact
We gotta burn it down so we can build it back
Let 'em burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Maze of mirror, house of cards
You fix the fight, rigged from the start
The bottom line is above our heads
Employ the flies
To build your web
Let 'em burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Let 'em burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Let 'em burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Let 'em burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Everybody, everybody, yeah
Everybody, everybody, yeah
Everybody I mean everybody, yeah
Everybody I mean everybody!
Everybody, yeah
Everybody, yeah
Everybody, yeah
Everybody!
Sick of this shiet, sick of these lies
They all deny, deny, deny
Let 'em burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
They repeat a lie 'til it become a fact
We gotta burn it down so we can build it back
Let 'em burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
So let 'em burn!
Everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody, haha!
