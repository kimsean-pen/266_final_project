Life is like a circus wheel
And I never know how to feel
You're still woven in the way back then
But I never meant to hurt you or to lose a friend
The times gone by on a runaway train
And I don't know where he's going or if he's back again
But you, you're looking at me
Just say what you want, just say what you need
Cause I, I need to be free
To come as I go and go as I please
Did you think I'd stay?
Well, you should turn the other way
Cause we're never going back again
All you did was stay
Holding on to yesterday
Well, it's never coming back again
Life, a couple hundred miles away
And I remember you like it was yesterday

So why, why you looking at me?
It's not what you want
It's not what you need
Did you think I'd stay?
Well, you should turn the other way
Cause we're never going back again
All you did was stay
Holding on to yesterday
Well, it's never coming back again, oh
You can stay in the past
You can live a lie
Say I've changed
Call me cold
Call me what you like
And never know what it's like on the other side
You can stay in the past
You can live a lie
Say I've changed
Call me cold
Call me what you like
And never know what it's like on the other side
Did you think I'd stay?
Well, you should turn the other way
Cause we're never going back again
All you did was stay
Holding on to yesterday
Well, it's never coming again
You can stay in the past
You can live a lie
Say I've changed
Call me cold
Call me what you like
And never know what it's like on the other side
You can stay in the past
You can live a lie
Say I've changed
Call me cold
Call me what you like
And never know what it's like on the other side
