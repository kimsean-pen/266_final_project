I can't afford the price of pain
I can't even pay the rent
They're coming at me every way and there's no letting up
I'm frightened by the threats they make
Take me down and they'll bury me
And if I run they'll chase me back again
Drag me before I make the break

I can't keep holding on
In a hideaway I needed to keep me from breaking down
And I'm under

Baby, I can't carry on
Didn't I??? on
Baby, I was one in a million
Even if our love was gone
Tear me down and let it fall
Baby, I was one in a million
And I was holding, running and waking, turning, testing, burning, losing time
I wanna get it down, holding myself
Baby, I was one in a million
I wanna get it down, holding myself
Baby, I was one in a million

Tears fall like acid rain and it burns me through the skin
It's taking everything from me and I lost my innocence
Let's bring the night to day
Watch them turn the sky to black
And then a gun that fires that sound again frightens me until the bitter end
I can't keep holding on
In a hideaway I needed to keep me from breaking down
And I'm under

And I need it
And I need it
And I need it to keep me from breaking down
And I need it to keep me from breaking down
And I need it to keep me from breaking down
And I need it to keep me from thinking I won't find my wings no more

Baby, I was one in a million
Baby, I was one in a million
And I was holding, waking, testing, losing time
I wanna get her to hold myself
Baby, I was one in a million
