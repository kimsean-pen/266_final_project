I've lost so much sleep
Mistaking your voice in my ear for the voice in my head
Your guilt stacked against me
Convinced that I'd bend
I just rolled over and prayed for the end

What chance do I have when you expect me to fail before I even begin?
Your exceptions can't take me out
I'm done betting against myself

I won't be doomed by you
I won't be doomed

You had caught in a tide of self doubt
Swimming against your current but I won't fucking drown
I can see you for what you've become
So don't wonder why you're left with no one

What chance do I have when you expect me to fail before I even begin?
Your narrow predictions won't take me down
I'm done betting against myself

I won't be doomed by you
I won't be doomed

You made me believe that this was about me
When the truth is, you fucking coward, you don't have what it takes
