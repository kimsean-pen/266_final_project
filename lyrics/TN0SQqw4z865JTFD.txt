They say sing what you know
But I've sung what they want
Some folks do what they're told
But baby this time I won't
We'll look through that door
I know the truth won't lie
Some things I've done before I can't justify
There are kings in my past
Things no one can be proud of
But I stand in the light I've cast
Turn away from any luck of love
Oh, and I walk through that door
I say here I go
You see me and nothing before
I'm saying what I know
I know better
I know better

Legend is just a name
I know better than to be so proud
I won't dream in all this fame
I've taken more than I'm allowed
I wanna highly cut it all from where it came
My history has brought m to this place
There's power in the color of my face
And I know better
Oh oh oh
I know better
Oh
I'll rise from the floor without a wing
I'll bust open that door so let me in
And if music chooses me to sing I'll let her
I'm saying what I know, yes
I know better
Oh
I know better
Yes
I know better
I know better
