Barren lands and barren minds, ice cold ice
In another place and time, ice cold ice
I feel I've never known myself, ice cold ice
Frozen in the sand again, ice cold ice

Well, see the blank expressions, waiting for progression
Standing still in place and time, no one's moving
They're only standing still in ice cold ice, cold ice
Only standing still in ice cold ice

Well, all machines and all are one, ice cold ice
Well, catching up on what's been done, ice cold ice
Stealing glimpses from the past, ice cold ice
Well, these impressions always last, ice cold ice

Well, never penetrating, always contemplating
We sit and count the blessings, but we're blessed by icons
No one else could trust in ice cold ice, cold ice, cold ice
Only standing still in ice cold ice

Stay together till the end, ice cold ice
Thinking you might be a friend, ice cold ice

We sit and pray together that they might change the weather
My love for you will never die, if I sound distant that's because
Shouldn't see me cry in ice cold ice
Shouldn't see me cry in ice cold ice

Shouldn't see me cry in ice cold ice
Shouldn't see me cry in ice cold ice

You shouldn't see me cry in ice cold ice
Shouldn't see me cry in ice cold ice
Shouldn't see me cry in ice cold ice
You shouldn't see me, you shouldn't see
