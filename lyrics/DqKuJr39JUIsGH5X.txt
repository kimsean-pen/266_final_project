This old man I've talked about
Broke his own heart poured it in the ground

Big red tree grew up and out
Throws up its leaves, spins round and round

I know all this and more
So take your hat off
When you're talking to me
And be there when I'll feed the tree

This little squirrel I used to be
Slammed her bike down the stairs

They put silver where her teeth had been
Baby silver tooth, she grins and grins

I know all this and more
So take your hat off, boy
When you're talking to me
And be there when I'll feed the tree

Take your hat off, boy
When you're talking to me
And be there when I'll feed the tree

This old man I used to be
Spins around, around, around the tree

Silver baby, come to me
I'll only hurt you in my dreams

I know all this and
I know all this and
I know all this and more
So take your hat off, boy
When you're talking to me
And be there when I'll feed the tree

Take your hat off
When you're talking to me
And be there when I'll feed the tree
