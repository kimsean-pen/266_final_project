Tired of living like my days are bad
When I open up my eyes, I'm glad
And I can't complain 'bout yesterday
'Cause today's a brand new day
Comb my hair and throw some black and run
Jump in my ride because it's on and I'm gone, I'm gone

I woke up this morning
Opened up my eyes and prayed
Lord 'cause it's a beautiful day
No matter what nobody say
Even though it's cloudy, I can see the sunray
Lord 'cause it's a beautiful day
No matter what nobody say
'Cause it's a beautiful day, a beautiful day

Life just can't get no better than this
Mother nature's given another kiss
There's more room, glad I didn't miss
Let's take advantage of days like this
When the night time does finally here
There be no reason for guns, it will be fun, fun, fun, fun

I woke up this morning
Opened up my eyes and prayed
Lord 'cause it's a beautiful day
No matter what nobody say
Even though it's cloudy, I can see the sunray
Lord 'cause it's a beautiful day
No matter what nobody say
'Cause it's a beautiful day, a beautiful day

Everything is good because I'm living and I'm healthy
I'm not too concerned about being poor or being wealthy
I feel really good about this blessing given to me
Nothing in this world could ever take all my joy from me
It's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful day, a beautiful day, beautiful day, a beautiful day

I woke up this morning
Opened up my eyes and prayed
Lord 'cause it's a beautiful day
No matter what nobody say
Even though it's cloudy, I can see the sunray
Lord 'cause it's a beautiful day
No matter what nobody say
'Cause it's a beautiful day, a beautiful day

I don't have a complain in the world
I am doing so good
Without, without, without the money
Without, without, without the stress
Without, without, without the people, yeah
Oh, budi dom, dubidom dubi dom dudu labi dom
Beautiful day, beautiful day, beautiful day

I woke up this morning
Opened up my eyes and prayed
Lord 'cause it's a beautiful day
No matter what nobody say
Even though it's cloudy, I can see the sunray
Lord 'cause it's a beautiful day
No matter what nobody say

I woke up this morning
Opened up my eyes and prayed
Lord 'cause it's a beautiful day
No matter what nobody say
Even though it's cloudy, I can see the sunray
Lord 'cause it's a beautiful day
No matter what nobody say
'Cause it's a beautiful day, a beautiful day
