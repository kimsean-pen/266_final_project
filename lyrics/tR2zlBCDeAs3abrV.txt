Good things come to those who wait
So I waited
Silently fighting half awake
Sweetness
Temporarily in our favor
Then in the bend I didn't break

I saw it bloom
Like Tokyo in the spring
One afternoon
My Tokyo, happening
The baby blue skies
Broke 'em in for the first time
As it opened right before my very eyes

Pictures no one dared to take
I was painting
Blindly deciding on the shapes
Unexpected little wind -
Something changes -
In the last second we escape

I saw it bloom
Like Tokyo in the spring
One afternoon
My Tokyo, happening
Rose with the moon
Like Tokyo, pretty thing
Outside my room
My Tokyo, happening
The baby blue skies
Broke 'em in for the first time
As it opened right before my very eyes

Baby, how we'd wait for this
Figured I was late for it
Baby how we'd wait for this
Carrying the weight of bliss
Baby how we'd wait for this
Thinking I was late for this

I saw it bloom
Like Tokyo in the spring
One afternoon
My Tokyo, happening
Rose with the moon
Like Tokyo, pretty thing
Outside my room
My Tokyo, happening
The baby blue skies
Broke 'em in for the first time
As it opened right before my very eyes
