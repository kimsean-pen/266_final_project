Do you wanna spend some time with me?
Do you wanna have some tuna?
Cold tuna fish in the kitchen with me
Half toasted bread with margerine

I'm travelling on mayonese
I'm travelling on mayonese

Do you wanna yesterday wine?
Do you wanna rob a bank tonight?
Do you wanna find some stuff at my home?
We could make love
And write one or two songs

'Cause I'm travelling on mayonese
I'm travelling on mayonese

Uh, I'm so drunk, can you be the driver?
Uh, why we pretend we are so outsiders?
Uh, I don't know where I parked my fucking car
Uh, is that a UFO or a shooting star?

'Cause we travelled on mayonese
We travelled on mayonese

October is gone
November, so gone
December was hell
December was hell
January, it's my birthday
February, it's carnival, people!
On march you are back to school
April is a nothing-month
In may we are travelling
In may we are travelling
June is a windy month
July, you might need some coat
I don't like August, I don't know why
I don't like August, hmm, I don't know why
September, some flowers
September, some flowers
In May we are travelling
In May we are travelling
We travelled on mayonese
We travelled on mayonese
We travelled on mayonese
We travelled on mayonese
