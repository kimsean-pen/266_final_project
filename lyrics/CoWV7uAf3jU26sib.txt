Cupid pass another my way (my way)
Another night, a lot more days (more days)
Hard to think about you anymore ('bout you anymore)
But I keep you in my mind always (always)
Called me on the phone last night (last night)
Couldn't hear your voice, I fight (I fight)
I won't be around you anymore (around you anymore)
In a dream where you feel alright

I don't really wanna run around, yeah
Time is goin' slow and I don't mind, yeah
Tell me if you know I'm really found, yeah
Fuck around and didn't get it right
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

I don't really wanna run around
'Round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round
Saying all the rhymes that make your world go

Girl, why don't you just stay?
Tellin' me that you're okay
Just better if you stay away
Better if you stay away
Won't you stay away?
Stay away, stay away
Alright
