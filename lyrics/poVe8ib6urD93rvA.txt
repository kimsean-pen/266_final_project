You've applied the pressure
To have me crystalised,
And you've got the faith
That I could bring paradise.

I'll forgive and forget
Before I'm paralyzed.
Do I have to keep up the pace
To keep you satisfied?

Ay, ay

Things have gotten closer to the sun,
And I've done things in small doses.
So don't think that I'm pushing you away,
When you're the one that I've kept closest.

Ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay
Mmm
Ay, ay, ay

You don't move slow,
You're taking steps in my direction.
The sounds echo...
It doesn't lessen your affection.
Oh, whoa.

You say I'm foolish,

(Oh, whoa)
For pushing this aside...
(Oh, whoa)
Burn down our home--
I won't leave alive.

Ay, ay, ay

Glaciers have melted to the sea,
I wish the tide would take me over.
I've been down on my knees,
And you just keep on getting closer.

Ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay

Glaciers have melted to the sea,
I wish the tide would take me over.
I've been down on my knees,
And you just keep on getting closer.

Go slow.
Go slow, oh.
Go slow.
