I just wanna lay in bed
Kiss you on the neck
Baby, lay your head down on me
We could do some drugs again (yeah)

I'm feeling addicted, like I cannot quit this
I wanna be with you a-a-all the time
Right when we finish I'm feeling electric
I wish you would hit this and say you're mine

I got a lot of shit to ask you
Boy you got me losin' my mind
You know I wish that I could have you
Got me feelin' like I'm high
