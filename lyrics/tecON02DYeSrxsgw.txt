When I see your smile
Tears run down my face, I can't replace
And now that I'm strong I have figured out
How this world turns cold and it breaks through my soul
And I know, I'll find, deep inside me I can be the one

I will never let you fall (let you fall)
I'll stand up with you forever
I'll be there for you through it all (through it all)
Even if saving you, sends me to Heaven

It's okay, It's okay, It's okay
Seasons are changing
And waves are crashing
And stars are falling all for us
Days grow longer and nights grow shorter
I can show you, I'll be the one

I will never let you fall (let you fall)
I'll stand up with you forever
I'll be there for you through it all (through it all)
Even if saving you, sends me to Heaven

Cause you're my, you're my, my
My true love, my whole heart
Please don't throw that away

Cause I'm here, for you
Please don't walk away and
Please tell me you'll stay, yeah
More, stay more
Use me as you will
Pull my strings just for a thrill
And I know I'll be ok
Though my skies are turning gray (gray)
I will never let you fall
I'll stand up with you forever
I'll be there for you through it all
Even if saving you, sends me to Heaven
I will never let you fall
I'll stand up with you forever
I'll be there for you through it all
Even if saving you, send me to Heaven
