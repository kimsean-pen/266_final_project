This, ends, now

This ends now
And I dont care about last year
Can't be afraid of what the future holds, no fear
You want the past and the safety it brings
It doesn't mean anything!
We've come to far
There's no going back now
Bring on the future with an open embrace
Memories I will erase
Memories I will erase

This is the end
This is the end of chasing dreams gone by
Everlong is this goodbye and this
This is the end
This is the end of our respect denied
Stand with us or stand aside

Only now
Do you pretend to care about this
You suffocated anything that came between us
Took every condescending barb and sting
I don't owe you anything
So here we stand
Farewell is forever
And if you think that it's joke or lie
Look me in these blackened eyes
Look me in these blackened eyes

This is the end
This is the end of chasing dreams gone by
Everlong is this goodbye and this
This is the end
This is the end of our respect denied
Stand with us or stand aside

Bastards, you bastards
May you suffer oh so long (oh so long)
Bastards, you bastards
So long

Brothers, my brothers
Why have you forsaken me? (forsaken me)
Brothers, my brothers
So be

Deny those that will never accept
Empty words are just empty regrets
Let go the bile that your soul has amassed
With this let the dye be cast
This is the end
This is the end of chasing dreams gone by
Everlong is this goodbye and this
This is the end
This is the end of our respect denied
Stand with us or stand aside
