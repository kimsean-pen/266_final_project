Shooting stars in midnight pastures
And hanging out on clouds beneath the moon
Hitching rides on magic carpets
It's a fairy tale to me but you're in tune

You're shattered by the final frame
Of the movie scene that generates your every aim
You ain't no bird and so for what it's worth
Gonna bring you straight back down, down

Straight back down
Come back down
Straight back down
Y'all straight back down to earth

In times when you're in need of assistance
You're looking for a lead and in the distance
You hear them calling come back down again
But you don't know how, you don't know where
And don't know when

You're shattered by the final frame
Of the movie scene that generates your every aim
You ain't no bird and so for what it's worth
Gonna bring you straight back down to earth

Straight back down
Come back down, down
Straight back down
Y'all straight back down to earth

Don't wanna wanna be misled
Don't wanna fall on a razor's edge and
You feel at ease, you're begging please
Don't take me down for nothing

Don't wanna wanna be misled
Don't wanna fall on a razor's edge and
You feel at ease, you're begging please
Don't take me down for nothing

You're shattered by the vital pain
That is needed now to tell you not to go insane
You're tempted by, I say the cooling breeze
That will bring you down
Oh, come back please

Straight back down
Come back down
Straight back down
Y'all straight back down to earth

Don't wanna wanna be misled
Don't wanna fall on a razor's edge and
You feel at ease, you're begging please
Don't take me down for nothing

Don't wanna wanna be misled
Don't wanna fall on a razor's edge and
You feel at ease, you're begging please
Don't take me down for nothing

Don't wanna wanna be misled
Don't wanna fall on a razor's edge and
Don't take me down for nothing

Don't wanna wanna be misled
Don't wanna fall on a razor's edge and
Don't take me down for nothing

Don't wanna wanna be misled
Don't wanna fall on a razor's edge and
Don't take me down for nothing
