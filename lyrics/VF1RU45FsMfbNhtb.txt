Set me free and watch me fall
Lose the feeling of it all
I wish the night would let me in
Back here knocking on the door again

If I ever wake up
At the right time
If I ever wake up
I'll find a way to change your mind

I dreamed we fell into the night
Your darkness shined the brightest light
We drove for miles on the moon
I'd go anywhere with you
