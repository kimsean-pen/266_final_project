His body loved her
his mind was set on other things
Keep your face out of sight
and your thoughts to yourself
And this went on for several nights
festering in silence, growing in the dark

and this they saw as love
Love
So sad to see
They suffocate at night
Oh this they saw as love
Love
So sad to see
to see it slowly die

She met his wishes
he found that he had changed his mind
Now the fit is too tight
and the bedroom too warm
The days are filled with things to do
Night-time lies so hollow and memories betray

Oh memories of love
Love
So sad to see
They suffocate at night
Those memories of love
Love
So sad to see
to see it slowly die

Two years have passed
two years of emptiness inside
and the grey skies above
just show how far I went wrong
I wonder if she's living there
the way that I recall
the way I'll always think of you
And when I think of you

I think of love
Love
So sad to see
They suffocate at night
You know I think of love
Love
So sad to see
to see it slowly die

I wrote you a letter
I threw it away
I wrote you a letter
I threw it away
I need her
I know I don't need her
I need her
Oh
Oh-oh
