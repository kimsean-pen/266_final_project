This days, lately I've been chasing shadows in the dark
I forgot the light
And all things black and white
Livin' in the grace fallen through the hour glass of time, time, time
I've been turning the time, time, tonight
Come a little closer, closer to the flame
Holdin' in a fire, tearin' up the frame
And i'm still alive
(Hey hey i'm still alive)
Come a little closer, closer to the flame
Ashes and desire burnin up my veins
And i'm still alive
(Hey hey i'm still alive)
Wasted, weightless, spended like a puppet on the string
But I' ll never give in
I've been on my own
I've been
The bruises left will never ever show
No no
And I'm letting it go, go woah
Come a little closer, closer to the flame
Holdin' in a fire, tearin' up the frame
And I'm still alive
(Hey hey i'm still alive)
Come a little closer, closer to the flame
Ashes and desire burnin in my veins
And i'm still alive
(Hey hey i'm still alive)
And I feel alive
(Hey hey i'm still alive)
I don't wanna let this go
I'll pull myself from the undertoe
And i'd push you out
And i'd let you in
Started over and over again
And I said
I don't wanna let this go
I'll pull myself from the undertoe
And i'd push you out
Then i'd let you in
Started over and over again
ohh ohh ohh ohh
Come a little closer, closer to the flame
Holdin' in a fire, tearin' up the frame
And I'm still alive
Come a little closer, closer to the flame
Holdin' in a fire, tearin' up the frame
And I'm still alive
(Hey hey i'm still alive)
Come a little closer, closer to the flame
Ashes and desire burnin in my veins
And i'm still alive
(Hey hey i'm still alive)
And I feel alive
(Hey hey i'm still alive)
ohh ohh ohh ohh
