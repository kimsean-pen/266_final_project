Well it all just seemed so simple
When i was just a boy
When wrong and right
Was clear as black and white
And the answers i had em all
If i knew then
What i know now
Well i would know much at all
But i know how
To take a stand
And how to rise from a fall
Cause i know i cant win em all
But just to win at all

Well it all just seemed so simple
When i was just a boy
When wrong and right
Was clear as black and white
And the answers i had em all
If i knew then
What i know now
Well i would know much at all
But i know when
To take a stand
And how to rise from a fall
Cause i know i cant win em all
But you just keep learning[?] when there's nothing else to do

As the years have passed me by
Stopped asking why I'm here
Why I'm here
I was young and full of dreams
All these plans and big ideas
But now
I can see
There's no hope for me

Memories are fading
But how'd I end up here
I'm doing my best to forget the past
Because the pains to much to bear
See I'm not a bitter man
But i think I'll have my share
All put downs and shit downs
It can only get better from here
Its never hit but miss
It cant get any worse than this

As the years have passed me by
Stopped asking why I'm here
Why I'm here
I was young and full of dreams
All these plans and big ideas
But now
I can see
As the years have passed me by
Stopped asking why I'm here
Why I'm here
I was young and full of dreams
All these plans and big ideas
But now
I can see
There's no hope for me
There's no hope for me
There's no hope for me
There's no hope for me
There's no hope for me
There's no hope for me
There's no hope for me
