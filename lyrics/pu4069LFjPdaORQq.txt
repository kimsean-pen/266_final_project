When in motion
World is frozen
Talks in circles and Greek
He's into epiphany
He's into philosophy
He's into methyl amphetamines
He's into science
But he's lost his way
He's not the real me, but I can hear
I can hear, I can hear him
From my future

Show, show, show show me
You gotta show me the way
Show, show, show show me
You gotta show me the way
Show, show, show show me
You gotta show me the way
Show, show, show show me
You gotta show me the way

Past and present
Are superimposed
He has seen this before
He's into conspiracy
He's into theophany
He's into phenomenology
He's into deeds
He don't mix his words
He's not the real me, but I can hear
I can hear, I can hear him
From my future

Show, show, show show me
You gotta show me the way
Show, show, show show me
You gotta show me the way
Show, show, show show me
You gotta show me the way
Show, show, show show me
Show, show, show show me
