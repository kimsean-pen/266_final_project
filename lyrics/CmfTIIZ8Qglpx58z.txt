You gotta fire burning
Burning and hurting me too
You gotta fire burning
But it's burning and hurting me too

Why are you angry? Tell me babe
Why are you angry? Tell me baby
That man's so angry
you make me sad tonight

He makes me dive into the cold

Cold

You gotta fire burning
Burning and hurting me too
You gotta fire burning
But it's burning and hurting me too

Why are you angry? Tell me babe
Why are you angry? Tell me baby
That man's so angry
you make me sad tonight

He makes me dive into the cold

Cold

I can not breathe in

I know it's hard when you're hurting
you're pleading
Pride is so dangerous
I can't compete with

All of your demons
They will never let me
Breathe in
I can not breathe in

I can not breathe in
He makes me dive into the cold

Cold

I can not breathe in

Cold
