I have been waiting for you
I have been storing all my devotion
It flows like an ocean now
It seems I've never felt so complete
It's like I've woken up from a deep sleep
But dreaming of you somehow
I've become fond of having you near
The way I'm fond of breathing in air
How could I be without you?

Chorus:
Yes, my love, darling I was made for you
Never will this alter, anytime you falter
I'll be there, I'll be there
Yes, my love, I open up my heart for you
Everyday that's breaking
You will hear me saying
Love is here, love is here
Never fear, 'cos baby, love is here

And so a new beginning
My heart, my head is spinning
I'm dizzy
Yeah, you make me giddy now
You make my life have purpose
And so I'm gonna make my goal just to love you

As much as I can do, yeah
I hope you're proud of being my man
The way I'm proud of holding your hand in my hand

Chorus

I've become fond of having your near
The way I'm fond of breathing in air
How could I be without you?

Chorus 2x
