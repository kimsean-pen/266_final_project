Ride, ride my See-Saw
Take this place
On this trip
Just for me

Ride, take a free ride
Take my place
Have my seat
It's for free

I worked like a slave for years
Sweat so hard just to end my fears
Not to end my life a poor man
But by now, I know I should have run

Run, run my last race
Take my place
Have this number of mine

Run, run like a fire
Don't you run in
In the lanes
Run for time

Left school with a first class pass
Started work but as second class
School taught one and one is two
But by now, that answer just ain't true

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

My world is spinning 'round
Everything is lost that I found
People run, come ride with me
Let's find another place that's free

Ride, ride my See-Saw
Take this place
On this trip
Just for me

Ride, take a free ride
Take my place
Have my seat
It's for free

Ride my See-Saw
Ride, ride, ride my See-Saw
Ride my See-Saw
