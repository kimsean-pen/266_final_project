Hold your breath, don't look down, keep trying
Darling, it's okay to be scared, it's frightening
At times it just feels like the world is trying hard to knock us down
But there's a reason that we're still here when no one else is around

How we've grown
Every single day I'm proud
I swear, I won't
Let anything stop us now

I'm not a soldier
But I'll fight through our darkest of days
Get on my shoulders
And I'll carry you all of the way
'Cause there's no life worth living in
If you're not with me in it
I'm not a soldier
But you make me wanna be brave
Yeah, you do

Through the depths of despair, we've stumbled
And all that distance between us, we've crumbled
We've ignored all of the rumours and jealous disapprovals
And we've come out the other side with something beautiful

Oh, how we've grown
Every single day I'm proud
And now I know
There's nothing that can stop us now

I'm not a soldier
But I'll fight through our darkest of days
Get on my shoulders
And I'll carry you all of the way
'Cause there's no life worth living in
If you're not with me in it
I'm not a soldier
But you make me wanna be brave
Yeah, you do

Only we know where we're going
Every day we're gonna keep on growing
Learning from the tears and the mistakes
We're not perfect but we've come such a long way
As long as I got you by my side
I know what I wanna do in this life
One day when our kids fall in love
We can tell them that the odds were against us

I'm not a soldier
But I'll fight through our darkest of days
Get on my shoulders
And I'll carry you all of the way, woo-ooh
'Cause there's no life worth living in
If you're not with me in it
I'm not a soldier (soldier)
But you make me wanna be brave
Yeah, you do

Yeah, you do, yeah, you do
But you make me wanna be brave
Yeah, you do
Oh yeah, you do
