Hey, I feel
I feel something new in my life
I don't know what's real
I've only just opened my eyes
Hey, take care
Take care in this foreign land
With a smile, long hair
And I wanna hold your hand

Everything is falling apart
Everything is falling apart
Everything is falling apart

Walk, don't run
But run from the miserablites
Who believe in no fun
Unless it's what they think is right
Relax, find love
Hold on to the hand of a friend
But hey, have fun
'Cause everything is going to end

Everything is falling apart (apart from our love)
Everything is falling apart (apart from what I want)
Everything is falling apart (apart from our love)

Everything is falling apart (apart from our love)
Everything is falling apart (apart from what I want)
Everything is falling apart (apart from our love)

Everything is falling apart (apart from our love)
Everything is falling apart (apart from what I want)
Everything is falling apart (apart from our love)

Everything is falling apart (apart from our love)
Everything is falling apart (apart from what I want)
Everything is falling apart (apart from our love)

Everything is falling apart (apart from our love)
Everything is falling apart (apart from what I want)
Everything is falling apart (apart from our love)

Everything is falling apart (apart from our love)
Everything is falling apart (apart from what I want)
Everything is falling apart (apart from our love)
