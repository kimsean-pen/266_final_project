I'm filling up inside
Like I need to open wide
And pour my heart out to you
But I'll just get denied
And all I wanted was someone to hear
What I'm going through

Everytime that I need you around
You're never there (never there)
You're never there (never there)
Because in my life is where I need you now
But you're never there (never there)
You're never there (never there)

You were supposed to see
All the signs I left to read
In front of your face
You were supposed to be
The closest thing to being me
But you're the furthest away
That's because

Everytime that I need you around
You're never there (never there)
You're never there (never there)
Because in my life is where I need you now
But you're never there (never there)
You're never there (never there)
You're never there
You're never there

And I doubt
That I will ever find out
If there's a way to get out
Of feeling all alone
'Cause lately
I've been thinking maybe
That no one's going to save me
I'll do it on my own
On my own, on my own

Everytime that I need you around
You're never there (never there)
You're never there (never there)
Because in my life is where I need you now
But you're never there (never there)
You're never there (never there)
You're never there (never there)
You're never there (never there)
You're never there
You're never there
