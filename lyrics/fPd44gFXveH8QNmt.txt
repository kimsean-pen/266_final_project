Sold my soul, and signed my name in blood
Stole it back, now praying in the dark
Fooled the devil, begging for a fight
Count the dollars, make your bet tonight

Feel strong like an oiled machine
All the anger boils within
Move it, give in, the high rollers are in

I get groovy, now turn it on and fight
Seal the deal, and let's boogie for a while
Let's get groovy, burning out with rage
Seal the deal, and let's do it all again

Knuckles crushed
My eyes no longer see
I paid the price, and fed the family

Feel strong like an oiled machine
All the anger boils within
Move it, give in, the high rollers are in

I get groovy, now turn it on and fight
Seal the deal, and let's boogie for a while
Let's get groovy, burning out with rage
Seal the deal, and let's do it all again

Sing hallelujah, the devil in disguise
There'll be no pearly gates
So stand up for yourself this time
Fight for honor, let no one drag you down no more
Be your own man
With blood, sweat, tears you fall

I get groovy, now turn it on and fight
Seal the deal, and let's boogie for a while
Let's get groovy, burning out with rage
Seal the deal, and let's do it all again

I get groovy, now turn it on and fight
Seal the deal, and let's boogie for a while
Let's get groovy, burning out with rage
Seal the deal, and let's do it all again
