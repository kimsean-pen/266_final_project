I'm waiting in the dark
Waiting for a dark light
To show me the way

I'm hiding from the world
Trapped by my ambition
Drowning in my fail

You're welcome to stand in my place
You're welcome to feel what I felt
You're welcome to live my life
And you're welcome to sleep in my bed of thorns

I'm walking through the dust
Pulling out splinters
Of things that never last

I'm easily forgotten
There is always someone
Better than the past

You're welcome to stand in my place
You're welcome to feel what I felt
You're welcome to live my life
And you're welcome to sleep in my bed of thorns

You're welcome
You're welcome
You're welcome
You're welcome
