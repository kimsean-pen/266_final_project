Sailing on your sea, and I fell in
Don't know how to breathe, or how to swim
Blinded by the dream, I wanna sleep
What you did to me, is what I need

Dear lover, put another pill upon my tongue
Forever, wrap me in your heavy love
Dear lover, put another pill upon my tongue
Forever, wrap me in your heavy love

Underneath your sheets, I dissolve
Safely in your heat, never cold

Dear lover, put another pill upon my tongue
Forever, wrap me in your heavy love
Dear lover, put another pill upon my tongue
Forever, wrap me in your heavy love

Dear lover, put another pill upon my tongue
Forever, wrap me in your heavy love
Dear lover, put another pill upon my tongue
Forever, wrap me in your heavy love
