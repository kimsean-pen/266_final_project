Why can't I decide, why my feelings I hide?
Always screwing with my mind, a thorn in my spine
Oh sure, it feels fine, wasting all our time
In the back of my mind, a thorn in my spine.

Wait, see it before my eyes
Why do I turn away?

Looking all the time at your face so blind
Feeling uptight, always the same fight
Hey, man, now decide, go ahead take your time
Kissing all the time that thorn in my spine

Wait, you cannot see inside
Why play yourself out that way?
Why you and me always hate?
Wait, weren't you my friend?

Pain and rage and fear I feel
Pain and rage and fear I feel
Pain and rage and fear I feel
Pain and rage and fear I feel
Pain and rage and fear I feel
Pain and rage and fear I feel
Pain and rage and fear I feel
Pain and rage and fear I feel

Hey, man, look inside, now you need your own life
Remember me, guy? That thorn in your spine
Waiting all the time, I'm doing mighty fine
Remember me, guy? That thorn in your spine

Wait, you cannot see inside
Why play yourself out that way?
Why you and me always hate
Wait, weren't you my friend?

Wait, you were my friend
Wait, you were my friend
Wait, you were my friend
Wait, you were my friend
