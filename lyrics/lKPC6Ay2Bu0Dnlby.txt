It's getting harder and harder to bear
You got me acting like a clown in a collar
You got me spending all the time I can spare
You got me wasting every dime, every dollar

When I stumble and fall does it hurt you at all?
Will it twist like a knife for the rest of your life?

You think that love's a joke but there ain't to much to laugh at
And it's all for show, should I keep my ticket after?
Or should I just go when you're begging for attention?
Once the crowd goes home and there's no one left to listen, tah dah!

You got me jumping through a circle of fire
You got me juggling everything that I care for
in your world is like a cage with a tiger
That's what the cuts and all the bruises are there for

When I stumble and fall does it hurt you at all?
Will it twist like a knife for the rest of your life?

You think that love's a joke but there ain't to much to laugh at
And it's all for show, should I keep my ticket after?
Or should I just go when you're begging for attention?
Once the crowd goes home and there's no one left to listen

I got the freedom to love, I got the freedom to leave
Well, now enough is enough, I'm not a trick up your sleeve
I'm not a part of your show, can't make me popup and go
One day your curtain will close, I've got to let you know

I've got to let you know
Oh, I've got to let you know

You think that love's a joke but there ain't to much to laugh at
And it's all for show, should I keep my ticket after?
Or should I just go when you're begging for attention?
Once the crowd goes home and there's no one left to listen, tah dah!
