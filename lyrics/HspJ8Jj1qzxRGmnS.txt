Don't you need me
Oh, baby boy
'Cause I'm so happy
Without your noise

Baby, now my head is on backwards
& my feet at funny angles
Every time I take a step
For moving forwards faster
Well lately, I can't take it
Baby, but my body's in tatters
In an ordinary fashion
& everything I tried to leave behind
Is still beside her
Hit me, I can take it

Leftover breakfast, cereal for lunch
She is broken, but she's fun
My girl eats mayonnaise
From a jar when she's gettin' blazed

Don't you need me
Oh, baby boy
'Cause I'm so happy
Without your noise

Lazy, layin' on your belly
With a super cool cola
Lookin' at your folded clothes
You've worn for three days over
With a cookie as a coaster

Maybe, I wish I could mold ya
"The Very Cool & Colder"
But you couldn't step forward
So it hurts to say it's hopeless
& we ain't gonna make it

Leftover breakfast, cereal for lunch
She is broken, but she's fun
My girl eats mayonnaise
From a jar when she's gettin' blazed

She is drunk on old cartoons
Liquid TV afternoons
Sometimes it makes me laugh
Sometimes it makes me sad

Don't you need me
Oh, baby boy
'Cause I'm so happy
Without your noise
Don't you need me
Oh, baby boy
'Cause I'm so happy
Without your noise
Oh, baby, now my head is on backwards
Mmm baby, now my head is on backwards
Oh, baby, now my head is on backwards
Mmm baby, now my head is on backwards
