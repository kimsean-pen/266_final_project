Eyes To See... Ears To Hear

Darkness - swallowing all in its path
The blind leading the blind and the "flock" is ever confused
Who has the gift of healthy sight and mind
Who can withstand while the others are blown away?

Eyes to see... what the others see not
Ears to hear... the voice of the elders guides
Eyes to see... and the blind; they wither away
You fools! These eyes are never for you

Darkness - corrupting all in its path
Greed leading the man to blindness, suffering
And ever foretold... the meek shall have this earth
Alas without sight they will only be left with demise

Worlds apart are they and I
My world remains in sight
Their lives - despair
The "I's" and "They's" cannot compare
