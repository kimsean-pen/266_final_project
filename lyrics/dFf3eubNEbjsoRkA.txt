It always hurts when no-one replies
I need to tell someone what's on my mind
'Cause no one ever feels the same as me
They always kind of seem to disagree

(And she knows) Hopeless ideas always come
(And she knows) And even I couldn't believe in some
(And she knows) So I guess I'll just do what I wanna do
(And she knows) And not think of what it means to you

'Cause she knows
That I never knew what love meant
And I still don't

Maybe someone could please interrupt
And pick up where I left off
I argued with you, and then you replied
"I don't know why I even try"

(And she knows) I wanna know what you think about me
(And she knows) 'Cause I don't know how I think about me
(And she knows) But when I'm guessin' right, it seems to me
(That she knows) But when I'm wrong, it's not because of me

'Cause she knows
'Cause she knows
'Cause she knows now
That I never knew what love meant
And I still don't

That I never knew what love meant
And I still don't
Never knew what love meant
And I still don't
