Tied off quick, looked around
Plunge it in, pull it out
I have found a fast solution to the pain
Painted walls, melt away
Am I a ghost? Decide to stay
I am shooting my solution in the rain
We're all dead now

Death will make you dream past tense
(Sleep now, dream forever)
Your hopes fly high and your life make sense
(Sleep now, dream tonight)
Death will make you dream past tense
(Sleep now, dream forever)
Your hopes fly high and your life make sense
(Sleep now, dream tonight)

Stay up late, enjoy the view
Sing with me, die with you
Come make my dreams come true
This high up, we start to fade
Watch the night, turn into day
Breaking high
We hold forever changing hearts of gold

Injection filled with contempt
I was fine when we met
Your reflection hides protected eyes of regret
We're all dead now

Death will make you dream past tense
(Sleep now, dream forever)
Your hopes fly high and your life make sense
(Sleep now, dream tonight)
Death will make you dream past tense
(Sleep now, dream forever)
Your hopes fly high and your life make sense once again
(Sleep now, dream tonight)

Sunrise before, as we wash ashore
Take us from this life, walk alone tonight
Sunrise before, as we wash ashore
And take us from this life, walk alone tonight

We're all dead now
(Dead now)
We're all dead now
(Dead now)
We're all dead now
(Dead now)
Dead now

Death will make you dream past tense
Your hopes fly high and your life make sense

Death will make you dream past tense
(Sleep now, dream forever)
Your hopes fly high and your life make sense
(Sleep now, dream tonight)
Death will make you dream past tense
(Sleep now, dream forever)
Your hopes fly high and your life make sense once again
(Sleep now, dream tonight)
