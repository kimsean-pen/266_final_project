One day you'll wake up
run away from my love
There is no way life is fair
Tonight my game is on

One day you'll wake up
run away from my love
There is no way life is fair
Tonight my game is on

Jeremiah, The Denier

Lights will stick up when you shut me off
Lights will stick up when you shut me off
And I'm not gonna fall when you let it go
I'm not gonna fall when you let it go.

Lights will stick up when you shut me off
Lights will stick up when you shut me off
And I'm not gonna fall when you let it go
I'm not gonna fall when you let it go.

You still love some part of me (Ah Ah Ah Ah)
You still love some part of me (Ah Ah Ah Ah)
You're not gonna fall when you let it go
I'm not gonna fall when you let it go.
You're not gonna fall when you let it go
I'm not gonna fall when you let it go.
