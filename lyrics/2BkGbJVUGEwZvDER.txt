I remember the look on your face
It plays on my mind as I lie awake
I heard your voice at the end of a tape
Static flickers and fades away

And I know that I've made my mistakes
But I hope that I see you again
I'll see you in another life
I'll see you in another life
I'll see you in another life

Pain, it comes and goes in waves
The colours have started to fade away
How come, I call and I talk to your friends?
Passing time until it bends and breaks

And I know that I've made my mistakes
But I hope that I see you again
I'll see you in another life
I'll see you in another life
I'll see you in another life

So I guess it's, it's time to say goodbye
I guess it's, it's time to close the door
So I guess it's, it's time to say goodbye
I guess it's, it's time to say goodnight
I'll see you in another life
I'll see you in another life
I'll see you in another life
I'll see you in another life
