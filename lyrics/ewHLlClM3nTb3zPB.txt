Mama told me when I was young
Come sit beside me, my only son
And listen closely to what I say.
Oh if you do this
It will help you some sunny day.

Oh take your time... don't live too fast
Troubles will come and they will pass.
Go find a woman and you'll find love
And don't forget son there is someone up above.

And be a simple kind of man.
And be something you love and understand
Baby, be a simple kind of man.
Won't you do this, If you can?
Forget your lust for rich man's gold

All that you need is in your soul
And you can do this if you try.
All that I want for you my son
Is to be satisfied.
And be a simple kind of man.

And be something you love and understand
Baby, be a simple kind of man.
Won't you do this, for me son.
If you can?
Oh don't you worry... you'll find yourself.
Follow you heart and nothing else.

And you can do this, if you try.
All that I want for you my son
Is to be satisfied.
And be a simple kind of man.
And be something you love and understand

Baby, be a simple kind of man.
Won't you do this, for me son.
If you can?
And be a simple kind of man.
And be something you love and understand
Baby, be a simple kind of man.
Won't you do this, If you can?
And be a simple kind of man.
And be something you love and understand
Baby, be a simple kind of man.
