I see you're moving, I see you're moving
Moving anyhow
You'll pierce your right ear, pierce your heart there
This skinny boy is one of the girls

'Cos around my neck and around her neck
Hangs everything you are
I know you've been inside
But what were you in for?

Animal lover
Animal lover
Animal lover

See you're moving, I see you're moving
Like wildlife from the waist
But when your name's scratched in on a shiny ring
Your waist is my resting place

And around my neck and around her neck
Hangs everything you are
I know you've been inside but what were you in for?
