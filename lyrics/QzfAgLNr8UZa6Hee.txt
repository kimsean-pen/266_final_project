A submission so sweet
A silent pact sealed
And it was in its shade
That i buried myself
Trembling like a thief
Nothing concealed
Not my hideous shame
Not the angst i felt
We are all weeping
'Cause we can't undo the lie
Not with a word
Not with the blink of an eye
We are all weeping
'Caue we can't break away
Not without getting hurt
Not without leading astray
I'll state my case
I won't go down
You've lost your face
Now you're after mine
Are you turning time
Over to lies?
Over to lies
Swear never to frown
Upon the things we left
Behind
Now and again
These walls are shaking
Now and again
These walls are breaking
Now and again
These walls are breaking us in two
We are waving stealthy goodbyes
For we know we have failed you
You would not ever break the ties
Nor the code, now, would you?
I'll rest my case
I won't go down
You've lost your face
Now you're turning on mine
Are you handing time
Over to lies?
Over to lies
Swear never to drown
The things we love
They're all gone
For we left those things behind
Would you embrace
What is left to me?
Ever embrace what is left to be?
Would you embrace
What is left of me now?
