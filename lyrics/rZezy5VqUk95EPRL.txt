I wake up in a strange place
Sounds of Ethiopia
She's wearing the same thing
Every time

I'm so far from home
So far from grown
Keep hearing the same thing

She can't tell
I can't tell her
You wear it well
I know better

Sometimes I need the pain
Keeps me right
And I'm never gonna be the same
How I like

Still living like on the run now
And I'm living like on the run

She can't tell
I can't tell her
You wear it well
I know better

So far from home
So far from grown

She can't tell
I can't tell her
You wear it well
I know better
