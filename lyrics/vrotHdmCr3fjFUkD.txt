ALL BITCHES DIE (BITCHES ALL DIE HERE)

Lingua Ignota

Sinner, you'd better get ready
Oh, sinner, you'd better get ready, hallelujah
Oh, sinner, you'd better get ready
For the time is coming that the sinner must die

I heard a lumbering in the sky
Made me think my time was nigh
Won't be the water, be the fire next time
And time is coming when the sinner must die

Sinner, you'd better get ready
Oh, sinner, you'd better get ready, hallelujah
Oh, sinner, you'd better get ready
For the time is coming that the sinner must die

You can't run
I'll find you
I'll bind your feet to hell
And drag you down
You can't hide
I'll take you
I'll snap your legs in two
And drag you down
Down

I fell down on my bended knee
Begged mercy for my life
Please, my dear, don't kill me here
I'm unprepared to die
I never spoke another word
He dragged me around and round
He beat me till my teeth were scattered
Like pearls across the red, red ground

The final words I ever heard
They shook the burning sky:
"Bitches get what's coming to you
All bitches die
All bitches die
Bitches all die here."
