Keep your things in a place meant to hide
But I know they're there somewhere
And I know
That's where you'll go tonight

I'll be thrown over just like before
The white lady loves you more

Need a metal man just to pick up your feet
It's a long time since you cared enough
For me
To even be discreet

I know what this metal is for
The white lady loves you more

I'm looking at a hand
Full of broken plans
And I'm tired of playing it down
You just want her to do
Anything to you
There ain't nothing that you won't allow

You wake up in the middle of the night
from a dream you won't remember
Flashing on
Like a cop's light

You say she's waiting and I know what for
The white lady loves you more

The white lady...
