How I remember sleepless nights,
when we would read by candlelight,
and on the windowpane outside
a new world made of snow.

A million feathers falling down,
a million stars that touch the ground:
so many secrets to be found
amid the falling snow.

Maybe I am falling down;
tell me, should I touch the ground?
Maybe I won't make a sound
in the darkness all around.

The silence of a winter's night
brings memories I hold inside;
remembering a blue moonlight
upon the fallen snow.

Maybe I am falling down;
tell me, should I touch the ground?
Maybe I won't make a sound
in the darkness all around.

I close my window to the night.
I leave the sky her tears of white,
and all is lit by candlelight
amid the falling snow.

And all is lit by candlelight
amid the falling snow.
