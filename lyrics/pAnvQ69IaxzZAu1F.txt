hideaway,
well they'll seat us in the sun
by the way,
no, you've always been the one
you'll ask your reasons why
what once was yours is mine
my babe is gone

ride away
gonna take me from my man
by the way
no they'll never understand
we'll have a bit of fun
watching everyone
pass us by
you'll ask your reason why
what once was yours is mine
my babe is gone
