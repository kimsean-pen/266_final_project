We shall go on till the end
We shall fight on the seas and oceans

We shall defend our island
Whatever the cost may be
We shall never surrender
History recalls
How great the fall can be

While everybody's sleeping
The boat's put out to sea
Born on the wings of time
It seems the answers
Were so easy to find
Too late the prophets cry

The island's sinking
Let's take to the sky
Called the man a fool
Stripped him off his pride

Everyone was laughing
Up until the day he died
Ooh though the wound went deep
Still he's calling us out of our sleep

My friends, we're not alone
He waits in silence to lead us all home
So you tell me that you find it hard to grow

Well I know, I know, I know
And you tell me that you've many seeds to sow
Well I know, I know, I know

(And was the Holy Lamb of God)
(On England's pleasant pastures seen)
(And did the Countenance Divine)
(Shine forth upon our clouded hills)
Dreamer...
Can you hear what I'm saying
Can you see the parts that I'm playing
Holy Man, Rocker Man, Come on Queenie
Joker Man, Spider Man, Blue Eyed Meanie
So you found your solution
What would be your last contribution
Live it up and rip it up and why so lazy
Give it out and dish it out and let's go crazy, yeah
