I know somethin' about love
You've gotta want it bad
If that guy's got into your blood
Go out and get him

If you want him to be
the very part of you
That makes you want to breathe
Here's the thing to do

Tell him that you're never gonna leave him
Tell him that you're always gonna love him
Tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him right now

I know somethin' about love
You've gotta show it and
Make him see that moon up above
Reach out and get it

If you want him
To make your heart sing out
And if you want him to
Only think of you

Tell him that you're never gonna leave him
Tell him that you're always gonna love him
Tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him right now

Ever since the world began it's been that way
For man and woman were created
To make love their destiny
Then why should true love be so complicated?

I know something about love
You've gotta take it and
Show him what the world is made of
One kiss will prove it
If you want him to be
Always by your side
Take his hand tonight
Swallow your foolish pride and

Tell him that you're never gonna leave him
Tell him that you're always gonna love him
Tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him right now

Tell him that you're never gonna leave him
Tell him that you're always gonna love him
Tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him right now
Tell him that you're never gonna leave him
Tell him that you're always gonna love him
Tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him right now
Tell him that you're never gonna leave him
Tell him that you're always gonna love him
Tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him right now
