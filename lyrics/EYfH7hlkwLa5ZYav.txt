Walkin' around in a daze, out for days now it's been
Talkin' it up as amazin', a maze that I'm in
Look at lonely stars for the answers
But all that I found was silence and dirty ground

If only you could see me now
(If only, if only, if only, if only, if)
If only you could hear me out
(If only, if only, if only, if only, if)
If only it was only me now

Listen just a little bit harder for I always tell the truth
Is it just a piston in an engine that keep you movin'
You're lookin' like you're lookin' for somethin'
And now you're surrounded by silence

If only you could see me now
(If only, if only, if only, if only, if)
If only you could hear me out
(If only, if only, if only, if only, if)
If only it was only me now

In silence, silence, silence
You're surrounded by silence, silence, silence
Yes, you're surrounded by silence, silence, silence
You're surrounded by silence, silence

If only you could see me now
(If only, if only, if only, if only, if)
If only you could hear me out
(If only, if only, if only, if only, if)
If only it was only me now

If only you could see me now
(If only, if only, if only, if only, if)
If only you could hear me out
(If only, if only, if only, if only, if)
If only it was only me now

If only it was only me now
If only it was only me now
