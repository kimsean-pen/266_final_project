Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up
Pick up the phone
You said it yourself you're scared of being alone
You said it yourself that you can crack the code
But the static you hear automatically keeps you exposed on your own
I hope you're ready, steady, smashing through the levy
The drama, the trauma, don't play the prima donna
My God, you said it yourself that you would never stop
Until you felt the needle drop

So now you pack your bags
The party's such a drag
And everyone can tell that you're poisoning the well
But there are no mistakes
Except what you create
You need to know your place

'Cause it's about to get heavy
It's about to be on
Yeah, I'm bangin' slingin' napalm
So nobody move
'Cause I was sent to warn you
The devil's in the next room

The silence, the silence
The blinding ultra violence
Knockin' at your door
Pacin' back and forth
What now?
The whispers and the screams
The stereotypical profiling ritual
Vicious and obscene

So now you pack your bags
The party's such a drag
And everyone can tell that you're poisoning the well
But there are no mistakes
Except what you create
You need to know your place

'Cause it's about to get heavy
It's about to be on
Yeah, I'm bangin' slingin' napalm
So nobody move
'Cause I was sent to warn you
The devil's in the next room

'Cause it's about to get heavy
It's about to be on
Yeah, I'm bangin' slingin' napalm
So nobody move
'Cause I was sent to warn you
The devil's in the next room
(Heavy, heavy, heavy)
Yeah the devil's in the next room
(Heavy, heavy, heavy)
Yeah the devil's in the next room
(Heavy, heavy, heavy)
So nobody move
'Cause I was sent to warn you
The devil's right beside you
