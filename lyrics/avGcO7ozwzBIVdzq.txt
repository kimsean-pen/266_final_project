You ain't like those other girls
There's nothing like you in this world
You got something more than curls
You ain't like those other girls

You ain't like those other guys
There's something different in your eyes
You got something hard to find
You ain't like those other guys

I think I'm always sad
I think I'm always sad
I think I'm always gonna be sad
'Cause you're the best I've ever had

A million miles between us now
Why can't we just work things out?

I think I'm always sad
I think I'm always sad
I think I'm always gonna be sad
'Cause you're the best I've ever had
