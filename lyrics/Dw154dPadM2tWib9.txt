Friday night
And I don't have a clue
Just in the crowds
We're dreaming as we move

I wonder who we are
I wonder who we are tonight

And I know that someone's following me
My littered face on the street
The loveliest season has taken you
Write my name in the leaves

I wonder who we are
I wonder who we are tonight
