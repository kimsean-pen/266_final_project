The reeling
Shivers my mind
I know I should be waiting
This reeling
I'm feeling my lies
Wants me to pay off
Before I die
The feeling
Shivers my mind
I know I should be waiting
The seeling
Is closing my eyes
Someone should wake me before I die
The reeling
Shivers my mind
I know I should be waiting
This reeling
I'm feeling my lies
Wants me to pay off
Before I die
The feeling
Shivers my mind
I know I should be waiting
The seeling
Is closing my eyes
Someone should wake me before I die
Theres something you dont know (die)
Theres something you dont know (die)
Theres something you dont know (die)
Theres something you dont know (die)
The reeling
Shivers my mind
I know I should be waiting
This reeling
I'm feeling my lies
Wants me to pay off before I die
The feeling
Shivers my mind
I know I should be waiting
The seeling is closing to my eyes
Someone should wake me before I die
Before I die, die
Pay off before we die
Pay off before we die
Theres something you dont know
Pay off before we
Pay off before we die
Pay off before we
Pay off before we die
Theres something you dont know
Theres something you dont know
