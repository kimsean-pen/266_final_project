there will be trouble with me
there will be trouble more than these
and i warned you ten times of these things
there ain't nothing short of wisdom
there ain't nothing short of wisdom
in your hot black silk
hot black silk
hot black silk
and there won't be more than one of me
is the only thing i can ever promise you
and i make enough loving for three of me
there ain't nothing short of wisdom
there ain't nothing short of wisdom
in your hot black silk
hot black silk
hot black silk
hot black silk
