I always knew I would one day be here
But I couldn't be a puppet on a string
I've had my fights, often I've been KO'd
But I've got back up, no I won't give in
And now I know how it works
If you're too nice you lose

I'm gonna make it to the top well let me show you
And if I've got to toughen up then that is what I'll do
Don't make me your master baby, you'd be crazy that's for sure
Becoming a bitch is not what I got into music for.

I remember back to a bench in Wales
Where two young boys started mocking me
I looked at them.
Thought I'll show you one day
But I didn't fight or stand up for me.
And that young girl's learn the hard way
If you're too nice you lose.

I'm gonna make it to the top well let me show you
And if I've got to toughen up then that is what I'll do
Don't make me your master baby, you'd be crazy that's for sure
Becoming a bitch is not what I got into music for.

I'll make it crystal clear that I am not going anywhere
As long as there is music, I'll be here.

I'm gonna make it to the top well let me show you
And if I've got to toughen up then that is what I'll do
Don't make me your master baby, you'd be crazy that's for sure
Becoming a bitch is not what I got into music for.

I'm gonna make it to the top well let me show you
And if I've got to toughen up then that is what I'll do
Don't make me your master baby, you'd be crazy that's for sure
Becoming a bitch is not what I got into music for.
