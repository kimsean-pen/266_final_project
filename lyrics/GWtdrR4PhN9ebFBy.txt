The tomb crew bring sugar oil
We'll meet at the mirrored statue
Margaret, my girl, standing on air
That is my name, that is my name

Light the bridges with the lantern
You know something's going to happen
Light the bridges with the lantern
You know something's going to happen

The tomb crew bring sugar oil
We'll meet at the mirrored statue
Margaret, my girl, standing on air
That is my name, that is my name

Light the bridges with the lantern
You know something's going to happen
Light the bridges with the lantern
You know something's going to happen

Light the bridges with the lantern
You know something's going to happen
Light the bridges with the lantern
You know something's going to happen

Tigers in boil
Forgotten works

Light the bridges with the lantern
You know something's going to happen
Light the bridges with the lantern
You know something's going to happen

You know something's going to happen
