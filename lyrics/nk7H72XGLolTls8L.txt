who are you in the dark
with the lights out?
bulletproof question marks
i'm onto you, i'm onto ...

your tell tale heart baby
beating like a drum
pounding out your chest now
repeating on the one
tear the floorboards baby
do it just for fun
because you buried it once
now you're digging it up
and going down with the sun

who's gonna believe you?
one of these nights somebody's gonna leave you
no one's gonna save you come the full moon

who's coming to the rescue?
what if tonight it's running, gonna get you?
no one's gonna save you when you cry wolf

there's a knock at your door
with the lights out
turn the lock, hit the floor
it's onto you, it's onto ...

your tell tale heart baby
beating like a drum
pounding out your chest now
repeating on the one
tear the floorboards baby
do it just for fun
because you buried it once
now you're digging it up
and going down with the sun

who's gonna believe you?
one of these nights somebody's gonna leave you
no one's gonna save you come the full moon

who's coming to the rescue?
what if tonight it's running, gonna get you?
no one's gonna save you when you cry wolf
(woooooolf, wooooooolf)

tear the floorboards baby,
do it just for fun
cause you buried it once, now you're digging it up
digging it up

who's gonna believe you?
one of these nights somebody's gonna leave you
no one's gonna save you come the full moon

who's coming to the rescue?
what if tonight it's running, gonna get you?
no one's gonna save you when you cry wolf
(woooooolf, wooooolf)

no one's gonna save you
no one's gonna save you
no one's gonna save you
