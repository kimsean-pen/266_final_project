Have you seen her?
She's a kaleidoscope
She can show you colors
that no one knows

Why did you run
when I turned your eyes around?
Got a crush on you
What can I do?
I want you to
send me a postcard from the rainbow

Do you want be my special someone?
Can you show me colors
that no one knows?

Why did you run
when I turned your eyes around?
Got a crush on you
What can I do?
I want you to
send me a postcard from the rainbow

From the rainbow
From the rainbow
Ah, from the rainbow
