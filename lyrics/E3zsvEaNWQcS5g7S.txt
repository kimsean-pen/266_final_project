I am not a wolf
I am not the hunter
Though that is the way
That I was made
Going softly now through the caves
Collecting skins and dust
In the darkest place
And in the dark
We arose!
In the dark
We lit up again!
Oh, sun and moon
In the land and in the water
Hunger and then being fulfilled
Are you satisfied?
And in the dark
We arose
And we know not what we do
