The sun has gone away
Gone away
Gone away
Now all is dark
All is dark
All is dark
And wading without name
Without name
Without an outside there is only more the same
More the same
The one that cannot move
Cannot move
Cannot move
Just stays in glue
Have her
Have her
Have her
Colder
Have her
Colder
Have her
Colder
Have her
Colder
