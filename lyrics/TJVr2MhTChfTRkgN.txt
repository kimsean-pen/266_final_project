Do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna fight?
Do you wanna get drunk and stay the night?

No regrets
Noblesse oblige
Do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna fight?
Do you wanna get drunk and stay the night?
Do you wanna smoke till our throats are sore?
Make out and then talk and then make out some more?

Do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna fight?
Do you wanna get drunk and stay the night?
Do you wanna know all the things I do
When I'm all alone and thinking about you?

Do you wanna?
Do you wanna?
Do you wanna?
Do you wanna?
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Do you, do you, do you, do you?

Do you wanna go back home?
Your animals are all alone
Oh, there's a chicken waiting on the stove
And your cousin left his DVD of swinging in the '70s
Or do you wanna go back home
Check your messages and charge your phone?
Oh, are you really sure
You wanna go
When you could
Do it with a rock star?
Do it with a rock star

Wait, wait, wait
I'll be fine in a minute
Wait, wait, wait
I'll be fine in a minute
Fine in a minute

I don't want your body
Just a part to listen to INXS
All the practice in the world
Won't get me good at loneliness-ness
Loneliless-ness
Loneliness-less
Ness-less-ness-less

Do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna fight?
Do you wanna get drunk and stay the night?
Do you wanna see all my cavities?
Talk about the crisis in the Middle East?
Do you wanna get really terrified?
Ice caps are all melting, and we're gonna die
Do you wanna cry?
I can make you cry
Do you wanna hit me, baby, one more time?

Do you wanna?
Do you wanna?
Do you wanna?
Do you wanna?
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Do you wanna go back home?
Your animals are all alone
Oh, there's a chicken waiting on the stove
And your cousin left his DVD of swinging in the '70s
Or do you wanna go back home
Check your messages and charge your phone?
Oh, are you really sure
You wanna go
When you could
Do it with a rock star?
Do it with a rock star

Wait, wait, wait
I'll be fine in a minute
Wait, wait, wait
I'll be fine in a minute

(Do you wanna go back home?)
Wait, wait, wait
I'll be fine in a minute
(Do you wanna go back home?)
Wait wait wait
I'll be fine in a minute
Fine in a minute
Fine in a minute
Fine in a minute
Fine in a minute
Fine in a minute
Fine in a minute
Fine in a minute
Fine in a minute
