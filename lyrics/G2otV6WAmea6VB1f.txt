Here I am just longing for you once again
If your arms would only let me in
...
You'd see the mess I'm in
I have dreamed your heart will come
and rescue me
Oh baby set me free

Only your love can win
You're only a heartbeat away
Baby, and my love
One day will find you
It will remind you
When it can enjoy (will enjoy it)

oh When it comes your way
Here I am my heart in the palm of your hand
Your every wish is my command
...
Darling understand
If I live a lie
...

Then all my dreams are doomed to die
Oh baby just let me try
To have my heart's desire
You're only a heartbeat away
Baby, and my love
One day will find you

It will remind you
When it comes your way oh
When it comes your way
Ooh but my feelings are in vain

Just like feelings they won't go away
...
My love remains
In my heart we'll always stay
...
You're only a heartbeat away

Baby, and my love
One day will find you
It will remind you
When it comes your way oh
When it comes your way
You're always
in my heart to stay baby
Love comes once in a lifetime
I think it's high time
Our hearts beat as one
Our hearts beat as one
...
