You're so sweet
Can't get enough
Kill me with
Your sugar rush

Tell me why
I like the way you get me high
So alive
That you just make me wanna die
Tell me why
Why I still want you to be mine
You're a poison in my mind
Stop my heart and hope to die

Candy coated suicide
(You're my)
Candy coated suicide
(You're my)
Candy coated suicide
(You're my)
Candy coated suicide

You're a lie
That I can trust
Only love
When I'm fucked up

Don't know what's wrong with me
But the temptation is stronger than me

Got me fucked up inside
And you're so sweet that I want to die
