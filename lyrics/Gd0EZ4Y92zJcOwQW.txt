I thought
You were done
But don't
Get caught
In the fog
You'll get lost

Hey I know you're okay
Just feeling away
You'll be fine today
I know you're not alone
This feeling is so
So unbearable

I've been thinking
About us how
We're not level
I'm upside down
So
Baby nobody can make me feel the same I got you in my brain
I think I found something special but now, I don't know how

Oh so you're not around
It's just on me now
Don't stress on me now

Hey, I know you're okay
Just feeling away
You'll be fine today
I know you're not alone
This feeling is so
So unbearable

I've been thinking
About us how
We're not level
I'm upside down
So
Baby nobody can make me feel the same I got you in my brain
