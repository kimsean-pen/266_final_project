Tall and tan and young and handsome
The Boy From Ipanema goes walking
And when he passes
Each girl he passes goes ah

When he walks, he's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gently
That when he passes
Each girl he passes goes, ah

Oh but I watch him so sadly
How can I tell him I love him
Yes I would give his heart gladly
But each day when he walks to the sea
He looks straight ahead not at me

Tall and tan and young and handsome
The Boy From Ipanema goes walking
And when he passes I smile
But he doesn't see

Oh but I watch him so sadly
How can I tell him I love him
Yes I would give heart gladly
But each day when he walks to the sea
He looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall and tan and young and handsome
The Boy From Ipanema goes walking
And when he passes I smile
But he doesn't see, he doesn't see me, he doesn't see
