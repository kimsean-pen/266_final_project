Nega
You spent so blissfully
The last few days with me
Nega
I spent so nicely too
The last few days with you
When I met you, it was so fine
I didn't talk a lot to you
I only mentioned your smooth hair
You made a speech about shampoo
We took many, many, many photographs
Downtown
As we passed through
Nega
You spent so blissfully
The last few days with me
Nega
I spent so nicely too
The last few days with you
You've been going just where I've gone
All my people you have seen
I've been doing just what you've done
Now I can dig your cup of mu tea
We let our moments become, become
What they really had to be
Nega
You spent so blissfully
The last few days with me
Nega
I spent so nicely too
The last few days with you
Develop our photographs
As simple dreams that will come true
Perhaps they will make you laugh
Or make you sure about we two
Develop, baby, our photographs
Perhaps they will make you sure
Perhaps they will show you nothing
Nothing, but a shade of blue
