I can hear my train comin'
It's a lonesome and distant cry
I can hear my train comin'
Now I'm runnin' for my life

What makes a man
Walk away from his mind?
I think I know
I think I might know

I can feel the wind blowin'
It's sending shivers down my spine
I can feel the wind blowin'
Shakes the trees and the power lines

What makes a man
Spend his whole life in disguise?
I think I know
Think I might know

(What makes a man?)
I think I might know
(What makes a man?)
I think I might know, know
(What makes a man?)

I can see the sun settin'
It's casting shadows on the sea
I can see the sun, it's setting
It's getting colder, starting to freeze

What makes a man
Want to break a heart with ease?
I think I know
Think I might know

(What makes a man?)
I think I might know
(What makes a man?)
I think I might know, ohh
(What makes a man?)

I can hear my train comin'
Looks like time is on my side
I can hear my train comin'
I'm still runnin' for my life

What makes a man pray
When he's about to die?
I think I know
I think I might know

(What makes a man?)
Think I might know
(What makes a man?)
I think I might know, ohh
(What makes a man?)

(What makes a man?)
Think I might know
(What makes a man?)
I think I might know, ohh
(What makes a man?)
