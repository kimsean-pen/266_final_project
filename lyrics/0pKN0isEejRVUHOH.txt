Altars to ashes
Burn down my churches
And give up what's holy
To live off your mercy

Joining the forces
Summon the powers
Wreck me to pieces

Cause you know I would die if I won't live
Push me down to my knees
And take me where the dark things are

Where the dark things are
Where the dark things are
Where the dark things are

Black is the magic
White is the night sky
Please let me have it
Worship you all night

Ruin and ravage
Make me your priestess
Wreck me to pieces

Cause you know I would die if I won't live
Push me down to my knees
And take me where the dark things are

Where the dark things are
Where the dark things are!
Where the dark things are
Where the dark things are
