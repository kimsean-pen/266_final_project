In the light of what's become
Daily incidents to some
We've decided time is nigh for action
Once the earth has lost its grip
We had to opt for full blown leadership

Prepare for takeoff
Into the unknown
We're on our own

Headed for outer space
Saving the human space from dying
At least we keep trying 'till we're gone

And as we leave our galaxy
We will search for certainty
Other worlds resembling ours
Illuminating journey through the stars

Head on, star men
Survival we seek
Our greatest plan

Aiming at outer space
Saving the human race from dying
At least we keep trying to become
Citizens of the stars
Earth will be but memoirs we treasure
If we get there
In time
