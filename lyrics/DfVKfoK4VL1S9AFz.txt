You gotta be honest
You gotta be guarded
Sure I'm gonna say
Right on the inside, that is the hardest, the hardest game to play.
You sorted it all out and managed to slip through the night into the day.
Life and the soul do you ever get lonely?
I'm goin' take you on.

Found the way to understand the things to understand the things I'm learning.
Found the way to understand the time your burning.
Found the way to understand the things I'm learning.
Found the way to understand the time you're burning.

You gotta be honest
You gotta be guarded
Sure I'm gonna say.
