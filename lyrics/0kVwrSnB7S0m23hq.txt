I won't make you pull out
Getting it all tonight
(All that I want)
I just wanna go down
In history how you like
(Wanna be the one)

As the one who makes you comfortable
'Cause your lips, they got me feeling very vulnerable
(The way that you speak to me, freak with me
Gives me a rise)

(And I think we're)
In too deep
Don't wanna pull out
(And I think we're)
In too deep
Don't wanna pull out

Don't you, baby, pull out
We're right where we're supposed to be
I just wanna go down
Give you what you want, completely
And I just wanna be clear
We're doing right, what we're doing works
(Feels like I'm almost there, oh yeah)
The way that you speak to me, freak with me
Gives me a rise

I think we're
(In too deep)
(Don't wanna pull out)
I think we're
(In too deep)
(Don't wanna pull out)

Oh no
Oh yeah
Ah-ha
Oh yeah
Woah-oo yeah yeah
Oh I wanna know
Ooooh
Yeah
