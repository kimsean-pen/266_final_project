A part of me died last night
I lost my innocence to your ignorance
You said it would be alright
Then you took my breath away, checked into a dark daze
A part of me died last night
No more fairytales pretending, no more happy endings
I wanna hide from the limelight
I am a shadow play, I just want to run away

Death
You could be my little black death
You could be my little black death
You could be my little black death
You could be my little black death

A part of me died last night
You killed my faith in romance, no more second chances
I wanna bathe in the tealight
To erase the memory of your humanity

Death
You could be my little black death
You could be my little black death
You could be my little black death
You could be my little black death

Now it's over, no more feeling
Nothing left to believe in
Now it's over, no more feeling
Nothing left to believe in
Now it's over, no more feeling
Nothing left to believe in
Now it's over, no more feeling
Nothing left

Now it's over, no more feeling
Nothing left to believe in
Now it's over, no more feeling
Nothing left to believe in
Now it's over, no more feeling
Nothing left to believe in
Now it's over, no more feeling
Nothing left

Death
You could be my little black death
You could be my little black death
You could be my little black death
You could be my little black death

Death
(Now it's over, no more feeling)
(Nothing left)
You could be my little black death
(Now it's over, no more feeling)
(Nothing left)
You could be my little black death
(Now it's over, no more feeling)
You could be my little black death
(Now it's over, no more feeling)
You could be my little black death
