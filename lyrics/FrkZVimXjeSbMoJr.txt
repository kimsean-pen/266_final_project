I have a ringing in my head
And no one to help me answer it
Even with you close enough to kiss
Every minute is arranged
Every moment lasts a day
But thinking about it can't help me let go
I know

Talk, talking a lot
But it's still talk
Gotta love how it's somehow all on me
All the petty scenes
And all the pretty things
Say whatever you want
'Cause I can laugh it off
Heh heh heh, heh heh
I can laugh it off
Heh heh heh, heh heh

I must look like I'm running away
To you at your faster pace
I wonder what it is you could have seen
In me

I'm the evil one who said
Gonna let everything just happen
Just like my chest, my ears are proud
The collision is such an ugly sound

I can hear you now

Talk, talking a lot
But it's still talk
Gotta love how it's somehow all on me
All the petty scenes
And all the pretty things
Say whatever you want
'Cause I can laugh it off

Talk, talking a lot
But it's still talk
Gotta love how it's somehow all on me
And all the placings
And all the pretty things
Say whatever you want
'Cause I can laugh it off
Heh heh heh, heh heh
I can laugh it off
Heh heh heh, heh heh

Heh heh heh, heh heh
Heh heh heh, heh heh
I can hear you now

Talk, talking a lot
But it's still talk
Gotta love how it's somehow all on me
All the petty scenes
And all the pretty things
Say whatever you want
'Cause I can laugh it off

Talk, talking a lot
But it's still talk
Gotta love how it's somehow all on me
All the petty scenes
And all the pretty things
Say whatever you want
'Cause I can laugh it off
