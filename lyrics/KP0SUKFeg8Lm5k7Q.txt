A tear fell from my face
And found the softest place to land
And I awoke and now
I understand

And in this circle of life
Lived through it many times
It's just the end, it is
The end, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah...

I'll turn this thing around
I'll turn it upside down
I'll turn it into sounds to sing
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah...
