Take today's pain away
Leave behind the feelings that I can't face
Wake up wishing for a better way
Wake up wishing for a better way

I wrapped my brain up in cellophane
My thoughts displayed
So I cut out the grey
It starts the same, but I'll take the blame
Gave my thoughts away
Save myself for a better day

Waste away
Wasted days

Better way
Better days

I've been pacing, losing my patience
Beaten, broken, picking up pieces
Losing feelings that I can't face

I wrapped my brain up in cellophane
My thoughts displayed
So I cut out the grey
It starts the same, but I'll take the blame
Gave my thoughts away
Save myself for a better day

Take today's
Pain away

(The feelings that I can't face)
Wake up wishing for a better way

I wrapped my brain up in cellophane
My thoughts displayed
So I cut out the grey
It starts the same, but I'll take the blame
Gave my thoughts away
Save myself for a better day
