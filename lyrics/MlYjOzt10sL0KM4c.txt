Thats all I need, to sit in the sun
Theres something here, that makes me run,
Its all in my head, or is it you instead,
were not enemies, but we dont have to get along,

CHORUS
and I dont want to listen,
Unless you Speak From your Heart,
Unless you speak from you heart
Unless you Speak from your heart

You can be Meek, You gotta prove what you can
dont want to hear, cos you will face yourself
we are not enemies, but we dont have to get along

Chorus x2
