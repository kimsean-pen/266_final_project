With her empty eyes
and her skin as a disguise
walks upon the water
The surface won't hold her.
And no one will catch her
No one will even dare
to take her by her hand
her poisonous fingers
She dives down
and the further she gets
The more her sense of alienation is dragged out of her core.
From the wandering shadows on shore,
from the faceless beings,
from delusion, from nothing to grasp,
from her repulsive shell,
she is swimming further down,
towards the black deep.
But beyond the abyss she'll never go,
now trapped in this infinite space.
Climb out, Aurelia where no one can see you. From the hurrying ghosts above sea,
from the faceless beings,
from the traitor that lived in her veins,
from her repulsive shell she is swimming further down,
towards the black deep.
But beyond the abyss she'll never go,
now trapped in this infinite space.
Climb out, Aurelia, where no one can see you.
