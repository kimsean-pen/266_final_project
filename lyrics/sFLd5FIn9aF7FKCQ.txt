Do you remember all those nights
When we stood side by side
And we said we'll save the goodbyes
The night is young
We still have time

In my dreams I see it ending
I see, I see the sky descending
But I'll let the seconds
Rip in on my heart
Cause in my dreams, I fear of falling
When I hear the darkness calling
Don't wake me up until the morning's night
Cause I've never felt more alive

Do you remember all those nights
When we stood side by side
And we said we'll save the goodbyes
The night is young

Well I never, never, never wanna press rewind
Every mistake that led us here
I wouldn't change for anything
I wouldn't change for anything
I wouldn't change for anything

Stand up
There is a world that sits between us and them
See, this was never about giving up, just giving in
Because you only live once
But you spend your whole life dying
So when it all comes crashing
Know you're not alone

You only live once
But you spend your whole life dying
So when it all comes crashing
Know you're not alone

You're not alone...

You only live once
But you spend your whole life dying
So when it all comes crashing
Know you're not alone

Alone, alone, alone!

We welcome death with all our sins
There is no fear when this life ends
We welcome death with all our sins
There is no fear when this life ends
We welcome death with all our sins
There is no fear

There is no fear!

Do you remember?
Do you remember?

Do you remember all those nights
When we stood side by side
And we said we'll save the goodbyes
The night is young

Do you remember all those nights
When we stood side by side
And we said we'll save the goodbyes
The night is young
We still have time

Cause I've never felt more alive
I've never felt more alive

Alive, alive, alive!
