I could never have what you have.
I could never have what you have.

Something
Got me
So tired
Frozen
Inside
Heart was
Pounding
'cause I knew that

I could never have what you have.
I could never have what you have.

I'll be the thief,
Boy.
Whisper to me,
Please.

'Cause I could never have what you have.
I could never have what you have.

Days been
Going
So fast
Trying
To keep
Up now
Tell me
Why you fly.

I could never have what you have.

I'll be the thief,
Boy.
Whisper to me,
Now.

I could never have what you have.
I could never have what you have.
