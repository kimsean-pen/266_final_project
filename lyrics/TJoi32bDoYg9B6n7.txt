She was lost in so many different ways
Out in the darkness with no guide
I know the cost of a losing hand
Ever for the grace of God, go I
I found heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then, I hear this voice inside...
Ave Maria
Sometimes love can come and pass you by
While you're busy making plans
Suddenly hit you, and then you realize
It's out of your hands...
Baby, you've got to understand
You are my heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then, I hear this voice inside...
Ave Maria
Ave Maria
