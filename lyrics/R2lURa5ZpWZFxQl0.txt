The party's over call it a night
I hope you had the time of your life
They say that Rock will never survive
It's up to youth to keep her alive
And I don't know whats making you tick
Generation Narcissistic
Little Miss South and lonely boy Slick
It's time you got a brand new fix baby

Louder, Louder, Louder than the DJ.
Louder, Louder, Louder than the DJ.
Faster, Faster, Faster than the Air Waves.
Louder, Louder, Louder than the DJ.
Louder than the DJ!
Louder than the DJ!

We surfed until the end of the set
Our leather jackets covered in sweat
Those glory days, they ain't over yet
So light that torch and burn like a jet
Cause revolution starts on the mic
Strike three chords that cut like a knife
Radio needs a shot to the vein
Of Anger, Fury, Heartache, and Pain baby

Louder, Louder, Louder than the DJ.
Louder, Louder, Louder than the DJ.
Faster, Faster, Faster than the Air Waves.
Louder, Louder, Louder than the DJ.

Someone said a long time ago
Rock and Roll will never grow old
She's still got the fire left in her bones
The lights go down, the crowd explodes

Louder than the DJ!
Louder than the DJ!
Louder than the DJ!
Louder than the DJ!

Louder than the DJ!
Louder than the DJ!
Louder than the DJ!
Louder than the DJ!

Someone said a long time ago
Rock and Roll will never grow old
Shes still got the fire left in her bones
And we're not gonna pack up and go cause we're

Louder, Louder, Louder than the DJ.
Louder, Louder, Louder than the DJ.
Louder, Louder, Louder than the DJ.
She'll be back some day I know baby

Louder, Louder, Louder than the DJ.
Louder, Louder, Louder than the DJ.
Faster, Faster, Faster than the Air Waves.
Louder, Louder, Louder than the DJ.

Someone said a long time ago
Rock and Roll will never grow old
Shes still got the fire left in her bones
The lights go down, the crowd explodes

(Your momma's new car is)
Louder than the DJ!
(And Ian's guitar is)
Louder than the DJ!
(The babe at the bar is)
Louder than the DJ!
(Gonna change who you are)
Louder than the DJ!!
