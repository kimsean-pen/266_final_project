What you can't see can't hurt you they say
But I've been blind too many times before
Never see it coming your way
Shadows and secrets hide

Gimme the bright lights of the dance floor
To shine inside this broken heart of mine
The way you're moving, forgetting all the ghosts in the mind
Just say you're mine and stay by my side

Don't say you're leaving
Don't turn out the lights
I'll scream, I'll scream, I'll scream!

Don't let the darkness come and hold me
I need someone 'cause I can't be lonely tonight
Come on baby, come and take me in your arms
I'll never be scared of the dark

And when the shadows creep up on me
If I shiver keep your body close to mine
Come on baby, come and take me in your arms
I'll never be scared of the dark

I'm the kind who's always falling
Into trouble and into paradise
I don't love by half, I'm all in
I wanna be yours
Just say you're mine and stay by my side

Don't say you're leaving
Don't turn out the lights
I'll scream, I'll scream, I'll scream!

Don't let the darkness come and hold me
I need someone 'cause I can't be lonely tonight
Come on baby, come and take me in your arms
I'll never be scared of the dark

And when the shadows creep up on me
If I shiver, keep your body close to mine
Come on baby, come and take me in your arms
I'll never be scared of the dark

Never be scared of the dark
Never be scared of the dark
Come on baby, come and take me in your arms

I'll never be scared of the dark

In your arms
In your arms
In your arms
In your arms
In your arms
In your arms
In your arms

I'll never be scared of the dark

Don't let the darkness come and hold me (AAAH AAAH!)
I need someone 'cause I can't be lonely tonight (AAAH AAAH!)
Come baby, come and take me in your arms (OOOH Arms!)
I'll never be scared of the dark

And when the shadows creep up on me (AAAH AAAH AAAH!)
If I shiver, keep your body close to mine (Close to mine!)
Come on baby, come and take me in your arms (In your arms!)
I'll never be scared of the dark
