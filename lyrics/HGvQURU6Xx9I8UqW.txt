Hey, mister, where you headed?
Are you in a hurry?
Need a lift to happy hour
Say, "oh, no"
Do you brake for distilled spirits?
I need a break as well
The well that inebriates the guilt
One, two, one, two, three, four

Cold turkey's getting stale
Tonight I'm eating crow
Fermented salmonella, poison ooh, no
There's a drought at the fountain of youth
And now I'm dehydrating
My tongue is swelling up
I say, one, two, one, two, three, four

Troubled times, you know I cannot lie
I'm off the wagon and I'm hitchin' a ride

There's a drought at the fountain of youth
And now I'm dehydrating
My tongue is swelling up, I say...
Shit!

Troubled times, you know I cannot lie
I'm off the wagon and I'm hitchin' a ride

(Don't know where to go) hitchin' a ride
(Don't know where to go) hitchin' a ride
(Don't know where to go) hitchin' a ride
(Don't know where to go) hitchin' a ride
(Don't know where to go) hitchin' a ride
(Don't know where to go) hitchin' a ride
(Don't know where to go) hitchin' a ride
(Don't know where to go) hitchin' a ride
Say birthday boys, hey!
