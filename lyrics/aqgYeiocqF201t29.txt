It bleeds!

It breathes!
What stands before us, is not a machine

It breathes, it will bleed and it will dream!

Its body is covered in hundreds of wires
and a mouth that attempts to speak

It attempts to lie
Only murmurs

Collapse from its jaws
And a world, a world without

A world without you

But I rise
The dead will pride
It breathes

Beyond this life
So sleep

Sleep among us
Hesitate no more

En... tomb-men... of-a-ma... chine We kneel and we plead for no
Mourning ahead of us

With only delayed movements

From its figure

We all begin to strain

Entombment of a machine
Entombment of a machine
What stands before us is not a machine
What stands before us is not a machine
My legs weaken at the site of this damaged program
This program kept you breathing
It kept you alive
These circuits diffused once more
Its body is covered in hundreds of wires
Only murmurs collapse
From its scream
Entombment of a Machine
But I saw it die
But I saw it die
But I saw it dead
But I saw it die
I saw it die
I watched it die!
