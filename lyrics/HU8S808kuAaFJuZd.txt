The air is close,
The dark is closer
Windows sun out the light
What bleeds through illuminates nothing
I don't know how long it's been
Time passes by and pays me no mind
My bones are crawling inside my flesh
I'm made of the snakes that hate the sun
Extend your hand, I won't take it
Extend your hand, I will cut it off
The world seeps in through the cracks as distant laughter
A spreading plaque of joyful corpses
Warmth, wealth, and love lay outside these walls
I am all I need, alone with my enemy
