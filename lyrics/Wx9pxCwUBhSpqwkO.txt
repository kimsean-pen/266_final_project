Out of the box, out of the kitchen
Out of the world she's grown so fearful of
So fearful of

I don't ever want to see you again
I don't ever want to see you again
I don't ever want to see you again
I don't ever want to see you again my friend
This is the end

Out of the house, she grabs the keys
Runs for the hills and doesn't leave a letter
That way the impact will be much better
Away from the man that she's grown so fearful of
So fearful of

I don't ever want to see you again
I don't ever want to see you again
I don't ever want to see you again
I don't ever want to see you again

Why do I wear sunglasses in the home
When the sun went down about an hour ago?
Why do why I wear sunglasses in the home
When the sun went down about an hour ago?
Life should not be that way

Always up or down, never down and out
You dream of demons while you sleep
They'll make you stutter when you speak

Always up or down, never down and out
Dream of demons while you sleep
They'll make you stutter when you speak
Speak now or forever hold your peace in pieces

Now that I'm grown
I've seen marriages fall to pieces
Now that I'm grown
I've seen friendships fall to pieces

Weekend warriors and our best friends
The writers weren't kidding
About how all good things must end

Then again some things
Then again some things are far too good
Some things are far too good to go ahead and let go

Always up or down, never down and out
Dream of demons while you sleep
They'll make you stutter when you speak

Always up or down, never down and out
Dream of demons while you sleep
They'll make you stutter when you speak
Speak now or forever hold your peace

We won't forget Tony or Johnny oh oh
No matter how they miss us
They still wish us the best on the road

Garrett took a plane to Paris, France
Now he's cookin' up entrees for the pretty, pretty French girls
Bookends, Blue and Clarity to The Wall and Grace
Dark side, Wish and a toast to late figure eights

Weekend warriors and our best friends
The writers weren't kidding
But the good things will live in our hearts

Always up or down, never down and out
Dream of demons while you sleep
They'll make you stutter when you speak

Always up or down, never down and out
Dream of demons while you sleep
(Never down and out)
That make you stutter when you speak

Always up or down, never down and out
Dream of demons while you sleep
(Never down and out)
They'll make you stutter when you speak

Always up or down, never down and out
Dream of demons while you sleep
They'll make you stutter when you speak
Speak now or forever hold your peace in pieces
