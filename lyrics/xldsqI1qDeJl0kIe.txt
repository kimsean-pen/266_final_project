Do not use the past as an alibi
For all of your deficiencies always standing by
Face your negligence, do not fool yourself
Shortcomings will soon appear
For weakness shows itself

Blind from your success and all of the excess
Deaf from the praise you had

Don't cry out of self pity in forcing your way through
For I will not be vulnerable to slander made by you

Blind from your success and all of the excess
Deaf from the praise you had

In a misty veil, misplaced
Where castles in the air will be no longer seen
As something out of reach
In time the dream will be erased
So many things will never be
The way they seemed
And pride will have it's fall at last

Her eyes fell
While the shame was written on her face
When she realised that her failures
Could never, could never be undone again

You did not notice the manipulated hand
That overshadowed your thoughts all those years
That made you insecure
You did not notice the ancient shifting sand
That pulls you down into an everlasting sham
You will never be able to fight
Never be able to hide
Run for a fall, you'd better run

Blind from your success and all of the excess
Deaf from the praise you had

Oh, in a misty veil, misplaced
Where castles in the air will be no longer seen
As something out of reach
In time the dream will be erased
So many things will never be
The way they seemed
And pride will have it's fall at last
