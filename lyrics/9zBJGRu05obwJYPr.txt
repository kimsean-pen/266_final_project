Brighter days, whiter painted graves under Idaho sky
Set to roadside attraction prayer traveling where the trains will?
Burning books, to Gainesville
One turning, looks in semicircles, lies
A little decency and time to kill?
Bluebird on a branch, unpromised land
Dormhouse sighs, the avalanche of sadness of untied strange commands
As symbols on their hands, now stored on foreheads
How concerned with unsubstantial terms and turns of circumstance

Before the day is done
My prince is gonna come
My prince is gonna come
Before the day is done

Ye winged seraphs fly, bear the news with loud and joyful cry
Boys with nothing left to lose?
Bridal shoes a birthright, child of the Ephraimites!
Not quite prepared to speak right
Or sleep well with how well we sleep at night?
Bluebird outside door mating rights secured
Lambs with best attempts to keep themselves warm
A toast to all we're meant for

Brighter days, whiter painted graves under Idaho sky
Withhold details of West Virginia highwayside

Before the day is done
My prince is gonna come
My prince is gonna come
Before the day is done

Fire and a flood
There's power in the blood of every little lamb, wonderworking power
Fire and a flood
There's power in the blood of wonderworking power, wonderworking power
Fire and a flood
There's power in the blood of every little lamb, wonderworking power
Fire and a flood
There's power in the blood of wonderworking power, wonderworking power
Fire and a flood
There's power in the blood of every little lamb, wonderworking power
Fire and a flood
There's power in the blood of Wonderworking power, wonderworking power
