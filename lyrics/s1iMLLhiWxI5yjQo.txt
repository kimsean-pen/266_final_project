On the edge, a windowsill
Ponders his maker, ponders his will
To the street below, he just ain't nothin'
But he's got a great view, and he sinks a needle deep
Oh, can't touch the bottom... in too deep, yeah
Oh, can't touch the bottom
Oh, on the edge of a know-nothing town
Feeling quite superior, the aged had come

To the sky above he just ain't nothin'
But he's got a great view, and he sinks a burning knife deep, yeah
Can't touch the bottom... in too deep, yeah

Uh-huh, can't touch the bottom... in too deep
(Guitar)
On the edge of a Christmas clean love
Young virgin down from Heaven, oh, visiting hell
To the man above her, she just ain't nothing
But she doesn't like the view, she doesn't like the view, she doesn't like the view
But he sinks himself deep
Oh, can't touch the bottom... in too deep, hey

Whoa, can't touch the bottom, can't touch the bottom
Deep, yeah
Can't, oh, touch the bottom (Repeat)
