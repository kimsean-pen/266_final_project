Fearless we can talk
Hopeless girl still walk
Seventeen like high
This is heavy sleepless times
Let us dance into the night
Let us speak until we shout
Kids facing windows from outside
This beat is leaving us this sound
Silence is your call
You can play and fall
Hundred times around

Envy chances to rewind
Hundred times around
Envy chances to rewind
Get your feet back on the ground
We can leave it all behind
This dance will keep us cold
This dance will let you know
It's all in your mind
Take your chance and turn around
It's all in your mind
Take your chances
Turn around
