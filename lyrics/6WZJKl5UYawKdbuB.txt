"Creator of life, guardian of the dead
Goddess of battle and war
All of yee watch me, my sword by my side
Proudly I sit on my horse

And I wait for the sign in the sky to appear
telling me that the moment has come
For me to ride beyond the edge of this world
into the realms where the shadows are strong

Gods of thunder of wind and of rain
Valkyries my soul is yours should I fail
Let my beheaded and battered corps lay
And take me where you bring all nordsmen slain

Gods of thunder of wind and of rain
Hugin and Munin my eyes in the sky
Heart of mine thrown in the pit of the snake
I will not need no heart where I go should I die

Realms of the shadows bring me no fear
I may stand or be beaten and torn
The mountains will stand, but the life of a man
was decided long before he was born

Leaving the plains where my ancestors hunted
for meat and for hides against the cold
Here the fire was tamed, here our swords were made
And here the elders amazing tales told

I ride into land few have seen or returned from
to tell of its bleakness and dark
I see nothing but mist and the mountains so tall
I can't tell them and the sky apart

Gods of thunder of wind and of rain
Valkyries my soul is yours should I fail
Let my beheaded and battered corps lay
And take me where you bring all nordsmen slain

Gods of thunder of wind and of rain
Hugin and Munin my eyes in the sky
Heart of mine thrown in the pit of the snake
I will not need no heart where I go should I die

Realms of the shadows bring me no fear
I may stand or be beaten and torn
The mountains will stand, but the life of a man
was decided long before he was born

Gods of thunder of wind and of rain
Valkyries my soul is yours should I fail
Let my beheaded and battered corps lay
And take me where you bring all nordsmen slain

Gods of thunder of wind and of rain
Hugin and Munin my eyes in the sky
Heart of mine thrown in the pit of the snake
I will not need no heart where I go should I die"
