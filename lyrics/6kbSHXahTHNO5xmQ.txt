I could almost hear the rhythm section
Kick in as the sun began to blaze
I saw you walk across the plaza
Figured I'd just play it like it lays

I think I'm gonna be real sick again
I think it's gonna happen real soon
And I know I can't afford another night here in this place
With its sixteenth floor view of the ocean and the dunes

And it's gonna be just you and me today
Waiting for the other shoe to drop in Tampa Bay

I can hear the roar of the crowd
In the stadium a couple of blocks away
It's the kind of thing that used to get me all worked up
But I don't want to talk about it now, okay, okay?

Okay

I just want to get this whole thing over with
I don't want to deal with it anymore
I hear the cogs all slipping at the same time
And then I see you walk in through the door

And it's gonna be just you and me today
Waiting for the other shoe to drop in Tampa Bay
