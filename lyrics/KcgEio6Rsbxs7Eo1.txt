Don't look so sad
I know it's over
But life goes on
And this world keeps on turning, yeah

Let's just be glad
We have this time to spend together
There is no need
To watch the bridges that we're burning

Lay your head...(Lay your head)

on my pillow... sweet baby
Hold your warm (and tender body) and tender body

close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops

Blowin' softly against my window
oh, late at night
(Make believe)...make believe you love me (make believe) One more time
For the good times
For the good times

I'll get along
And I'm sure you'll find another
But baby, please remember
I'll be here...(i'll be here)
I'm gonna stay right here
And if you should ever find you need me, yeah
Don't say a word about tomorrow
Ahh, forever and ever and ever and ever
There'll be time enough for severance, when you leave me
ehehehehe...
For the good times, oh yeah...
For the good times
Lay your head...(Lay your head)
on my pillow
oh, this is one time girl (one time...)
Hold your warm (and tender body) and tender body
close to mine... ehehehehe...
Oh baby, won't you
hear that whisper... hear that whisper
of the raindrops... of the raindrops
Blowin' softly... softly...
against my window
All ya gotta do is (make believe), all ya gotta do is
Make believe you love me...(make believe)
One more time, for me baby
For the good times... (hey baby)
For the good times
And here's what you ought to do
Lay your head on my pillow
I just wanna
(hold your warm)...hold your warm... hold your warm
(and tender body)...and tender body
(close to mine)...close to mine
