When I read your face, it's like a screen door
I can see right through your heart's window
Why you gotta treat me like the bimbo
Who sticks it out when you don't care any more

You make it so easy
You're sweet like a Reese's Pieces
But I promise, if you leave me
You'll be crawling on your knees
So if you go, it's a joke

If you drive away
Hope you get a flat tire, get stranded
If it's goodbye today
Know you're leaving here empty-handed
'Cause I've got my own life and
You're just a punch line
If you go, you're a joke
But I forgot to laugh

You don't like it when I check your iPhone
I don't even get my own ringtone
When you're heading out with all your best bros
You don't wanna tell me where you guys go

You say that I'm needy
Like a kid needs Reese's Pieces
But I promise, if you leave me
You'll be running back to me at my door
What a joke

If you drive away
Hope you get a flat tire, get stranded
If it's goodbye today
Know you're leaving here empty-handed
'Cause I've got my own life and
You're just a punch line
If you go, you're a joke
But I forgot to laugh

So if you're saying "peace" like you're so over me trying
To sting like a bee, then I gotta laugh
You're more like a ducky or a cute little bunny
Think that you're funny, I forgot to laugh
Laugh...

Like a diamond in a mountain of coal
I'm the girl that guys can't find anymore
Hey, yeah!

If you drive away
Hope you get a flat tire, get stranded
If it's goodbye today
Know you're leaving here empty-handed
'Cause I've got my own life and
You're just a punch line
If you go, you're a joke
But I forgot to laugh

If you drive away
Hope you get a flat tire, get stranded
If it's goodbye today
Know you're leaving here empty-handed
'Cause I've got my own life and
You're just a punch line
If you go, you're a joke
But I forgot to laugh
