Midnight
I must say it
All those lights, they call my name
My world isn't pretty
I've seen he best of it
I've got the best of you
Pick me up, Pick me up
Pick me up, Pick me up
Help me back on my feet
Pick me up, Pick me up
Pick me up, Pick me up
It feels like
I can see Something New
Do you feel that too?
I'm looking for something new
I don't know what
I'm looking for
But I'm looking for something
For something
For something
I felt everything
I ever gonna feel
Don't know where
I've been
All those streets looks wrong
Don't know where
I belong
Pick me up, Pick me up
Pick me up, Pick me up
Help me back on my feet
Pick me up, Pick me up
Pick me up, Pick me up it feels like
I can see
Something New
Do you feel that too?
I'm looking for something new
I don't know what
I'm looking for
But I'm looking for something
For something
For something
Do you feel that too?
I'm looking for something
But i'm looking for something
Something new
Do you feel that too?
But I'm looking for something
For something
For something
For something
For something
I've never knew
