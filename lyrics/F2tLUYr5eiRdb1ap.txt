Fuck you

You took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You bled me dry and went, like leeches
Go, you've got what you came for, now leave, like vultures

Ripped apart in minutes what we built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back may as well as disappear
For as long as I remember you sold everything you own
But now you've sold our friendship, you're on your fucking own

Sleep with one eye open because
Sleep with one eye open because

If I had it my way I'd slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt
All this regret, that's me

I'm inside of you
I'm inside of you
I'm inside of you
I'm inside of you

And this is your world fucking falling apart mate from the inside out
Everything will fall apart at your feet
You've got hell to pay
Yeah, you've got hell to pay and you better fuckin bow

Bow down to me
You better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees
And cry me a fucking river

Sleep with one eye open because
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt
