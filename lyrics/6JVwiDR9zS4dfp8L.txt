All my life I had this funny little feeling
It came and went time and again with all my daily demons
Call it a deficit, an emptiness inside
Why is true love hard to find? Why does true love hide?

But now I found you and I know that we will be
So very happy, if you could only see
That I was made for you and you were made for me

The road in front of us is long and it is wide
We've got beginner's luck, we've got it on our side
If you are willing, well, I think I'm qualified
And with beginner's luck we've gotta take the ride

I've got a plan, you know, I've got it all worked out
And all you've got to do is pack your bags and check your doubts
You come around and you will see just what I am
A true love through the worst of times, a true love til the end

So now you've found me and you only gotta see
How complementary we can really be
'Cause I was made for you and you were made for me

The road in front of us is long and it is wide
We've got beginner's luck, we've got it on our side
We will be stronger if our forces are allied
And with beginner's luck we've gotta take the ride

We'll take the ride as far as anyone can go
We'll brave it all, yeah, hand-in-hand and toe-to-toe
I've got it all worked out, don't worry 'bout a thing
Just give your hand to me and here, put on this ring

The road in front of us is long and it is wide
We've got beginner's luck, we've got it on our side
If you are willing, well, I think I'm qualified
And with beginner's luck we've gotta take the ride
