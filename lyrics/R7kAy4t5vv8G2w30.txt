When the waves start crashing in
And your heart is black as sin
And when you feel the water rise
And you're about to drown

Can't take all the pressure
Gasping for a breath
You're thrashing arms begin to tire
Don't close your eyes
We'll make it out alive

You're not alone
Never alone
It's pouring tonight
But it won't rain forever
I've been there before
Fought through the storm
I'm here, you'll never be alone
I'm here, you'll never be alone

Losing strenth to fight the waves
Starting to asphyxiate
Fingertips outstretched hoping to get a grip
Of something on something safe

Can't take the pressure
Gasping for a breath
And now you're slipping into shock
Don't close your eyes
(We'll make it out alive)
We'll make it out alive

You're not alone
Never alone
It's pouring tonight
But it won't rain forever
I've been there before
Fought through the storm
I'm here, you'll never be alone
I'm here, you'll never be alone

I'll be your shelter from the storm
Give it one more day
Things are gonna change
It's not the end of the world
(It's not the end of the world)
It's not the end of the world

Can't take all the pressure
Gasping for a breath
Your thrashing arms begin to tire
(Open your eyes)
Can't take all the pressure
Gasping for a breath
And now you're slipping
And I'm grabbing a hold
I won't let go
(Open your eyes)
Taking control

You're not alone
Never alone
It's pouring tonight
But it won't rain forever
I've been there before
Fought through the storm
I'm here, you'll never be alone
You'll never, you'll never,
I'm here, you'll never be alone
You'll never, you'll never
I'm here, you'll never be alone
