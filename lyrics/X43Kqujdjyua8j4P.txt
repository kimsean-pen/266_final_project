I could swear I was there
With my drink on the floor
Waiting out what I said to you
Maybe I said it, I sure didn't mean it
I couldn't forget the comfort of being next to you
Maybe I dreamt it, I don't think I heard it
But what you said, I've got it stuck in my head

Had to clean up the mess
And nurse the cuts on my head
It's no fun getting gone without you
There was a time, that I would have cried
But... that part of me has up and died

That part of me has up and died.
