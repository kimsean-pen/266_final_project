Running in circles
So it seems
Running in circles
Never ends
Tragically, you are stuck, stuck in time
Unlike me, gliding free, so linear

Just like a dog
Dirt on your paws
Just like a dog
You dig your own grave

Run

Show your teeth
Now play dead
Show your teeth
Now play dead
Show your teeth
Now play dead
Show your teeth
Now play dead

All bark no bite you dumb little bitch
